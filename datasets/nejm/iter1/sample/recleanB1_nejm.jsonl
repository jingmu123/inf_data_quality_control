Today this remains the only medical indication for its use approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1988 a highly publicized study reported that topical tretinoin improves the appearance of “photoaged” skin 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Since then, the manufacturer of topical tretinoin has conducted an active, controversial multimedia effort to ensure that the general public and the medical profession are aware of the “unlabeled” use of tretinoin to treat benign cutaneous changes, such as wrinkles and brown spots, that may be annoying to patients because of their association with the appearance of aging. The commissioner of the FDA, members of Congress, and others have cited these efforts as an example of inappropriate promotion of a drug for an unlabeled use 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-5 </a></sup></u> . The greatly increased attention to topical tretinoin in the medical and lay press and the substantial increase in the number of prescriptions written for this agent since 1988 suggest that the company's actions in promoting the unlabeled use were successful and highly profitable.\n\n【3】Methods\n-------\n\n【4】The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is a national probability-sample survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> . Participating physicians complete a record of each outpatient visit that includes the patient's diagnosis and demographic characteristics, the services rendered, and the characteristics of the provider. I analyzed the data tapes available to the public to determine the number of office visits involving prescriptions for topical tretinoin dispensed by nonfederally employed office-based physicians in the United States in 1980, 1981, 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1991, the six years of the survey that include prescription data. In these six years, a total of 276,689 outpatient visits were sampled.\n\n【5】Using these data, I determined the number of visits during which a prescription for topical tretinoin was given, overall and for subgroups of patients with various characteristics. I calculated standard errors and statistical significance by t-test using published formulas 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; the coefficients were provided by Iris Shimuzu of the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n【6】To find the relative number of medical articles each year principally concerning topical tretinoin and the skin, I carried out a MEDLINE search of English-language journals using the PaperChase computer program 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Company-sponsored supplements were excluded. Using The New York Times Index and the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature, I determined the number of indexed articles in the popular press concerning topical tretinoin and the skin 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】Figure 1.  Figure 1. The Number of Articles Principally Concerning Topical Tretinoin and the Skin in Medical Publications and the Popular Press and the Number of Office Visits to Physicians Involving Prescriptions for Topical Tretinoin.\n\n【9】The medical citations were found in a MEDLINE 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> search, and articles in the popular press were found in The New York Times Index 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> and the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Office visits include those to nonfederally employed physicians in office-based practices. Data on prescriptions were available only for 1980, 1981, 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1991.\n\n【10】Publicity about topical tretinoin has not always been positive. In 1978 an FDA bulletin warned about a possible risk of cancer associated with the drug 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> . Beginning in 1980, a number of publications, including one from a company-sponsored workshop, provided reassuring data about the risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> . Reports of the FDA warning accounted for most coverage in the popular press before 1986 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Most other medical articles about topical tretinoin before 1986 concerned its use for acne or rare dermatologic diseases. In 1988, when the highly publicized medical study suggested that topical tretinoin improved wrinkles related to photoaging of the skin, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 28 articles on topical tretinoin in the popular press were indexed. Nearly all discussed the treatment of photoaging. Citations in the popular press declined after the 1988 peak 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. After 1987 there were 41 times as many articles about topical tretinoin and the skin in the popular press as there had been in the preceding decade, and 3 times as many in medical publications (P<0.05 for both comparisons).\n\n【11】The number of visits during which a prescription for topical tretinoin was given was significantly higher in 1981 than in 1980 (1,850,000 vs. 810,000, P<0.05). The average for 1980 and 1981 was nearly identical, however, to the number in 1985 (1,330,000 vs. 1,220,000, P>0.2) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The number in 1989 (2,720,000) was 123 percent higher than the number in 1985 (P<0.01). From 1989 to 1991 prescribing rates were relatively constant 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. After 1988 the greatest increase in prescriptions for topical tretinoin was for patients over 30 years of age (284 percent increase over earlier years), patients who were not seeing a dermatologist (895 percent increase), and patients who did not have acne (400 percent increase) (P<0.001 for all comparisons). In contrast, the number of prescriptions per year for patients under 30 who had acne and were visiting a dermatologist increased by only 22 percent (P>0.1).\n\n【12】Discussion\n----------\n\n【13】For over 20 years, topical tretinoin has been on the market for the treatment of acne, its only approved medical indication. In 1988 the number of medical and popular articles about topical tretinoin increased dramatically, to extraordinary levels in the popular press. Most of these articles concerned the treatment of photoaging, a medical use of topical tretinoin that has never been approved by the FDA. The 1988 Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature listed 23 articles on topical tretinoin and the skin (with 20 on photoaging), as compared with 28 on treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 15 on AIDS vaccines 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . In my experience and that of my colleagues, topical tretinoin became by far the therapy most often requested by patients after the highly publicized 1988 study on its use for photoaging 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . After 1988 the prescription rates for topical tretinoin more than doubled as compared with the average for earlier years. The rate of prescribing increased most for visits by women over 30, visits to nondermatologists, and visits that were not for acne.\n\n【14】Not all articles in the medical literature or all publicity helps drug sales. In 1978 the FDA and the popular press warned about the potential carcinogenic effects of topical tretinoin 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> . The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey first collected data on prescriptions in 1980. Unfortunately, I thus cannot assess any changes in prescribing rates that occurred immediately after this negative publicity. The substantial increase in prescribing rates in 1981 as compared with 1980 did, however, follow the publication of a number of articles, some company-sponsored, that provided reassuring information on this issue 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【15】Although since 1972 acne has been the only FDA-approved indication for topical tretinoin, the content of advertisements in dermatology journals has changed dramatically. For example, in 1985 a two-page advertisement for Retin-A in a medical journal included photographs of patients with acne and the results of clinical trials 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> . In 1989 an advertisement of the same size in the same journal provided no clinical-trial results or information about acne, but showed a stylized, wrinkle- and blemish-free face with porcelain-like skin 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> . Whether topical tretinoin has a clinically important effect on sun-induced skin damage or is cost effective for this purpose is not established. The data I report do demonstrate that medical articles and reports on them in the popular press were associated with a large increase in prescribing, especially for an unlabeled indication.\n\n【16】I was not able to quantify precisely the profits attributable to articles and promotional efforts suggesting that topical tretinoin helps reduce the effects of photoaging or quantify the losses attributable to articles raising questions about its safety. However, the number of prescriptions for topical tretinoin increased dramatically after 1988, and from 1987 to 1990 the average wholesale price increased by approximately 25 percent a year 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,17 </a></sup></u> . At least for the manufacturer, reports of company-sponsored studies, promotional efforts (press conferences, symposiums, and advertising), and the tremendous publicity about this drug in the popular media, particularly its use for an unlabeled indication, have certainly paid, and paid well.\n\n【17】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【18】From the Department of Dermatology, Beth Israel Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston.\n\n【19】Address reprint requests to Dr. Stern at Beth Israel Hospital, 330 Brookline Ave., Boston, MA 02215.\n\n【20】参考删除-1:<u>References _(17)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

We examined the possibility that this problem might be alleviated by desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), which increases the plasma level of von Willebrand factor and improves hemostasis in mild hemophilia and other conditions associated with defective platelet function.\n\n【2】In a double-blind, prospective, randomized trial, we studied the effect of intraoperative desmopressin acetate in 70 patients undergoing various cardiac operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients undergoing uncomplicated primary coronary-artery bypass grafting were not included. The drug significantly reduced mean operative and early postoperative blood loss (1317±486 ml in the treated group vs. 2210±1415 ml in the placebo group); of the 14 patients whose 24-hour blood loss exceeded 2000 ml, 11 had received the placebo. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor were higher after desmopressin acetate than after placebo. Patients with the most bleeding had relatively low levels of von Willebrand factor before operation, suggesting a role for this factor in the hemorrhagic tendency induced by extracorporeal circulation. There were no untoward side effects of desmopressin acetate.\n\n【3】We conclude that the administration of desmopressin acetate can be recommended to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing complex cardiac operations. The beneficial effect of the drug on hemostasis after cardiopulmonary bypass may be related to its effect on von Willebrand factor. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1986; 314:1402–6.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 10:28:12", "endTime": "2024/08/12 10:29:27", "cost": 74.803}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-11 18:29:28", "grab_time": "2024-08-11 18:28:13"}

To determine whether hydroxyurea, a cytotoxic/cytostatic drug that does not influence DNA methylation, might stimulate fetal-hemoglobin synthesis, we phlebotomized two juvenile cynomolgus monkeys to induce anemia and reticulocytosis and then treated them with hydroxyurea. Immediately after phlebotomy was initiated, there was a rise in the level of F cells, which stabilized at an average value of 13 per cent in one animal and 20 per cent in the other during a two-month control period. Fetal hemoglobin gradually rose from undetectable values before bleeding to 3 per cent in one animal and 5 per cent in the other. Sixty-two days after initiation of phlebotomy, hydroxyurea (50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for five days) induced only a small and transient increase in F cells and fetal hemoglobin. Two weeks later, however, a similar course (100 mg per kilogram per day) resulted in a prompt and dramatic increase in both indexes. These results strongly suggest that S-phase–specific cytotoxic/cytostatic drugs increase fetal hemoglobin by a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of DNA methylation. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1984; 310: 869–73.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/13 10:20:39", "endTime": "2024/08/13 10:20:58", "cost": 18.642}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-12 18:20:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 18:20:39"}

A woman with polycystic disease received a renal transplant in May 1998. The graft functioned well. In November 1999, routine mammography showed a nodule in the left breast, and a biopsy specimen was obtained. Primary breast cancer was diagnosed. Pain and swelling then developed over the renal transplant, and two subcutaneous nodules were found. Biopsy confirmed the presence of secondary melanoma. No primary melanoma was identified. The pathological features of the breast specimen were reviewed, immunocytochemistry was performed, and secondary melanoma was diagnosed. Immunosuppression was stopped, the nodules were excised, and the patient underwent a trial of interferon, which was stopped because of toxicity. She died of metastatic melanoma in March 2000. In May 2000, a man presented with a palpable lump over a kidney, also donated in May 1998. The function of the graft had been good. Renal biopsy showed secondary melanoma, and again no primary tumor was identified.\n\n【3】The transplant registry showed that both of these patients had received a kidney from the same donor, who had died from a presumed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy had not been performed. The patient was found to have been registered with the Scottish Melanoma Group after the removal of a 2.6-mm-thick primary melanoma in 1982. On wider excision, no residual tumor was found, and she had been followed up in the melanoma clinic until 1997, when she was discharged, apparently tumor free, after 15 years.\n\n【4】Figure 1.

A woman with polycystic disease received a renal transplant in May 1998. The graft functioned well. In November 1999, routine mammography showed a nodule in the left breast, and a biopsy specimen was obtained. Primary breast cancer was diagnosed. Pain and swelling then developed over the renal transplant, and two subcutaneous nodules were found. Biopsy confirmed the presence of secondary melanoma. No primary melanoma was identified. The pathological features of the breast specimen were reviewed, immunocytochemistry was performed, and secondary melanoma was diagnosed. Immunosuppression was stopped, the nodules were excised, and the patient underwent a trial of interferon, which was stopped because of toxicity. She died of metastatic melanoma in March 2000. In May 2000, a man presented with a palpable lump over a kidney, also donated in May 1998. The function of the graft had been good. Renal biopsy showed secondary melanoma, and again no primary tumor was identified.\n\n【3】The transplant registry showed that both of these patients had received a kidney from the same donor, who had died from a presumed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy had not been performed. The patient was found to have been registered with the Scottish Melanoma Group after the removal of a 2.6-mm-thick primary melanoma in 1982. On wider excision, no residual tumor was found, and she had been followed up in the melanoma clinic until 1997, when she was discharged, apparently tumor free, after 15 years.\n\n<mark>【4】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Affected Kidney from Patient 2.</mark>\n\n【5】The excised kidney is necrotic and contains a large, central mass of melanoma tissue<mark> (Panel A)</mark>. An S-100–stained specimen of the kidney shows striking cytologic atypia and strong S-100 positivity (Panel B).\n\n【6】In the second recipient, immunosuppression was stopped. Scans showed no evidence that the melanoma had spread beyond the transplanted kidney, so he was given 10 million units of interferon subcutaneously three times weekly to stimulate rejection of both the kidney and the transplanted melanoma. After 13 weeks, biochemical evidence of rejection developed, and the kidney was removed. Large masses of necrotic melanoma cells were present 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>, some in the renal vasculature. The patient underwent dialysis and continued interferon therapy for another nine weeks, when neuropsychiatric symptoms developed.

We evaluated whether the early introduction of allergenic foods in the diet of breast-fed infants would protect against the development of food allergy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We recruited, from the general population, 1303 exclusively breast-fed infants who were 3 months of age and randomly assigned them to the early introduction of six allergenic foods (peanut, cooked egg, cow’s milk, sesame, whitefish, and wheat; early-introduction group) or to the current practice recommended in the United Kingdom of exclusive breast-feeding to approximately 6 months of age (standard-introduction group). The primary outcome was food allergy to one or more of the six foods between 1 year and 3 years of age.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the intention-to-treat analysis, food allergy to one or more of the six intervention foods developed in 7.1% of the participants in the standard-introduction group (42 of 595 participants) and in 5.6% of those in the early-introduction group (32 of 567) (P=0.32). In the per-protocol analysis, the prevalence of any food allergy was significantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (2.4% vs. 7.3%, P=0.01), as was the prevalence of peanut allergy (0% vs. 2.5%, P=0.003) and egg allergy (1.4% vs. 5.5%, P=0.009); there were no significant effects with respect to milk, sesame, fish, or wheat. The consumption of 2 g per week of peanut or egg-white protein was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of these respective allergies than was less consumption. The early introduction of all six foods was not easily achieved but was safe.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The trial did not show the efficacy of early introduction of allergenic foods in an intention-to-treat analysis. Further analysis raised the question of whether the prevention of food allergy by means of early introduction of multiple allergenic foods was dose-dependent. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the Food Standards Agency and others; EAT Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN14254740 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 QUICK TAKE  \nThe EAT Study  \n_01:51_\n\n【12】The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breast-feeding of infants for their first 6 months of life. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Two national guidelines that had previously recommended the delayed introduction of allergenic foods have been withdrawn 删除7:<u>(see the Introduction section in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. In the 2010 United Kingdom Infant Feeding Survey, 45% of the mothers of infants 8 to 10 months of age reported avoiding giving their infant a particular food: 48% avoided nuts, 14% eggs, 10% dairy, and 6% fish. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Fear of allergy was the most common reason for avoiding foods, followed by a belief that the baby was too young.\n\n【13】Observational studies suggest that the early introduction of peanut, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> egg, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> or cow’s milk 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> may prevent the development of allergy to these foods. The randomized, controlled Learning Early about Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial showed that the early consumption of peanut in high-risk infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both reduced the development of peanut allergy by 80% by 5 years of age. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The Persistence of Oral Tolerance to Peanut (LEAP-On) study has now shown that the absence of reactivity is maintained in these infants. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> However, the LEAP trial did not investigate the efficacy of introduction of other allergenic foods, nor did it examine whether this approach could prevent peanut allergy in children in the general population. The Enquiring about Tolerance (EAT) trial was therefore conceived to determine whether the early introduction of common dietary allergens (peanut, cooked hen’s egg, cow’s milk, sesame, whitefish, and wheat) from 3 months of age in exclusively breast-fed infants in the general population would prevent food allergies, as compared with infants who were exclusively breast-fed for approximately 6 months.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【16】This randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom. Ethics approval was provided by the St. Thomas’ Hospital research ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians, and safety data were reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee. The trial protocol is available at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【18】Enrollment took place from November 2, 2009, to July 30, 2012. Details of the trial procedures have been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Singleton infants who were 3 months of age and exclusively breast-fed were recruited from the general population in England and Wales. Participants were randomly assigned by an independent online service to the standard-introduction group or the early-introduction group 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Participants in the standard-introduction group were to be exclusively breast-fed to approximately 6 months of age. After 6 months of age, the consumption of allergenic foods was allowed according to parental discretion. After skin-prick testing in duplicate at baseline, participants in the early-introduction group had six allergenic foods introduced: cow’s milk (yogurt) first, followed (in random order) by peanut, cooked (boiled) hen’s egg, sesame, and whitefish; wheat was introduced last. The infants in the standard-introduction group did not undergo skin-prick testing at baseline because the results could have influenced the timing of the introduction of allergenic foods.\n\n【19】Infants in the early-introduction group who had a wheal of any size on skin-prick testing at baseline underwent an open-label incremental food challenge totaling 2 g of protein of that food. Families of infants in the early-introduction group who had negative results on skin-prick testing or who had positive results on skin-prick testing but negative results on the food challenge were asked to continue feeding their infants 2 g of the allergen protein twice weekly. Families of infants who had a positive result on the food challenge at baseline were instructed to avoid giving the infants that food but to continue feeding the infants the other foods.\n\n【20】All the families completed an online questionnaire each month to 1 year of age, and then every 3 months until the child reached 3 years of age. This questionnaire recorded the frequency of consumption of allergenic foods in the two groups. In addition, the parents of the participants in the early-introduction group kept a weekly diary to record the quantity of the six foods consumed. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Peanut-protein levels were measured in dust collected from the participant’s bed at 3 months of age (before the consumption of allergenic foods commenced in the early-introduction group) and at 12 months of age as an independent measure of adherence to the dietary intervention. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> Participants had scheduled assessments at 1 year of age and 3 years of age and had unscheduled clinic visits for the investigation of parent-reported symptoms that were suggestive of food allergy. Additional details are provided in the Methods section and Tables S1, S2, and S3 and Figs. S2, S3, and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【22】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【23】The primary outcome was challenge-proven food allergy to one or more of the six early-introduction foods between 1 year and 3 years of age. In two exceptional circumstances, reactions to foods that occurred before 1 year of age were also included in the primary outcome. Categories of evidence for food allergy are presented in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix . Secondary outcomes were allergy to individual foods and positive results on skin-prick testing for individual foods.\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】The statistical analysis followed a prespecified analysis plan. Post hoc analyses included a dominance analysis of factors contributing to having a positive result with respect to the primary outcome and to not adhering to the protocol in the two study groups. Dominance analysis discerns the relative importance of independent variables in an estimation model on the basis of the contribution of each variable to the fit statistics of the overall model (all post hoc analyses are listed in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【26】The intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome included all the participants who had data that could be evaluated. The analysis, which compared the proportion of participants in the two groups who had food allergy to one or more of the early-introduction foods, was performed with a chi-square test. For secondary analyses, comparisons were made with the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. The trial had 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a halving of the prevalence of food allergy, from 8% in the standard-introduction group to 4% in the early-introduction group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【27】The per-protocol population included all participants who adhered adequately to the assigned regimen, which was defined as follows. In each group, breast-feeding was continued to at least 5 months of age. In the standard-introduction group, there was no consumption of peanut, egg, sesame, fish, or wheat before 5 months of age and consumption of less than 300 ml per day of formula milk between 3 and 6 months of age. In the early-introduction group, there was consumption of at least five of the early-introduction foods, for at least 5 weeks between 3 and 6 months of age, of at least 75% of the recommended dose (i.e., 3 g per week of allergenic protein). The per-protocol population for food-specific allergy used the same consumption criterion — consumption for at least 5 weeks between 3 and 6 months of age of at least 75% of the recommended dose of that food (i.e., 3 g per week of allergenic protein). The data set will be made publicly available by August 2017.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Participant Population\n----------------------\n\n【30】The median age of the participants at enrollment was 3.4 months. The two groups were balanced, except for a significantly higher rate of birth by cesarean section in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. A total of 91.3% of the participants attended the final clinic visit, 90.0% of whom attended within the visit window (by 4 years of age). A total of 94.0% of the participants’ families completed the 3-year questionnaire.\n\n【31】Food Allergy\n------------\n\n【32】A food allergy developed in 74 participants. In 70 of these participants (39 in the standard-introduction group and 31 in the early-introduction group), diagnoses were made on the basis of double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (primary-outcome categories 1A and 1B), and in 4 (3 in the standard-introduction group and 1 in early-introduction group), diagnoses were made on the basis of an allergic reaction that resulted in a wheal size of 5 mm or more in diameter on skin-prick testing (primary-outcome category 3). A diagnosis of any food allergy was significantly associated with the presence of eczema at enrollment, nonwhite race, and having siblings. In the post hoc dominance analysis, these three factors accounted for 92.6% of the variation in the fit statistic of the overall logistic model 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【33】Food Consumption and Allergy in the Intention-to-Treat Analyses\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Primary Outcome of Allergy to One or More Foods and Secondary Outcomes of Allergy to Peanut and to Egg.\n\n【35】The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy is shown with respect to one or more of the six early-intervention foods (peanut, cooked egg, cow’s milk, sesame, whitefish, and wheat; Panel A), to peanut (Panel B), and to egg (Panel C). The results regarding IgE-mediated food allergy to the other early-introduction foods are shown in Figure S5 in the Supplementary Appendix . The first column shows the intention-to-treat analysis, the second column the per-protocol analysis, and the third column an adjusted per-protocol analysis. The intention-to-treat analysis included all the participants who had data that could be evaluated; the per-protocol population included all participants who adhered adequately to the assigned regimen. The adjusted per-protocol analysis was a conservative per-protocol analysis that adjusted the prevalence of food allergy in the standard-introduction group by subtracting the number of participants in the early-introduction group who had a positive result on the challenge at enrollment and who completed the trial with a confirmed food allergy from both the numerator (the number of participants with allergy in the standard-introduction group) and the denominator (the number of participants in the standard-introduction group who adhered to the protocol ). P values are based on chi-square analyses or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. The relative risks with 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table S6 (intention-to-treat analysis) and Table S10A (per-protocol analysis) in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【36】For the primary outcome, 595 of 651 enrolled participants (91.4%) in the standard-introduction group and 567 of 652 (87.0%) in the early-introduction group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The rate of the primary outcome was nonsignificantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (5.6% \\[32 of 567 participants\\] and 7.1% \\[42 of 595\\], respectively), which represented a relative risk of 0.80 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.51 to 1.25; P=0.32), with the point estimate representing a 20% lower prevalence in the early-introduction group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of allergy to more than one food was nonsignificantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (P=0.17) 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【37】Peanut allergy occurred in 1.2% of the participants in the early-introduction group and in 2.5% of those in the standard-introduction group, representing a nonsignificant 51% lower relative risk in the early-introduction group (P=0.11). Egg allergy occurred in 3.7% of the participants in the early-introduction group and in 5.4% of those in the standard-introduction group, representing a nonsignificant 31% lower relative risk in the early-introduction group (P=0.17) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【38】For other early-introduction foods, the prevalence of food allergy was 0.7% or less in each group 删除2:<u>(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Non–IgE-mediated allergy-type symptoms are discussed in Tables S8 and S9 and the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【39】Food Consumption and Allergy in the Per-Protocol Analysis\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】In the per-protocol analysis, the rate of the primary outcome was significantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (2.4% \\[5 of 208 participants\\] vs. 7.3% \\[38 of 524\\]). The relative risk in the early-introduction group was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.83; P=0.01), representing a prevalence that was 67% lower than that in the standard-introduction group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【41】With regard to food-specific per-protocol consumption, the protective effects with respect to egg and peanut were larger in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group. In the per-protocol analysis of peanut consumption, there were no cases of peanut allergy among the 310 participants in the early-introduction group, as compared with 13 cases among 525 participants (2.5%) in the standard-introduction group (P=0.003) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The prevalence of egg allergy among participants who adhered to the protocol with respect to egg consumption was 1.4% in the early-introduction group versus 5.5% in the standard-introduction group, representing a 75% lower relative risk (P=0.009) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The rates of food allergy in the per-protocol analysis were lower, but not significantly so, in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group for milk (P=0.63) and sesame (P=0.56). There were no cases of wheat allergy in either group in the per-protocol analysis. The rate of fish allergy was nonsignificantly higher in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (P=1.00) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【42】Although adjustment for multiple testing was not part of the statistical analysis plan, if these six component food tests were adjusted for multiple testing with the use of a Bonferroni correction, the critical value for statistical significance would be 0.0085 (i.e., 1−0.95 <sup>1/6 </sup> ). Under this constraint, in the per-protocol analysis the effect on peanut allergy would remain significant, and the results for egg would remain borderline significant (see the Discussion section in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【43】Protective effects with respect to the primary outcome and with respect to peanut allergy and egg allergy remained significant in the conservative adjusted per-protocol analysis. This analysis was not adjusted for multiple comparisons 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 , and the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【44】Participants in the two trial groups who did not adhere to the protocol or whose adherence could not be evaluated had rates of allergy that were similar to the rate among the participants in the standard-introduction group who adhered to the protocol . Statistical comparisons between the participants in the standard-introduction group who adhered to the protocol and the participants in the early-introduction group who did not adhere to the protocol or whose adherence could not be evaluated were all nonsignificant 删除2:<u>(Table S10B in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【45】Results of Skin-Prick Testing\n-----------------------------\n\n【46】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Secondary Outcome of Results on Skin-Prick Testing.\n\n【47】The prevalence of a positive skin-prick test (wheal of any size) is shown for one or more of the six early-intervention foods (Panel A), peanut (Panel B), egg (Panel C), and raw egg white (Panel D; this test was performed only at the 36-month visit). Results of skin-prick testing for the other early-introduction foods are shown in Figure S6 in the Supplementary Appendix . The first column shows the intention-to-treat analysis, and the second column the per-protocol analysis. P values are based on chi-square analyses. The group-specific denominators and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals are shown in Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【48】A similar pattern was seen for the results of skin-prick testing 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. In the intention-to-treat analyses, the risk of a positive skin-prick test to any food was 22% lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group at 12 months of age (P=0.07) and 12% lower at 36 months of age (P=0.47); both differences were nonsignificant. Positive skin-prick tests to wheat occurred significantly less frequently in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group at 12 months (1.3% vs. 3.2%, P=0.03) and at 36 months of age (1.4% vs. 3.2%, P=0.04). The prevalence of positive skin-prick tests at 12 months and 36 months of age was nonsignificantly lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group for every other food, with the exception of fish at 12 months of age, which had a higher prevalence in the early-introduction group 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 , and Fig. S6 and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【49】In the per-protocol analyses, the early-introduction group had a significant 42% lower rate of positive skin-prick tests to any food than the standard-introduction group at 12 months of age (P=0.01) and a significant 67% lower rate at 36 months of age (P=0.002). On food-specific testing, the relative risk of a positive result on skin-prick testing at 12 months of age was consistently lower, by approximately 50%, in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group for every food with the exception of fish; the difference was significant with respect to egg (P=0.009) and peanut (P=0.04). At 36 months of age, the effect was greater; the relative risk of a positive result on skin-prick testing was 67% lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group with respect to peanut (P=0.007), 48% lower with respect to egg (P=0.10), 88% lower with respect to milk (P=0.02), 100% lower with respect to both sesame (P=0.04) and fish (P=0.17), and 69% lower with respect to wheat (P=0.12). The rate of a positive skin-prick test to raw egg white was also lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group at 36 months of age; the 49% lower relative risk (P=0.07) was similar to that observed with commercial egg extract 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 , and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Adherence to the Protocol\n-------------------------\n\n【51】A total of 92.9% of the participants in the standard-introduction group whose primary-outcome status could be determined (524 of 564 participants) adhered to the protocol 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In the dominance analysis, shorter duration of maternal education and maternal smoking accounted for the majority of the variation in the fit statistic of the overall model 删除2:<u>(Tables S12 and S13 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. A total of 85.6% of the participants in the standard-introduction group consumed no cow’s milk formula before 6 months of age.\n\n【52】A total of 42.8% of the participants in the early-introduction group whose primary-outcome status could be determined (208 of 486 participants) adhered to the protocol (representing 31.9% of the total number of participants enrolled in the early-introduction group) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Four factors accounted for 78% of the nonadherence in the dominance analysis: nonwhite race (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.14), parentally perceived symptoms in the child related to any of the early-introduction foods (odds ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.86), reduced maternal quality of life (psychological domain) (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.00), and the presence of eczema in the child at enrollment (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.87 to 2.19) 删除2:<u>(Tables S12 and S14 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【53】The rate of adherence to the protocol with respect to individual foods in the early-introduction group varied. The rates were as follows: 43.1% for egg (215 of 499 participants), 50.7% for sesame (266 of 505), 60.0% for fish (297 of 495), 61.9% for peanut (310 of 501), and 85.2% for milk (415 of 487).\n\n【54】The levels of peanut protein in bed dust were similar at baseline in the early-introduction group and the standard-introduction group (median, 7.6 μg of peanut protein per gram of dust and 9.7 μg per gram, respectively). However, by 1 year of age, the levels were significantly higher in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (387.9 μg of peanut protein per gram of dust vs. 77.0 μg per gram, P<0.001). At 1 year of age, participants in the early-introduction group who adhered to the protocol had higher levels of peanut protein in bed dust than did those in the same trial group who did not adhere to the protocol (P=0.04) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Further details on adherence to the protocol are provided in the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【55】Dose–Response Analysis\n----------------------\n\n【56】Variations in the number of foods consumed, the weekly dose of each food consumed, and the number of weeks during which this dose was consumed resulted in a rate of adherence in the early-introduction group that ranged from 6% to 81%. The prevalence of food allergy overall and the prevalence of allergy to specific foods were reduced in concert with increases in any of these variables. At a consumption level of 2 g or more per week of allergenic protein for 4 or more weeks, peanut was consumed by 85.3% of the participants in the early-introduction group for whom adherence with peanut consumption could be determined (419 of 491 participants) and egg by 75.5% (370 of 490). The corresponding rates of allergy were 0.2% for peanut and 1.9% for egg. Details are provided in Tables S15A, S15B, and S16 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【57】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Dose–Response Analysis of the Relationship between Mean Weekly Dose of Peanut or Egg Protein Consumed and Allergy or Positive Result on Skin-Prick Testing to Peanut, Egg, and Raw Egg White.\n\n【58】Shown are the predictive probability plots that were generated from statistical models of the prevalence of peanut allergy and egg allergy (Panel A) and of a positive result on skin-prick testing to peanut and egg at 12 months (Panel B) and to peanut, egg, and raw egg white at 36 months (Panel C), according to the mean weekly consumption of peanut and egg protein between enrollment and 6 months of age. The prevalence of both food allergy and positive skin-prick test diminishes with increasing levels of mean weekly consumption. Insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis. Plots of the raw data and the probability plots are shown in Figure S8 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【59】The mean weekly consumption of egg and peanut protein between enrollment and 6 months of age was calculated and divided into quartiles. The prevalence of allergy to peanut and egg and the prevalence of positive responses on skin-prick testing to peanut, egg, and raw egg white diminished with increasing quartile levels of consumption 删除2:<u>(Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The mean weekly consumption data were used to generate predictive probability plots that were based on logistic modeling; analysis showed that higher consumption was associated with a lower prevalence of allergy and sensitization to that food 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. The mean weekly consumption of 2 g of peanut protein and 4 g of egg protein (equivalent to 2 g of egg-white protein) was associated with the prevention of these two respective food allergies. The consumption of cooked egg was equally effective in inhibiting reactivity to raw egg-white protein and egg extract on skin-prick testing at 3 years of age.\n\n【60】Safety\n------\n\n【61】No deaths occurred in the trial. There were three life-threatening events, all of which occurred in the standard-introduction group; none were related to allergic disease (heart-valve damage, prolonged febrile convulsion, and extensive burns). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of hospitalization. There were no cases of anaphylaxis with the introduction of foods at home in the early-introduction group. The use of the epinephrine autoinjector is discussed in the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【62】The rate of visits to the emergency department was similar in the two groups. The early-introduction regimen did not affect the growth of the participants or the duration of breast-feeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Details on safety outcomes are provided in Tables S17 through S28 and Figures S9 through S19 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【63】Results According to Skin-Prick Testing and Allergy Status at Baseline\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【64】At enrollment, 33 of the 652 participants in the early-introduction group (5.1%) had a positive skin-prick test to an early-introduction food. All 33 participants were invited to undergo food challenges to the relevant foods: 7 participants had positive results (to one or more foods), 22 had negative results (to one or more foods), and 4 did not return for the challenges. Of the 7 participants who had a positive result on a challenge at baseline, 5 subsequently had a positive result with respect to the primary outcome, 1 had a negative result, and 1 withdrew from the trial. Of the 22 participants who had negative results on the challenge at baseline, 1 subsequently had a positive result with respect to the primary outcome, 3 could not be evaluated, and 18 had a negative result. Details are provided in Table S29A in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【65】All the reactions in the seven participants who had positive results on challenges at baseline were mild 删除2:<u>(Table S30 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were 10 positive challenges among these seven participants; 6 reactions required no treatment, and 4 were treated with antihistamines. There were no cases of anaphylaxis during the challenges, and no intramuscular epinephrine was administered.\n\n【66】Discussion\n----------\n\n【67】This trial did not show efficacy of early introduction of allergenic foods versus standard introduction in an intention-to-treat analysis; there was a nonsignificant 20% lower relative risk of food allergy in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group. In the per-protocol analysis, there was a significant 67% lower relative risk of food allergy overall in the early-introduction group. Unexpectedly, in the per-protocol analysis, significantly lower relative risks of peanut allergy and egg allergy were observed in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group (P=0.003 and P=0.009, respectively). The rates of other food allergies were too low to show any effects. Nevertheless, at 36 months of age, the average relative risk of a positive skin-prick test to the six individual foods was 79% lower in the early-introduction group than in the standard-introduction group; findings were significant for peanut (P=0.007), milk (P=0.02), and sesame (P=0.04). The efficacy of the intervention was related to the duration of consumption of the specific food and the quantity of food consumed between 3 months and 6 months of age.\n\n【68】We found that the early introduction of allergenic foods was safe, with no cases of anaphylaxis during the initial introduction regimen and no adverse effects on breast-feeding or growth. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Partial adherence among participants in the early-introduction group was not associated with any increase in the prevalence of allergy. Seven participants in the early-introduction group had positive results on food challenges at baseline, and hence complete adherence to the early-introduction protocol in this trial would not have prevented all cases of food allergy from occurring.\n\n【69】The per-protocol consumption of cooked egg resulted in a lower rate of a positive skin-prick test to raw egg white (by 49%) and to commercial egg extract, which suggests that the possible protective effect is not confined to the form in which the individual food is consumed. The Hen’s Egg Allergy Prevention (HEAP) study, which enrolled patients from the general population, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and the Solids Timing for Allergy Research (STAR) study, which enrolled high-risk patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> introduced raw-egg powder but showed significant side effects. Our data suggest that the introduction of cooked egg is a safe strategy and may be effective for prevention.\n\n【70】The rates of food allergy were higher among nonwhite participants than among whites and higher among participants with eczema at enrollment than among those without eczema — findings that are consistent with those in the literature; however, adherence to the trial protocol was significantly lower among participants in the early-introduction group who were nonwhite and was lower (but not significantly) among those who had eczema than among the rest of the standard-introduction group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> Adherence was also lower in cases in which parents perceived symptoms in their child with the early introduction of the foods and in cases in which mothers had a lower psychological quality of life at enrollment. These results raise the question of whether targeted clinical and dietetic support to these families at the earliest stages of food introduction could possibly augment adherence, and this concept requires further consideration if early introduction is to be considered as a policy to reduce the prevalence of food allergies.\n\n【71】The strengths of our trial included a high retention rate, the fact that nearly all cases of allergy were confirmed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge, the enrollment of an unselected population of exclusively breast-fed infants, and the fact that all the children with a positive skin-prick test were invited to undergo a food challenge. The main weakness of the study was the low rate of per-protocol adherence in the early-introduction group, as discussed below.\n\n【72】There are a number of possible explanations for the finding of efficacy at the per-protocol level as opposed to the intention-to-treat level. The first is that the early introduction of allergenic foods prevented the development of food allergy. This explanation has some plausibility, given the food-specific findings and an apparent dose–response relationship for protection against peanut allergy and egg allergy. Reverse causality would provide a second explanation, reflecting the possibility that infants with nascent food allergy were less likely to successfully consume the foods because of aversive feeding behavior, which is the first sign of clinical food allergy. If this were the case, we would anticipate an excess of food allergy among the participants in the early-introduction group who did not adhere to the protocol, but there was no evidence of this. Furthermore, the 3-month-old infants who were most at risk for nascent food allergy (positive skin-prick test at enrollment but negative result on the food challenge at baseline) did not have lower rates of adherence to the early-introduction protocol than those in this group who had a negative skin-prick test.\n\n【73】A third potential explanation is that of bias leading to a higher prevalence of atopy and food allergy among children outside the per-protocol analysis. This is an important consideration, given that only 31.9% of all the enrolled participants in the early-introduction group (208 of 652 participants) adhered to the protocol and had a primary outcome that could be evaluated, as compared with 80.5% in the standard-introduction group (524 of 651). Differential attrition between the two groups potentially introduces bias. An analysis for evidence of bias in the participants who were not in the group that adhered to the protocol does not provide an explanation for the apparent efficacy in the per-protocol analyses 删除2:<u>(Tables S12 and S31 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【74】Finally, we eliminated the possibility that our findings were the result of an artifact of study design — the selective removal of participants who had food allergy at baseline exclusively from the early-introduction group. When the participants were 3 months of age, we evaluated food allergy only in the early-introduction group. Participants with confirmed food allergy at this point were unable to adhere to the protocol, which thus artificially lowered the rate of food allergy in this group. We therefore undertook an adjusted per-protocol analysis in which we subtracted the same number of participants with food allergy from the standard-introduction group. The results remained significant after the adjustment 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Nevertheless, we cannot be certain whether unmeasured sources of bias still exist.\n\n【75】Modeling determined that 2 g or more of peanut or egg-white protein per week may prevent these respective allergies. This level of consumption matches the median level of consumption observed in Israeli infants 8 to 14 months of age (7.1 g per month), who have a rate of peanut allergy that is 10 times lower than that among Jewish children in the United Kingdom, who consume very little peanut (0.17% vs. 1.85%). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> In the EAT trial, this level of peanut consumption for at least 4 weeks also resulted in a rate of peanut allergy that was 10 times lower than that among the participants in the standard-introduction group (2.5% vs. 0.2%) — a finding that mirrors that of Du Toit et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> The results of our trial are complementary to those of the LEAP trial. Only 9 of the 1303 participants in our trial would have been considered to be at sufficiently high risk to enroll in the LEAP trial. It should be noted that 76% of the participants in the standard-introduction group did not have eczema at 3 months of age, and yet they accounted for 38% of the participants in the standard-introduction group with food allergy to one or more of the foods tested 删除2:<u>(Table S32 in the Supplementary Appendix ; additional information regarding many of the findings discussed in this section is available in the Discussion section of the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【76】This trial failed to show the efficacy of early introduction of allergenic foods as compared with standard introduction of those foods in an intention-to-treat analysis. Further analysis suggests that the possibility of preventing food allergy by means of the early introduction of multiple allergenic foods in normal breast-fed infants may depend on adherence and dose.\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Food Standards Agency and the Medical Research Council, by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, which is based at Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London, and by a National Institute for Health Research comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre award to Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London.

After three months she had lost 7 kg (15 lb) but discontinued the anorectic drugs, reporting fatigue, cough, chest discomfort, and exertional dyspnea. Pulmonary rales were present, a course of antibiotics was given without producing relief, and she was referred for further evaluation. One year earlier a series of common upper respiratory tract infections culminated during her 39th week of pregnancy in an episode of bronchopneumonia and pleurisy, which resolved. Her peripartum course was otherwise uncomplicated, and her medical and family histories were unremarkable.\n\n【4】Figure 1.  Figure 1.

The blood pressure was 104/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate was 18, and the pulse was regular at 108 per minute. The chest was clear except for decreased right basilar sounds. There was no cardiac murmur, gallop, or friction rub, but mild hepatomegaly and peripheral edema were present, with jugular venous distention but no Kussmaul's sign. The results of laboratory tests and electrocardiography were unremarkable, and a chest X-ray film showed a small right pleural effusion. Echocardiography revealed a normal left ventricle and aortic valve, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial enlargement, and inferior vena caval engorgement but no pericardial effusion or thickening. Cardiac catheterization disclosed normal pulmonary-artery pressures (36/19 mm Hg; mean, 25), elevated ventricular end-diastolic pressures (right, 14 mm Hg; left, 24 mm Hg), a dip-and-plateau right-ventricular-pressure wave form, and a mean right atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg, all consistent with the presence of restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300 and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> of body-surface area (stage 2 to 4 CKD) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of at least 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> (stage 1 or 2 CKD). Patients were treated with renin–angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer’s label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. The first secondary outcome was a composite of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the eGFR, or death from renal causes. Safety was assessed as investigator-reported adverse events.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 7437 patients underwent randomization. Among the patients included in the analysis, during a median follow-up of 3.4 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 458 of 3686 patients (12.4%) in the finerenone group and in 519 of 3666 (14.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.76 to 0.98; P=0.03), with the benefit driven primarily by a lower incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.90). The secondary composite outcome occurred in 350 patients (9.5%) in the finerenone group and in 395 (10.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.01). The overall frequency of adverse events did not differ substantially between groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation of the trial regimen was higher with finerenone (1.2%) than with placebo (0.4%).\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】Among patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria, finerenone therapy improved cardiovascular outcomes as compared with placebo. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by Bayer; FIGARO-DKD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02545049 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nFinerenone in Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes  \n_02:16_\n\n【13】Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exacerbates the cardiovascular risk associated with type 2 diabetes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The risks of cardiovascular events and new-onset heart failure increase as the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) exceeds 10 and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreases below 75 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> of body-surface area. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-4 </a></sup></u> Most patients with CKD are at higher risk for cardiovascular events than for kidney failure 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; thus, it is important to identify and treat CKD in order to reduce the high cardiovascular and heart failure burden of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,6</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation is associated with kidney and cardiovascular diseases, which often coexist as cardiorenal disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9 </a></sup></u> Finerenone, a selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improved markers of kidney and cardiovascular damage in preclinical models and in patients with CKD in phase 2 studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-13 </a></sup></u> The planned phase 3 program for finerenone included two complementary trials, which together cover the spectrum of CKD in type 2 diabetes 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> In the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) trial, finerenone improved kidney outcomes in patients with predominantly stage 3 or 4 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria and type 2 diabetes, a population with high kidney risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> In the Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial, reported here, we evaluated whether treatment with finerenone would lead to lower risks of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes among patients with either stage 2 to 4 CKD and moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD and severely increased albuminuria — a patient population at high cardiovascular risk that was excluded from or understudied in the FIDELIO-DKD trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】We conducted a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven clinical trial. Details of the trial design have been published previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> and are included in the trial protocol , available at NEJM.org. The trial was designed and supervised by the executive committee in conjunction with Bayer (the sponsor). An independent data and safety monitoring committee oversaw patient safety and conducted one planned efficacy interim analysis. The trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The sponsor conducted the analyses, and all authors had access to and participated in the interpretation of the analyzed data. The first and second authors prepared the initial draft of the manuscript, which was reviewed and edited by all authors. All the authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data; the sponsor and the investigators vouch for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【18】Patients\n--------\n\n【19】Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years old) with type 2 diabetes and CKD treated with a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker) at the maximum dose on the manufacturer’s label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. For the purposes of the trial, CKD was defined according to one of two sets of criteria. The first set included persistent, moderately elevated albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio \\[with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams\\], 30 to <300) and an eGFR (calculated with the use of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula) of 25 to 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> (i.e., stage 2 to 4 CKD). The second set of criteria included persistent, severely elevated albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 300 to 5000) and an eGFR of at least 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> (i.e., stage 1 or 2 CKD). Patients were required to have a serum potassium level of 4.8 mmol per liter or less at the time of screening.\n\n【20】Patients who were highly represented in the FIDELIO-DKD trial (i.e., those with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> ; 4367 of 5674 patients \\[77.0%\\]) were excluded from the current trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Other key exclusion criteria were symptomatic chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (i.e., a class 1A recommendation for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment). A full list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【21】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【22】The current trial consisted of run-in, screening, and double-blind treatment periods 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. During the run-in period, RAS inhibitor therapy was adjusted upward to a maximum labeled dose that did not cause unacceptable side effects. Patients who met the eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in period were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral finerenone or placebo; patients with an eGFR at the screening visit of 25 to less than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> received an initial dose of 10 mg once daily, and those with an eGFR of at least 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> received an initial dose of 20 mg once daily. From month 1 onward, the target dose of finerenone or placebo was 20 mg once daily; adjustment of the dose from 10 mg up to 20 mg once daily was encouraged, provided that the serum potassium level was no more than 4.8 mmol per liter and that the eGFR was stable; adjustment of the dose down from 20 mg to 10 mg once daily was allowed for any safety reason after the initiation of finerenone or placebo.\n\n【23】After randomization, trial visits were conducted at month 1, month 4, and then every 4 months until trial completion. Finerenone or placebo was withheld if the serum potassium level exceeded 5.5 mmol per liter and was restarted when serum potassium levels decreased to 5.0 mmol per liter or less. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix and the protocol .\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. The first secondary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of the first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the eGFR for a period of at least 4 weeks, or death from renal causes. Kidney failure was defined as end-stage kidney disease or as a sustained eGFR of less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> for a period of at least 4 weeks. End-stage kidney disease was defined as the initiation of chronic dialysis (for ≥90 days) or kidney transplantation.\n\n【26】Other secondary outcomes (in order of sequential hierarchical testing) were hospitalization for any cause, assessed in a time-to-event analysis; death from any cause, assessed in a time-to-event analysis; the change in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to month 4; and a kidney composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, of the first onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 57% in the eGFR for a period of at least 4 weeks (equivalent to a doubling of the serum creatinine level), or death from renal causes. A clinical event committee whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments independently reviewed and adjudicated all reported outcome events (see the Supplementary Appendix and the protocol).\n\n【27】Safety analyses included assessment of adverse events and central laboratory testing. Adverse events that occurred during the treatment period were designated as those that started or worsened during finerenone or placebo intake or up to 3 days after any temporary or permanent interruption.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】This event-driven trial was designed to have 90% power to detect a 20% lower risk of a primary outcome event with finerenone than with placebo, on the basis of 976 patients with an event. Efficacy analyses were performed in the full analysis set (all the patients who had undergone randomization and were without critical Good Clinical Practice violations). In time-to-event analyses, the superiority of finerenone over placebo was tested by means of stratified log-rank tests; stratification factors were geographic region, eGFR category at screening, albuminuria category at screening, and history of cardiovascular disease (see the Supplementary Appendix ). Treatment effects are expressed as hazard ratios with corresponding confidence intervals from stratified Cox proportional-hazards models. Events were counted from randomization to the end-of-trial visit, and patients without an event had their data censored at the date of last contact with complete information on all the components of the respective outcome.\n\n【30】To account for multiplicity of testing, a hierarchical testing procedure was applied. Because of the formal interim analysis, the significance level for the final analysis was adjusted from 5% to 4.9674%. Stratified Fine–Gray models were used to calculate the subdistribution hazard ratios, with accounting for the competing risk of death for reasons that were not part of the respective outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Safety analyses were performed in the safety analysis set, which included all the patients who had undergone randomization, were without critical Good Clinical Practice violations, and had received at least one dose of finerenone or placebo. Additional details on the statistical analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix and the protocol, which includes the statistical analysis plan. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Patients\n--------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Key Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients and Medications at Baseline.\n\n【34】From September 2015 through October 2018, a total of 19,381 patients from 48 countries underwent screening, and 7437 patients underwent randomization 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. A total of 85 patients were prospectively excluded from all the analyses because of critical Good Clinical Practice violations (including violations that led to the closure of one site and other violations related to patient misconduct) (see the Supplementary Appendix ). Among the 7352 patients included in the analyses, the baseline characteristics and medications, including the dose of RAS inhibitor, were balanced between the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , S1, and S2 and Fig. S4)</u>. At baseline, 8.4% of the patients were being treated with a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and 7.5% with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist; an additional 15.8% and 11.3% of patients, respectively, started treatment during the trial. Table S3 lists details of the medications that were initiated after the start of the trial regimen.\n\n【35】At the trial conclusion, at a median follow-up of 3.4 years, vital status was ascertained for 7334 of the 7352 patients (99.8%) included in the primary analysis. The trial was ongoing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, which caused trial disruption for 2096 patients (28.5%; mostly because of missed trial visits) and caused temporary interruption of the trial regimen for 696 patients (9.5%). The incidence of premature discontinuation of the trial regimen (including because of death) was balanced between the two groups (27.4% in the finerenone group and 27.7% in the placebo group). The mean daily dose of finerenone was 17.5 mg, and the mean daily dose of placebo was 18.2 mg. The mean adherence to the trial regimen (the percentage of administered doses relative to the number of planned doses) from randomization until receipt of the last dose was 91.5% in the finerenone group and 92.9% in the placebo group.\n\n【36】Effects on Primary Composite Outcome and Components\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Cardiovascular Outcomes.\n\n【38】Outcomes were assessed in time-to-event analyses. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. Insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.Figure 2.  Figure 2. Efficacy Outcomes.\n\n【39】Shown are the hierarchical prespecified efficacy outcomes of the trial, including the components of the composite outcomes. Outcomes were assessed in time-to-event analyses. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. The first secondary outcome was a composite of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for a period of at least 4 weeks, or death from renal causes. The additional prespecified kidney outcome was a composite of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 57% in the eGFR for a period of at least 4 weeks, or death from renal causes.\n\n【40】The incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (the primary composite outcome) was significantly lower in the finerenone group than in the placebo group (458 of 3686 patients \\[12.4%\\] vs. 519 of 3666 patients \\[14.2%\\]; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.76 to 0.98; P=0.03) 删除2:<u>( Figures 1A and Figure 2 )</u>. The incidences of the primary-outcome components are shown in Figures 1B through 1E and Figure 2 . The incidence of hospitalization for heart failure was lower in the finerenone group than in the placebo group (117 patients \\[3.2%\\] vs. 163 \\[4.4%\\]; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.90) 删除2:<u>( Figures 1E and Figure 2 )</u>. The number of patients who needed to be treated with finerenone to prevent one primary outcome event was 47 (95% CI, 26 to 226), on the basis of an absolute between-group difference of 2.1 percentage points (95% CI, 0.4 to 3.8) after 3.5 years.\n\n【41】The effect of finerenone therapy on the primary outcome was consistent across prespecified subgroups 删除2:<u>(Fig. S5)</u>. An analysis that was adjusted for the competing risk of noncardiovascular death showed consistent results 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>. Similar findings were observed in an “on-treatment” analysis, which included all the events from randomization up to 30 days after the last dose of finerenone or placebo 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>. The number of patients with missing data for the primary composite outcome was low, and a tipping-point analysis supported the robustness of the results 删除2:<u>(Fig. S6 and Table S6)</u>.\n\n【42】Secondary and Exploratory Outcomes\n----------------------------------\n\n【43】There was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of the first secondary composite outcome of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the eGFR, or death from renal causes (350 patients \\[9.5%\\] in the finerenone group and 395 \\[10.8%\\] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.01) 删除2:<u>( Figures 2 and S7A)</u>; analyses of the subsequent outcomes are, therefore, exploratory. An analysis that was adjusted for the competing risk of death from nonrenal causes showed consistent results, as did the “on-treatment” analysis.\n\n【44】The incidences of the components of the first secondary outcome are shown in Figure 2 . End-stage kidney disease occurred in 32 patients (0.9%) in the finerenone group and in 49 (1.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.995). The incidences of hospitalization for any cause and of death from any cause are shown in Figures 2 , S7B, and S7C. The reduction in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to month 4 was 32% greater with finerenone than with placebo (ratio of the least-squares mean change from baseline, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.70), and similar results were seen in an analysis that accounted for death as a competing risk 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. The kidney composite outcome of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 57% in the eGFR, or death from renal causes occurred in 108 patients (2.9%) in the finerenone group and in 139 (3.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.99) 删除2:<u>( Figures 2 and S7D)</u>.\n\n【45】Safety Outcomes and Vital Signs\n-------------------------------\n\n【46】Table 2.  Table 2. Safety Outcomes.\n\n【47】Safety issues during the treatment period were recorded as investigator-reported adverse events. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , S8, and S9)</u>. Overall, 31.4% of the patients treated with finerenone had a serious adverse event, as compared with 33.2% of those who received placebo. The incidence of acute kidney injury was balanced between the groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia was higher with finerenone than with placebo (10.8% vs. 5.3%), but none of these adverse events resulted in death, and few events led to permanent discontinuation of the regimen (in 1.2% and 0.4% of the patients, respectively) or hospitalization (in 0.6% and 0.1%). The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with finerenone than with placebo (1.1% vs. 2.4%), and gynecomastia was rare, with the incidence balanced between the groups (0.1% and 0.1%, respectively).\n\n【48】Adverse events and serious adverse events of pneumonia were less common with finerenone than with placebo (in 3.9% vs. 5.6% of the patients and in 2.0% vs. 3.1%, respectively), as were adverse events related to Covid-19 (in 2.3% vs. 3.2%). The results of additional post hoc analyses of the between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events of interest are provided in Table S10.\n\n【49】Finerenone treatment was associated with a greater increase in the serum potassium level from baseline than that observed with placebo. A between-group difference of 0.16 mmol per liter was seen from month 1 and remained largely stable thereafter 删除2:<u>(Fig. S8)</u>. Finerenone treatment had modest effects on blood pressure; the mean difference between finerenone and placebo in the change from baseline in the systolic blood pressure was –3.5 mm Hg at month 4 and –2.6 mm Hg at month 24 删除2:<u>(Fig. S9)</u>. The mean glycated hemoglobin levels and body weight were similar in the two groups throughout the trial 删除2:<u>(Figs. S10 and S11)</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】The results of the current trial showed that, among patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD (stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria), those assigned to the finerenone group had a lower risk of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure than those assigned to the placebo group. This difference was driven predominantly by a lower incidence of hospitalization for heart failure in the finerenone group.\n\n【52】Although previous trials have examined cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of CKD, there remains scant evidence from dedicated clinical trials to support the use of therapies to improve cardiorenal outcomes in patients with less-advanced CKD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-23 </a></sup></u> This trial addressed that gap by enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes without heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and with either stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria. The present trial extends the findings of the FIDELIO-DKD trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,14 </a></sup></u> Together, these two trials included a spectrum of CKD in type 2 diabetes — patients with stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or with stage 1 to 4 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1)</u>.\n\n【53】In both trials, the observed cardiovascular benefits of finerenone therapy were clinically meaningful and were obtained on a background of guideline-directed therapy, including RAS blockade at a maximum labeled dose that did not cause unacceptable side effects, as well as frequent use of cardiovascular medications (e.g., statins) and well-controlled glycated hemoglobin and blood-pressure levels. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> In the present trial, the cardiovascular benefits of finerenone therapy were consistent across categories according to the baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR. More than 60% of the patients had albuminuric CKD with an eGFR of at least 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> at baseline, which highlights the need for early CKD diagnosis with the use of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio screening and for treatment to improve outcomes in this underrecognized population of patients with a high cardiovascular risk.\n\n【54】During the course of this trial, the recommended care for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes evolved, with contemporary guidelines recommending the use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists to reduce cardiorenal risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25 </a></sup></u> Consistent cardiovascular benefits of finerenone therapy were observed independent of and in combination with the use of either an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1 receptor agonist, with the point estimates suggesting benefits with combination use (as assessed in subgroups defined according to SGLT2 inhibitor use and GLP-1 receptor agonist use at baseline). Preclinical data suggest additive cardiorenal and survival benefits of coadministration of finerenone and empagliflozin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> More data are needed to establish whether combination therapy with finerenone and an SGLT2 inhibitor would result in greater cardiorenal protection than these therapies alone in patients with CKD. Together, these findings suggest a more positive future for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, with three effective drug classes now available. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,22,23</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】In this trial, despite the exclusion of patients who had symptomatic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, hospitalization for heart failure was a key driver of the primary outcome. Because patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who have new-onset or preexisting heart failure are at very high risk for hospitalization and death, 删除3:<u><sup><a>27-29 </a></sup></u> treatment with finerenone may represent an advance in the prevention and management of heart failure, thus minimizing the considerable health care burdens in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes. Although the effects of finerenone treatment on the kidney composite outcome that included a decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the eGFR were similar in the current trial and the FIDELIO-DKD trial, significance was not achieved here. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> In this trial, the incidence of end-stage kidney disease was lower in the finerenone group than in the placebo group. In both trials, the incidence of the kidney composite outcome that included a decrease from baseline of at least 57% in the eGFR (a more sensitive surrogate outcome for kidney failure than a decrease of ≥40% in the eGFR 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> ) was lower in the finerenone group than in the placebo group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】In a finding that is consistent with mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> treatment with finerenone led to a greater increase in the serum potassium level than placebo. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-14 </a></sup></u> Given the higher mean eGFR in this trial than in the FIDELIO-DKD trial (68 vs. 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> ), the incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone treatment was lower (10.8% vs. 18.3%), despite the longer median follow-up (3.4 vs. 2.6 years). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Results from the Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Tolerability Study (ARTS) showed a lower incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone therapy at a dose of 10 mg once daily than with spironolactone therapy at a dose of 25 to 50 mg once daily (4.5% vs. 11.1%). 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Because concerns about hyperkalemia contribute to the underuse of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure and CKD, 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> finerenone may be an attractive therapeutic option in these patients, with the recommended monitoring of serum potassium levels and eGFR (as mandated in both the current trial and the FIDELIO-DKD trial). 删除3:<u><sup><a>32</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】The Covid-19 pandemic caused disruption in the latter part of our trial. Despite this situation, only 10 patients were lost to follow-up. However, 85 patients were prospectively excluded from all the analyses because of critical Good Clinical Practice violations. Although our trial included a large population of patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, the generalizability of the findings may be restricted because few Black patients underwent randomization.\n\n【58】In the FIGARO-DKD trial, finerenone therapy improved cardiovascular outcomes, as compared with placebo, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria.\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Bayer .</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Twenty-seven patients were able to discontinue insulin therapy 48±5 days after the start of immunosuppression. At four months, their fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations averaged 110 and 160 mg per deciliter (6.1 and 8.9 mmol per liter) with a mean hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> level of 6.15 percent. Seventy-five percent of these patients with early remission still did not need insulin at 12 months, and their glycemic control was similar to that at 4 months.\n\n【2】The major differences between the 27 patients with remission and the 13 without remission were the duration of symptoms before diagnosis (26.8 vs. 48.0 days, P<0.01), the degree of weight loss (3.2 vs. 10 percent of body weight, P<0.001), the initial hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> level (10.7 vs. 13.2 percent, P<0.001), and the frequency of ketoacidosis (11 vs. 61.5 percent, P<0.001). The lesser degree of weight loss was the strongest independent predictor of remission. The response of C-peptide to intravenous glucagon (0.50 vs. 0.17 pmol per milliliter, P<0.05) was also an independent predictor. No differences were observed between the two groups of patients in age, sex, HLA phenotype, autoantibodies to insulin or islet-cell antigens, or doses or trough levels of cyclosporine. Only minimal manifestations of toxicity were detected over the period of observation.\n\n【3】We conclude that early treatment with cyclosporine in children with recent-onset Type I diabetes can induce remission from insulin dependence, with half the patients not requiring insulin after a full year. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1988; 318:663–70.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 17:35:17", "endTime": "2024/08/12 17:35:22", "cost": 4.797}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-12 01:35:23", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 01:35:11"}

Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both. Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】### Video\n\n【12】 Computed Tomographic Imaging of a Patient with ARDS Due to Covid-19. (00:07)\n\n【13】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Since initial detection of the virus, more than 400,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with the first reported cases in the United States occurring on January 19, 2020, in the state of Washington. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> The number of cases in Washington continues to rise; as of March 27, 2020, there had been 3700 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 175 deaths. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Most of the cases have been in King County, an urban county that includes Seattle and outlying suburbs and accounts for 1760 Covid-19 cases and 125 deaths. Genomic and epidemiologic analyses of sequenced virus RNA recovered in the western Washington region 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> have shown that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the result of local community transmission — meaning that the source of infection cannot be traced back to a known exposure. Person-to-person transmission has also been well documented in skilled nursing and long-term care facilities in the Seattle metropolitan area.\n\n【14】Initial reports from China and Italy suggest high mortality and stressed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> Reports describing patients admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 in the United States are limited. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> A better characterization of Covid-19 infection in critically ill patients is important to guide decision making regarding critical care capacity and allocation of resources. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The aim of our multicenter report is to describe the demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, and outcomes among critically ill patients with Covid-19 in the Seattle metropolitan area.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Study Population, Setting, and Data Collection\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【17】We included patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection who were admitted to nine hospital ICUs in the Seattle region between February 24 and March 9, 2020. A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included.\n\n【18】Twenty-four adults (18 years of age or older) were identified from nine hospitals, including three University of Washington (UW) Medicine Hospitals (Harborview Medical Center, UW Medical Center–Montlake, and Northwest campuses), the Virginia Mason Medical Center, and the Swedish Hospitals (First Hill and Cherry Hill). This group represents six of the eight adult acute care hospitals in the city of Seattle; hospitals connected to these systems in suburbs outside Seattle (UW–Valley Medical Center, Swedish–Issaquah, and Swedish–Edmonds) were also included in the group of nine. Pregnant women, prisoners, and children (those younger than 18 years of age) were excluded from the study. The UW institutional review board approved this study with the reliance agreement (also known as an authorization agreement) of other local medical centers. The institutional review board at Swedish Medical Center also independently approved the study. Informed consent was waived, and researchers analyzed only deidentified (anonymized) data.\n\n【19】Data from each institution’s electronic medical record was obtained through a research form in Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University). We obtained demographic data, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during ICU admission. All laboratory tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n【20】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【21】Coexisting conditions were ascertained from physician documentation. Patient data were censored at the time of data cutoff, which occurred on March 23, 2020. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as acute-onset hypoxemia (the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen \\[Pa o <sub>2 </sub> :F io <sub>2 </sub> \\], <300) with bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging that were not fully explained by congestive heart failure or other forms of volume overload. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Specimen Collection and Testing\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】Clinical specimens for Covid-19 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Initially, all clinical specimens were tested with the assay developed by the CDC, targeting the N1 and N2 genes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> which was run at the Washington Department of Health State Public Health Laboratory. On March 2, UW began using an assay developed by the UW School of Medicine clinical virology laboratory 删除7:<u>(see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. The assay is based on the World Health Organization standard, and it targets the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RdRp gene. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> If both targets are detected, the assay is reported as positive; if one target is detected, the assay is reported as inconclusive and is later confirmed reflexively by the real-time RT-PCR assay developed by the CDC at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as medians and interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing data. Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Table 1.  Table 1. Clinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【29】During the period from February 24 through March 9, we identified 24 critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection at the nine hospitals surveyed. This number included all patients admitted to the ICU under the care of an intensivist at any time during the hospital stay. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years (range, 23 to 97); 63% were men. The mean duration of symptoms before hospital admission was 7±4 days. None of the patients had recently traveled to a country with known transmission, such as China, South Korea, Iran, or Italy. A slight majority of patients (13 \\[54%\\]) had had recent contact with a person known to have been ill, but whether the sick contacts were infected with SARS-CoV-2 was not known because of the limited availability of testing at the time. Sixteen patients (67%) were admitted from home, and 6 patients (25%) were admitted from a skilled nursing facility. The most common symptoms on admission to the hospital were shortness of breath and cough, each of which occurred in 21 patients (88%). Documented fever was present in 12 patients (50%) on presentation at the hospital. Patient-level data are available in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【30】Chronic medical conditions were common in this critically ill population. Fourteen patients (58%) had diabetes mellitus and 5 (21%) had chronic kidney disease; 3 patients (14%) had asthma, and all 3 had recently received, as an outpatient, systemic glucocorticoids for a presumed asthma exacerbation before becoming critically ill. Five patients (22%) were current or former smokers and 1 patient (4%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 8 patients (33%) had more than one coexisting condition.\n\n【31】Laboratory and Radiologic Findings\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Laboratory Data at Hospital Admission and Imaging Findings.\n\n【33】Table 2 shows the laboratory and radiologic findings in the patients on admission and during the ICU course. On admission, lymphocytopenia was common (in 75% of the patients), with a median lymphocyte count of 720 per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 520 to 1375). Arterial lactate was 1.5 mg per deciliter or higher in 8 patients, and hepatic enzymes were 40 U per liter or higher in 9 patients. Troponin concentrations were elevated in 2 patients early in their ICU course (maximum value, 0.80 ng per deciliter).\n\n【34】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Chest Radiographs and CT Images of a 55-Year-Old Patient with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【35】An initial radiograph (anteroposterior view) of the chest at admission (Panel A) shows hazy opacities in the upper and mid lung zones. Another chest radiograph obtained approximately 24 hours after the initial presentation (Panel B) shows worsening multifocal air-space opacities. Axial CT images (Panels C and D) and coronal reformats (Panel E) obtained within 2 hours after the chest radiograph in Panel B show extensive ground glass opacities and occasional foci of consolidation.\n\n【36】A chest radiograph was obtained in 23 patients (96%) on ICU admission, and all the radiographs showed bilateral pulmonary opacities. No pleural effusions were seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest was obtained in 5 patients (21%); four of the scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities, and one showed pulmonary nodules. Figure 1 provides representative images from a single patient, illustrating the rapid evolution of pulmonary opacities and the diffuse findings. A video showing the CT cross-sectional images of the chest is available at NEJM.org.\n\n【37】Microbiologic Results\n---------------------\n\n【38】The performance of the local UW assay was similar to that of the CDC assay in comparison diagnostic testing. All patients had Covid-19 confirmed by an RT-PCR assay of a nasal swab. The UW assay returned one inconclusive result that was later confirmed as positive by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.\n\n【39】Of the patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, nearly all (23 patients \\[96%\\]) also had nasopharyngeal swabs sent to test for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, and 21 patients (88%) had an extended-spectrum respiratory viral panel. None of the patients had a coinfection with another virus (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Sputum samples from 15 patients were sent for bacterial culture, and all were negative for bacterial growth; blood samples from 20 patients were sent, and all remained negative. Bronchoscopy was performed in 4 patients. Two patients had bronchoscopy performed before diagnosis of Covid-19; bacterial and viral RT-PCR results were negative for other respiratory viruses. Two subjects had bronchoscopy performed late in the hospitalization for mucous plugging, without additional cultures.\n\n【40】Respiratory Failure and Shock\n-----------------------------\n\n【41】Table 3.  Table 3. ICU-Level Therapies and Clinical Outcomes.\n\n【42】Eighteen patients (75%) received invasive mechanical ventilation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. For patients who received mechanical ventilation, the Pa o <sub>2 </sub> :F io <sub>2 </sub> ratios were consistent with moderate-to-severe ARDS. Pulmonary secretions were characterized as either moderate or thick and purulent in 14 patients (77%) during the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation. The median F io <sub>2 </sub> on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 0.9 (interquartile range, 0.7 to 1.0), and the F io <sub>2 </sub> improved on day 3 to 0.6 (interquartile range, 0.5 to 0.7). The median driving pressure (the difference between plateau pressure and positive end expiratory pressure \\[PEEP\\]) on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 13 cm of water (interquartile range, 11 to 17). During the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, the median driving pressure was 12 to 13 cm of water. The median pulmonary compliance on day 1 was 29 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 36). The pulmonary compliance improved during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, with median compliance on day 3 of 37 ml per cm of water (interquartile range, 25 to 42). Five patients (28%) were placed in a prone position, 7 (39%) received neuromuscular blockade, and 5 (28%) received inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to treat hypoxemic respiratory failure in ARDS. Tracheostomy was not completed in any of the patients.\n\n【43】Seventeen patients (71%) presented with concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressors, without clear evidence of secondary infection. Of these patients, 3 (18%) had transient hypotension after intubation; 14 (82%) had hypotension that was unrelated to intubation or that persisted for more than 12 hours after intubation. None of the echocardiograms completed in 9 patients (38%) showed new cardiac dysfunction. Seven patients received compassionate-use remdesivir as antiviral therapy, 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and 1 patient received lopinavir–ritonavir; no patient received systemic glucocorticoids or tocilizumab in the ICU.\n\n【44】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【45】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Outcomes for Individual Patients Included in the Case Series.\n\n【46】Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) designates orders that were in place before hospital admission. As of March 23, 2020, a total of 12 patients (50%) had died. Six patients who had received mechanical ventilation had been extubated and three patients remained intubated. Five patients had been discharged from the hospital. All the patients had at least 14 days of follow up. Dashed red lines indicate censoring of data.\n\n【47】All patients had at least 14 days of hospital follow-up. As of March 23, of the 24 patients, 12 (50%) had died, 4 (17%) had been discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, 3 (13%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and were still in the ICU, and 5 (21%) had been discharged from the hospital 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. A greater percentage of patients over 65 years of age had died than patients under 65 years of age (62% vs. 37%). The 12 deaths included 4 patients (17%) who had do-not-resuscitate orders in place before hospital admission for use in the event of cardiac arrest, and 6 additional patients (25%) had do-not-resuscitate orders that were instituted during their admission.\n\n【48】The median length of hospital stay among survivors was 17 days (interquartile range, 16 to 23), and the median length of ICU stay among survivors was 14 days (interquartile range, 4 to 17) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 10 days (interquartile range, 7 to 12), and 6 patients (33%) had been extubated as of March 23, 2020. Three patients continued to receive ventilatory support, so the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay are likely to be underestimates.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】This multicenter case series describes 24 critically ill patients who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection. We included all patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to an ICU at nine Seattle-area hospitals between February 24 and March 9, 2020. All the patients had acquired Covid-19 without known exposure to a returning traveler. Coexisting lower respiratory bacterial infections were not identified in sputum and blood cultures obtained early in the clinical course. Overall outcomes were poor in patients who received ICU care.\n\n【51】The patients in our series presented with respiratory symptoms similar to those of patients described in reports from China, which indicates a common host response to SARS-CoV-2. Cough was the most common presenting symptom, as it was in reports from China, and the mean duration of symptoms before ICU admission was 1 week. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Only half the patients had fever at the time of hospital admission, which suggests that fever may not be a useful criterion to determine the severity of illness and that diagnostic algorithms that require fever for Covid-19 testing may delay diagnosis. The majority of patients had chronic illnesses before their admission to the ICU, most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Lymphocytopenia was common on hospital admission, as it was in reports from China. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】The case fatality rate of 50% in this series (to date) is similar to that reported among critically ill patients in Chinese hospitals but lower than that in a single-center experience reported from our area. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,13 </a></sup></u> Although the case fatality rate was higher in persons 65 years of age or older, it was still substantial (37%) in persons younger than 65 years of age. Our case fatality rate may be an underestimate, given that 3 patients remained intubated at the time data were censored.\n\n【53】Patients who received mechanical ventilation had high oxygen requirements soon after initiation of mechanical ventilation, with plateau pressures (mean, 25 cm of water) and driving pressures (mean, 12 to 13 cm of water) similar to those in populations of patients with ARDS enrolled in clinical trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> For example, the mean plateau pressure in the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> was 25 to 26 cm of water. Of the 18 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation in this series, 6 had been successfully extubated. The earliest extubation occurred 8 days after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, which suggests that acute respiratory failure due to Covid-19 may require prolonged mechanical ventilation lasting days to weeks and that readiness for extubation is unlikely to occur early in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Of patients who were extubated, the age range was 23 to 88 years, which suggests that age may not be the sole indicator for successful extubation.\n\n【54】A large proportion of patients in this series presented with shock that required vasopressor support. In patients who had an echocardiogram, myocardial dysfunction was uncommon. The lack of bacterial or viral coinfection suggests that the observed shock was directly related to Covid-19. In these preliminary data, Covid-19 infection appears to differ from seasonal influenza, which is commonly associated with bacterial coinfection due to pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as staphylococcus and streptococcus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Regarding antiviral interventions, 7 patients received compassionate-use remdesivir, but we have insufficient information to report associated outcomes. Bronchoscopy was performed in a minority of patients and did not appear to change clinical management.\n\n【55】Three patients with mild asthma had received systemic glucocorticoids within 1 week before ICU admission, as outpatients, for presumed asthma exacerbation while they had symptoms of Covid-19. These 3 patients then presented to the hospital again, with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment for phylogenetically similar viruses, SARS-CoV (2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load, longer duration of viremia, and worse clinical outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-20 </a></sup></u> These findings are in contrast to those of a recent nonrandomized observational study that suggested that glucocorticoids may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 and ARDS. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> Further research is necessary to determine the role of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with Covid-19 infection.\n\n【56】Our study has several notable limitations. First, some cases had incomplete documentation of clinical symptoms, missing laboratory testing, or both. However, given the need to provide objective data and the urgent timeline, we did not approach patients to obtain additional history or biologic samples for laboratory measurement. Second, 7 patients (29%) remained in hospitals at the time of data censoring on March 23, 2020; as a result, outcomes for those patients were not known. Third, because of our focus on the critical care needs of patients with the greatest severity of illness, our sample size is small. Finally, it is possible that critically ill patients with established goals of care that were not consistent with admission to an ICU were not included in this report. Specifically, this includes patients who received care on the general medical ward that focused on comfort measures only.\n\n【57】This early experience of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States resembles the experience in other countries, with high mortality for patients requiring care in the ICU. Patients with coexisting conditions and older age are at risk for severe disease and poor outcomes after ICU admission. Better information is needed to inform care for these challenging patients. Our findings also highlight the importance of planning for mass critical care as the need for ICU care and ventilatory support to treat patients with Covid-19 grows rapidly in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (K23DK116967, to Dr. Bhatraju).</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on March 30, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>We thank Adrienne Meyer from the University of Washington institutional review board for rapidly reviewing and facilitating study protocols across many area hospitals.</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>From the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine (P.K.B., B.J.G., M.N., R.K., M.M.W., L.E., P.A.K., T.E.W., A.L., C.M.), the Departments of Laboratory Medicine (K.R.J., A.K.N., A.L.G.) and Radiology (S.P.), and the Division of Allergy and Infectious Disease (J.D.G.), University of Washington, the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (K.R.J., A.K.N., A.L.G.), the Sections of Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine, Virginia Mason Medical Center (A.G.), and the Divisions of Pulmonary and Critical Care (C.R.D., S.O.) and Infectious Disease (J.D.G.), Swedish Medical Center — all in Seattle.</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Bhatraju at University of Washington–Harborview Medical Center, 325 9th Ave., Seattle, WA 98104, or at Bhatraju@uw.edu .</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Supplementary Appendix | PDF | 234KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 418KB |\n| Data Sharing Statement | PDF | 77KB |</u>\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>References _(23)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Carabello and Crawford (July 3 issue) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> included useful insights into the pathophysiology and care of patients with valvular heart disease. Mitral regurgitation is a very common valvular lesion and is often associated with left ventricular dysfunction. Unfortunately, the underlying cause is often coronary heart disease. The treatment of this important group of patients remains a major clinical problem. Can the authors comment further about these patients?\n\n【3】Careful follow-up shows that patients with valvular heart disease are often in a border zone, with symptoms that cannot be confidently attributed to their valvular lesions. We have found that stress echocardiography is extremely helpful as a means of assessing these patients objectively and further clarifying the pathophysiology of their symptoms and echocardiographic findings at rest. The assessment of exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension, exercise-induced transvalvular gradients, myocardial reserve, left ventricular end-systolic index during exercise, right ventricular function after exercise, exercise capacity, and sometimes, exercise-induced systemic hypertension often has a major impact on patient care. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> Echocardiographers should be encouraged to explore exercise physiology using the various methods available with this imaging technique to evaluate patients with valvular heart disease further — beyond the indecisive findings obtained from patients at rest — and to an even greater extent than has previously been done invasively in the catheterization laboratory.\n\n【4】参考删除-2:<u>Micha S.

We entirely agree but did not address this point in our review because mitral regurgitation due to coronary disease represents two heart diseases instead of one valvular disease. In a given case, the outcome may be determined more by the progression of coronary disease than by the valve lesion, thus making general statements about the management of ischemic mitral regurgitation very difficult. Ischemic mitral regurgitation continues to be an extremely difficult disease to manage, with a poor outcome relative to that of nonischemic mitral regurgitation. Further complicating the issue, mitral-valve repair may be problematic in ischemic mitral regurgitation, since the valve itself may be relatively normal. Thus, some have advocated mitral-valve replacement as superior to mitral-valve repair in this entity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u></u>\n\n【18】参考删除-2:<u>We agree that exercise echocardiography may be helpful in a patient with mitral regurgitation in establishing both symptom status and the origin of exercise-related symptoms. Indeed, there are data in the literature to support this approach. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> However, in our opinion, longer follow-up of a larger number of patients will be necessary to establish the exact role of echocardiography in the timing of valve surgery for mitral regurgitation.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-2:<u>We concur with Dr. Homler that prophylaxis against repeated streptococcal infection is indicated in young patients with a history of rheumatic fever. However, the age at which this prophylaxis may safely be discontinued remains debatable and is unlikely to be resolved in the near future owing to apparent differences in the nature of rheumatic fever in different parts of the world. We thank Dr. Homler for noting the error on page 37. Indeed, we were referring to mitral regurgitation rather than mitral stenosis.</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-2:<u>Blase A.

In 29 per cent of the deaths, a major disagreement on the underlying cause of death led to reclassification of the death in a different _International Classification of Diseases_ major disease category. In an additional 26 per cent, the death certificate and autopsy report agreed on the major disease category but attributed the death to a different specific disease. Deaths due to neoplasms were most accurately diagnosed, with a sensitivity of 87 per cent and a positive predictive value of 85 per cent. Deaths resulting from diseases of the respiratory or digestive system were associated with the highest rates of disagreement. Diseases most commonly overdiagnosed were circulatory disorders, ill-defined conditions, and respiratory diseases. Diseases most commonly underdiagnosed as the cause of death on the death certificate were specific traumatic conditions and gastrointestinal disorders. The autopsy remains an important method for ensuring the quality of mortality statistics. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1985; 313:1263–9.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 16:00:17", "endTime": "2024/08/12 16:00:37", "cost": 20.128}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-12 00:00:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 00:00:12"}

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n【24】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n【40】Table 1.  Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n【24】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n【40】Table 1.  Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n【40】Table 1.  Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【45】Table 3.  </mark>Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【47】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【45】Table 3.  </mark>Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【47】Figure 2.  </mark>Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children (Panels A and B), adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【45】Table 3.  </mark>Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【47】Figure 2.  </mark>Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children<mark> (Panels A and B)</mark>, adolescents (Panels C and D), adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【45】Table 3.  </mark>Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【47】Figure 2.  </mark>Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children<mark> (Panels A and B)</mark>, adolescents<mark> (Panels C and D)</mark>, adults (Panels E and F), and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Subjects were between 3 and 77 years of age, stratified into four age groups. The immunization schedule consisted of two vaccinations, 21 days apart. Subjects were injected with placebo or with vaccine, with or without alum adjuvant, at doses of 7.5 μg, 15 μg, or 30 μg. Serologic analysis was performed at baseline and on days 21 and 35.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2200 subjects received one dose, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, of vaccine or placebo. No severe adverse side effects associated with the vaccine were noted. In the nonadjuvanted-vaccine groups, injection-site or systemic reactions, most mild in nature, were noted in 5.5 to 15.9% of subjects. Among the subjects receiving 15 μg of nonadjuvanted vaccine, a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was achieved by day 21 in 74.5% of subjects between 3 and 11 years of age, 97.1% of subjects between 12 and 17 years, 97.1% of subjects between 18 and 60 years, and 79.1% of subjects 61 years of age or older; by day 35, the titer had been achieved in 98.1%, 100%, 97.1%, and 93.3% of subjects, respectively. The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more was generally highest among the subjects receiving 30 μg of vaccine, with or without adjuvant. Vaccine without adjuvant was associated with fewer local reactions and greater immune responses than was vaccine with adjuvant.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These data suggest that a single dose of 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen without alum adjuvant induces a typically protective immune response in the majority of subjects between 12 and 60 years of age. Lesser immune responses were seen after a single dose of vaccine in younger and older subjects. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975572 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified as the cause of large numbers of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> It rapidly spread to many countries around the world, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic on June 11, 2009. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> An important method of controlling this pandemic will be large-scale immunization. Currently used trivalent seasonal-influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> ; hence, there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine against it. On July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tentatively concluded that children under 9 years of age may need to be given two doses of vaccine to elicit sufficient immunogenic reactivity against the 2009 H1N1 virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In response to the pandemic, a novel vaccine against the virus strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) has been developed and recently was approved for sale in China. This report details the findings of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of the safety and immunogenicity profile of this influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. In addition, we evaluated the role of alum adjuvant in the vaccine formulation, the optimal amount of antigen, and the need for second doses in children or elderly people.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Objective\n--------------------------\n\n【15】From July 2009 through August 2009, we enrolled a total of 2200 subjects between the ages of 3 years and 77 years in a stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. The study was sponsored by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company. The study was conducted and the data were gathered by the nonindustry investigators, and the data analysis was conducted by Southeast University; all the authors drafted the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication. The sponsor did not influence these activities. All the authors had full access to the data, which were held by Southeast University, and all vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the analysis.\n\n【16】Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the ethics committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the standards of Good Clinical Practice (as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization), and Chinese regulatory requirements, as stipulated by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject or his or her legal representative.\n\n【17】The study subjects received either vaccine or placebo. The vaccine was administered at various doses, with or without alum adjuvant. The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more on day 21 after the first dose and on day 35 (14 days after the second dose). The second dose was administered on day 21, after data for the primary end point had been collected. The primary safety end points were the presence of any systemic reaction or injection-site reaction 21 days after the first dose and 14 days after the second dose.\n\n【18】Vaccine\n-------\n\n【19】The influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent, split-virus vaccine was developed by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company, and the seed virus was prepared from reassortant vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 NYMC X-179A (New York Medical College, New York), distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. This strain was recommended by the World Health Organization and obtained from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was prepared in embryonated chicken eggs according to the same standard techniques that are used for the production of trivalent inactivated vaccine against seasonal influenza. In brief, the virus was harvested from the egg cultures and inactivated with the use of formaldehyde. The virus was concentrated, purified, and further sterilized by means of chromatography (on a Sepharose 4FF column) with Triton X-100.\n\n【20】The five experimental vaccines produced were split-virus products of 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with or without adjuvant, and 7.5 μg of hemagglutinin antigen with adjuvant. The adjuvant formulation contained 1.2 mg of alum per milliliter of solution. The placebo consisted of phosphate-buffered saline.\n\n【21】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【22】Subjects were eligible to participate in the study if they were healthy, were 3 years of age or older, did not have a history of infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus, and had not received an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine, and if they or their guardians confirmed that they understood the study procedures, provided written informed consent, and agreed to keep a daily record of symptoms. Adverse events were coded according to the requirements of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration. These requirements are based on documents published by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that provide a grading system to classify adverse effects in adult and pediatric patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Women between 16 and 50 years of age were also required to have a negative pregnancy test at the time of screening and before each vaccination.\n\n【23】The study subjects were classified into four age categories: 61 years of age or older, 18 to 60 years of age, 12 to 17 years of age, and 3 to 11 years of age. The general rationale for the age divisions was as follows: young children, defined as those 3 to 11 years of age, attend kindergartens or primary schools; adolescents, defined as those 12 to 17 years of age, attend junior high school or high school; adults, defined as those 18 to 60 years, work outside the home; and the elderly, defined as those 61 years or older, are retired and often live with family. Hence, the four age groups have different socialization patterns and thus different risks of exposure to the virus.\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Study Subjects.\n\n【25】The reasons why 251 subjects did not undergo randomization are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The reasons why 97 of the 2200 subjects who received the first vaccine dose did not receive the second dose are listed in Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Each treatment group had 110 subjects 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Subjects in the elderly and adolescent cohorts were each randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The adult subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5, 15, or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose. The subjects who were 3 to 11 years of age were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of vaccine: adjuvant vaccine with 7.5 or 15 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose or nonadjuvant vaccine with 15 or 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per dose.\n\n【27】With 110 subjects per treatment group, the study had a statistical power of at least 80% to detect a seroconversion rate of more than 40% in each group. The randomization schedule was created with the use of SAS software (version 9.1). The block size was defined by an independent statistician at Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Randomization-code numbers were assigned to subjects in chronological order by the investigator.\n\n【28】Subjects and investigators were unaware of the formulation of the study vaccine that was administered. Injections were given intramuscularly, in the deltoid muscle. After an on-site safety observation of 30 minutes' duration, subjects or their guardians were asked to record underarm body temperature and data on injection-site reactions and systemic reactions at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours and at 7, 14, and 21 days, in a diary provided by the investigators. Serum samples were collected three times: on day 0 (before the first vaccination), day 21 (before the second vaccination), and day 35 (14 days after the second vaccination).\n\n【29】Assays\n------\n\n【30】The titer of antibodies against the vaccine strain was measured in all samples by means of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, which were performed in accordance with established procedures and with the use of turkey erythrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In brief, samples were treated with cholera filtrate at 36°C for 16 hours and were then tested at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:20. Titers of anti–hemagglutinin antigen antibodies that were below the detection limit (i.e., <1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5, and titers above 1:5120 were assigned a value of 1:5120. All samples were assayed in a blinded manner, in duplicate, and were double-checked by two investigators at the Chinese National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceuticals and Biological Products.\n\n【31】The results of immunogenicity assays performed 21 days after the first vaccination and 14 days after the second vaccination were compared with the results obtained at baseline. In addition, the numbers of subjects who underwent seroconversion were noted and compared with the baseline numbers. Seroconversion was defined as an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of at least four times the baseline titer, according to international guidelines used to evaluate influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> No microneutralization tests were performed.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The likelihood-ratio chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of subjects in each treatment group who had a local (injection-site) or systemic reaction within 21 days after vaccination.\n\n【34】The primary immunologic end points were the proportions of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first and second vaccine doses. Specifically, seroconversion was considered to have occurred when the hemagglutination-inhibition titer was less than 1:10 before vaccination and was 1:40 or more after vaccination or the titer was 1:10 or more before vaccination and increased to at least four times the baseline level after vaccination. Other end points regarding hemagglutination inhibition included the geometric mean titer, the geometric mean increase (i.e., the ratio of the titer after vaccination to the titer before vaccination), and the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more. Modeling of the geometric mean titers and geometric mean increases was conducted with the use of generalized linear models, which included the effects of adjuvant status, dose, and age. Logistic regression was used to model the rate of adverse reactions, the proportion of subjects with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, and the proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more, according to adjuvant status, dose, and age. Safety data were summarized descriptively.\n\n【35】Hypothesis testing was conducted with the use of two-sided tests, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed by means of SAS software (version 9.1).\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Subjects\n--------------\n\n【38】A total of 2200 subjects between 3 and 77 years of age received the first dose of vaccine, and 2103 (95.6%) received the second dose, 21 days later 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. Data from all vaccinated subjects were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity data on the effects of the first and second vaccinations were available for 2104 and 2069 subjects, respectively.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. </mark> Table 1. Injection-Site and Systemic Reactions within 21 Days after the First or Second Dose of Nonadjuvanted Vaccine or Placebo, According to Age Group.\n\n【41】Injection-site and systemic reactions are shown in Table 1 . Most reactions were mild; grade 3 reactions — corresponding to an inability to perform usual social and functional activities 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> — occurred in 0.0 to 1.8% of the study subjects 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables 3, 4, and 5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Only one severe adverse event was reported, in a subject who received placebo: hospitalization for atrial fibrillation on the day after the first injection. Thus, no serious, vaccine-related adverse events or unexpected events were recorded. Analysis of the factors associated with the rate of local or systemic reactions suggested that the presence of adjuvant and receipt of the second dose were associated with a higher rate of local reactions (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) 删除2:<u>(Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For systemic reactions, age was the only factor with significant effects on the rate: subjects 12 to 17 years of age had systemic reactions most frequently, followed by subjects 3 to 11 years of age, those 18 to 60 years of age, and those 61 years of age or older 删除2:<u>(Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most common injection-site reaction after vaccination was pain, which occurred in 10.5 to 26.7% of subjects; the most frequently reported systemic reaction was fever, which occurred in 11.5 to 18.0% of subjects 删除2:<u>(Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of an adverse event was similar among subjects with detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain and in those without detectable antibodies.\n\n【42】Immune Response\n---------------\n\n<mark>【43】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titer of 1:40 or More among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【44】The proportion with a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 or more was 1.1 to 6.0% at baseline in the four age groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies against the vaccine strain were detected on day 21 after the first dose and also 14 days after the second dose (day 35). The proportion with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more, according to treatment group, are listed in Table 10 in the Supplementary Appendix . Logistic-regression modeling showed that dose, adjuvant status, and age significantly affected the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more and the proportion with an increase in the hemagglutination-inhibition titer by a factor of 4 or more after the first dose (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Tables 11 and 12, respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Vaccine formulations without adjuvant were more immunogenic than formulations with adjuvant. There was also a dose-dependent antibody response; the dose of 30 μg was the most immunogenic, with the proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more highest among subjects 12 to 17 years of age, followed by subjects 18 to 60 years of age, subjects 3 to 11 years of age, and subjects 61 years of age or older. The proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more among those receiving nonadjuvant vaccine was 74.5 to 97.1% after the first dose and increased to 93.3 to 100% after the second dose 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【45】Table 3.  </mark>Table 3. Geometric Mean Titer of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies among Subjects Receiving Nonadjuvanted Vaccine, According to Age Group.\n\n【46】The results were similar for the geometric mean titer and the geometric mean increase from baseline: the highest values in the adolescent and adult cohorts were seen with formulations without adjuvant and at higher doses 删除2:<u>(Tables 13, 14, and 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the children, both the geometric mean titer and geometric mean increase rose significantly after the second vaccination. In contrast, in the other age groups, the antibody levels did not rise significantly after the second dose among the subjects who received the nonadjuvanted vaccine. After the first and second vaccinations, antibody levels did not differ significantly between the groups receiving the 15-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine and the groups receiving the 30-μg dose of nonadjuvanted vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n<mark>【47】Figure 2.  </mark>Figure 2. Cumulative Distribution Curves for Titers of Hemagglutination-Inhibition Antibodies on Day 21 (after the First Dose of Vaccine) and Day 35 (after the Second Dose), According to Treatment Group and Age Group.\n\n【48】The percentages of subjects with hemagglutination-inhibition titers are shown for children<mark> (Panels A and B)</mark>, adolescents<mark> (Panels C and D)</mark>, adults<mark> (Panels E and F)</mark>, and elderly subjects (Panels G and H). The limit of detection was a titer of 1:10. Titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution.\n\n【49】The antibody titers after the first and second doses of vaccine support the findings of higher immunogenicity of the vaccine formulations without adjuvant and of the higher doses, among adolescents and adults 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Recently, Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> reported that a single 15-μg dose of split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions. However, because children and the elderly were not included in the study, it not known whether a second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be necessary to induce sufficient immunity in these populations.\n\n【52】The results of our study show that 2009 H1N1 vaccine is associated with an acceptable safety profile for adults as well as children and elderly people. The level of immunity induced by the first dose of the vaccine appears to be influenced by the presence or absence of alum adjuvant and the age of the recipients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 , and Tables 10 through 15 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The vaccines formulated without alum adjuvant were more effective in inducing an immune reaction in subjects than were vaccines with adjuvant. This lack of enhancement by the use of alum adjuvant was consistent with data from previous studies of other influenza vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> There were no significant differences in the immunogenicity of the 15-μg and 30-μg doses of nonadjuvant vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>, in line with the results reported by Greenberg et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The immune response to the vaccine varied among the age groups. As in studies of seasonal influenza vaccine, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15-17 </a></sup></u> age was an important factor associated with the level of induced immunity in our study.\n\n【53】The immune responses in children and the elderly, but not adults or adolescents, can be substantially boosted by a second dose of vaccine 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Table 3 )</u>. This finding is consonant with the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination, which showed that one dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in healthy adults under 65 years of age and that a second dose did not substantially enhance the antibody response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In our study, depending on the age of the subjects, the administration of a single 15-μg dose of vaccine is associated with a proportion of subjects with a titer of 1:40 or more of 74.5% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 65.1 to 82.5) to 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.4) and a geometric mean titer of 64.1 (95% CI, 51.1 to 80.3) to 430.7 (95% CI, 330.0 to 562.1). These results are consistent with the statutory or regulatory requirements of most governments for the use of vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,21</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Although one dose of 15 μg of vaccine without adjuvant protects the majority of persons, another dose given 21 days later will increase the antibody response in children. The decision about whether to administer two doses of vaccine in children will need to be made by public health officials. One argument for a two-dose vaccine schedule in children is the unusual epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: it affects younger age groups, including young children, and significant morbidity and mortality appear to occur in these younger age groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Hualan Biological Bacterin Company.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Intracranial hemorrhage, which may be antenatal, occurs in approximately 15 to 20 percent of infants with this form of thrombocytopenia. In families with an affected infant, 75 percent of subsequent infants are affected. We report the results of antenatal treatment with intravenous gamma globulin, with or without dexamethasone, in seven pregnant women who had previously had infants who had severe alloimmune thrombocytopenia.\n\n【2】The platelet count increased by a mean (±SD) of 72.5±62X10 <sup>9 </sup> per liter in the six fetuses in whom periumbilical blood sampling was performed. All seven treated fetuses had platelet counts above 30X10 <sup>9 </sup> at birth, and none had an intracranial hemorrhage, in contrast to all seven of their respective untreated siblings, who had lower platelet counts and three of whom had intracranial hemorrhages (antenatal in two infants). Mild intrauterine growth retardation was observed in one treated infant; all seven infants have developed normally in the two months to four years since birth.\n\n【3】We conclude that intravenous gamma globulin, with or without dexamethasone, is effective in elevating the fetal platelet count in severe cases of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and in helping to avoid intracranial hemorrhage. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1988; 319: 1374–8.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 17:45:32", "endTime": "2024/08/12 17:45:38", "cost": 5.363}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-12 01:45:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 01:45:08"}

Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to compare interferon alpha-2b with placebo in the treatment of this disorder. Our rationale was that interferon has both antiproliferative and antiviral properties.\n\n【2】The placebo or interferon (1x10 <sup>6 </sup> IU) was injected directly into one to three warts three times weekly for three weeks. The injections were well tolerated by both groups of patients. The side effects of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and leukopenia occurred more commonly in the interferon group than in the placebo group, but such effects rarely disrupted daily routines. Only 13 of 296 patients (4 percent) discontinued therapy because of side effects (11 in the interferon group and 2 in the placebo group). Twenty-six other patients were excluded from analysis because of a loss to follow-up or other deviations from protocol, thus leaving 257 patients in the final evaluation.\n\n【3】At one week after the completion of therapy, interferon had produced a large and significantly greater reduction in mean wart area (a 62.4 percent decrease), as compared with placebo (a 1.2 percent increase in mean area) (P<0.001). At the conclusion of the study (13 weeks after the completion of therapy), the mean wart area was still decreased 39.9 percent below the initial size in the interferon group, whereas it had increased by 46 percent over base-line measurements in the placebo group (P<0.001). At the same time, all treated warts had completely cleared in 36 percent of the interferon recipients and in 17 percent of the placebo recipients (P<0.001), whereas treated warts progressed in 13 percent of the interferon recipients and in 50 percent of the placebo recipients (P<0.001).\n\n【4】We conclude that injection of interferon alpha-2b directly into genital warts appears to be an effective and fairly well-tolerated form of therapy. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1986; 315:1059–64)</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/13 10:16:56", "endTime": "2024/08/13 10:17:20", "cost": 23.684}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-12 18:17:18", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 18:16:53"}

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers (see the Appendix) contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】Table 1.  Table 1. Fluoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers (see the Appendix) contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】Table 1.  Table 1. Fluoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers (see the Appendix) contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】Table 1.  Table 1. Fluoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】Table 1.  Table 1. Fluoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n<mark>【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.</mark>\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】Table 1.  Table 1. Fluoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n<mark>【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.</mark>\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1. F</mark>luoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n<mark>【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.</mark>\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】<mark>Table 1.

F</mark>luoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】<mark>Figure 2.  Figure 2.</mark> Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight. Figure 2 shows the results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n<mark>【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.</mark>\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1. F</mark>luoroscopy Time and Early Success of Ablation, According to Pathway or Type of Tachycardia.\n\n【50】Success rates are shown in Table 1 according to the pathway or type of tachycardia.\n\n【51】Ongoing Results\n---------------\n\n【52】<mark>Figure 2.  Figure 2.</mark> Freedom from Recurrence of Tachycardia or Preexcitation after Ablation (Abl), According to the Location or Mechanism of Tachycardia (Panel A), the Degree of Experience at the Study Center in Performing Ablation in Children (Panel B), the Presence or Absence of Structural or Hemodynamic Heart Disease (Panel C), and Body Weight (Panel D).\n\n【53】The individual locations or mechanisms of tachycardia classified as “other” in Panel A did not differ significantly from one another in their rates of recurrence (P>0.05). The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight.<mark> Figure 2 shows the</mark> results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】Table 2.  Table 2. Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

We reviewed registry data obtained from 24 centers to evaluate the indications, early results, complications, and short-term follow-up data in young patients who underwent this procedure.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Standardized data were submitted for 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The mean length of follow-up was 13.5 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The median age of the patients was 13.5 years, and 84 percent of them had structurally normal hearts. The initial success rates for ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways (508 of 615 procedures) and atrioventricular-node reentry (63 of 76 procedures) were both 83 percent. Greater institutional experience in performing ablation in children and location of the accessory pathway in the left free wall correlated with greater likelihood of sustained success. Conversely, a right free-wall pathway, the presence of other heart disease, and higher body weight were all associated with a lesser chance of sustained success. Recurrences of arrhythmia accounted for 45 percent of the failures overall in the series. Atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia had the highest recurrence rate. The total complication rate was 4.8 percent (35 of 725 procedures), and the only variables that independently correlated with a higher complication rate were very low weight and less institutional experience.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】These early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation has a good success rate and a low complication rate in pediatric patients, especially when it is carried out in experienced pediatric cardiology centers.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The initial experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias has shown excellent success with low complication rates in large numbers of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . These early reports of safety and efficacy led to the suggestion that this procedure would become the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Only a small number of children and adolescents were included in the reports of large series of adult patients, and only a few single-center reports have focused on pediatric patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13 </a></sup></u> . Accordingly, the Pediatric Radiofrequency Ablation Registry was established in November 1990 by the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society to gather data on the use of this procedure in this population. We summarize the initial findings from the registry regarding the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation in children and adolescents and report the results of short-term follow-up of a large cohort.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Procedures\n-----------------------\n\n【15】Twenty-four centers <mark>(see the Appendix)</mark> contributed data on 652 patients who underwent 725 procedures involving radiofrequency catheter ablation (69 patients underwent 2 procedures each, and 2 underwent 3 procedures each) between January 1, 1991, and September 1, 1992. The median number of procedures per center was 13.5 (25th and 75th percentiles, 6 and 32, respectively); 76 percent of the procedures were performed at eight centers.\n\n【16】Criteria for Participation\n--------------------------\n\n【17】Any member of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society could participate in the registry by submitting data on children who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation. Although the goal of the registry was to study all such patients treated at each center, no center was excluded because of incomplete participation. After the interval set for data collection, a survey revealed that the registry comprised 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent ablation at the participating centers during that time. A follow-up form was completed (May 1993) and submitted (June 1993) once for each patient by each participating center to provide information about late complications (i.e., complications not detected at the time of ablation), recurrences of clinical tachycardia or preexcitation (follow-up cardiac catheterizations were not routinely performed) and the time of recurrence (<4, 4 to 12, or >12 months after ablation), and medications and their effectiveness. At the time of follow-up, data were current for 89 percent of patients in the registry. Patients were registered if 21 years of age or younger, according to the definition of the American Academy of Pediatrics 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【18】Collection and Analysis of Data\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Each registration form recorded the patient's demographic characteristics, the indications for ablation, procedural data (e.g., fluoroscopy time), the results of treatment (success or failure), and complications. After the forms were returned to the coordinating center (University of Nebraska Medical Center), the data were entered by means of a relational-data-base program.\n\n【20】Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) to identify variables associated with three measures of outcome: the result of ablation (presence of tachycardia or preexcitation, vs. its absence), fluoroscopy time, and complications (absence vs. presence).\n\n【21】Outcome was evaluated in relation to the following variables: age, very young age ( ≤ 3 years), weight, extremes of body weight ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 80 kg), presence of heart disease, number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at the institution, and location of the accessory pathway (defined below) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry or atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia).\n\n【22】Categorical variables were analyzed for their univariate relation to outcome by means of the chi-square test. Each continuous variable was tested by generating a regression model to predict outcome, with only one continuous variable being incorporated at a time. All variables with at least a fair correlation with outcome on univariate analysis (P<0.10) were entered into a multivariate analysis. They were added to the model by forward-selection logistic regression (for dichotomous outcome measures, early success, and complications) or stepwise multiple linear regression (for fluoroscopy time) until the model showed no statistically significant improvement (alpha = 0.05). Patients for whom data on risk factors or outcome were incomplete were excluded from the multivariate analyses; thus, the results of treatment and complications in 96 percent of the patients were analyzed, and the data on fluoroscopy time in 85 percent.\n\n【23】Life-table analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the probability of freedom from tachycardia or preexcitation (or both) as a function of the time elapsed since ablation. Data on patients lost to follow-up were censored at the midpoint of the interval during which follow-up data became unavailable. Recurrences of tachycardia or preexcitation were counted from the midpoint of the interval during which the recurrence was noted. The “midpoint” of a follow-up interval of more than 12 months was estimated as the mean duration of follow-up in patients followed for more than 12 months. Patients not followed for more than 12 months who had undergone ablation more than 24 months previously were considered lost to follow-up during the time after the 12-month interval. The analysis was stratified according to the categorical variables evaluated for their relation to other outcome measures and according to the median number of ablations previously performed in children at the study center (<30 vs. ≥ 30). The Kaplan-Meier curves generated for each variable were compared by the Wilcoxon test.\n\n【24】Indications for Ablation\n------------------------\n\n【25】Of the following indications for ablation listed on the registry form, only one was accepted for each procedure: (1) life-threatening symptoms -- tachyarrhythmia associated with syncope, near syncope, seizures, or resuscitation from cardiac arrest; (2) medically refractory tachycardia -- tachyarrhythmia not effectively controlled by one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (3) adverse drug effects -- any problems attributed to the use of one or more antiarrhythmic medications; (4) tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction -- ventricular dysfunction associated with incessant tachycardia; (5) impending surgery -- planned cardiac surgery whose risks could be reduced by catheter ablation; and (6) the patient's choice -- an indication accepted only when none of the above indications applied. Although the patient's choice (or the family's choice for young patients) was a practical consideration in virtually all procedures, it was regarded as the indication only when it was the sole reason for ablation. Specific reasons for the choice were not sought or analyzed. Moreover, each of these definitions probably varied from center to center (e.g., what one center defined as medically refractory tachycardia might have been defined as the patient's choice at another center). Therefore, the selection of patients for radiofrequency catheter ablation also probably differed somewhat among centers.\n\n【26】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【27】### _Atrioventricular Accessory Pathway_\n\n【28】To maintain the consistency of the definition of the location of the accessory atrioventricular pathway among the study centers, arbitrary borders were shown on the registry form in a diagram representing the left anterior oblique view of the tricuspid-valve annulus and the mitral-valve annulus. The anatomical sections on the diagram were assigned numbers to facilitate identification of the specific area of ablation. Although this system facilitated data collection and analysis, it might have introduced some anatomical inconsistencies.\n\n【29】### _Slow and Fast Pathways in Atrioventricular-Node Reentry_\n\n【30】Patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia underwent ablation of either the “fast” pathway or the “slow” pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> . (Five patients underwent ablation of both pathways after ablation of one pathway was unsuccessful.) The fast pathway was defined as the anterior or superior atrioventricular nodal pathway, whereas the slow pathway was the posterior or inferior atrioventricular nodal pathway 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Treatment Success_\n\n【32】Ablation was considered successful if conduction through a pathway (e.g., preexcitation) was abolished, tachyarrhythmia (e.g., atrioventricular-node reentry) could not be induced, or tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ectopic-focus tachycardia) was absent. In patients with two or more pathways or types of tachycardia, success was determined with respect to each pathway or diagnosis. Success was also determined with respect to each diagnosis regardless of complications. For example, if a pathway was successfully ablated but complete atrioventricular block was produced, the pathway was considered successfully ablated but with a complication.\n\n【33】### _Recurrence_\n\n【34】For each patient and for each pathway or type of tachycardia, only documentation of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both was considered to represent a recurrence. Palpitations were not considered to represent recurrences if they were not associated with documented tachyarrhythmia or if they were associated with a tachyarrhythmia different from that identified before ablation.\n\n【35】### _Complications_\n\n【36】Complications were included in this report if they met one or both of the following criteria: the problem required emergency or ongoing treatment or follow-up; or residual effects interfered with normal function.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n<mark>【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Ages of the 652 Patients at the Time of Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation for Tachyarrhythmia.\n\n【40】The number of patients is shown above each bar; some patients are represented more than once because they underwent two or three procedures.\n\n【41】Patients ranged in age from 20 days to 20.9 years at the time of ablation (median, 13.5 years; mean, 12.4); their distribution according to age is shown in Figure 1 . Their weight ranged from 3.2 to 124 kg (median, 50).\n\n【42】No associated heart disease was present in 519 of the 621 patients for whom data were available (no data were available for 31 of the 652 patients in the study). Of the 102 patients with underlying heart disease, 32 had a structurally normal heart with ventricular dysfunction or dilatation and incessant tachycardia and 70 had congenital heart disease.</mark>\n\n【43】Indications\n-----------\n\n【44】Thirty-nine percent of the patients underwent ablation for medically refractory tachycardia, 30 percent by choice, 13 percent for life-threatening symptoms, 6 percent for adverse drug effects, 5 percent for tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction, 5 percent for unknown reasons, and 2 percent because of impending surgery.\n\n【45】Fluoroscopy Time\n----------------\n\n【46】Multivariate analysis revealed four factors independently associated with fluoroscopy time. Fluoroscopy took longer if the accessory pathway was in the right free wall (β = 18.89; 95 percent confidence interval, 9.91 to 27.87; P<0.001) or body weight was higher (β = 0.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.31; P = 0.047). Fluoroscopy was shorter if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = -0.18; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.27 to -0.08; P<0.001) or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrioventricular-node reentry (β = -15.62; 95 percent confidence interval, -26.76 to -4.48; P = 0.005). (In these and subsequent analyses, negative β coefficients represent inverse associations, and positive β coefficients, direct associations).\n\n【47】Early Success of Ablation\n-------------------------\n\n【48】Five factors were found to be independently associated with early success of ablation. Success rates were lower if heart disease was present (β = -0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.19 to -0.17; P = 0.007) or body weight was 80 kg or more (β = -0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, -1.49 to -0.18; P = 0.011). Success rates were higher if the number of ablation procedures previously performed at the institution was higher (β = 0.014; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.008 to 0.020; P<0.001), the accessory pathway was in the left free wall (β = 1.10; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.59; P<0.001), or the mechanism of tachyarrhythmia was atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia (β = 2.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 3.60; P = 0.006).\n\n【49】<mark>Table 1.

The institutional experience represented in Panel B reflects the fact that half the procedures in the registry were performed with the benefit of prior experience in more than 30 patients at the study center. The Kaplan-Meier curves include immediate treatment failures. P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon test. The numbers of patients eligible for follow-up and free of recurrence at the beginning of each follow-up interval are shown below each graph. Some patients underwent more than one procedure.\n\n【54】Variables associated with success of ablation over time were an accessory pathway in the left free wall and greater institutional experience 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Failure over time was associated with a pathway in the right free wall, underlying heart disease, and high body weight.<mark> Figure 2 shows the</mark> results of 725 procedures over time as a function of pathway location, institutional experience with ablation, heart disease other than tachyarrhythmia, and body weight. Of 603 patients who were free from tachycardia early after the procedure and eligible for follow-up, 39 were lost to follow-up before four months. Of 491 eligible patients without recurrence at 4 months, 32 were lost to follow-up by 12 months. Seven of 431 eligible patients without recurrence were lost to follow-up before 24 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 13.5 months among the patients who remained free of tachycardia or preexcitation. Among the patients with early or late treatment failure, 70 patients required medication for recurrent tachycardia, which was successfully controlled in 57 (81 percent).\n\n【55】Recurrences accounted for 45 percent of treatment failures overall. This proportion was relatively constant with respect to the locations of the accessory pathways and the mechanisms of tachycardia, except for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia. Ninety-two percent of the ablations in patients with this type of tachycardia were initially considered successful; however, the rate of freedom from recurrence was only 68 percent by 21 months. Fully 75 percent of failures of ablation for atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia were due to late recurrences after apparent initial success.\n\n【56】Complications\n-------------\n\n【57】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2. </mark>Complications of Ablation.\n\n【58】The complication rate at the time of ablation was 3.7 percent (27 of 725 procedures), and the total rate of complications (including those detected during follow-up) was 4.8 percent (35 procedures) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The multivariate analysis showed that body weight of less than 15 kg was an independent risk factor for complications (β = 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 2.02; P = 0.007). If the number of ablations previously performed in children at a study center was higher, the rate of complications was lower (β = -0.012; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.024 to 0; P = 0.043). The complication rate among children weighing less than 15 kg was 10 percent.\n\n【59】Deaths\n------\n\n【60】Table 3.  Table 3. Sudden Deaths.\n\n【61】Four patients died at different times after ablation. Because of the low number, statistical analysis of the deaths was not carried out. However, observational data are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】In this report from a multicenter registry, we have addressed the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children and adolescents. The success rate of this procedure among patients with supraventricular tachycardia treated at individual centers has been quite variable, ranging from 50 to 96 percent among children and adolescents 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> to 82 to 99 percent among adults 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> . Such studies alone could not establish with certainty the reasons for the differences in reported success rates within each of these two age groups or between them.\n\n【64】Although the extensive experience represented by our registry data allowed better assessment of the results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in the pediatric population, it is difficult to compare our results with those in adult patients because multicenter registry data for the latter have not been reported. Higher reported success rates among adults may reflect several possible influences other than the age and size of the patients. First, the studies in adults were conducted in series of patients from single institutions and thus would be more subject to selection bias than studies of a large registry of patients from many centers. Second, some of the series of adults with higher success rates include disproportionately more patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and fewer patients with right-sided free-wall pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . In both the children in our report and the children and adults in reports from individual centers, the chances of initial success were greater among patients with left-sided free-wall accessory atrioventricular pathways and lower among those with right-sided pathways 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,8,9,16,17 </a></sup></u> . Even with apparent early success, our data and those of others show that right-sided free-wall pathways are prone to the recurrence of preexcitation, tachycardia, or both 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,6,16-19 </a></sup></u> . Third, as would be expected in a pediatric population, a relatively high proportion of our patients had underlying heart disease, as compared with most of the series of adult patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> . Our analysis demonstrated that treatment failure over time was associated with the presence of such disease.\n\n【65】Prolonged exposure to radiation during fluoroscopy is a concern 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> . Both an accessory pathway in the right free wall and higher body weight were associated with longer fluoroscopy time. Technical challenges in mapping and ablation of right free-wall pathways are probably related to the longer fluoroscopy times required.\n\n【66】A higher number of ablation procedures previously performed in children at a study center was associated with a higher success rate, a shorter fluoroscopy time, and a lower complication rate. Although individual centers have reported that their results improved as their studies progressed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,9 </a></sup></u> our findings document a learning curve for procedural safety and efficacy that is independent of other confounding variables.\n\n【67】The rate of early complications (3.7 percent) was similar to rates reported in the individual series of adult patients (1.3 to 8 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-6 </a></sup></u> and children (0 to 10 percent) 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-13,15-17 </a></sup></u> . Few reports have included late complications, making it difficult to compare their rates with our total rate (for early and late complications combined, 4.8 percent). These rates are only slightly higher than that of pediatric cardiac catheterization in general 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【68】Late recurrence of tachycardia or preexcitation after apparent initial success has involved all pathway locations and mechanisms of tachycardia. This phenomenon is particularly frequent with respect to atrial ectopic-focus tachycardia, possibly because this type of tachycardia may arise from multiple foci 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> and thus present during follow-up as a “recurrence.” Our follow-up has not been long enough to permit estimation of the lifetime risk of recurrence; however, the likelihood of recurrence appears to diminish with time.\n\n【69】Deaths were very infrequent, but observational details provide common findings that suggest ways to try to reduce the risks of mortality further. Because three of the four patients who died had noncardiac diseases and two had peripheral thrombosis after catheterization, it appears prudent to evaluate patients carefully for noncardiac diseases and to recommend the use of anticoagulation during and after the procedure.\n\n【70】The main limitation of this study applies to any uncontrolled, voluntary registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> . Because 97 percent of all pediatric patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation at the participating centers were entered into the registry, bias introduced by selective reporting was probably small. However, the results reported here are not necessarily representative of those that might be expected in children treated outside centers with expertise in pediatric electrophysiologic programs. It may be argued that ablation in adolescents has more in common with the procedure in adults than with ablation in younger children, and that the inclusion of adolescents might obscure important conclusions about the procedure in small children and infants. Careful attention to the independent effects of age and body weight on outcome show that patients with very low weight have a higher complication rate, and that very heavy patients have a lower success rate. Otherwise, adolescents do not differ enough from younger children to warrant separate consideration. Because only weights (and not heights) were available for our study, the influence of body-surface area and body-mass index is not known.\n\n【71】Early results suggest that radiofrequency catheter ablation is becoming an acceptable mode of treatment for supraventricular tachycardia in children. The low risk of complications and the high success rate (despite learning curves) demonstrate its safety and efficacy. The fact that 30 percent of the procedures were performed with the patient's choice serving as the indication is evidence of its acceptability to physicians and patients. However, because low weight was an independent risk factor for complications and because three of the four deaths occurred in very small, young patients and all four patients had underlying heart disease, it is prudent to emphasize that the procedure poses a higher risk to patients with these features. Together with data on the natural history of tachyarrhythmias, the maintenance and analysis of long-term follow-up data from the registry should help determine whether or not radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with certain supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Kris Gerken Houston, R.N., B.S.N., M.A., for entering the registry data; to Gary Felix, B.A., for developing and customizing the computer system and assisting in the data analysis; and to Louise Larsen for assistance in preparing the manuscript.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>From the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha (J.D.K., D.A.D.); Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago (B.J.D.); South Carolina Children's Heart Center, Charleston (P.C.G.); Texas Children's Hospital, Houston (J.C.P.); Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland (M.J.S.); University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco (G.F.V.H.); and Children's Hospital, Boston (E.P.W.).</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Kugler at the Section of Pediatric Cardiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 S. 42nd St., Omaha NE 68198-2166.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>The other members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society who participated in this study are listed in the Appendix according to their study centers (Dr. Danford is not a member).</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Appendix\n--------</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>The following members of the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society participated in this study.

The index case, which prompted clinicians at Vanderbilt University to call the Tennessee Department of Health and which brought this event to national attention, was reported by Pettit et al. on October 19, 2012, at NEJM.org and in the November 29, 2012, issue of the _Journal_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> We now summarize our understanding of this outbreak as of June 7, 2013.\n\n【3】At the outset of the outbreak, the persistence and progression of neutrophilic meningitis of unknown cause was the trigger for obtaining the history of a recent epidural injection of methylprednisolone. Then events fell into place. After the alarm was sounded about this association, other physicians throughout the country realized that they too had struggled to find a cause for similar cases in recent weeks. What was intriguing about this case report was that the mold causing meningitis was reported to be _Aspergillus fumigatus,_ an organism that has not been detected in any of the subsequent 700-plus cases. It has since been determined that the major culprit is _Exserohilum rostratum,_ a plant pathogen that rarely causes human disease. This mold has been cultured or identified by means of a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay from cerebrospinal fluid or tissues in 152 patients and has been detected in unopened vials from two of the three implicated lots of methylprednisolone.\n\n【4】Shortly after the Tennessee Department of Health was notified on September 18, 2012, the implicated lots were quickly identified, all centers that had received the implicated lots were alerted, and patients who had received injections from these lots were notified of the potential for fungal infection. More than 13,400 patients could have been exposed to contaminated methylprednisolone from one of the three implicated lots. The compounding pharmacy producing the drug, New England Compounding Center (NECC), was closed, and all products (not just the implicated lots) were recalled. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided timely information regarding appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment on its website 删除7:<u>( www.cdc.gov . opens in new tab )</u>. Further epidemiologic studies by the Tennessee Department of Health and the CDC showed that one lot (number 06292012@26) was associated with an increased number of cases, especially when the vials that were used had been manufactured more than 50 days earlier. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】Identification of the Mold\n--------------------------\n\n【6】_E. rostratum_ is a dematiaceous, or black, mold containing melanin in its cell wall. It is widely found in the environment, on plant debris, in soil, and in water. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Human infection is uncommon and is usually restricted to allergic sinusitis, keratitis, and localized soft-tissue infection. In rare cases, invasive infection occurs in immunocompromised patients.\n\n【7】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Photomicrograph of _Exserohilum rostratum_ Isolate from Cerebrospinal Fluid Grown for 48 Hours on Potato Flakes Agar.\n\n【8】Courtesy of Annette W. Fothergill, Fungus Testing Laboratory, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.\n\n【9】The conidia of this organism have distinctive morphologic features 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> that allow its identification. The organism grows readily on usual fungal culture medium, but sporulation to identify the conidia typically requires the use of a plant-based medium, such as potato dextrose agar. Even though the mold grows readily in the laboratory, cultures from cerebrospinal fluid and tissues may be negative, as has been true for other mold infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Molecular identification was used to establish a diagnosis, and PCR assays on cerebrospinal fluid were useful in the outbreak. It is important to note that the performance characteristics of this specific PCR assay had not been characterized previously because this organism had rarely caused disease.\n\n【10】In tissues, _E. rostratum,_ like many other dematiaceous fungi, appears as irregular, beaded hyphae, as compared with the broad, rarely septate, ribbonlike hyphae seen in the order Mucorales and with the narrow, septate, acutely branching hyaline hyphae of aspergillus species. Special stains for cell-wall melanin (e.g., Masson–Fontana stain) are useful to confirm the presence of a dark-walled mold.\n\n【11】Several outbreaks in the past decade have been associated with contamination with black molds. _Exophiala dermatitidis_ was associated with a disturbingly similar outbreak of infections including meningitis that was traced back to a contaminated lot of glucocorticoid injections from a U.S. compounding pharmacy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> and _Exophiala jeanselmei_ was identified in an outbreak associated with contaminated water. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents\n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】Generally, exserohilum species are susceptible to available antifungal agents, but for some strains, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the usually recommended agents, including voriconazole, is increased. Thus, susceptibility testing is advised. Analyses have shown that most isolates from this outbreak are susceptible to voriconazole (MIC, 1 to 4 μg per milliliter; mode, 1 to 2 μg per milliliter), amphotericin B (MIC, 0.03 to 2 μg per milliliter; mode, 0.4 μg per milliliter), itraconazole (MIC, 0.25 to 4 μg per milliliter; mode, 0.5 μg per milliliter), and posaconazole (MIC, 0.25 to 1 μg per milliliter; mode, 0.5 μg per milliliter). 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> This organism is resistant to fluconazole.\n\n【14】Clinical Diagnostic Issues\n--------------------------\n\n【15】How the Outbreak Evolved\n------------------------\n\n【16】Early in the outbreak, patients had symptoms of meningitis for weeks before the diagnosis was made. Neutrophilia in cerebrospinal fluid was extreme in many cases, and complications, including basilar-artery stroke, were common. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3,10,11 </a></sup></u> The incubation period for patients who presented with meningitis was 1 to 4 weeks after injection. After notifying patients at risk and performing lumbar punctures as soon as even mild headache occurred, clinicians began to see patients who had milder clinical disease.\n\n【17】As the outbreak evolved, it became increasingly rare for a patient to present with meningitis. The manifestations of infection changed to those related to localized infection at the injection site. Early in the outbreak, a few patients had increasing back pain as the prominent symptom and were found to have an epidural abscess or diskitis or vertebral osteomyelitis at the site of injection. It is now clear that in some centers, epidural abscess or phlegmon, arachnoiditis, and diskitis or vertebral osteomyelitis became the major disease manifestations. Michigan had a disproportionate number of these cases, and the pain clinic in which most of these injections were administered had received lot number 06292012@26 from the NECC. Fewer patients had infection of peripheral joints or bursae from the implicated lots, but 33 infections in these sites have been documented to date, with most of the patients presenting with increasing pain several months after injection.\n\n【18】Spinal Tap, Joint Aspiration, or Imaging Studies\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Exposed patients were alerted to tell their physician about any new-onset headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, or strokelike symptoms. Because the symptoms of CNS fungal infection are often more subtle than those usually seen with bacterial meningitis, there was a very low threshold for performing lumbar puncture if any symptom suggesting possible CNS infection occurred. Even with headache as the only symptom, values for cerebrospinal fluid have been abnormal in some patients. The criterion for initiating therapy was suggested to be a white-cell count above that which is considered normal (i.e., >5 cells per cubic millimeter). White-cell counts in patients in this outbreak of fungal meningitis have ranged from 13 cells to 15,000 cells per cubic millimeter, almost always with a neutrophil predominance. Glucose and protein levels were not suggested as criteria for initiating therapy. Most important, it was suggested that empirical antifungal treatment be given as soon as pleocytosis is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, without waiting for results of diagnostic studies.\n\n【20】Increasing back pain, pain that differed in quality from the chronic back pain for which a patient received an epidural injection, or development of the cauda equina syndrome alerted physicians to the possibility of an epidural abscess or phlegmon, arachnoiditis, or diskitis or vertebral osteomyelitis at the site of injection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was suggested in such patients. Early symptoms of these complications were often subtle, and localized infection occurred most often without meningitis. It was suggested that any fluid or tissue obtained by means of aspiration or at the time of surgery should be sent for culture and PCR studies for exserohilum. Some centers embarked on a program to perform MRI in all patients who received an injection from the highly contaminated lot. Reports followed that some of these patients who had only subtle symptoms of back pain were found to have an epidural abscess or phlegmon requiring surgical intervention.\n\n【21】It was suggested that patients who received an intraarticular injection should be alert for new pain, especially if it differed in quality from their original pain, or if they had erythema or swelling of a joint. In such cases, it was suggested that aspiration of synovial fluid should be performed immediately for diagnostic studies. Given the variability in what is considered to be a normal number of white cells in synovial fluid, no firm guidance has been given for the number of cells required to initiate therapy. It was suggested that clinical judgment, along with the symptoms and signs of joint disease before the injection, should be used to make therapeutic decisions. If there was any question of whether infection was present, arthroscopy to obtain synovial fluid and possibly synovial biopsy for culture and PCR studies should be performed as soon as possible.\n\n【22】Treatment as the Epidemic Evolved\n---------------------------------\n\n【23】Recommendations for the treatment of this rare infection were based on small case series, individual case reports, and personal experience. A large number of patients in this outbreak were older adults, many of whom had substantial coexisting illnesses that made therapeutic decisions challenging. Treatment recommendations evolved during the outbreak as clinicians gained more experience with managing these infections. It was suggested that given the paucity of data pertaining to treatment and the complexity of management, decisions about the treatment of patients with proven or suspected infection should be made with the input of an infectious diseases specialist.\n\n【24】Initial recommendations for therapy were to use high doses of both liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole because the causative organism was not known and the index patient had been shown to have infection with _A. fumigatus_ . As events moved forward, it quickly became evident that the primary pathogen was a black mold, and clinical experience had shown that an azole was the usual drug of choice for infection with such organisms. In addition, a large number of patients had serious toxic effects from the high doses of amphotericin B that were recommended. Thus, the therapeutic regimen was modified in favor of monotherapy with voriconazole, except for the sickest patients or those who had substantial side effects while receiving this agent, for whom amphotericin B could play a role.\n\n【25】Voriconazole was selected over posaconazole and itraconazole for several reasons. First and foremost, there was experience in the use of voriconazole for various mold infections. Both intravenous and oral formulations were available, and oral administration produced serum levels equivalent to those achieved by intravenous administration. Levels of the drug in cerebrospinal fluid are approximately 50% of serum levels, 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and levels both in cerebrospinal fluid and in serum are above the MIC for many dematiaceous molds. By comparison, neither posaconazole nor itraconazole achieves substantial levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and their oral absorption can be erratic.\n\n【26】Current Recommendations\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Drugs and Doses\n---------------\n\n【28】For patients with mild or moderate CNS disease, including meningitis and localized infections involving the spine, the current recommendation is to administer voriconazole at a dose of 6 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily. For patients with severe or refractory CNS disease, therapy with a combination of voriconazole (6 mg per kilogram twice daily) and intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 5 to 6 mg per kilogram daily) is recommended. The dose of voriconazole should be modified to achieve serum levels of 2 to 5 μg per milliliter. In many patients, this will lead to a dose reduction from that given initially, but some patients will require even higher doses to achieve those concentrations, which suggests that some patients have more rapid metabolism. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Surgery plays an important role in patients who have epidural abscess or phlegmon.\n\n【29】For patients with osteoarticular infection, a loading dose of voriconazole at 6 mg per kilogram for two doses, followed by 4 mg per kilogram twice daily, is recommended. The penetration of voriconazole into the joint space is excellent. The combination of voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B (at a dose of 5 mg per kilogram daily) should be offered to patients with severe disease. Surgery plays an important role in patients who have osteoarticular infection.\n\n【30】Adverse Effects\n---------------\n\n【31】Voriconazole is associated with a host of drug–drug interactions. As an example, drugs that induce cytochrome P-450 (e.g., rifampin, long-acting barbiturates, and carbamazepine) substantially decrease voriconazole levels. The coadministration of voriconazole with rifabutin or phenytoin not only leads to lower voriconazole levels but also may cause toxic serum levels of rifabutin and phenytoin. Voriconazole interferes with the metabolism of several other drugs, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and warfarin, potentially leading to toxic levels of these drugs. The coadministration of voriconazole and other agents, such as statins, benzodiazepines, calcium-channel blockers, sulfa drugs, and proton-pump inhibitors, should be done with care, with attention paid to decreasing the doses of these agents.\n\n【32】There is appropriate concern about the toxicity of voriconazole, particularly at the doses recommended to treat CNS infection, which often leads to serum levels of more than 5 μg per milliliter. Visual hallucinations have been especially problematic in patients treated in this outbreak and appear to be related to high serum levels. Decreasing the dose of the drug will obviate this effect. Other adverse effects include visual disturbances (e.g., photopsia), confusion, nausea, hepatic-enzyme elevation, rash, and photosensitivity. Long-term tolerance of the high doses required to achieve the recommended drug levels has been poor in many patients who have persistent reports of fatigue, difficulty with concentration, and hair loss. These adverse effects have resolved with the discontinuation of the drug, but the frequency of their occurrence and long-term effect is unknown. The administration of parenteral voriconazole in patients with impaired renal function may lead to the accumulation of the cyclodextrin component of the intravenous solution. There is growing evidence to suggest that if needed, voriconazole can be given intravenously in such patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【33】Other Issues Related to Treatment\n---------------------------------\n\n【34】Duration of Therapy\n-------------------\n\n【35】The duration of therapy is not known. Initially, it was thought that at least 3 months of treatment would be necessary. As the outbreak has evolved, it appears that this duration may be appropriate for some patients who primarily had meningitis and at 3 months have no symptoms and normal results on lumbar puncture. However, for patients who have localized spinal abscess or phlegmon, arachnoiditis, or vertebral diskitis or osteomyelitis, therapy should be continued for 6 months or longer until all clinical signs and symptoms have resolved.\n\n【36】Therapeutic Drug Monitoring\n---------------------------\n\n【37】Therapeutic drug monitoring is especially important in this outbreak. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The severity of the infection, the possibility of relatively decreased antifungal susceptibility, and the concentration-dependent toxicity of voriconazole make the measurement of serum antifungal drug levels important. A voriconazole serum trough level of 2 to 5 μg per milliliter is recommended. Unpublished data from the Fungus Testing Laboratory at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio show that in 47% of more than 15,000 samples, voriconazole serum levels were 1 to 5 μg per milliliter, but 14% of samples had undetectable levels, and 15% had levels of more than 5 μg per milliliter. Of 167 measurements of cerebrospinal fluid, the median voriconazole level was 2.77 μg per milliliter, but there was substantial variability.\n\n【38】Treatment of Patients with Normal Cerebrospinal Fluid and Spine MRI\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Without objective evidence of infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (i.e., <5 white cells per cubic millimeter), treatment was not recommended. However, it was suggested that patients who had symptoms should be monitored closely, and that if there was even subtle progression of symptoms, a repeat lumbar puncture be performed immediately. If the number of white cells had increased, then it was suggested that antifungal treatment be initiated immediately.\n\n【40】Similarly, it was suggested that patients who had persistent back pain or peripheral-joint pain but who had a normal MRI study should not be treated. Instead, it was proposed that they should be watched carefully and undergo repeated imaging if there was persistence or any increase in symptoms. Some patients had initially had normal imaging but subsequently were shown to have development of epidural abscess or phlegmon on follow-up MRI that was performed because of persistent symptoms.\n\n【41】Prophylaxis\n-----------\n\n【42】The agents used for treatment are amphotericin B and voriconazole. During the outbreak it was unlikely that anyone would consider using amphotericin B for prophylaxis. Voriconazole was known to be less toxic but has numerous adverse effects in patients who have serum levels within the recommended range for treatment in this outbreak. Drug–drug interactions with this agent are numerous. Another concern was that the prophylactic use of antifungal agents could delay the onset or change the course of the disease so that it would appear months later or, probably less likely, that the organism may have become resistant to the agent used.\n\n【43】Summary\n-------\n\n【44】This outbreak of fungal meningitis caused by injection of contaminated methylprednisolone is in late evolution; there are now known to be more than 700 patients who have been affected. The primary pathogen is _E. rostratum_ . It is encouraging to note that clinically apparent disease has developed in only a small percentage of exposed patients. However, among patients who have been infected, some have died, others have major complications, and some remain in chronic care or rehabilitation centers. Even some patients who are doing well in respect to symptoms caused by the infection continue to have major issues with side effects from the antifungal agents. Management recommendations will probably continue to change as more information becomes available regarding the natural history and pathogenesis of these infections.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Kauffman reports serving on a data and safety monitoring board for Merck and an adjudication panel for New England Research Institutes; Dr. Pappas, receiving consulting fees from Merck, Gilead, Astellas, and T2 Biosystems and grant support through his institution from Merck, Gilead, Astellas, T2 Biosystems, and Pfizer; and Dr. Patterson, receiving consulting fees from Astellas, Merck, Pfizer, Toyoma, and Viamet, grant support through his institution from Astellas and Merck, and lecture fees through his institution from Merck and Pfizer.

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others (see the support statement at the end of the article). In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs. A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

My impression is that the material is obvious to any experienced clinician and should not result in any change of treatment except broader use of defibrillators and or hypothermia.</u>\n\n【117】参考删除-1:<u>*   Next\n*   Prev</u>\n\n【118】参考删除-1:<u>*   1</u>\n\n【119】参考删除-1:<u>Page 1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "284 Citing Articles\nLetters\n2 Comments\nRelated Articles", "content": "【0】参考删除-0*   _25_ References\n*   _284_ Citing Articles\n*   Letters\n*   _2_ Comments\n*   Related Articles\n\n【1】Abstract\n--------\n\n【2】Background\n----------\n\n【3】Antiarrhythmic drugs are used commonly in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, but without proven survival benefit.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared parenteral amiodarone, lidocaine, and saline placebo, along with standard care, in adults who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after at least one shock, and vascular access. Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others (see the support statement at the end of the article). In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs. A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others (see the support statement at the end of the article). In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs. A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs. A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , <mark>which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , <mark>which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice<mark> (see the Supplementary Appendix ).</mark>\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , <mark>which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice<mark> (see the Supplementary Appendix ).</mark>\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1</mark>. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , <mark>which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice<mark> (see the Supplementary Appendix ).</mark>\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1</mark>. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.</mark>\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

Paramedics enrolled patients at 10 North American sites. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge; the secondary outcome was favorable neurologic function at discharge. The per-protocol (primary analysis) population included all randomly assigned participants who met eligibility criteria and received any dose of a trial drug and whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was refractory to shock.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the per-protocol population, 3026 patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (974), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059); of those, 24.4%, 23.7%, and 21.0%, respectively, survived to hospital discharge. The difference in survival rate for amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08); for lidocaine versus placebo, 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70). Neurologic outcome at discharge was similar in the three groups. There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether the arrest was witnessed (P=0.05); active drugs were associated with a survival rate that was significantly higher than the rate with placebo among patients with bystander-witnessed arrest but not among those with unwitnessed arrest. More amiodarone recipients required temporary cardiac pacing than did recipients of lidocaine or placebo.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overall, neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01401647 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is responsible for more than 300,000 deaths each year in North America. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Many out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are attributable to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Although ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is regarded as the most treatable presentation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest because of its responsiveness to shock, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> most defibrillation attempts do not result in sustained return of spontaneous circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia commonly persists or recurs after shock, and there is a significant inverse relationship between the duration of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or the frequency of acute recurrences, and resuscitation outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Amiodarone and lidocaine are used commonly to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and prevent recurrences. In controlled trials involving patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, those who received amiodarone were more likely than those who received placebo or lidocaine to have a return of spontaneous circulation and to survive to be admitted to the hospital, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> but the effects of amiodarone on survival to hospital discharge or neurologic outcome remain uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effects of amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo on survival to hospital discharge after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Trial Conduct and Oversight\n---------------------------\n\n【15】The background and methods of the trial were described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Paramedics from 55 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies enrolled patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at 10 North American sites participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The trial was conducted under exception from informed consent in emergency research in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, oversight by the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, approval by institutional review boards in participating communities, and monitoring by an independent data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n\n【16】The trial was sponsored by the NHLBI, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and others <mark>(see the support statement at the end of the article)</mark>. In addition, Baxter Healthcare provided the trial drugs without cost and tested the stability of these products over the trial duration but otherwise played no role in the trial. The investigators designed and conducted the trial; gathered, analyzed, and interpreted the data; wrote the manuscript draft (the first author); and made the decision to submit it for publication. The trial statisticians had full access to all trial data and take responsibility for their integrity, analytic accuracy, and completeness and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol , <mark>which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】The trial included patients 18 years of age or older with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, defined as confirmed persistent (nonterminating) or recurrent (restarting after successful termination) ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia after one or more shocks anytime during resuscitation (inclusive of rhythms interpreted as being shockable by an automated external defibrillator). Eligible patients were also required to have intravenous or intraosseous vascular access. We excluded patients who had already received open-label intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone during resuscitation or had known hypersensitivity to these drugs.<mark> A complete list of trial inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</mark>\n\n【19】The trial protocol specified that the primary analysis population (the per-protocol population) would include only those randomly assigned participants who actually met the eligibility criteria, who received any dose of a trial drug during shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and who were confirmed to have an initial (rather than secondary) cardiac-arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Analyses were also performed in all randomly assigned patients (the intention-to-treat population).\n\n【20】Interventions\n-------------\n\n【21】The trial evaluated licensed parenteral preparations of lidocaine, normal saline and a recently approved Captisol-based formulation of amiodarone (Nexterone, Baxter Healthcare) that is designed to reduce hypotensive effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Trial drugs were packaged in identically appearing, sealed kits each having three identically formulated syringes. Each syringe held 3 ml of colorless fluid containing 150 mg of amiodarone (totaling 450 mg in the amiodarone kit), 60 mg of lidocaine (180 mg in the lidocaine kit), or normal saline. Kits and their syringe contents were indistinguishable except by numerical code and were randomly distributed to EMS providers in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization was performed in permuted blocks of concealed size and was stratified according to participating site and agency. Trial drugs were tested regularly for stability and were confirmed to maintain their integrity in the simulated climates of trial communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Treatment Protocol\n------------------\n\n【23】Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were treated in accordance with local EMS protocols that complied with American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced life support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Some patients were coenrolled in a concurrent trial comparing continuous chest compressions with interrupted chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After the failure of one or more shocks to terminate ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia or prevent its recurrence, eligible patients received a vasopressor and were then enrolled in the trial by the EMS personnel’s act of opening a trial-drug kit whose masked contents (amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo) determined the patient’s random assignment (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Patients, investigators, and trial personnel were unaware of the trial-drug assignments. The initial dose of a trial drug, approximating current clinical practice, consisted of two syringes (one syringe if the estimated body weight was <100 lb \\[45.4 kg\\]) that were administered by rapid bolus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,15,16 </a></sup></u> If ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia persisted after the initial dose of the trial drug, standard resuscitation measures, and additional shocks, a supplemental dose (one syringe) of the same drug was administered. Thereafter, standard interventions for advanced life support ensued according to local practice, excluding open-label lidocaine or amiodarone before hospitalization.\n\n【25】Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n------------------------\n\n【26】All trial interventions were completed before hospital arrival. On arrival, hospital care providers were notified of the patient’s enrollment in the trial and encouraged to provide usual post–cardiac arrest care in accordance with published AHA guidelines, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> including open-label amiodarone or lidocaine if necessary. Components of hospital care were monitored but were not standardized by the trial protocol, and their performance was reported back to hospitals periodically. A patient’s trial-drug assignment was not disclosed to care providers, investigators, or site personnel unless emergency unblinding was requested, and then only to the treating physicians.\n\n【27】Data Collection and Outcomes\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Data from prehospital patient care records, CPR-process measures, and data from hospital medical records were collected as described in the Supplementary Appendix . The primary outcome of the trial was survival to hospital discharge. The main aim was to compare survival in amiodarone recipients versus placebo recipients, with secondary comparisons of survival in lidocaine recipients versus placebo recipients and in amiodarone recipients versus lidocaine recipients. The secondary outcome was survival with favorable neurologic status at discharge, defined as a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of 3 or less, indicating the ability to conduct daily activities independently or with minimal assistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> These outcomes were determined in both the per-protocol population (the primary analysis) and in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【29】Mechanistic outcomes that were assessed for exploratory purposes included the number of defibrillation shocks administered after receipt of the trial drug, return of spontaneous circulation at hospital arrival, hospital admission, hospital treatments, and time to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to status with respect to witnessing of the cardiac arrest (witnessed by EMS, witnessed by bystander, or unwitnessed), receipt of bystander-initiated CPR (yes or no), location of the arrest (public or private), time to trial-drug administration (<15 or ≥15 minutes), route of trial-drug administration (intravenous or intraosseous), treatment group in the concurrent trial of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during CPR, baseline survival rate at the trial site (in quartiles), and EMS drug-administration practice<mark> (see the Supplementary Appendix ).</mark>\n\n【30】Adverse events were considered to be drug-related if they were reported previously with these medications 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> (e.g., anaphylaxis, thrombophlebitis requiring therapeutic intervention, clinical seizure activity, and bradycardia requiring temporary cardiac pacing) and if they occurred within 24 hours after trial-drug administration. Serious or unexpected adverse events attributable to trial interventions 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and complications related to vascular access were also assessed. Other adverse events such as pulmonary edema, hypotension, or pneumonia, which are common after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, were monitored but were not considered to be drug-related unless imbalanced between trial groups.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】We estimated that a sample size of 3000 in the per-protocol population (1000 patients per group) would provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the rate of survival to hospital discharge between the amiodarone group and the placebo group (29.7% vs. 23.4%). The baseline survival rate was estimated from patients with a first recorded rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who received at least two shocks in previous ROC trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> The projected difference in survival with amiodarone was estimated from a previous trial database 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> and was the comparison for which this trial was powered.\n\n【33】Survival was evaluated across groups with the use of the z-test for comparison of binomial proportions with pooled variance, with a one-sided significance level of 0.025 for comparisons between an active drug and placebo (based on the monitoring plan of the trial) and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 when comparing amiodarone with lidocaine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> All comparisons in this report, including testing interactions, were recalculated as two-sided with P values of less than or equal to 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance (as most comparisons were initially performed), which did not substantially change the results.\n\n【34】The data and safety monitoring board performed interim reviews twice a year with the use of group sequential methods with formal stopping boundaries; final differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome were adjusted accordingly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Apart from this, there were no adjustments for multiple comparisons.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Trial Populations\n-----------------\n\n【37】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1</mark>. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【38】The inclusion and exclusion of patients depended on their clinical and cardiac-rhythm characteristics at the time of potential trial-drug receipt. Of 46 patients in protected populations who were determined to be ineligible before enrollment, 33 were children, 12 were prisoners, and 1 was pregnant. Of 5 patients who had “other reasons” for ineligibility, 3 had exsanguination and 2 had a history of allergy to amiodarone or lidocaine. Circumstantial issues that were reasons for nonenrollment included safety concerns at the scene, arrival at the hospital before the trial-drug kit was opened, debatable asystole, shocks from an implanted defibrillator, infiltration or loss of intravenous (IV) access, and a need for extrication of the patient. The intention-to-treat population excluded patients in protected populations. There were 8 such patients (6 children and 2 prisoners) who were enrolled; 3 were assigned to amiodarone, 1 to lidocaine, and 4 to placebo. The intention-to-treat population included all patients for whom a trial-drug kit was opened, regardless of their eligibility, initial cardiac-arrest rhythm, or actual receipt of the trial drug. A total of 1627 patients in the intention-to-treat population were excluded from the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The per-protocol population was composed of randomly assigned, trial-eligible patients whose initial cardiac-arrest rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT), who continued to have shock-refractory VF/VT, and who received any dose of a trial drug. EMS denotes emergency medical services.\n\n【39】The trial began on May 7, 2012 and completed enrollment on October 25, 2015. Of 37,889 patients with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7051 (18.6%) had shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia at some time and were potentially eligible for enrollment in the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The intention-to-treat population of 4653 patients was composed of 4667 with opened drug kits, excluding 6 with an unknown trial-drug assignment and 8 in protected populations. Of these, 3026 comprised the per-protocol population of trial-eligible patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia who were randomly assigned recipients of amiodarone (974 patients), lidocaine (993), or placebo (1059), excluding 1627 who did not meet the per-protocol criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Emergency unblinding of the trial-drug assignment was requested in 24 patients (0.8%) and was proportionately similar across trial groups.\n\n<mark>【40】Table 1. Table 1. Prerandomization Characteristics of the Per-Protocol Population. Table 2.  Table 2. Event Characteristics and Treatments Received in the Per-Protocol Population.</mark>\n\n【41】The baseline patient characteristics and event characteristics in the per-protocol population were well balanced across trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. The first dose of the trial drugs was given a mean (±SD) of 19.3±7.4 minutes after the initial call to EMS and after a median of three shocks (interquartile range, two to four) had been administered.\n\n【42】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【43】<mark>Table 3.  Table 3. </mark>Outcomes According to Trial Group in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【44】Outcomes were available for 99.5% of all patients in the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Among amiodarone recipients in the per-protocol population, 237 (24.4%) survived to hospital discharge (the primary outcome), as compared to 233 (23.7%) who received lidocaine and 222 (21.0%) who received placebo. The absolute risk difference for the primary comparison of amiodarone versus placebo was 3.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.4 to 7.0; P=0.08). For the secondary comparison of lidocaine versus placebo, the risk difference was 2.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.0 to 6.3; P=0.16), and for the secondary comparison of amiodarone versus lidocaine, it was 0.7 percentage points (95% CI, −3.2 to 4.7; P=0.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Rates of survival with favorable neurologic status (the secondary outcome) were similar in the amiodarone group (182 patients \\[18.8%\\]), lidocaine group (172 \\[17.5%\\]), and placebo group (175 \\[16.6%\\]). The risk difference for the secondary outcome for amiodarone versus placebo was 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.6; P=0.19); for lidocaine versus placebo, 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 4.2; P=0.59); and for amiodarone versus lidocaine, 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.1 to 4.8; P=0.44).\n\n【45】Subgroups\n---------\n\n【46】There was heterogeneity of treatment effect with respect to whether or not the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed (P=0.05 for interaction); active drugs were associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge than the rate with placebo among patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among 1934 patients with bystander-witnessed arrest, the survival rate was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with placebo (22.7%). This absolute risk difference was significant for amiodarone versus placebo (5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 9.7; P=0.04) and for lidocaine versus placebo (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.5 to 9.9; P=0.03), but did not differ significantly between amiodarone and lidocaine (−0.1 percentage points; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P=0.97). The survival rate was also higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients with EMS-witnessed arrest, a risk difference of 21.9 percentage points (95% CI, 5.8 to 38.0; P=0.01). Conversely, among 839 patients in whom out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was unwitnessed, survival did not differ significantly between trial groups. No other significant interaction with treatment was found in other prespecified subgroups.\n\n【47】Mechanistic Outcomes\n--------------------\n\n【48】After randomization, placebo recipients were more likely to require an additional dose of blinded trial drug than recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine, and they received a greater number of subsequent shocks and other rhythm-control medications 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. More lidocaine recipients than placebo recipients had sustained return of spontaneous circulation on hospital arrival 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Patients were more likely to survive to hospital admission after receipt of amiodarone or lidocaine than after receipt of placebo. Fewer recipients of amiodarone or lidocaine than of placebo required CPR during hospitalization 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Use of open-label antiarrhythmic drugs (particularly open-label amiodarone) during the first 24 hours of hospitalization was also less common in the amiodarone group than in the lidocaine or placebo groups.\n\n【49】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【50】Table 4.  Table 4. Adverse Events in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【51】In the per-protocol population, the overall frequency of prespecified drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo, nor did serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 , and Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a greater need for temporary cardiac pacing after receipt of amiodarone (4.9%) than after receipt of lidocaine (3.2%) or placebo (2.7%).\n\n【52】Intention-to-Treat Population\n-----------------------------\n\n【53】Patients enrolled in the intention-to-treat population had balanced baseline characteristics across trial groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of the primary and secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the trial groups in the rates of drug-related adverse events or serious adverse events 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prehospital trial, we found that treatment with amiodarone or lidocaine did not result in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome at discharge than the rate with placebo after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by shock-refractory initial ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. There were also no significant differences in these outcomes between amiodarone and lidocaine.\n\n【56】Two previous small, randomized trials showed significantly higher rates of return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission with amiodarone than with placebo or lidocaine after shock-refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The current trial, which was larger and performed in the context of well-executed CPR, showed similar benefits with respect to short-term outcomes, but with both drugs. The time to treatment with these drugs was typically late across all the trials, averaging 19 minutes from the initial call to EMS in this trial and 21 to 25 minutes in the others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Such delays may attenuate the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic interventions as patients progress to the metabolic phase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, when cellular injury and physiological derangements may be irreversible despite restored circulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our results could be interpreted in several ways. First, antiarrhythmic drugs may simply be ineffective in this population because they lack antiarrhythmic or restorative effects on circulation. This explanation seems unlikely, given that both amiodarone and lidocaine facilitated termination of ongoing or recurrent ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with fewer shocks than placebo, were associated with higher rates of hospital admission, and resulted in a lesser need for CPR or antiarrhythmic therapies during hospitalization, which could even be taken as potential mechanisms for improved survival. Drug-related adverse events could also have mitigated survival. This too seems unlikely, because no significant between-group differences were observed in the frequency of adverse events. Conversely, because hospital care was not standardized, treatment imbalances between trial groups might have attenuated the survival benefit from amiodarone or lidocaine. However, the trial was randomized and blinded throughout, and the frequency of coronary catheterization, therapeutic hypothermia, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments did not differ significantly across trial groups.\n\n【58】The effectiveness of active treatment could also depend on physiological conditions, timing, and patient characteristics. We observed an interaction of treatment with the witnessed status of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which is often taken as a surrogate for early recognition of cardiac arrest, a short interval between the patient’s collapse from cardiac arrest and the initiation of treatment, and a greater likelihood of therapeutic responsiveness. Though prespecified, this subgroup analysis was performed in the context of an insignificant difference for the overall analysis, and the P value for heterogeneity in this subgroup analysis was not adjusted for the number of subgroup comparisons. Nonetheless, the suggestion that survival was improved by drug treatment in patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, without evidence of harm in those with unwitnessed arrest, merits thoughtful consideration.\n\n【59】Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered. If amiodarone has a true treatment effect of 3 percentage points, approximately 9000 patients across the three trial groups would be needed to establish this difference in outcome with 90% power. Though seemingly small, a confirmed overall difference of 3 percentage points in survival with drug therapy would mean that 1800 additional lives could be saved each year in North America alone after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【60】Several limitations of this trial should be considered. Selection bias could have influenced trial enrollment. However, reasons for nonenrollment were systematically tracked, and questionable instances of exclusion were numerically small. The trial tested only one administration strategy without active-treatment crossover; other strategies may produce different results. Last, enrollment of patients whose condition at randomization afforded little or no chance of survival irrespective of treatment may have diluted the presence of a more robust treatment effect in others, resulting in a smaller overall benefit than had eligibility been more selective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this randomized trial, we found that overall neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) was supported by the NHLBI through a series of cooperative agreements with nine regional clinical centers (spanning 10 North American communities) and one data coordinating center (5U01 HL077863, with the University of Washington Data Coordinating Center; HL077866, with the Medical College of Wisconsin; HL077867, with the University of Washington; HL077871, with the University of Pittsburgh; HL077872, with St. Michael’s Hospital; HL077873, with Oregon Health and Science University; HL077881, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham; HL077885, with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; HL077887, with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; and HL077908, with the University of California San Diego).

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n【24】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Figure 2.

Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother (for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 ), not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n【24】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother (for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 ), not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1.  </mark>Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother (for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 ), not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1.  </mark>Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n<mark>【28】Figure 2. </mark> Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother (for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 ), not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1.  </mark>Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n<mark>【28】Figure 2. </mark> Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n<mark>【32】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother (for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 ), not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1.  </mark>Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n<mark>【28】Figure 2. </mark> Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n<mark>【32】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother <mark>(for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 )</mark>, not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 ). Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

The prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of diabetes with this mutation are largely undefined.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We studied 55 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), 100 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and a family history of diabetes (group 3), and 5 patients with diabetes and deafness (group 4) for the mutation. We also studied the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes in 39 patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We identified 16 unrelated patients with diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation: 3 patients from group 1 (6 percent), 2 patients from group 3 (2 percent), 3 patients from group 4 (60 percent), and 8 patients from group 5 (21 percent). We also identified 16 additional subjects who had diabetes and the mutation among 42 relatives of the patients with diabetes and the mutation in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 20 affected subjects among the 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Diabetes cosegregated with the mutation in a fashion consistent with maternal transmission, was frequently (in 61 percent of cases) associated with sensory hearing loss, and was generally accompanied by impaired insulin secretion.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Diabetes mellitus associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine transfer RNA represents a subtype of diabetes found in both patients with IDDM and patients with NIDDM in Japan.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic disorders, affecting as many as 5 to 10 percent of persons in both Japan and Western countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . Both types of diabetes mellitus -- insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) -- are heterogeneous disorders, and several mechanisms have been implicated in their causes. These include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells in IDDM and mutations in the insulin gene, the insulin-receptor gene, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> a gene linked to the adenosine deaminase gene on chromosome 20, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the glucokinase gene 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> in NIDDM. Although defects in both glucose-induced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity are generally thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NIDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> many patients with NIDDM in Japan have decreased insulin responses to glucose even during the preclinical period 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ; however, the prevalence of mutations in the glucokinase gene appears to be low 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . Mitochondrial genes are plausible causative agents of both IDDM and NIDDM, since it has been suggested that oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria has a crucial role in the secretion of insulin by pancreatic β cells in response to glucose and other nutrients 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . Normal mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule of 16,569 base pairs (bp) that contains 37 genes encoding 22 types of transfer RNA (tRNA), 2 types of ribosomal RNA, and 13 enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【12】Recently, several case reports 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-15 </a></sup></u> suggested that mutations in mitochondrial DNA, especially one involving the substitution of guanine for adenine (A-to-G) at position 3243 of leucine tRNA, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> may cause diabetes and deafness. This mutation occurs within the mitochondrial DNA binding site for a protein factor that promotes the termination of transcription at the boundary between the 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA Leu(UUR) genes. This mutation appears to interfere not only with the synthesis of tRNA Leu(UUR) but also with the binding of the transcription termination factor, thereby causing defects in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> . The prevalence, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiologic process of diabetes associated with the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified 22 families (52 patients) with the mutation and diabetes and examined the clinical features of this subtype of diabetes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Families\n--------\n\n【15】We studied 55 patients with IDDM and a history of diabetes (either IDDM or NIDDM) in first-degree relatives (group 1), 85 patients with IDDM and no family history of diabetes (group 2), and 100 patients with NIDDM and a history of diabetes in first-degree relatives (group 3) 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> . The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Institute for Diabetes Care and Research of the Asahi Life Foundation. Five patients with diabetes and hearing loss (three of whom had a family history of these problems) were referred to us for testing for the mutation (group 4). The 245 patients were all unrelated. We studied 42 relatives of the patients in the four groups who were found to have the mutation. We also studied 39 unrelated patients with a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) who were known to have the mutation and 127 of their relatives (group 5). Questionnaires or direct examination of the patients and their relatives was used to ascertain the presence of diabetes, the type of diabetes, the treatment regimen, and insulin secretory capacity, as well as to determine whether associated symptoms such as sensory hearing loss, muscle weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and mental retardation were present. The diagnosis of diabetes in these subjects was based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and ketosis-prone patients were defined as having clinical IDDM. The study was approved by the appropriate institutional review committees, and all subjects gave informed consent.\n\n【16】Molecular Studies\n-----------------\n\n【17】DNA was prepared from peripheral-blood leukocytes. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were amplified with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer was 5'AGGACAAGAGAAATAAGGCC3', covering positions 3130 to 3149, and the reverse primer was 5'CACGTTGGGGCCTTTGCGTA3', covering positions 3423 through 3404 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> . The resultant 294-bp fragments of mitochondrial DNA (3130 through 3423) were digested with a restriction endonuclease, ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. The PCR products were either sequenced directly 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> or subcloned into a plasmid vector and then sequenced.\n\n【18】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Euglycemic-Clamp Studies\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Insulin secretory capacity was evaluated by measurements of plasma insulin or C-peptide concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test or after the intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg) or by measurements of C peptide in a 24-hour urine sample. Peripheral uptake of glucose (mainly by skeletal muscle) was measured in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM, both of whom had the mutation, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】Continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test, and categorical variables were compared by chi-square analysis. All P values are two-tailed.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Identification of the Mutation\n------------------------------\n\n<mark>【24】Figure 1.  </mark>Figure 1. Identification of an A-to-G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【25】Panel A shows the sequences of mitochondrial DNA surrounding the mutated site in mitochondrial tRNA Leu(UUR) from Subject II-2 in Family 2. Fragments of mitochondrial DNA were amplified by PCR, and the products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced as described in the Methods section. In Panel B, 294-bp fragments (3130 through 3423) of mitochondrial DNA encompassing position 3243 were obtained from three subjects and prepared by PCR, digested with ApaI, and analyzed by agarose-gel (0.8 percent) electrophoresis. Affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Families with Diabetes Mellitus Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【26】We identified an A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA in 16 of the patients from groups 1 through 5 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Figure 1A shows the sequences encompassing position 3243 in normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA from one patient (Subject II-2 in Family 2). This means that the patient is heteroplasmic for the mutation. This A-to-G transition created a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease ApaI (GAGCCC to GGGCCC). Digestion of mitochondrial DNA with ApaI revealed that affected subjects are heteroplasmic for the mutation 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. This mutation was not found in 200 normal subjects with no family history of diabetes. In group 1, 3 of the 55 patients (6 percent) had this mutation; in group 2, 0 of 85 patients; in group 3, 2 of 100 patients (2 percent); in group 4, 3 of 5 patients (60 percent); and in group 5, 8 of 39 patients (21 percent). We identified 16 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 42 relatives of the patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 20 additional subjects with diabetes and the mutation in our study of 127 relatives of the patients in group 5. Thus, we identified 52 patients with diabetes mellitus in 22 unrelated families who had the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】Representative Families with Diabetes and the Mutation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n<mark>【28】Figure 2. </mark> Figure 2. Pedigrees of Nine Families with Diabetes Mellitus and the A to G Mutation at Position 3243.\n\n【29】Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a history of diabetes and the mutation but not the MELAS syndrome. Families 10, 12, and 13 have a history of diabetes and the mutation and have a proband with the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【30】The pedigrees of nine representative families with diabetes and the mutation are shown in Figure 2 . A preliminary description of Family 1 has been reported 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【31】### _Family 2_\n\n<mark>【32】Table 2.  </mark>Table 2. Insulin Secretory Capacity of Pancreatic β Cells in Patients with Diabetes Associated with the A to G Mutation at Position 3243 of Mitochondrial Leucine tRNA.\n\n【33】The proband in Family 2 (Subject II-2) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He was given a diagnosis of diabetes after an oral glucose-tolerance test at the age of 13 years, and he started taking insulin at the age of 17, when he became prone to ketoacidosis. His insulin secretory capacity was considered to be low on the basis of low urinary C-peptide excretion (7 to 13 μg per day \\[2.3 to 4.3 nmol per day\\]) and a low plasma C-peptide response to glucagon injection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Although he was given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> a test for islet-cell antibodies was negative. He began to have sensory hearing loss at the age of 29 years. His mother (Subject I-2), sister (Subject II-1), and uncle (Subject I-3) had the mutation and insulin-requiring NIDDM with low insulin secretion 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and sensory hearing loss. The proband's father (Subject I-1), who did not have the mutation, had normal glucose tolerance.\n\n【34】### _Family 3_\n\n【35】The proband in Family 3 (Subject II-2) was also identified during screening for the mutation in group 1. He had been prone to ketosis since the age of 24 years unless treated with insulin and had recently had mild sensory hearing loss. His urinary C-peptide excretion was low (19 μg per day \\[6.3 nmol per day\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. His mother (Subject I-2), who also had the mutation, had NIDDM and was being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent but did not have a hearing loss. Neither of his sons (Subjects III-1 and III-2) had the mutation or diabetes.\n\n【36】### _Family 5_\n\n【37】The proband in Family 5 (Subject III-1) was identified during screening for the mutation in group 3. She was given a diagnosis of NIDDM at the age of 36 years and was treated with an oral hypoglycemic agent until the age of 44, when she started taking insulin. She had no hearing loss. Her insulin secretory capacity was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Her mother (Subject II-3), two uncles (Subjects II-1 and II-5), and grandmother (Subject I-2) had diabetes, and her mother and one of her uncles had sensory hearing loss.\n\n【38】### _Family 10_\n\n【39】The proband in Family 10 (Subject II-2) had the MELAS syndrome with the mutation (group 5) but did not have diabetes. His mother (Subject I-2) and sister (Subject II-1) had the mutation and diabetes and were being treated with insulin. Neither had the MELAS syndrome, but both had sensory hearing loss and short stature.\n\n【40】### _Family 13_\n\n【41】The proband in Family 13 (Subject III-1) had the MELAS syndrome and the mutation (group 5) but not diabetes. His mother (Subject II-3) and his aunt (Subject II-1) had insulin-requiring NIDDM, and his mother also had sensory hearing loss. The proband's grandmother (Subject I-2) had NIDDM. The offspring (Subject II-4) of the proband's grandmother with a different partner (Subject I-3) also had insulin-requiring NIDDM. None of the family members except the proband had the MELAS syndrome.\n\n【42】Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In these families, diabetes is apparently transmitted maternally. Thus, diabetes and the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 were transmitted by the mother <mark>(for example, see Families 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, and 13 in Figure 2 )</mark>, not by the father. The men with diabetes and the mutation transmitted neither diabetes nor the mutation to their offspring<mark> (for example, see Families 3 and 12 in Figure 2 )</mark>. Twenty-seven of the 52 patients with diabetes and the mutation (52 percent) were treated with insulin. Among 44 patients with diabetes but not the MELAS syndrome, 24 (55 percent) were treated with insulin. Before the identification of the mutation, patients with diabetes and the mutation were often given a diagnosis of IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM on the basis of the development of ketoacidosis unless insulin was given and their endogenous insulin secretory capacity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Some of these patients were given a diagnosis of slowly progressive IDDM 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> because there was a lag (2 to 20 years) between the diagnosis of diabetes and the initiation of insulin therapy. However, tests for islet-cell antibodies were not positive in any of the four patients with IDDM with the mutation who were tested 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Thirty-three of the 52 patients with diabetes (63 percent), including 27 of 44 patients with diabetes who did not have the MELAS syndrome, had hearing loss. The hearing loss often developed after the onset of diabetes. However, only the probands of the families with a history of the MELAS syndrome had other neuromuscular symptoms.\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Diabetes and the Mutation but Not the MELAS Syndrome, Patients with IDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation, and Patients with NIDDM and a Family History of Diabetes but Not the Mutation.\n\n【45】We compared the clinical characteristics of the 44 patients with diabetes associated with the mutation who did not have the MELAS syndrome with those of the 52 patients with IDDM in group 1 without the mutation and the 98 patients with NIDDM in group 3 without the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. As compared with the patients in group 1 who had diabetes without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a hearing loss and a mother with diabetes and less likely to have a father with diabetes. Similarly, as compared with the patients in group 3 with NIDDM without the mutation, the patients with diabetes and the mutation were more likely to have a mother with diabetes, were younger at the time of diagnosis, had a lower frequency of obesity in the past, had a higher frequency of treatment with insulin, and had a higher frequency of hearing loss.\n\n【46】Insulin Secretory Capacity and Peripheral Insulin Resistance\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Insulin secretory capacity was studied in 13 families (19 patients) with the mutation 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Urinary C-peptide excretion in these patients was low (mean ±SD, 24 ±15 μg per day \\[7.9 ±5.0 nmol per day\\]; normal range, 60 to 120 μg per day \\[20 to 40 nmol per day\\]). In three patients studied repeatedly, urinary C-peptide excretion progressively decreased (data not shown). The plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations were subnormal after the administration of glucagon, although the response was not abolished.\n\n【48】Euglycemic-clamp studies were performed in one patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM from Family 1 <sup><a>15 </a></sup> . Peripheral uptake of glucose was not significantly impaired in these patients (9.9 mg per kilogram of body weight per minute \\[55.0 μmol per kilogram per minute\\] and 8.6 mg per kilogram per minute \\[47.7 μmol per kilogram per minute\\], respectively; normal value, 10.5 ±4.4 mg per kilogram per minute \\[58.3 ±24.4 μmol per kilogram per minute\\]).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】We found that the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 in mitochondrial DNA may be associated with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. The mutation appears to be the cause of diabetes in affected families, since the disease is inherited maternally and cosegregated with the mutation. Patients with diabetes and the mutation may have sensory hearing loss, which often develops after the onset of diabetes, and they are younger at diagnosis, have a lower frequency of obesity in the past, and more often need insulin than diabetic patients without the mutation.\n\n【51】Patients with diabetes and the mutation have impaired insulin secretion, and this impairment probably has an important role in the development of diabetes. One patient with IDDM and one patient with NIDDM who had the mutation had apparently normal glucose uptake. In findings consistent with our results, Reardon et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> described two patients with the mutation who had poor insulin secretory responses to glucose. In contrast, van den Ouweland et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> reported that insulin secretion was apparently normal in affected patients, suggesting the pathogenic importance of peripheral insulin resistance. It is likely that the mechanisms whereby the mutation causes diabetes are heterogeneous.\n\n【52】How might this mutation cause dysfunction of pancreatic β cells? Since oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria may have an important role in insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> mutant mitochondrial DNA in the pancreatic β cells may interfere with the normal process of insulin secretion.\n\n【53】The tRNA Leu(UUR) mutation at position 3243 was originally identified in heteroplasmic form in patients with the MELAS syndrome 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> . It is noteworthy that in the families we studied some of the patients who had the mutation had diabetes (and deafness) without the MELAS syndrome and other family members with the mutation had the MELAS syndrome without diabetes (Families 10, 12, and 13). In this respect, the degree of heteroplasmy is reported to differ in various tissues and various persons (even in a single family) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the fraction of abnormal mitochondria with the mutation is relatively high in pancreatic β cells, liver cells, muscle cells, or some combination of these cells in patients with diabetes and in nerve and muscle cells in patients with the MELAS syndrome. It is also possible that patients with IDDM or insulin-deficient NIDDM have a higher fraction of abnormal mitochondria in pancreatic β cells than patients with NIDDM with apparently normal insulin secretion, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> even though they share the same mutation.\n\n【54】Although IDDM is generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder, the mutation in the mitochondrial gene may represent another cause of IDDM. Moreover, although IDDM and NIDDM were thought to be distinct clinical entities, our results suggest that a common diabetogenic gene such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 of mitochondrial leucine tRNA may cause either IDDM or NIDDM, indicating overlap between these two entities.\n\n【55】In summary, we have described a subtype of diabetes associated with a mutation in mitochondrial DNA in patients with either IDDM or NIDDM in Japan. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA such as the A-to-G mutation at position 3243 should be considered as a cause of (slowly progressive) IDDM and insulin-deficient NIDDM, especially in patients with sensory hearing loss or a mother with diabetes.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International (192125), a grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and a Diabetes Research Grant from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company (to Dr. T.

This infusion resulted in a 45 to 55 per cent decline in plasma insulin and glucagon. Plasma glucose initially fell by 20 to 25 mg per 100 ml, but later rose despite continuing hypoglucagonemia. After five hours, plasma glucose concentration was 45 to 50 mg per 100 ml higher than that observed with saline infusion (P<0.001). The degree of hyperglycemia and plasma insulin levels correlated inversely at completion of the infusion (P<0.01). In addition, somatostatin resulted in a fivefold increase in β-hydroxybutyrate and a 40 to 45 per cent rise in branched-chain amino acids (P<0.005).\n\n【2】Our findings suggest that glucagon is not essential for the development and maintenance of fasting hyperglycemia. Furthermore, accentuation by somatostatin of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and hyperaminoacidemia in maturity-onset diabetes argues against its use in patients with residual insulin secretion. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 297:181–183, 1977)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 10:29:39", "endTime": "2024/08/12 10:29:46", "cost": 6.955}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:23", "update_time": "2024-08-11 18:29:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-11 18:29:30"}

He died seven days later and post-mortem examination showed lymphocytic infiltration of the islets of Langerhans and necrosis of beta cells. Inoculation of mouse, monkey and human cell cultures with homogenates from the patient's pancreas led to isolation of a virus. Serologic studies revealed a rise in the titer of neutralizing antibody to this virus from less than 4 on the second hospital day to 32 on the day of death. Neutralization data showed that the virus was related to a diabetogenic variant derived from Coxsackievirus B4. Inoculation of mice with the human isolate produced hyperglycemia, inflammatory cells in the islets of Langerhans and beta-cell necrosis. Staining of mouse pancreatic sections with fluorescein-labeled antiviral antibody revealed viral antigens in beta cells. Both the clinical picture and animal studies suggested that the patient's diabetes was virus induced. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 300:1173–1179, 1979)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 17:46:38", "endTime": "2024/08/12 17:58:47", "cost": 728.791}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:22", "update_time": "2024-08-12 01:58:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 01:46:35"}

All patients were hospitalized, received blood transfusions as needed, and received a purge to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. Colonoscopy was performed within 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia. Among the first 73 patients, those with continued diverticular bleeding underwent hemicolectomy. For the subsequent 48 patients, those requiring treatment received therapy, such as epinephrine injections or bipolar coagulation, through the colonoscope.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the first 73 patients, 17 (23 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 6, nonbleeding visible vessels in 4, and adherent clots in 7). Nine of the 17 had additional bleeding after colonoscopy, and 6 of these required hemicolectomy. Of the subsequent 48 patients, 10 (21 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 5, nonbleeding visible vessels in 2, and adherent clots in 3). An additional 14 patients in this group (29 percent) were presumed to have diverticular bleeding because although they had no stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage, no other source of bleeding was identified. The other 24 patients (50 percent) had other identified sources of bleeding. All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage were treated endoscopically; none had recurrent bleeding or required surgery.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis, at least one fifth have definite diverticular hemorrhage. Colonoscopic treatment of such patients with epinephrine injections, bipolar coagulation, or both may prevent recurrent bleeding and decrease the need for surgery.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Identification of the origin of the bleeding, including diverticula, by endoscopy is facilitated by cleansing the colon with a purge. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> For more than a decade, the stigmata of hemorrhage on endoscopy, such as active bleeding or adherent clots, have been used to identify the site of bleeding and determine the risk of renewed bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal ulcer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> However, most endoscopists do not perform urgent colonoscopy to identify stigmata of bleeding from lower gastrointestinal lesions, such as diverticula. Rather, they perform elective colonoscopy (when the patient may not be bleeding).\n\n【12】There have been case reports of treatment with colonoscopy for diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-9 </a></sup></u> Johnston and Sones described four patients who were treated with an endoscopic heater probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Three of the patients had active bleeding, and one had a sentinel clot in a diverticulum. Kim and Marcon reported the successful treatment of active diverticular hemorrhage with injection of epinephrine in one patient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Savides and Jensen described three patients with severe, recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding in whom nonbleeding visible vessels were successfully treated with bipolar coagulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Hokama et al. described three patients with diverticular bleeding that was controlled by an endoscopic hemoclip. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Neither complications nor recurrent bleeding in the short or long term was reported in these series. We evaluated the use of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe diverticular hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Design of the Study\n--------------------------------\n\n【15】In two sequential studies of urgent colonoscopy, we prospectively studied 121 patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis. The studies were approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers (University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System), and all patients gave written informed consent. Medical management consisted of hospitalization, monitoring, and resuscitation in intensive care or telemetry units. Anticoagulants and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including aspirin, were discontinued before colonoscopy. Patients also received transfusions of red cells for severe anemia and blood products to correct any coagulopathy before they underwent urgent colonoscopy. Only patients who had evidence of diverticulosis on colonoscopy were enrolled in the study; all other patients with hematochezia were excluded.\n\n【16】A team of intensivists, internists, and general surgeons managed the treatment of all patients in consultation with gastroenterologists. All patients received a sulfate purge (Golytely, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass., or Colyte, Schwarz Pharmaceuticals, Milwaukee), either orally (in the case of 67 percent of patients) or by nasogastric tube (in the case of 33 percent) to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The procedure usually required 5 to 6 liters of purge and three to four hours before the colon was clean. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Urgent colonoscopy was defined as colonoscopy performed at the bedside 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia and within 1 hour after clearance of stool, blood, and clots, as documented by a physician.\n\n【17】Definition of Diverticular Hemorrhage\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】A definite diagnosis of diverticulosis as the source of bleeding required the finding of one of the following after vigorous irrigation of diverticula: active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Two other types of diverticulosis were defined: incidental diverticulosis, in which diverticulosis was present but the bleeding originated from another lesion or lesions, and presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, in which diverticula had no evidence of bleeding but no other major colonic lesions or bleeding sites were identified on enteroscopy.\n\n【19】Patients Treated Medically and Surgically\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【20】The first study was conducted from June 1986 to June 1992 and included 73 consecutive patients with severe hematochezia (for four or more hours after hospitalization, as documented by a physician or nurse) and diverticulosis. Seventeen patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of colonoscopic findings of signs of hemorrhage and were treated medically. Once the hematochezia cleared, the diets of all patients were changed from liquids to solids as tolerated. The patients were observed in the hospital in case bleeding recurred. If bleeding continued or recurred, the patient received transfusions. In the event of severe bleeding, as evidenced by further hematochezia after colonoscopy, and if the patient had already received at least 3 units of packed red cells in addition to an initial transfusion for resuscitation, emergency hemicolectomy was performed.\n\n【21】Patients Treated Medically and Colonoscopically\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The second prospective study was conducted from June 1994 to December 1998 and included 48 consecutive patients with hematochezia and diverticulosis. Ten patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of signs of hemorrhage and were treated by colonoscopy. Medical treatment was also continued. Colonoscopic treatments were standardized among investigators on the basis of our previous laboratory studies of coagulation of the right side of the colon 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> and a pilot study in patients with diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> During the procedure the patients underwent conscious sedation.\n\n【23】In patients with active bleeding, 1- or 2-ml aliquots of epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) were injected in four quadrants to control the bleeding (in the case of shallow, broad-based diverticula) or to close the mouth of the diverticulum by tamponade (in the case of narrow-necked or deep diverticula). Nonbleeding visible vessels were treated by bipolar coagulation (Gold probe, Microvasive, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass.) with 10 to 15 W of power, moderate appositional pressure directly on the vessel, and one-second pulses until good coagulation and flattening of the vessel were achieved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Nonbleeding adherent clots were injected with epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) in four quadrants around the pedicle of the clot, and the clot was shaved down to 3 to 4 mm above the attachment with a polypectomy snare by cutting it off without coagulation and without pulling the clot off its attachment. Then the underlying stigmata (usually a nonbleeding visible vessel) was coagulated with a bipolar probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> For future identification in the event of repeated colonoscopy or surgical procedure, the mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum was labeled with India ink. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After recovery from sedation, patients were given full liquid diets for 24 hours and then switched to regular diets as tolerated. The patients were encouraged to move around after colonoscopy, unless bleeding recurred or they were being monitored by telemetry.\n\n【25】Long-Term Medical Management\n----------------------------\n\n【26】After being discharged from the hospital, all patients with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage followed high-fiber diets with supplemental psyllium (Metamucil, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, or Citrucel, SKB, Pittsburgh), took analgesics other than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as necessary, and were cautioned not to take any over-the-counter or prescription medications that might cause or aggravate gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants. They were also instructed to avoid eating popcorn, nuts with shells, and foods that contained small, hard seeds (such as sesame and caraway) and to use stool softeners and other over-the-counter medications for constipation. Residual iron-deficiency anemia was treated with iron supplements and foods high in iron content. These long-term management recommendations were reinforced at each visit to the gastroenterology clinic.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Chi-square tests were used to compare data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P values are two-tailed.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Table 1.  Table 1. Prevalence of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Bleeding from Other Sites in Patients with Severe Hematochezia and Diverticulosis.\n\n【31】In the first study, in which patients received medical and surgical treatment, 17 of the 73 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (23 percent) had signs of diverticular hemorrhage. The other 56 (77 percent) had incidental diverticulosis, because a site of bleeding other than a diverticulum was identified and treated 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the second study, in which patients received medical and colonoscopic treatment, 10 of 48 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (21 percent) had definite diverticular hemorrhage, 14 (29 percent) had presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, and 24 (50 percent) had incidental diverticulosis. Among the 24 patients in the second study with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, 21 percent had active bleeding, 8 percent had nonbleeding visible vessels, 12 percent had adherent clots, and 58 percent had no signs.\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Clinical and Endoscopic Findings in 27 Patients with Definite Diverticular Hemorrhage.\n\n【33】A total of 27 patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage: 17 in the first study and 10 in the second study 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The mean (±SE) ages in the two groups were similar: 66±3 years in the first group and 67±4 years in the second. All these patients had one or more coexisting conditions. Recent use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was more common among patients in the second study than in the first study (30 percent vs. 18 percent), but the difference was not significant. The number of units of packed red cells transfused for resuscitation before colonoscopy was similar in the groups.\n\n【34】We diagnosed active bleeding in six of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and five of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment. We found nonbleeding visible vessels in four of the patients treated medically and surgically and two of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment; such vessels were usually seen at the neck (lip) of the diverticulum. We found adherent clots in seven of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and three of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment.\n\n【35】Table 3. Table 3. Outcome of Treatment for Diverticular Hemorrhage. Table 4.  Table 4. Relation between Stigmata of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Recurrent Bleeding in Patients Who Received Medical and Surgical Treatment.\n\n【36】After urgent colonoscopy, 9 of the 17 patients treated medically and surgically had recurrent or persistent bleeding severe enough to require additional transfusions 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Bleeding stopped in three of these nine patients after medical treatment, including transfusions of 2 or fewer units of packed red cells. However, severe bleeding continued in six, and emergency hemicolectomy was performed. Two of the six patients had complications after surgery. Table 4 shows the relation between the stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage and the incidence of recurrent bleeding in patients who received medical and surgical treatment.\n\n【37】All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the second study were treated endoscopically. None had recurrent bleeding or complications or required further red-cell transfusions or surgery 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. In this group of patients, the median time from colonoscopy to discharge was two days, as compared with five days for the 17 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the group treated medically and surgically.\n\n【38】During follow-up, no patient with definite diverticular hemorrhage had late recurrent bleeding (more than 30 days after discharge) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The median duration of follow-up was 36 months in the group treated medically and surgically (range, 24 to 54) and 30 months in the group treated medically and colonoscopically (range, 18 to 49). Bleeding recurred in one patient (who was taking warfarin) among those with presumptive diverticular hemorrhage in the second study. The median follow-up in this subgroup was 23 months (range, 5 to 64).\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】Before the introduction of colonoscopy, diverticulosis was thought to be the most frequent cause of severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding in older people, particularly in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage was most often based on the results of barium enema, findings at surgery, or a finding of extensive nonbleeding diverticulosis. In several studies, urgent colonoscopy after thorough removal of blood and stool from the colon indicated that diverticular hemorrhage was the second most common diagnosis, after colonic angioma, among elderly patients who were hospitalized because of very severe ongoing hematochezia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> Improvements in endoscopic technology have made it possible for gastroenterologists not only to diagnose sources of bleeding accurately but also to achieve hemostasis at diverticula with active bleeding, visible vessels, and adherent clots and other bleeding sites. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,4-10</a></sup></u>\n\n【41】In our paired prospective studies, we used major stigmata of hemorrhage during urgent colonoscopy to identify the bleeding site, provide a prognostic guide, and focus colonoscopic therapy. Among patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia, 23 percent of those in the first study and 21 percent of those in the second study had definite stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. However, when we excluded the 50 percent of patients with incidental diverticulosis in the second study (i.e., those who had another known site of gastrointestinal hemorrhage), we found the following prevalence of stigmata among patients with endoscopically documented definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage: active bleeding, 21 percent; nonbleeding visible vessels, 8 percent; adherent clots, 12 percent; and no stigmata, 58 percent.\n\n【42】Unlike the case with hemorrhage from ulcer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,16-19 </a></sup></u> there are few data on the frequency of early recurrent bleeding after the medical treatment of diverticular hemorrhage. In our first study, 53 percent of the patients who were treated medically but not endoscopically had additional bleeding, requiring transfusions of packed red cells, and 35 percent had recurrent or continued bleeding severe enough to require emergency colectomy. The percentage of patients who required additional transfusions and the percentage who required surgery were higher among those with active bleeding (67 percent and 50 percent, respectively) than among those with nonbleeding visible vessels (50 percent and 25 percent, respectively) or adherent clots (43 percent and 29 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. These rates of recurrent bleeding are similar to those reported for patients with peptic ulcers and similar stigmata of recent hemorrhage who were treated medically. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【43】The colonoscopic treatments used for hemostasis differed depending on the stigmata of hemorrhage and were based on our experience with endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcers with the same signs of hemorrhage, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,16 </a></sup></u> prior laboratory work, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and a recent pilot study of the treatment of nonbleeding visible vessels in diverticula. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Active bleeding or adherent clots were first treated with an epinephrine injection, whereas nonbleeding visible vessels were coagulated, without an epinephrine injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Bipolar probes were chosen because of their excellent efficacy and good safety. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> None of the patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage who underwent colonoscopic treatment required surgery, and none had complications after colonoscopic diagnosis or treatment. However, we studied only a small number of patients, and the treatments were not randomized. Thus, larger studies are warranted to confirm our results.\n\n【44】The rate of recurrence of diverticular hemorrhage in retrospective surgical series has varied, but it was as high as 50 percent in studies in 1957 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> and 1972 <sup><a>18 </a></sup> and 38.4 percent in a more recent retrospective review. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> High rates of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage are often used as the rationale for early surgery to prevent a recurrence when the patient is older and presumably at higher risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> On the basis of our results, a different approach should be considered, consisting of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis by a skilled and experienced endoscopist to identify the type of diverticular hemorrhage — definite, presumptive, or incidental — with endoscopic hemostasis and India-ink tattooing of the diverticulum at the site of the lesion in case severe hematochezia recurs; avoidance of the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants; and careful long-term medical and dietary management. The last recommendation is unproved, and further studies of the secondary prevention of diverticular hemorrhage are warranted. In our opinion, surgery should be reserved for patients in whom definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage has been diagnosed by urgent colonoscopy after vigorous purging of the colon and for whom medical and colonoscopic treatment has failed or resulted in complications.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1 33273) and the Human Studies Core of the National Institutes of Health (41301).</u>\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Ulcer Research and Education (CURE) Hemostasis Research Unit, Digestive Disease Research Center, Division of Digestive Diseases, University of California at Los Angeles Center for the Health Sciences, and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles.</u>\n\n【49】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Jensen at CURE, Digestive Disease Research Center, VA GLAHS, 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Bldg. 115, Rm. 318, Los Angeles, CA 90073-1003, or at djensen@med1.medsch.ucla.edu .</u>\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>References _(19)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

All patients were hospitalized, received blood transfusions as needed, and received a purge to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. Colonoscopy was performed within 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia. Among the first 73 patients, those with continued diverticular bleeding underwent hemicolectomy. For the subsequent 48 patients, those requiring treatment received therapy, such as epinephrine injections or bipolar coagulation, through the colonoscope.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the first 73 patients, 17 (23 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 6, nonbleeding visible vessels in 4, and adherent clots in 7). Nine of the 17 had additional bleeding after colonoscopy, and 6 of these required hemicolectomy. Of the subsequent 48 patients, 10 (21 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 5, nonbleeding visible vessels in 2, and adherent clots in 3). An additional 14 patients in this group (29 percent) were presumed to have diverticular bleeding because although they had no stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage, no other source of bleeding was identified. The other 24 patients (50 percent) had other identified sources of bleeding. All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage were treated endoscopically; none had recurrent bleeding or required surgery.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis, at least one fifth have definite diverticular hemorrhage. Colonoscopic treatment of such patients with epinephrine injections, bipolar coagulation, or both may prevent recurrent bleeding and decrease the need for surgery.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Identification of the origin of the bleeding, including diverticula, by endoscopy is facilitated by cleansing the colon with a purge. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> For more than a decade, the stigmata of hemorrhage on endoscopy, such as active bleeding or adherent clots, have been used to identify the site of bleeding and determine the risk of renewed bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal ulcer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> However, most endoscopists do not perform urgent colonoscopy to identify stigmata of bleeding from lower gastrointestinal lesions, such as diverticula. Rather, they perform elective colonoscopy (when the patient may not be bleeding).\n\n【12】There have been case reports of treatment with colonoscopy for diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-9 </a></sup></u> Johnston and Sones described four patients who were treated with an endoscopic heater probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Three of the patients had active bleeding, and one had a sentinel clot in a diverticulum. Kim and Marcon reported the successful treatment of active diverticular hemorrhage with injection of epinephrine in one patient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Savides and Jensen described three patients with severe, recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding in whom nonbleeding visible vessels were successfully treated with bipolar coagulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Hokama et al. described three patients with diverticular bleeding that was controlled by an endoscopic hemoclip. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Neither complications nor recurrent bleeding in the short or long term was reported in these series. We evaluated the use of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe diverticular hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Design of the Study\n--------------------------------\n\n【15】In two sequential studies of urgent colonoscopy, we prospectively studied 121 patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis. The studies were approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers (University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System), and all patients gave written informed consent. Medical management consisted of hospitalization, monitoring, and resuscitation in intensive care or telemetry units. Anticoagulants and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including aspirin, were discontinued before colonoscopy. Patients also received transfusions of red cells for severe anemia and blood products to correct any coagulopathy before they underwent urgent colonoscopy. Only patients who had evidence of diverticulosis on colonoscopy were enrolled in the study; all other patients with hematochezia were excluded.\n\n【16】A team of intensivists, internists, and general surgeons managed the treatment of all patients in consultation with gastroenterologists. All patients received a sulfate purge (Golytely, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass., or Colyte, Schwarz Pharmaceuticals, Milwaukee), either orally (in the case of 67 percent of patients) or by nasogastric tube (in the case of 33 percent) to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The procedure usually required 5 to 6 liters of purge and three to four hours before the colon was clean. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Urgent colonoscopy was defined as colonoscopy performed at the bedside 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia and within 1 hour after clearance of stool, blood, and clots, as documented by a physician.\n\n【17】Definition of Diverticular Hemorrhage\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】A definite diagnosis of diverticulosis as the source of bleeding required the finding of one of the following after vigorous irrigation of diverticula: active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Two other types of diverticulosis were defined: incidental diverticulosis, in which diverticulosis was present but the bleeding originated from another lesion or lesions, and presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, in which diverticula had no evidence of bleeding but no other major colonic lesions or bleeding sites were identified on enteroscopy.\n\n【19】Patients Treated Medically and Surgically\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【20】The first study was conducted from June 1986 to June 1992 and included 73 consecutive patients with severe hematochezia (for four or more hours after hospitalization, as documented by a physician or nurse) and diverticulosis. Seventeen patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of colonoscopic findings of signs of hemorrhage and were treated medically. Once the hematochezia cleared, the diets of all patients were changed from liquids to solids as tolerated. The patients were observed in the hospital in case bleeding recurred. If bleeding continued or recurred, the patient received transfusions. In the event of severe bleeding, as evidenced by further hematochezia after colonoscopy, and if the patient had already received at least 3 units of packed red cells in addition to an initial transfusion for resuscitation, emergency hemicolectomy was performed.\n\n【21】Patients Treated Medically and Colonoscopically\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The second prospective study was conducted from June 1994 to December 1998 and included 48 consecutive patients with hematochezia and diverticulosis. Ten patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of signs of hemorrhage and were treated by colonoscopy. Medical treatment was also continued. Colonoscopic treatments were standardized among investigators on the basis of our previous laboratory studies of coagulation of the right side of the colon 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> and a pilot study in patients with diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> During the procedure the patients underwent conscious sedation.\n\n【23】In patients with active bleeding, 1- or 2-ml aliquots of epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) were injected in four quadrants to control the bleeding (in the case of shallow, broad-based diverticula) or to close the mouth of the diverticulum by tamponade (in the case of narrow-necked or deep diverticula). Nonbleeding visible vessels were treated by bipolar coagulation (Gold probe, Microvasive, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass.) with 10 to 15 W of power, moderate appositional pressure directly on the vessel, and one-second pulses until good coagulation and flattening of the vessel were achieved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Nonbleeding adherent clots were injected with epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) in four quadrants around the pedicle of the clot, and the clot was shaved down to 3 to 4 mm above the attachment with a polypectomy snare by cutting it off without coagulation and without pulling the clot off its attachment. Then the underlying stigmata (usually a nonbleeding visible vessel) was coagulated with a bipolar probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> For future identification in the event of repeated colonoscopy or surgical procedure, the mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum was labeled with India ink. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After recovery from sedation, patients were given full liquid diets for 24 hours and then switched to regular diets as tolerated. The patients were encouraged to move around after colonoscopy, unless bleeding recurred or they were being monitored by telemetry.\n\n【25】Long-Term Medical Management\n----------------------------\n\n【26】After being discharged from the hospital, all patients with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage followed high-fiber diets with supplemental psyllium (Metamucil, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, or Citrucel, SKB, Pittsburgh), took analgesics other than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as necessary, and were cautioned not to take any over-the-counter or prescription medications that might cause or aggravate gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants. They were also instructed to avoid eating popcorn, nuts with shells, and foods that contained small, hard seeds (such as sesame and caraway) and to use stool softeners and other over-the-counter medications for constipation. Residual iron-deficiency anemia was treated with iron supplements and foods high in iron content. These long-term management recommendations were reinforced at each visit to the gastroenterology clinic.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Chi-square tests were used to compare data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P values are two-tailed.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Table 1.  Table 1. Prevalence of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Bleeding from Other Sites in Patients with Severe Hematochezia and Diverticulosis.\n\n【31】In the first study, in which patients received medical and surgical treatment, 17 of the 73 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (23 percent) had signs of diverticular hemorrhage. The other 56 (77 percent) had incidental diverticulosis, because a site of bleeding other than a diverticulum was identified and treated 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the second study, in which patients received medical and colonoscopic treatment, 10 of 48 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (21 percent) had definite diverticular hemorrhage, 14 (29 percent) had presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, and 24 (50 percent) had incidental diverticulosis. Among the 24 patients in the second study with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, 21 percent had active bleeding, 8 percent had nonbleeding visible vessels, 12 percent had adherent clots, and 58 percent had no signs.\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Clinical and Endoscopic Findings in 27 Patients with Definite Diverticular Hemorrhage.\n\n【33】A total of 27 patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage: 17 in the first study and 10 in the second study 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The mean (±SE) ages in the two groups were similar: 66±3 years in the first group and 67±4 years in the second. All these patients had one or more coexisting conditions. Recent use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was more common among patients in the second study than in the first study (30 percent vs. 18 percent), but the difference was not significant. The number of units of packed red cells transfused for resuscitation before colonoscopy was similar in the groups.\n\n【34】We diagnosed active bleeding in six of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and five of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment. We found nonbleeding visible vessels in four of the patients treated medically and surgically and two of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment; such vessels were usually seen at the neck (lip) of the diverticulum. We found adherent clots in seven of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and three of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment.\n\n【35】Table 3. Table 3. Outcome of Treatment for Diverticular Hemorrhage. Table 4.  Table 4. Relation between Stigmata of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Recurrent Bleeding in Patients Who Received Medical and Surgical Treatment.\n\n【36】After urgent colonoscopy, 9 of the 17 patients treated medically and surgically had recurrent or persistent bleeding severe enough to require additional transfusions 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Bleeding stopped in three of these nine patients after medical treatment, including transfusions of 2 or fewer units of packed red cells. However, severe bleeding continued in six, and emergency hemicolectomy was performed. Two of the six patients had complications after surgery. Table 4 shows the relation between the stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage and the incidence of recurrent bleeding in patients who received medical and surgical treatment.\n\n【37】All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the second study were treated endoscopically. None had recurrent bleeding or complications or required further red-cell transfusions or surgery 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. In this group of patients, the median time from colonoscopy to discharge was two days, as compared with five days for the 17 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the group treated medically and surgically.\n\n【38】During follow-up, no patient with definite diverticular hemorrhage had late recurrent bleeding (more than 30 days after discharge) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The median duration of follow-up was 36 months in the group treated medically and surgically (range, 24 to 54) and 30 months in the group treated medically and colonoscopically (range, 18 to 49). Bleeding recurred in one patient (who was taking warfarin) among those with presumptive diverticular hemorrhage in the second study. The median follow-up in this subgroup was 23 months (range, 5 to 64).\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】Before the introduction of colonoscopy, diverticulosis was thought to be the most frequent cause of severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding in older people, particularly in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage was most often based on the results of barium enema, findings at surgery, or a finding of extensive nonbleeding diverticulosis. In several studies, urgent colonoscopy after thorough removal of blood and stool from the colon indicated that diverticular hemorrhage was the second most common diagnosis, after colonic angioma, among elderly patients who were hospitalized because of very severe ongoing hematochezia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> Improvements in endoscopic technology have made it possible for gastroenterologists not only to diagnose sources of bleeding accurately but also to achieve hemostasis at diverticula with active bleeding, visible vessels, and adherent clots and other bleeding sites. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,4-10</a></sup></u>\n\n【41】In our paired prospective studies, we used major stigmata of hemorrhage during urgent colonoscopy to identify the bleeding site, provide a prognostic guide, and focus colonoscopic therapy. Among patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia, 23 percent of those in the first study and 21 percent of those in the second study had definite stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. However, when we excluded the 50 percent of patients with incidental diverticulosis in the second study (i.e., those who had another known site of gastrointestinal hemorrhage), we found the following prevalence of stigmata among patients with endoscopically documented definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage: active bleeding, 21 percent; nonbleeding visible vessels, 8 percent; adherent clots, 12 percent; and no stigmata, 58 percent.\n\n【42】Unlike the case with hemorrhage from ulcer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,16-19 </a></sup></u> there are few data on the frequency of early recurrent bleeding after the medical treatment of diverticular hemorrhage. In our first study, 53 percent of the patients who were treated medically but not endoscopically had additional bleeding, requiring transfusions of packed red cells, and 35 percent had recurrent or continued bleeding severe enough to require emergency colectomy. The percentage of patients who required additional transfusions and the percentage who required surgery were higher among those with active bleeding (67 percent and 50 percent, respectively) than among those with nonbleeding visible vessels (50 percent and 25 percent, respectively) or adherent clots (43 percent and 29 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. These rates of recurrent bleeding are similar to those reported for patients with peptic ulcers and similar stigmata of recent hemorrhage who were treated medically. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【43】The colonoscopic treatments used for hemostasis differed depending on the stigmata of hemorrhage and were based on our experience with endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcers with the same signs of hemorrhage, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,16 </a></sup></u> prior laboratory work, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and a recent pilot study of the treatment of nonbleeding visible vessels in diverticula. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Active bleeding or adherent clots were first treated with an epinephrine injection, whereas nonbleeding visible vessels were coagulated, without an epinephrine injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Bipolar probes were chosen because of their excellent efficacy and good safety. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> None of the patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage who underwent colonoscopic treatment required surgery, and none had complications after colonoscopic diagnosis or treatment. However, we studied only a small number of patients, and the treatments were not randomized. Thus, larger studies are warranted to confirm our results.\n\n【44】The rate of recurrence of diverticular hemorrhage in retrospective surgical series has varied, but it was as high as 50 percent in studies in 1957 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> and 1972 <sup><a>18 </a></sup> and 38.4 percent in a more recent retrospective review. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> High rates of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage are often used as the rationale for early surgery to prevent a recurrence when the patient is older and presumably at higher risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> On the basis of our results, a different approach should be considered, consisting of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis by a skilled and experienced endoscopist to identify the type of diverticular hemorrhage — definite, presumptive, or incidental — with endoscopic hemostasis and India-ink tattooing of the diverticulum at the site of the lesion in case severe hematochezia recurs; avoidance of the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants; and careful long-term medical and dietary management. The last recommendation is unproved, and further studies of the secondary prevention of diverticular hemorrhage are warranted. In our opinion, surgery should be reserved for patients in whom definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage has been diagnosed by urgent colonoscopy after vigorous purging of the colon and for whom medical and colonoscopic treatment has failed or resulted in complications.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1 33273) and the Human Studies Core of the National Institutes of Health (41301).</u>\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Ulcer Research and Education (CURE) Hemostasis Research Unit, Digestive Disease Research Center, Division of Digestive Diseases, University of California at Los Angeles Center for the Health Sciences, and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles.</u>\n\n【49】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Jensen at CURE, Digestive Disease Research Center, VA GLAHS, 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Bldg. 115, Rm. 318, Los Angeles, CA 90073-1003, or at djensen@med1.medsch.ucla.edu .</u>\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>References _(19)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

All patients were hospitalized, received blood transfusions as needed, and received a purge to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. Colonoscopy was performed within 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia. Among the first 73 patients, those with continued diverticular bleeding underwent hemicolectomy. For the subsequent 48 patients, those requiring treatment received therapy, such as epinephrine injections or bipolar coagulation, through the colonoscope.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the first 73 patients, 17 (23 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 6, nonbleeding visible vessels in 4, and adherent clots in 7). Nine of the 17 had additional bleeding after colonoscopy, and 6 of these required hemicolectomy. Of the subsequent 48 patients, 10 (21 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 5, nonbleeding visible vessels in 2, and adherent clots in 3). An additional 14 patients in this group (29 percent) were presumed to have diverticular bleeding because although they had no stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage, no other source of bleeding was identified. The other 24 patients (50 percent) had other identified sources of bleeding. All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage were treated endoscopically; none had recurrent bleeding or required surgery.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis, at least one fifth have definite diverticular hemorrhage. Colonoscopic treatment of such patients with epinephrine injections, bipolar coagulation, or both may prevent recurrent bleeding and decrease the need for surgery.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Identification of the origin of the bleeding, including diverticula, by endoscopy is facilitated by cleansing the colon with a purge. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> For more than a decade, the stigmata of hemorrhage on endoscopy, such as active bleeding or adherent clots, have been used to identify the site of bleeding and determine the risk of renewed bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal ulcer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> However, most endoscopists do not perform urgent colonoscopy to identify stigmata of bleeding from lower gastrointestinal lesions, such as diverticula. Rather, they perform elective colonoscopy (when the patient may not be bleeding).\n\n【12】There have been case reports of treatment with colonoscopy for diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-9 </a></sup></u> Johnston and Sones described four patients who were treated with an endoscopic heater probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Three of the patients had active bleeding, and one had a sentinel clot in a diverticulum. Kim and Marcon reported the successful treatment of active diverticular hemorrhage with injection of epinephrine in one patient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Savides and Jensen described three patients with severe, recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding in whom nonbleeding visible vessels were successfully treated with bipolar coagulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Hokama et al. described three patients with diverticular bleeding that was controlled by an endoscopic hemoclip. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Neither complications nor recurrent bleeding in the short or long term was reported in these series. We evaluated the use of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe diverticular hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Design of the Study\n--------------------------------\n\n【15】In two sequential studies of urgent colonoscopy, we prospectively studied 121 patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis. The studies were approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers (University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System), and all patients gave written informed consent. Medical management consisted of hospitalization, monitoring, and resuscitation in intensive care or telemetry units. Anticoagulants and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including aspirin, were discontinued before colonoscopy. Patients also received transfusions of red cells for severe anemia and blood products to correct any coagulopathy before they underwent urgent colonoscopy. Only patients who had evidence of diverticulosis on colonoscopy were enrolled in the study; all other patients with hematochezia were excluded.\n\n【16】A team of intensivists, internists, and general surgeons managed the treatment of all patients in consultation with gastroenterologists. All patients received a sulfate purge (Golytely, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass., or Colyte, Schwarz Pharmaceuticals, Milwaukee), either orally (in the case of 67 percent of patients) or by nasogastric tube (in the case of 33 percent) to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The procedure usually required 5 to 6 liters of purge and three to four hours before the colon was clean. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Urgent colonoscopy was defined as colonoscopy performed at the bedside 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia and within 1 hour after clearance of stool, blood, and clots, as documented by a physician.\n\n【17】Definition of Diverticular Hemorrhage\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】A definite diagnosis of diverticulosis as the source of bleeding required the finding of one of the following after vigorous irrigation of diverticula: active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Two other types of diverticulosis were defined: incidental diverticulosis, in which diverticulosis was present but the bleeding originated from another lesion or lesions, and presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, in which diverticula had no evidence of bleeding but no other major colonic lesions or bleeding sites were identified on enteroscopy.\n\n【19】Patients Treated Medically and Surgically\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【20】The first study was conducted from June 1986 to June 1992 and included 73 consecutive patients with severe hematochezia (for four or more hours after hospitalization, as documented by a physician or nurse) and diverticulosis. Seventeen patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of colonoscopic findings of signs of hemorrhage and were treated medically. Once the hematochezia cleared, the diets of all patients were changed from liquids to solids as tolerated. The patients were observed in the hospital in case bleeding recurred. If bleeding continued or recurred, the patient received transfusions. In the event of severe bleeding, as evidenced by further hematochezia after colonoscopy, and if the patient had already received at least 3 units of packed red cells in addition to an initial transfusion for resuscitation, emergency hemicolectomy was performed.\n\n【21】Patients Treated Medically and Colonoscopically\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The second prospective study was conducted from June 1994 to December 1998 and included 48 consecutive patients with hematochezia and diverticulosis. Ten patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of signs of hemorrhage and were treated by colonoscopy. Medical treatment was also continued. Colonoscopic treatments were standardized among investigators on the basis of our previous laboratory studies of coagulation of the right side of the colon 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> and a pilot study in patients with diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> During the procedure the patients underwent conscious sedation.\n\n【23】In patients with active bleeding, 1- or 2-ml aliquots of epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) were injected in four quadrants to control the bleeding (in the case of shallow, broad-based diverticula) or to close the mouth of the diverticulum by tamponade (in the case of narrow-necked or deep diverticula). Nonbleeding visible vessels were treated by bipolar coagulation (Gold probe, Microvasive, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass.) with 10 to 15 W of power, moderate appositional pressure directly on the vessel, and one-second pulses until good coagulation and flattening of the vessel were achieved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Nonbleeding adherent clots were injected with epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) in four quadrants around the pedicle of the clot, and the clot was shaved down to 3 to 4 mm above the attachment with a polypectomy snare by cutting it off without coagulation and without pulling the clot off its attachment. Then the underlying stigmata (usually a nonbleeding visible vessel) was coagulated with a bipolar probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> For future identification in the event of repeated colonoscopy or surgical procedure, the mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum was labeled with India ink. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After recovery from sedation, patients were given full liquid diets for 24 hours and then switched to regular diets as tolerated. The patients were encouraged to move around after colonoscopy, unless bleeding recurred or they were being monitored by telemetry.\n\n【25】Long-Term Medical Management\n----------------------------\n\n【26】After being discharged from the hospital, all patients with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage followed high-fiber diets with supplemental psyllium (Metamucil, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, or Citrucel, SKB, Pittsburgh), took analgesics other than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as necessary, and were cautioned not to take any over-the-counter or prescription medications that might cause or aggravate gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants. They were also instructed to avoid eating popcorn, nuts with shells, and foods that contained small, hard seeds (such as sesame and caraway) and to use stool softeners and other over-the-counter medications for constipation. Residual iron-deficiency anemia was treated with iron supplements and foods high in iron content. These long-term management recommendations were reinforced at each visit to the gastroenterology clinic.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Chi-square tests were used to compare data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P values are two-tailed.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n<mark>【30】Table 1.  </mark>Table 1. Prevalence of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Bleeding from Other Sites in Patients with Severe Hematochezia and Diverticulosis.\n\n【31】In the first study, in which patients received medical and surgical treatment, 17 of the 73 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (23 percent) had signs of diverticular hemorrhage. The other 56 (77 percent) had incidental diverticulosis, because a site of bleeding other than a diverticulum was identified and treated 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the second study, in which patients received medical and colonoscopic treatment, 10 of 48 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (21 percent) had definite diverticular hemorrhage, 14 (29 percent) had presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, and 24 (50 percent) had incidental diverticulosis. Among the 24 patients in the second study with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, 21 percent had active bleeding, 8 percent had nonbleeding visible vessels, 12 percent had adherent clots, and 58 percent had no signs.\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Clinical and Endoscopic Findings in 27 Patients with Definite Diverticular Hemorrhage.\n\n【33】A total of 27 patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage: 17 in the first study and 10 in the second study 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The mean (±SE) ages in the two groups were similar: 66±3 years in the first group and 67±4 years in the second. All these patients had one or more coexisting conditions. Recent use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was more common among patients in the second study than in the first study (30 percent vs. 18 percent), but the difference was not significant. The number of units of packed red cells transfused for resuscitation before colonoscopy was similar in the groups.\n\n【34】We diagnosed active bleeding in six of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and five of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment. We found nonbleeding visible vessels in four of the patients treated medically and surgically and two of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment; such vessels were usually seen at the neck (lip) of the diverticulum. We found adherent clots in seven of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and three of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment.\n\n【35】Table 3. Table 3. Outcome of Treatment for Diverticular Hemorrhage. Table 4.  Table 4. Relation between Stigmata of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Recurrent Bleeding in Patients Who Received Medical and Surgical Treatment.\n\n【36】After urgent colonoscopy, 9 of the 17 patients treated medically and surgically had recurrent or persistent bleeding severe enough to require additional transfusions 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Bleeding stopped in three of these nine patients after medical treatment, including transfusions of 2 or fewer units of packed red cells. However, severe bleeding continued in six, and emergency hemicolectomy was performed. Two of the six patients had complications after surgery. Table 4 shows the relation between the stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage and the incidence of recurrent bleeding in patients who received medical and surgical treatment.\n\n【37】All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the second study were treated endoscopically. None had recurrent bleeding or complications or required further red-cell transfusions or surgery 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. In this group of patients, the median time from colonoscopy to discharge was two days, as compared with five days for the 17 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the group treated medically and surgically.\n\n【38】During follow-up, no patient with definite diverticular hemorrhage had late recurrent bleeding (more than 30 days after discharge) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The median duration of follow-up was 36 months in the group treated medically and surgically (range, 24 to 54) and 30 months in the group treated medically and colonoscopically (range, 18 to 49). Bleeding recurred in one patient (who was taking warfarin) among those with presumptive diverticular hemorrhage in the second study. The median follow-up in this subgroup was 23 months (range, 5 to 64).\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】Before the introduction of colonoscopy, diverticulosis was thought to be the most frequent cause of severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding in older people, particularly in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage was most often based on the results of barium enema, findings at surgery, or a finding of extensive nonbleeding diverticulosis. In several studies, urgent colonoscopy after thorough removal of blood and stool from the colon indicated that diverticular hemorrhage was the second most common diagnosis, after colonic angioma, among elderly patients who were hospitalized because of very severe ongoing hematochezia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> Improvements in endoscopic technology have made it possible for gastroenterologists not only to diagnose sources of bleeding accurately but also to achieve hemostasis at diverticula with active bleeding, visible vessels, and adherent clots and other bleeding sites. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,4-10</a></sup></u>\n\n【41】In our paired prospective studies, we used major stigmata of hemorrhage during urgent colonoscopy to identify the bleeding site, provide a prognostic guide, and focus colonoscopic therapy. Among patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia, 23 percent of those in the first study and 21 percent of those in the second study had definite stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. However, when we excluded the 50 percent of patients with incidental diverticulosis in the second study (i.e., those who had another known site of gastrointestinal hemorrhage), we found the following prevalence of stigmata among patients with endoscopically documented definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage: active bleeding, 21 percent; nonbleeding visible vessels, 8 percent; adherent clots, 12 percent; and no stigmata, 58 percent.\n\n【42】Unlike the case with hemorrhage from ulcer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,16-19 </a></sup></u> there are few data on the frequency of early recurrent bleeding after the medical treatment of diverticular hemorrhage. In our first study, 53 percent of the patients who were treated medically but not endoscopically had additional bleeding, requiring transfusions of packed red cells, and 35 percent had recurrent or continued bleeding severe enough to require emergency colectomy. The percentage of patients who required additional transfusions and the percentage who required surgery were higher among those with active bleeding (67 percent and 50 percent, respectively) than among those with nonbleeding visible vessels (50 percent and 25 percent, respectively) or adherent clots (43 percent and 29 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. These rates of recurrent bleeding are similar to those reported for patients with peptic ulcers and similar stigmata of recent hemorrhage who were treated medically. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【43】The colonoscopic treatments used for hemostasis differed depending on the stigmata of hemorrhage and were based on our experience with endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcers with the same signs of hemorrhage, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,16 </a></sup></u> prior laboratory work, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and a recent pilot study of the treatment of nonbleeding visible vessels in diverticula. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Active bleeding or adherent clots were first treated with an epinephrine injection, whereas nonbleeding visible vessels were coagulated, without an epinephrine injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Bipolar probes were chosen because of their excellent efficacy and good safety. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> None of the patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage who underwent colonoscopic treatment required surgery, and none had complications after colonoscopic diagnosis or treatment. However, we studied only a small number of patients, and the treatments were not randomized. Thus, larger studies are warranted to confirm our results.\n\n【44】The rate of recurrence of diverticular hemorrhage in retrospective surgical series has varied, but it was as high as 50 percent in studies in 1957 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> and 1972 <sup><a>18 </a></sup> and 38.4 percent in a more recent retrospective review. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> High rates of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage are often used as the rationale for early surgery to prevent a recurrence when the patient is older and presumably at higher risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> On the basis of our results, a different approach should be considered, consisting of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis by a skilled and experienced endoscopist to identify the type of diverticular hemorrhage — definite, presumptive, or incidental — with endoscopic hemostasis and India-ink tattooing of the diverticulum at the site of the lesion in case severe hematochezia recurs; avoidance of the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants; and careful long-term medical and dietary management. The last recommendation is unproved, and further studies of the secondary prevention of diverticular hemorrhage are warranted. In our opinion, surgery should be reserved for patients in whom definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage has been diagnosed by urgent colonoscopy after vigorous purging of the colon and for whom medical and colonoscopic treatment has failed or resulted in complications.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1 33273) and the Human Studies Core of the National Institutes of Health (41301).</u>\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Ulcer Research and Education (CURE) Hemostasis Research Unit, Digestive Disease Research Center, Division of Digestive Diseases, University of California at Los Angeles Center for the Health Sciences, and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles.</u>\n\n【49】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Jensen at CURE, Digestive Disease Research Center, VA GLAHS, 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Bldg. 115, Rm. 318, Los Angeles, CA 90073-1003, or at djensen@med1.medsch.ucla.edu .</u>\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>References _(19)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

All patients were hospitalized, received blood transfusions as needed, and received a purge to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. Colonoscopy was performed within 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia. Among the first 73 patients, those with continued diverticular bleeding underwent hemicolectomy. For the subsequent 48 patients, those requiring treatment received therapy, such as epinephrine injections or bipolar coagulation, through the colonoscope.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the first 73 patients, 17 (23 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 6, nonbleeding visible vessels in 4, and adherent clots in 7). Nine of the 17 had additional bleeding after colonoscopy, and 6 of these required hemicolectomy. Of the subsequent 48 patients, 10 (21 percent) had definite signs of diverticular hemorrhage (active bleeding in 5, nonbleeding visible vessels in 2, and adherent clots in 3). An additional 14 patients in this group (29 percent) were presumed to have diverticular bleeding because although they had no stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage, no other source of bleeding was identified. The other 24 patients (50 percent) had other identified sources of bleeding. All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage were treated endoscopically; none had recurrent bleeding or required surgery.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis, at least one fifth have definite diverticular hemorrhage. Colonoscopic treatment of such patients with epinephrine injections, bipolar coagulation, or both may prevent recurrent bleeding and decrease the need for surgery.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Diverticular bleeding is a common cause of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Identification of the origin of the bleeding, including diverticula, by endoscopy is facilitated by cleansing the colon with a purge. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> For more than a decade, the stigmata of hemorrhage on endoscopy, such as active bleeding or adherent clots, have been used to identify the site of bleeding and determine the risk of renewed bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal ulcer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> However, most endoscopists do not perform urgent colonoscopy to identify stigmata of bleeding from lower gastrointestinal lesions, such as diverticula. Rather, they perform elective colonoscopy (when the patient may not be bleeding).\n\n【12】There have been case reports of treatment with colonoscopy for diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-9 </a></sup></u> Johnston and Sones described four patients who were treated with an endoscopic heater probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Three of the patients had active bleeding, and one had a sentinel clot in a diverticulum. Kim and Marcon reported the successful treatment of active diverticular hemorrhage with injection of epinephrine in one patient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Savides and Jensen described three patients with severe, recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding in whom nonbleeding visible vessels were successfully treated with bipolar coagulation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Hokama et al. described three patients with diverticular bleeding that was controlled by an endoscopic hemoclip. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Neither complications nor recurrent bleeding in the short or long term was reported in these series. We evaluated the use of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe diverticular hemorrhage.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Patients and Design of the Study\n--------------------------------\n\n【15】In two sequential studies of urgent colonoscopy, we prospectively studied 121 patients with severe hematochezia and diverticulosis. The studies were approved by the institutional review boards at participating centers (University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System), and all patients gave written informed consent. Medical management consisted of hospitalization, monitoring, and resuscitation in intensive care or telemetry units. Anticoagulants and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including aspirin, were discontinued before colonoscopy. Patients also received transfusions of red cells for severe anemia and blood products to correct any coagulopathy before they underwent urgent colonoscopy. Only patients who had evidence of diverticulosis on colonoscopy were enrolled in the study; all other patients with hematochezia were excluded.\n\n【16】A team of intensivists, internists, and general surgeons managed the treatment of all patients in consultation with gastroenterologists. All patients received a sulfate purge (Golytely, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass., or Colyte, Schwarz Pharmaceuticals, Milwaukee), either orally (in the case of 67 percent of patients) or by nasogastric tube (in the case of 33 percent) to rid the colon of clots, stool, and blood. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The procedure usually required 5 to 6 liters of purge and three to four hours before the colon was clean. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Urgent colonoscopy was defined as colonoscopy performed at the bedside 6 to 12 hours after hospitalization or the diagnosis of hematochezia and within 1 hour after clearance of stool, blood, and clots, as documented by a physician.\n\n【17】Definition of Diverticular Hemorrhage\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】A definite diagnosis of diverticulosis as the source of bleeding required the finding of one of the following after vigorous irrigation of diverticula: active bleeding, a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot. Two other types of diverticulosis were defined: incidental diverticulosis, in which diverticulosis was present but the bleeding originated from another lesion or lesions, and presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, in which diverticula had no evidence of bleeding but no other major colonic lesions or bleeding sites were identified on enteroscopy.\n\n【19】Patients Treated Medically and Surgically\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【20】The first study was conducted from June 1986 to June 1992 and included 73 consecutive patients with severe hematochezia (for four or more hours after hospitalization, as documented by a physician or nurse) and diverticulosis. Seventeen patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of colonoscopic findings of signs of hemorrhage and were treated medically. Once the hematochezia cleared, the diets of all patients were changed from liquids to solids as tolerated. The patients were observed in the hospital in case bleeding recurred. If bleeding continued or recurred, the patient received transfusions. In the event of severe bleeding, as evidenced by further hematochezia after colonoscopy, and if the patient had already received at least 3 units of packed red cells in addition to an initial transfusion for resuscitation, emergency hemicolectomy was performed.\n\n【21】Patients Treated Medically and Colonoscopically\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The second prospective study was conducted from June 1994 to December 1998 and included 48 consecutive patients with hematochezia and diverticulosis. Ten patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage on the basis of signs of hemorrhage and were treated by colonoscopy. Medical treatment was also continued. Colonoscopic treatments were standardized among investigators on the basis of our previous laboratory studies of coagulation of the right side of the colon 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> and a pilot study in patients with diverticular hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> During the procedure the patients underwent conscious sedation.\n\n【23】In patients with active bleeding, 1- or 2-ml aliquots of epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) were injected in four quadrants to control the bleeding (in the case of shallow, broad-based diverticula) or to close the mouth of the diverticulum by tamponade (in the case of narrow-necked or deep diverticula). Nonbleeding visible vessels were treated by bipolar coagulation (Gold probe, Microvasive, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass.) with 10 to 15 W of power, moderate appositional pressure directly on the vessel, and one-second pulses until good coagulation and flattening of the vessel were achieved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Nonbleeding adherent clots were injected with epinephrine (dilution, 1:20,000) in four quadrants around the pedicle of the clot, and the clot was shaved down to 3 to 4 mm above the attachment with a polypectomy snare by cutting it off without coagulation and without pulling the clot off its attachment. Then the underlying stigmata (usually a nonbleeding visible vessel) was coagulated with a bipolar probe. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> For future identification in the event of repeated colonoscopy or surgical procedure, the mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum was labeled with India ink. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】After recovery from sedation, patients were given full liquid diets for 24 hours and then switched to regular diets as tolerated. The patients were encouraged to move around after colonoscopy, unless bleeding recurred or they were being monitored by telemetry.\n\n【25】Long-Term Medical Management\n----------------------------\n\n【26】After being discharged from the hospital, all patients with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage followed high-fiber diets with supplemental psyllium (Metamucil, Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, or Citrucel, SKB, Pittsburgh), took analgesics other than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as necessary, and were cautioned not to take any over-the-counter or prescription medications that might cause or aggravate gastrointestinal hemorrhage, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants. They were also instructed to avoid eating popcorn, nuts with shells, and foods that contained small, hard seeds (such as sesame and caraway) and to use stool softeners and other over-the-counter medications for constipation. Residual iron-deficiency anemia was treated with iron supplements and foods high in iron content. These long-term management recommendations were reinforced at each visit to the gastroenterology clinic.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Chi-square tests were used to compare data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P values are two-tailed.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n<mark>【30】Table 1.  </mark>Table 1. Prevalence of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Bleeding from Other Sites in Patients with Severe Hematochezia and Diverticulosis.\n\n【31】In the first study, in which patients received medical and surgical treatment, 17 of the 73 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (23 percent) had signs of diverticular hemorrhage. The other 56 (77 percent) had incidental diverticulosis, because a site of bleeding other than a diverticulum was identified and treated 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the second study, in which patients received medical and colonoscopic treatment, 10 of 48 patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia (21 percent) had definite diverticular hemorrhage, 14 (29 percent) had presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, and 24 (50 percent) had incidental diverticulosis. Among the 24 patients in the second study with definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage, 21 percent had active bleeding, 8 percent had nonbleeding visible vessels, 12 percent had adherent clots, and 58 percent had no signs.\n\n<mark>【32】Table 2. </mark> Table 2. Clinical and Endoscopic Findings in 27 Patients with Definite Diverticular Hemorrhage.\n\n【33】A total of 27 patients had definite diverticular hemorrhage: 17 in the first study and 10 in the second study 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The mean (±SE) ages in the two groups were similar: 66±3 years in the first group and 67±4 years in the second. All these patients had one or more coexisting conditions. Recent use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was more common among patients in the second study than in the first study (30 percent vs. 18 percent), but the difference was not significant. The number of units of packed red cells transfused for resuscitation before colonoscopy was similar in the groups.\n\n【34】We diagnosed active bleeding in six of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and five of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment. We found nonbleeding visible vessels in four of the patients treated medically and surgically and two of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment; such vessels were usually seen at the neck (lip) of the diverticulum. We found adherent clots in seven of the patients who were treated medically and surgically and three of those who received medical and colonoscopic treatment.\n\n【35】Table 3. Table 3. Outcome of Treatment for Diverticular Hemorrhage. Table 4.  Table 4. Relation between Stigmata of Diverticular Hemorrhage and Recurrent Bleeding in Patients Who Received Medical and Surgical Treatment.\n\n【36】After urgent colonoscopy, 9 of the 17 patients treated medically and surgically had recurrent or persistent bleeding severe enough to require additional transfusions 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Bleeding stopped in three of these nine patients after medical treatment, including transfusions of 2 or fewer units of packed red cells. However, severe bleeding continued in six, and emergency hemicolectomy was performed. Two of the six patients had complications after surgery. Table 4 shows the relation between the stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage and the incidence of recurrent bleeding in patients who received medical and surgical treatment.\n\n【37】All 10 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the second study were treated endoscopically. None had recurrent bleeding or complications or required further red-cell transfusions or surgery 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. In this group of patients, the median time from colonoscopy to discharge was two days, as compared with five days for the 17 patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage in the group treated medically and surgically.\n\n【38】During follow-up, no patient with definite diverticular hemorrhage had late recurrent bleeding (more than 30 days after discharge) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The median duration of follow-up was 36 months in the group treated medically and surgically (range, 24 to 54) and 30 months in the group treated medically and colonoscopically (range, 18 to 49). Bleeding recurred in one patient (who was taking warfarin) among those with presumptive diverticular hemorrhage in the second study. The median follow-up in this subgroup was 23 months (range, 5 to 64).\n\n【39】Discussion\n----------\n\n【40】Before the introduction of colonoscopy, diverticulosis was thought to be the most frequent cause of severe lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding in older people, particularly in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage was most often based on the results of barium enema, findings at surgery, or a finding of extensive nonbleeding diverticulosis. In several studies, urgent colonoscopy after thorough removal of blood and stool from the colon indicated that diverticular hemorrhage was the second most common diagnosis, after colonic angioma, among elderly patients who were hospitalized because of very severe ongoing hematochezia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,12 </a></sup></u> Improvements in endoscopic technology have made it possible for gastroenterologists not only to diagnose sources of bleeding accurately but also to achieve hemostasis at diverticula with active bleeding, visible vessels, and adherent clots and other bleeding sites. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,4-10</a></sup></u>\n\n【41】In our paired prospective studies, we used major stigmata of hemorrhage during urgent colonoscopy to identify the bleeding site, provide a prognostic guide, and focus colonoscopic therapy. Among patients with diverticulosis and severe hematochezia, 23 percent of those in the first study and 21 percent of those in the second study had definite stigmata of diverticular hemorrhage 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. However, when we excluded the 50 percent of patients with incidental diverticulosis in the second study (i.e., those who had another known site of gastrointestinal hemorrhage), we found the following prevalence of stigmata among patients with endoscopically documented definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage: active bleeding, 21 percent; nonbleeding visible vessels, 8 percent; adherent clots, 12 percent; and no stigmata, 58 percent.\n\n【42】Unlike the case with hemorrhage from ulcer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,16-19 </a></sup></u> there are few data on the frequency of early recurrent bleeding after the medical treatment of diverticular hemorrhage. In our first study, 53 percent of the patients who were treated medically but not endoscopically had additional bleeding, requiring transfusions of packed red cells, and 35 percent had recurrent or continued bleeding severe enough to require emergency colectomy. The percentage of patients who required additional transfusions and the percentage who required surgery were higher among those with active bleeding (67 percent and 50 percent, respectively) than among those with nonbleeding visible vessels (50 percent and 25 percent, respectively) or adherent clots (43 percent and 29 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. These rates of recurrent bleeding are similar to those reported for patients with peptic ulcers and similar stigmata of recent hemorrhage who were treated medically. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【43】The colonoscopic treatments used for hemostasis differed depending on the stigmata of hemorrhage and were based on our experience with endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcers with the same signs of hemorrhage, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,16 </a></sup></u> prior laboratory work, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and a recent pilot study of the treatment of nonbleeding visible vessels in diverticula. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Active bleeding or adherent clots were first treated with an epinephrine injection, whereas nonbleeding visible vessels were coagulated, without an epinephrine injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Bipolar probes were chosen because of their excellent efficacy and good safety. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> None of the patients with definite diverticular hemorrhage who underwent colonoscopic treatment required surgery, and none had complications after colonoscopic diagnosis or treatment. However, we studied only a small number of patients, and the treatments were not randomized. Thus, larger studies are warranted to confirm our results.\n\n【44】The rate of recurrence of diverticular hemorrhage in retrospective surgical series has varied, but it was as high as 50 percent in studies in 1957 <sup><a>17 </a></sup> and 1972 <sup><a>18 </a></sup> and 38.4 percent in a more recent retrospective review. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> High rates of recurrent diverticular hemorrhage are often used as the rationale for early surgery to prevent a recurrence when the patient is older and presumably at higher risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> On the basis of our results, a different approach should be considered, consisting of colonoscopy performed on an urgent basis by a skilled and experienced endoscopist to identify the type of diverticular hemorrhage — definite, presumptive, or incidental — with endoscopic hemostasis and India-ink tattooing of the diverticulum at the site of the lesion in case severe hematochezia recurs; avoidance of the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (including aspirin) and anticoagulants; and careful long-term medical and dietary management. The last recommendation is unproved, and further studies of the secondary prevention of diverticular hemorrhage are warranted. In our opinion, surgery should be reserved for patients in whom definite or presumptive diverticular hemorrhage has been diagnosed by urgent colonoscopy after vigorous purging of the colon and for whom medical and colonoscopic treatment has failed or resulted in complications.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (RO1 33273) and the Human Studies Core of the National Institutes of Health (41301).</u>\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Ulcer Research and Education (CURE) Hemostasis Research Unit, Digestive Disease Research Center, Division of Digestive Diseases, University of California at Los Angeles Center for the Health Sciences, and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles.</u>\n\n【49】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Jensen at CURE, Digestive Disease Research Center, VA GLAHS, 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Bldg. 115, Rm. 318, Los Angeles, CA 90073-1003, or at djensen@med1.medsch.ucla.edu .</u>\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>References _(19)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Variants that were first detected in California (B.1.429 lineage) and New York (B.1.526 lineage) are causing concern in the United States. A variant that was first detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7 lineage) is spreading globally and has now acquired an E484K substitution, which confers resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【3】We and our colleagues reported that BNT162b2, a messenger RNA vaccine that expresses the prefusion stabilized full spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number, MN908947.3), is 95% effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In addition, we reported that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 bearing _S_ genes from the B.1.1.7 variant, the variant first identified in South Africa (B.1.351 lineage), and the variant first identified in Brazil (P.1 lineage) remained susceptible to BNT162b2 vaccine–elicited serum neutralization, although at a reduced level for the B.1.351 variant. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】To determine whether variants that have emerged more recently are also susceptible to BNT162b2-elicited neutralization, we engineered the complete _S_ genes of the variant viruses into the genetic background of USA-WA1/2020 (isolated in January 2020) 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org)</u></u>, which resulted in three recombinant viruses: one with the B.1.429 _S_ gene (B.1.429-spike–S13I, W152C, L452R, and D614G), a second with the B.1.526 _S_ gene (B.1.526-spike–L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K, D614G, and A701V), and a third with the B.1.1.7 _S_ gene plus the E484K substitution (B.1.1.7-spike+E484K–Δ69-70, Δ145, E484K, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H). All the recombinant viruses produced infectious viral titers of more than 10 <sup>7 </sup> plaque-forming units (PFUs) per milliliter. The B.1.1.7-spike+E484K virus formed smaller plaques than the other viruses 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. All the viruses had similar viral RNA genome to PFU ratios 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>, which suggests equivalent specific infectivities of the viral stocks.\n\n【5】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Serum Neutralization of New Variant Strains of SARS-CoV-2 after Two Doses of BNT162b2 Vaccine.\n\n【6】Shown are the results of 50% plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT <sub>50 </sub> ) with the use of 20 samples obtained from 15 trial participants at 2 weeks (circles) or 4 weeks (triangles) after the administration of the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The mutant viruses were produced by engineering the complete _S_ genes from the B.1.429 variant (B.1.429-spike), B.1.526 variant (B.1.526-spike), or B.1.1.7 variant plus an additional E484K mutation (B.1.1.7-spike+E484K) into USA-WA1/2020. Each data point represents the geometric mean PRNT <sub>50 </sub> obtained with a serum sample against the indicated virus, including data from repeat experiments, as detailed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix . The data for USA-WA1/2020 are from two experiments; the data for B.1.429-spike, B.1.526-spike, and B.1.1.7-spike+E484K viruses are from one experiment each. In each experiment, the neutralization titer was determined in duplicate assays, and the geometric mean was calculated. The heights of bars and the numbers over the bars indicate geometric mean titers. The 𝙸 bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. The statistical significance of the difference between geometric mean titers in the USA-WA1/2020 neutralization assay and in each variant virus neutralization assay with the same serum samples are as follows: P=0.002 for B.1.429-spike; P=0.47 for B.1.526-spike; and P=0.04 for B.1.1.7-spike+E484K.\n\n【7】All the recombinant viruses were analyzed by means of 50% plaque reduction neutralization testing with 20 human serum samples, collected from 15 persons 2 or 4 weeks after the second dose of 30 μg of BNT162b2, which was administered 3 weeks after the first immunization 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>(Fig. S4)</u>. All the serum samples neutralized USA-WA1/2020 and the variant viruses at titers of 1:80 or higher. The geometric mean neutralizing titers against USA-WA1/2020, B.1.429-spike, B.1.526-spike, and B.1.1.7-spike+E484K viruses were 520, 394, 469, and 597, respectively 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and Table S1)</u>. Thus, as compared with neutralization of USA-WA1/2020, neutralization of B.1.1.7-spike+E484K and B.1.526-spike viruses was approximately equivalent, and neutralization of B.1.429-spike was slightly lower, possibly reflecting the influence of the L452R mutation, which appears to be under positive selective pressure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Our results suggest that, as compared with the previously reported neutralization of B.1.1.7-spike, the additional E484K mutation, which is also found in the B.1.351 and B.1.526 lineages, caused little compromise to neutralization. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】An inherent limitation of the study is that new SARS-CoV-2 variants continuously emerge, so the set of strains of current concern constantly shifts. Nevertheless, some mutations are of particular interest. For example, the E484K mutation has arisen convergently, multiple times, in several variants. A second limitation is the potential for mutations to alter neutralization by affecting spike function rather than antigenicity, despite the similar titers and specific infectivities of the viral variant preparations. A third limitation is that BNT162b2 elicits multiple immune effectors, including SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and nonneutralizing antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Thus, studies of virus neutralization by postimmunization serum can show that a variant remains susceptible to one potential mechanism of vaccine-mediated protection but cannot rule out susceptibility to other mechanisms of protection and cannot substitute for clinical evidence of vaccine-mediated protection or escape from that protection.\n\n【9】Because these data show that the newly emerged B.1.526, B.1.429, and B.1.1.7+E484K variants remain susceptible to an important vaccine-elicited immune effector (neutralizing antibody), they confirm the importance of mass immunization with current, highly effective, authorized vaccines as a central strategy to end the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Yang Liu, Ph.D.  \nJianying Liu, Ph.D.  \nHongjie Xia, Ph.D.  \nXianwen Zhang, B.S.  \nJing Zou, Ph.D.  \nCamila R.

In two of the four studies the diet was supplemented hourly with 20 g of glucose orally. Without supplementation mean blood ammonia rose 20 μg per 100 ml, insulin averaged >50 μU per milliliter, and glucagon averaged >160 pg per milliliter. Mean molar insulin:glucagon ratio rose to a peak of 12.3 but was usually below 5. With glucose supplementation, mean insulin rose to 201 μU per milliliter, glucagon fell below basal values, and the insulin: glucagon ratio rose to a peak of 39.2, significantly above the control at all points. In this hormonal setting, blood ammonia did not rise, but declined slightly, a difference that was significant at all six points of comparison after the first hour of the experiment.

We tested two treatment strategies that could be more sustainable in Africa than the standard of 2 weeks of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and more effective than the widely used fluconazole monotherapy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis to receive an oral regimen (fluconazole \\[1200 mg per day\\] plus flucytosine \\[100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day\\] for 2 weeks), 1 week of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day), or 2 weeks of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day). Each patient assigned to receive amphotericin B was also randomly assigned to receive fluconazole or flucytosine as a partner drug. After induction treatment, all the patients received fluconazole consolidation therapy and were followed to 10 weeks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 721 patients underwent randomization. Mortality in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups was 18.2% (41 of 225), 21.9% (49 of 224), and 21.4% (49 of 229), respectively, at 2 weeks and was 35.1% (79 of 225), 36.2% (81 of 224), and 39.7% (91 of 229), respectively, at 10 weeks. The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in 2-week mortality was 4.2 percentage points for the oral-regimen group versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups and 8.1 percentage points for the 1-week amphotericin B groups versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups, both of which were below the predefined 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin. As a partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (71 deaths \\[31.1%\\] vs. 101 deaths \\[45.0%\\]; hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks, 0.62; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002). One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1). Side effects, such as severe anemia, were more frequent with 2 weeks than with 1 week of amphotericin B or with the oral regimen.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine were effective as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. (ACTA Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN45035509 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of adult meningitis in many regions that have a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and accounts for 10 to 20% of all HIV-related deaths, with more than 100,000 deaths each year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This high burden is driven by a high case fatality rate, which in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 70% at 3 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is challenging. The international standard induction treatment of 2 weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus flucytosine 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> is not available in most African clinical centers. Amphotericin B requires intravenous administration and close laboratory monitoring and is associated with phlebitis, secondary infections, anemia, and renal impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Flucytosine is currently unavailable, although the molecule is used widely as a constituent of emtricitabine, and generic manufacture is possible at low cost. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Most countries therefore rely on generic or donated fluconazole induction monotherapy; however, the rate of fungal clearance with fluconazole is slower than that with amphotericin B, even at an elevated dosage, and mortality associated with this treatment is 50 to 60% at 10 weeks and is higher than 70% at 1 year even in study cohorts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Phase 2 studies have defined several promising treatment strategies that are associated with fungal clearance similar to that with 2-week amphotericin B regimens and that have more favorable safety profiles. An oral combination of fluconazole and flucytosine was found to be associated with a rate of clearance of infection similar to that with amphotericin B alone and to be associated with higher survival rates than those with fluconazole alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Shorter-course amphotericin B had a more favorable side-effect profile than standard 2-week courses, with no diminution in the rate of clearance of infection in the second week, perhaps because of the long half-life of amphotericin B in brain tissue. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> The efficacy of shorter-course amphotericin B treatment has also been shown in animal models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】In addition, the drug of choice to combine with amphotericin B remains unclear. In a previous trial, amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates at day 70 than amphotericin B alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Amphotericin B plus flucytosine was not found to differ from amphotericin B plus fluconazole with regard to mortality at 10 weeks, but the results of a secondary analysis at 6 months favored flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, these results have been insufficient to drive wider availability of flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】Therefore, we tested two new treatment strategies that could be more readily sustainable in African centers than 2 weeks of amphotericin B and more effective than fluconazole: oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine, and a shorter course (1 week) of induction therapy with amphotericin B–based treatment. These regimens were compared with a 2-week regimen of amphotericin B–based treatment. In addition, within the amphotericin B groups, we randomly assigned patients to receive either flucytosine or fluconazole as the partner drug.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】We conducted an open-label, phase 3, randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial (Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa \\[ACTA\\]) to compare three treatment strategies (an oral combination regimen of fluconazole plus flucytosine, 1 week of amphotericin B, and the standard 2 weeks of amphotericin B) for the induction treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole were also evaluated as partner drugs with amphotericin B.\n\n【19】Participants were recruited from nine African centers: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, and Zomba Central Hospital, Zomba, Malawi; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; Muhimbili, Amana, and Mwananyamala Hospitals, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; and Hôpital Central, Yaoundé, and Douala General Hospital, Douala, Cameroon. The protocol was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by all the site national research ethics committees and regulatory bodies. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or, in the case of patients with altered mental status, from the next of kin (consent was obtained from these patients after recovery).\n\n【20】Lateral-flow cryptococcal antigen tests were donated by or purchased from IMMY. Trial drugs were purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb (amphotericin B \\[Fungizone\\]), Meda Pharmaceuticals (flucytosine), and Cipla or Medopharm (fluconazole). In places where the Pfizer fluconazole donation program was running, donated fluconazole was used when available. The trial funders, suppliers, and drug manufacturers had no role in trial design; data collection, analysis, and interpretation; or manuscript preparation. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】Trial Participants\n------------------\n\n【22】HIV-seropositive adults (≥18 years old) with a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis who tested positive on India ink staining, cryptococcal antigen assay, or both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were included. Patients were excluded if they had previously received more than one dose of amphotericin B or more than one treatment dose (1200 mg) or more than seven low doses (200 mg) of fluconazole in the 2 weeks before screening, were pregnant or lactating, were taking contraindicated concomitant drugs, or had any previous adverse reactions to the trial drugs.\n\n【23】An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that was more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count that was less than 500 per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count that was less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter were late-exclusion criteria (i.e., a patient who met one or more of these criteria at baseline was withdrawn from the trial). In addition, if an elevated creatinine level remained above 220 μmol per liter on the day after randomization despite the patient receiving rehydration, the patient was withdrawn from the trial.\n\n【24】Initially, patients were excluded if they had previously been exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, because it became clear that a large number of patients were presenting with cryptococcal meningitis while taking ART or with previous exposure to ART, soon after commencement of the trial (after 4% of total enrollment), a protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of these patients. Full details of the trial design can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.\n\n【25】Interventions and Randomization\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】We assessed three treatment strategies (the use of an oral regimen, a 1-week amphotericin B regimen, and a 2-week amphotericin B regimen), as well as two alternative partner drugs for amphotericin B (fluconazole or flucytosine). The oral regimen consisted of fluconazole (1200 mg per day) plus flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) given orally for 2 weeks. The 1-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 7 days, followed on days 8 through 14 by fluconazole (1200 mg per day). The 2-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 14 days.\n\n【27】Patients underwent block randomization individually, stratified according to site, to one of the three treatment strategies and, for patients who were assigned to an amphotericin B regimen, to one of the two partner drugs. Overall, this strategy resulted in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio of patients assigned to receive one of the five combinations of treatment strategy and partner drug with amphotericin B. For each site, a computer-generated randomization list with block sizes of 18, 24, and 30 was produced. The trial pharmacist and clinician were responsible for conducting the randomization by sequentially drawing sealed envelopes that contained the treatment assignment for each enrolled patient.\n\n【28】Patients who received amphotericin B were given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously daily in addition to usual fluid requirements and preemptive potassium and magnesium (glycerophosphate) supplementation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Oral medications were given through a nasogastric tube if the patient was unable to swallow. Laboratory blood tests were performed regularly during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Baseline and day 7 electrocardiographic monitoring was discontinued at the advice of the data and safety monitoring committee after 100 paired electrocardiograms showed no evidence of clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval in association with fluconazole at a dose of 1200 mg per day. Lumbar punctures were performed at baseline and on days 7 and 14 for quantitative cultures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In addition, patients with high CSF pressure underwent daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until the pressure was controlled. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Patients were followed for 10 weeks after randomization. After 2 weeks, fluconazole was given at 800 mg per day until ART was started at 4 weeks (or restarted in those who had discontinued ART), at 400 mg per day until 10 weeks, and at 200 mg per day thereafter. ART was prescribed in accordance with national guidelines.\n\n【29】End Points\n----------\n\n【30】The primary end point for comparison of the two experimental treatment strategies with the standard therapy of 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based treatment was all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. Two weeks was chosen in view of the noninferiority design of the trial and the fact that mortality at 2 weeks is more likely than mortality at later time points to reflect deaths from cryptococcal meningitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Secondary end points included 4-week and 10-week all-cause mortality, the rate of decrease in the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over 14 days, and clinical and laboratory-defined grade 3 and 4 adverse events.\n\n【31】For the comparison between partner drugs for the amphotericin B regimens, the primary end point was all-cause mortality at 10 weeks. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, rate of clearance of infection, and adverse events.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】A target enrollment of 680 patients (226 per strategy) was set in order to achieve 90% power to show noninferiority with a 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin and under the assumption of 15% mortality at 2 weeks in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. For the comparison of the partner drugs with amphotericin B, with the use of a superiority design and under the assumption of a 10-week mortality of 40% with one partner treatment, the trial had 90% power to detect a 35% lower mortality with the alternative partner treatment.\n\n【34】The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and identity link function was used to calculate differences and upper limits of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the primary end point with a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval, the upper limit of which is equivalent to the upper limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval and the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction (α=0.025) for two comparisons, was also performed. Correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to the analyses of secondary outcomes. The per-protocol population excluded patients who missed more than 1 day of treatment within the first 2 weeks after randomization.\n\n【35】All-cause mortality at 2, 4, and 10 weeks was compared between the groups with the use of log-rank tests. Kaplan–Meier plots were also constructed, and Cox regression models with treatment as a predictor were used to derive hazard ratios and two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were also performed with adjustment for prespecified covariates: site, age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CD4+ cell count, CSF fungal count at baseline, and ART status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses of all-cause mortality were performed under the assumption that all the patients who were lost to follow-up had died.\n\n【36】The analysis of the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over a period of 14 days from baseline was performed with a linear mixed-effects model. For comparison with previous studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> linear regression was also used to calculate slopes of the decrease in CSF fungal count for each patient, and the mean slopes were compared between the groups.\n\n【37】All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【40】Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Of these patients, 43 were excluded from all analyses: 30 met predefined late-exclusion criteria, 3 immediately withdrew consent, 7 were negative for cryptococcal meningitis, and 3 had had cryptococcal meningitis previously. A total of 16 patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: 14 missed more than 1 day of treatment within the 2-week induction period, and 2 did not receive the correct randomly assigned treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in the treatment groups and reflected the severity of immunosuppression in the population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In total, 59% of patients were taking or had previously taken ART.

The dashed line indicates the prespecified noninferiority margin.\n\n【46】A total of 678 patients were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these patients, 1 was lost to follow-up within 2 weeks and 3 were lost to follow-up between 2 weeks and 10 weeks. Mortality was similar in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups: 18.2%, 21.9%, and 21.4%, respectively, at 2 weeks and 35.1%, 36.2%, and 39.7%, respectively, at 10 weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2A )</u>. The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mortality at 2 weeks (primary end point) was 3.0 percentage points for the comparison of the oral-regimen group with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P<0.001) and 6.8 percentage points for the comparison of the 1-week amphotericin B groups with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P=0.007) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D )</u>. The upper limits of the one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction for the comparisons) both remained below the noninferiority margin 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The hazard ratios for death at 2 weeks, as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B groups, were 0.82 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.25) in the oral-regimen group and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51) in the 1-week amphotericin B groups; the corresponding hazard ratios for death at 10 weeks were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.21) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The results were similar in the per-protocol analysis, adjusted analysis, and sensitivity analyses 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D , and Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Table 3.

Unadjusted Time-to-Event Analysis of Mortality and Rate of Fungal Clearance in CSF According to Treatment Strategy and Partner Treatment with Amphotericin B in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【48】As partner treatment with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks with flucytosine vs. fluconazole, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Figure 2B )</u>. This difference was driven by a difference in mortality between the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group and the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group. The results of separate analyses of the five groups are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2C , with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group as the comparator. The 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group had the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1), significantly lower than any other amphotericin B group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.56 \\[95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91\\], and adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59 \\[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96\\], as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group). The hazard ratio for death by 10 weeks, with the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group used as the comparator, was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.42) in the oral-regimen group, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.60 to 4.05) in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group, and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.17) in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【49】There was no significant difference in mortality between patients who had never taken ART and those who had previously been exposed to ART 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Rate of Clearance of Infection\n------------------------------\n\n【51】The rate of clearance of infection (measured as the decrease in log <sub>10 </sub> colony-forming units per milliliter of CSF per day) was similar in the 1-week and 2-week amphotericin B groups and more rapid in the amphotericin B groups than in the oral-regimen group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Flucytosine as the partner drug given with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance than fluconazole 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Results were similar when linear regression was used, as in previous studies 删除2:<u>(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Safety\n------\n\n【53】Table 5.  Table 5. Laboratory-Defined and Clinical Adverse Events That Occurred within 21 Days after Randomization, According to Treatment Strategy.\n\n【54】Laboratory-defined side effects were less frequent in the oral-regimen group than in the 1-week or 2-week amphotericin B groups 删除2:<u>( Table 5 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Grade 4 anemia developed in 0.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 4.9% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups; the median decrease from baseline in hemoglobin level over the first 2 weeks was 0.4, 1.8, and 2.7 g per deciliter, respectively, and 5.5%, 10.3%, and 20.2%, respectively, of patients in each group received a transfusion. A grade 3 or 4 increase in the serum creatinine level developed in 4.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 6.2% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in only one patient, most likely because preemptive electrolyte replacement was provided for patients receiving amphotericin B. Grade 4 neutropenia was recorded in 3.2% of the patients who were taking a regimen that included 2 weeks of flucytosine, in 0.9% of those taking 1 week of flucytosine, and in 1.3% of those taking a flucytosine-free regimen. A grade 4 increase in the alanine aminotransferase level developed in only two patients, one of whom was taking fluconazole. Clinical adverse events were frequent with all regimens, which was reflective of the severe immunosuppression in this patient population.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this trial, we recruited patients from centers in southern, eastern, and central Africa, where the burden of cryptococcal meningitis is highest. We found that combination oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine and shorter-course 1-week amphotericin B–based treatment were noninferior to 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based therapy and that, as the partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was associated with lower mortality than fluconazole. This latter difference was driven by the superiority of flucytosine to fluconazole in the 1-week amphotericin B groups. Indeed, although caution is appropriate in interpreting these results, given the secondary nature of the comparisons involved, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates than the other regimens, although the difference only just met the criteria for significance in the comparison with the oral combination and, in an adjusted analysis, in the comparison with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine regimen.\n\n【57】The results were consistent in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, as well as in adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Few patients (0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Patients with severe disease were not excluded, so that the study population reflected patients presenting at centers across Africa. Also supportive of the generalizability of the results was the finding that mortality in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group (41.3% at 10 weeks) was the same as that seen in the placebo group of the recent multicenter trial of adjunctive glucocorticoids in which the same antifungal regimen was used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】The results were consistent with those in animal models and in our phase 2 studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-13 </a></sup></u> and may reflect, at least in part, a balance between the rate of clearance of infection and the drug-related side effects. Flucytosine as the partner drug with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance of infection than fluconazole and had a similar side-effect profile, as was previously shown in a study in Vietnam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Clearance of infection was as rapid in the 1-week amphotericin B groups as it was in the 2-week amphotericin B groups, and, as expected, the shorter regimens had fewer side effects, with, in particular, less anemia. Our results with 1 week of amphotericin B–flucytosine lend further support to the concept of prolonged efficacy after an initial loading of brain compartments with amphotericin B, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,21 </a></sup></u> as was also recently shown with the use of a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Of note, we implemented full preemptive management and monitoring of amphotericin B toxic effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> It is likely that in resource-limited settings, the challenges of transfusion and monitoring would further disadvantage the 2-week amphotericin B regimens, as evidenced by the continued very high mortality rates reported from African centers where 2 weeks of amphotericin B has been used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> The amphotericin B–free oral combination regimen had few laboratory-defined side effects and also had efficacy, despite slower clearance of infection.\n\n【59】All the best-performing regimens in our trial contained flucytosine. In particular, mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group was significantly lower than that in the other amphotericin B groups, whereas mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group was the highest. It may be that the more effective partner drug is particularly important in the context of shorter courses of amphotericin B. In addition to rapid fungicidal activity, flucytosine may also have other properties, such as a more prolonged postantibiotic effect than fluconazole, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> to help explain this difference.\n\n【60】Despite the fact that patients in resource-limited settings have access to ART, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is not decreasing in many centers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> Widespread availability of generic flucytosine is urgently needed as an essential part of global programs to reduce HIV-related mortality, as is continued investigation into new drug therapies. Efforts by international agencies to make flucytosine available are gaining momentum. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,15,28,29</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in our trial, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was the most effective option for induction therapy for patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. Our results also suggest that in the absence of availability of amphotericin B or in conditions in which amphotericin B cannot be administered safely, the oral combination of fluconazole plus flucytosine provides an effective and sustainable alternative.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Medical Research Council , United Kingdom (100504) and the French Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis ( ANRS ) ( ANRS 12275), a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust UK (to the Malawi–Liverpool–Wellcome Clinical Research Programme), and a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (2 P30-AI50410-14 to the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research, with support to Dr. van der Horst).

We tested two treatment strategies that could be more sustainable in Africa than the standard of 2 weeks of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and more effective than the widely used fluconazole monotherapy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis to receive an oral regimen (fluconazole \\[1200 mg per day\\] plus flucytosine \\[100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day\\] for 2 weeks), 1 week of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day), or 2 weeks of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day). Each patient assigned to receive amphotericin B was also randomly assigned to receive fluconazole or flucytosine as a partner drug. After induction treatment, all the patients received fluconazole consolidation therapy and were followed to 10 weeks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 721 patients underwent randomization. Mortality in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups was 18.2% (41 of 225), 21.9% (49 of 224), and 21.4% (49 of 229), respectively, at 2 weeks and was 35.1% (79 of 225), 36.2% (81 of 224), and 39.7% (91 of 229), respectively, at 10 weeks. The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in 2-week mortality was 4.2 percentage points for the oral-regimen group versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups and 8.1 percentage points for the 1-week amphotericin B groups versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups, both of which were below the predefined 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin. As a partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (71 deaths \\[31.1%\\] vs. 101 deaths \\[45.0%\\]; hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks, 0.62; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002). One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1). Side effects, such as severe anemia, were more frequent with 2 weeks than with 1 week of amphotericin B or with the oral regimen.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine were effective as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. (ACTA Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN45035509 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of adult meningitis in many regions that have a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and accounts for 10 to 20% of all HIV-related deaths, with more than 100,000 deaths each year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This high burden is driven by a high case fatality rate, which in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 70% at 3 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is challenging. The international standard induction treatment of 2 weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus flucytosine 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> is not available in most African clinical centers. Amphotericin B requires intravenous administration and close laboratory monitoring and is associated with phlebitis, secondary infections, anemia, and renal impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Flucytosine is currently unavailable, although the molecule is used widely as a constituent of emtricitabine, and generic manufacture is possible at low cost. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Most countries therefore rely on generic or donated fluconazole induction monotherapy; however, the rate of fungal clearance with fluconazole is slower than that with amphotericin B, even at an elevated dosage, and mortality associated with this treatment is 50 to 60% at 10 weeks and is higher than 70% at 1 year even in study cohorts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Phase 2 studies have defined several promising treatment strategies that are associated with fungal clearance similar to that with 2-week amphotericin B regimens and that have more favorable safety profiles. An oral combination of fluconazole and flucytosine was found to be associated with a rate of clearance of infection similar to that with amphotericin B alone and to be associated with higher survival rates than those with fluconazole alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Shorter-course amphotericin B had a more favorable side-effect profile than standard 2-week courses, with no diminution in the rate of clearance of infection in the second week, perhaps because of the long half-life of amphotericin B in brain tissue. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> The efficacy of shorter-course amphotericin B treatment has also been shown in animal models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】In addition, the drug of choice to combine with amphotericin B remains unclear. In a previous trial, amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates at day 70 than amphotericin B alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Amphotericin B plus flucytosine was not found to differ from amphotericin B plus fluconazole with regard to mortality at 10 weeks, but the results of a secondary analysis at 6 months favored flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, these results have been insufficient to drive wider availability of flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】Therefore, we tested two new treatment strategies that could be more readily sustainable in African centers than 2 weeks of amphotericin B and more effective than fluconazole: oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine, and a shorter course (1 week) of induction therapy with amphotericin B–based treatment. These regimens were compared with a 2-week regimen of amphotericin B–based treatment. In addition, within the amphotericin B groups, we randomly assigned patients to receive either flucytosine or fluconazole as the partner drug.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】We conducted an open-label, phase 3, randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial (Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa \\[ACTA\\]) to compare three treatment strategies (an oral combination regimen of fluconazole plus flucytosine, 1 week of amphotericin B, and the standard 2 weeks of amphotericin B) for the induction treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole were also evaluated as partner drugs with amphotericin B.\n\n【19】Participants were recruited from nine African centers: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, and Zomba Central Hospital, Zomba, Malawi; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; Muhimbili, Amana, and Mwananyamala Hospitals, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; and Hôpital Central, Yaoundé, and Douala General Hospital, Douala, Cameroon. The protocol was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by all the site national research ethics committees and regulatory bodies. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or, in the case of patients with altered mental status, from the next of kin (consent was obtained from these patients after recovery).\n\n【20】Lateral-flow cryptococcal antigen tests were donated by or purchased from IMMY. Trial drugs were purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb (amphotericin B \\[Fungizone\\]), Meda Pharmaceuticals (flucytosine), and Cipla or Medopharm (fluconazole). In places where the Pfizer fluconazole donation program was running, donated fluconazole was used when available. The trial funders, suppliers, and drug manufacturers had no role in trial design; data collection, analysis, and interpretation; or manuscript preparation. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】Trial Participants\n------------------\n\n【22】HIV-seropositive adults (≥18 years old) with a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis who tested positive on India ink staining, cryptococcal antigen assay, or both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were included. Patients were excluded if they had previously received more than one dose of amphotericin B or more than one treatment dose (1200 mg) or more than seven low doses (200 mg) of fluconazole in the 2 weeks before screening, were pregnant or lactating, were taking contraindicated concomitant drugs, or had any previous adverse reactions to the trial drugs.\n\n【23】An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that was more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count that was less than 500 per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count that was less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter were late-exclusion criteria (i.e., a patient who met one or more of these criteria at baseline was withdrawn from the trial). In addition, if an elevated creatinine level remained above 220 μmol per liter on the day after randomization despite the patient receiving rehydration, the patient was withdrawn from the trial.\n\n【24】Initially, patients were excluded if they had previously been exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, because it became clear that a large number of patients were presenting with cryptococcal meningitis while taking ART or with previous exposure to ART, soon after commencement of the trial (after 4% of total enrollment), a protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of these patients. Full details of the trial design can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.\n\n【25】Interventions and Randomization\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】We assessed three treatment strategies (the use of an oral regimen, a 1-week amphotericin B regimen, and a 2-week amphotericin B regimen), as well as two alternative partner drugs for amphotericin B (fluconazole or flucytosine). The oral regimen consisted of fluconazole (1200 mg per day) plus flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) given orally for 2 weeks. The 1-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 7 days, followed on days 8 through 14 by fluconazole (1200 mg per day). The 2-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 14 days.\n\n【27】Patients underwent block randomization individually, stratified according to site, to one of the three treatment strategies and, for patients who were assigned to an amphotericin B regimen, to one of the two partner drugs. Overall, this strategy resulted in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio of patients assigned to receive one of the five combinations of treatment strategy and partner drug with amphotericin B. For each site, a computer-generated randomization list with block sizes of 18, 24, and 30 was produced. The trial pharmacist and clinician were responsible for conducting the randomization by sequentially drawing sealed envelopes that contained the treatment assignment for each enrolled patient.\n\n【28】Patients who received amphotericin B were given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously daily in addition to usual fluid requirements and preemptive potassium and magnesium (glycerophosphate) supplementation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Oral medications were given through a nasogastric tube if the patient was unable to swallow. Laboratory blood tests were performed regularly during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Baseline and day 7 electrocardiographic monitoring was discontinued at the advice of the data and safety monitoring committee after 100 paired electrocardiograms showed no evidence of clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval in association with fluconazole at a dose of 1200 mg per day. Lumbar punctures were performed at baseline and on days 7 and 14 for quantitative cultures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In addition, patients with high CSF pressure underwent daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until the pressure was controlled. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Patients were followed for 10 weeks after randomization. After 2 weeks, fluconazole was given at 800 mg per day until ART was started at 4 weeks (or restarted in those who had discontinued ART), at 400 mg per day until 10 weeks, and at 200 mg per day thereafter. ART was prescribed in accordance with national guidelines.\n\n【29】End Points\n----------\n\n【30】The primary end point for comparison of the two experimental treatment strategies with the standard therapy of 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based treatment was all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. Two weeks was chosen in view of the noninferiority design of the trial and the fact that mortality at 2 weeks is more likely than mortality at later time points to reflect deaths from cryptococcal meningitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Secondary end points included 4-week and 10-week all-cause mortality, the rate of decrease in the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over 14 days, and clinical and laboratory-defined grade 3 and 4 adverse events.\n\n【31】For the comparison between partner drugs for the amphotericin B regimens, the primary end point was all-cause mortality at 10 weeks. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, rate of clearance of infection, and adverse events.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】A target enrollment of 680 patients (226 per strategy) was set in order to achieve 90% power to show noninferiority with a 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin and under the assumption of 15% mortality at 2 weeks in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. For the comparison of the partner drugs with amphotericin B, with the use of a superiority design and under the assumption of a 10-week mortality of 40% with one partner treatment, the trial had 90% power to detect a 35% lower mortality with the alternative partner treatment.\n\n【34】The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and identity link function was used to calculate differences and upper limits of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the primary end point with a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval, the upper limit of which is equivalent to the upper limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval and the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction (α=0.025) for two comparisons, was also performed. Correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to the analyses of secondary outcomes. The per-protocol population excluded patients who missed more than 1 day of treatment within the first 2 weeks after randomization.\n\n【35】All-cause mortality at 2, 4, and 10 weeks was compared between the groups with the use of log-rank tests. Kaplan–Meier plots were also constructed, and Cox regression models with treatment as a predictor were used to derive hazard ratios and two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were also performed with adjustment for prespecified covariates: site, age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CD4+ cell count, CSF fungal count at baseline, and ART status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses of all-cause mortality were performed under the assumption that all the patients who were lost to follow-up had died.\n\n【36】The analysis of the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over a period of 14 days from baseline was performed with a linear mixed-effects model. For comparison with previous studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> linear regression was also used to calculate slopes of the decrease in CSF fungal count for each patient, and the mean slopes were compared between the groups.\n\n【37】All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【40】Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【42】From January 2013 through November 2016, a total of 721 patients underwent randomization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these patients, 43 were excluded from all analyses: 30 met predefined late-exclusion criteria, 3 immediately withdrew consent, 7 were negative for cryptococcal meningitis, and 3 had had cryptococcal meningitis previously. A total of 16 patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: 14 missed more than 1 day of treatment within the 2-week induction period, and 2 did not receive the correct randomly assigned treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in the treatment groups and reflected the severity of immunosuppression in the population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In total, 59% of patients were taking or had previously taken ART. Patients who had never taken ART started the therapy at a median of 28 days (interquartile range, 27 to 34) after randomization.\n\n【43】Mortality\n---------\n\n【44】Table 2. Table 2.

Panel D shows a noninferiority graph for differences in all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. The differences in the risk of death and the two-sided 90% confidence intervals for both between-group comparisons in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses are shown. The dashed line indicates the prespecified noninferiority margin.\n\n【46】A total of 678 patients were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these patients, 1 was lost to follow-up within 2 weeks and 3 were lost to follow-up between 2 weeks and 10 weeks. Mortality was similar in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups: 18.2%, 21.9%, and 21.4%, respectively, at 2 weeks and 35.1%, 36.2%, and 39.7%, respectively, at 10 weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2A )</u>. The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mortality at 2 weeks (primary end point) was 3.0 percentage points for the comparison of the oral-regimen group with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P<0.001) and 6.8 percentage points for the comparison of the 1-week amphotericin B groups with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P=0.007) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D )</u>. The upper limits of the one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction for the comparisons) both remained below the noninferiority margin 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The hazard ratios for death at 2 weeks, as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B groups, were 0.82 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.25) in the oral-regimen group and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51) in the 1-week amphotericin B groups; the corresponding hazard ratios for death at 10 weeks were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.21) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The results were similar in the per-protocol analysis, adjusted analysis, and sensitivity analyses 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D , and Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Table 3.

Unadjusted Time-to-Event Analysis of Mortality and Rate of Fungal Clearance in CSF According to Treatment Strategy and Partner Treatment with Amphotericin B in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【48】As partner treatment with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks with flucytosine vs. fluconazole, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Figure 2B )</u>. This difference was driven by a difference in mortality between the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group and the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group. The results of separate analyses of the five groups are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2C , with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group as the comparator. The 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group had the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1), significantly lower than any other amphotericin B group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.56 \\[95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91\\], and adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59 \\[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96\\], as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group). The hazard ratio for death by 10 weeks, with the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group used as the comparator, was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.42) in the oral-regimen group, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.60 to 4.05) in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group, and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.17) in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【49】There was no significant difference in mortality between patients who had never taken ART and those who had previously been exposed to ART 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Rate of Clearance of Infection\n------------------------------\n\n【51】The rate of clearance of infection (measured as the decrease in log <sub>10 </sub> colony-forming units per milliliter of CSF per day) was similar in the 1-week and 2-week amphotericin B groups and more rapid in the amphotericin B groups than in the oral-regimen group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Flucytosine as the partner drug given with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance than fluconazole 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Results were similar when linear regression was used, as in previous studies 删除2:<u>(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Safety\n------\n\n【53】Table 5.  Table 5. Laboratory-Defined and Clinical Adverse Events That Occurred within 21 Days after Randomization, According to Treatment Strategy.\n\n【54】Laboratory-defined side effects were less frequent in the oral-regimen group than in the 1-week or 2-week amphotericin B groups 删除2:<u>( Table 5 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Grade 4 anemia developed in 0.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 4.9% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups; the median decrease from baseline in hemoglobin level over the first 2 weeks was 0.4, 1.8, and 2.7 g per deciliter, respectively, and 5.5%, 10.3%, and 20.2%, respectively, of patients in each group received a transfusion. A grade 3 or 4 increase in the serum creatinine level developed in 4.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 6.2% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in only one patient, most likely because preemptive electrolyte replacement was provided for patients receiving amphotericin B. Grade 4 neutropenia was recorded in 3.2% of the patients who were taking a regimen that included 2 weeks of flucytosine, in 0.9% of those taking 1 week of flucytosine, and in 1.3% of those taking a flucytosine-free regimen. A grade 4 increase in the alanine aminotransferase level developed in only two patients, one of whom was taking fluconazole. Clinical adverse events were frequent with all regimens, which was reflective of the severe immunosuppression in this patient population.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this trial, we recruited patients from centers in southern, eastern, and central Africa, where the burden of cryptococcal meningitis is highest. We found that combination oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine and shorter-course 1-week amphotericin B–based treatment were noninferior to 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based therapy and that, as the partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was associated with lower mortality than fluconazole. This latter difference was driven by the superiority of flucytosine to fluconazole in the 1-week amphotericin B groups. Indeed, although caution is appropriate in interpreting these results, given the secondary nature of the comparisons involved, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates than the other regimens, although the difference only just met the criteria for significance in the comparison with the oral combination and, in an adjusted analysis, in the comparison with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine regimen.\n\n【57】The results were consistent in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, as well as in adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Few patients (0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Patients with severe disease were not excluded, so that the study population reflected patients presenting at centers across Africa. Also supportive of the generalizability of the results was the finding that mortality in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group (41.3% at 10 weeks) was the same as that seen in the placebo group of the recent multicenter trial of adjunctive glucocorticoids in which the same antifungal regimen was used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】The results were consistent with those in animal models and in our phase 2 studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-13 </a></sup></u> and may reflect, at least in part, a balance between the rate of clearance of infection and the drug-related side effects. Flucytosine as the partner drug with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance of infection than fluconazole and had a similar side-effect profile, as was previously shown in a study in Vietnam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Clearance of infection was as rapid in the 1-week amphotericin B groups as it was in the 2-week amphotericin B groups, and, as expected, the shorter regimens had fewer side effects, with, in particular, less anemia. Our results with 1 week of amphotericin B–flucytosine lend further support to the concept of prolonged efficacy after an initial loading of brain compartments with amphotericin B, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,21 </a></sup></u> as was also recently shown with the use of a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Of note, we implemented full preemptive management and monitoring of amphotericin B toxic effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> It is likely that in resource-limited settings, the challenges of transfusion and monitoring would further disadvantage the 2-week amphotericin B regimens, as evidenced by the continued very high mortality rates reported from African centers where 2 weeks of amphotericin B has been used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> The amphotericin B–free oral combination regimen had few laboratory-defined side effects and also had efficacy, despite slower clearance of infection.\n\n【59】All the best-performing regimens in our trial contained flucytosine. In particular, mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group was significantly lower than that in the other amphotericin B groups, whereas mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group was the highest. It may be that the more effective partner drug is particularly important in the context of shorter courses of amphotericin B. In addition to rapid fungicidal activity, flucytosine may also have other properties, such as a more prolonged postantibiotic effect than fluconazole, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> to help explain this difference.\n\n【60】Despite the fact that patients in resource-limited settings have access to ART, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is not decreasing in many centers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> Widespread availability of generic flucytosine is urgently needed as an essential part of global programs to reduce HIV-related mortality, as is continued investigation into new drug therapies. Efforts by international agencies to make flucytosine available are gaining momentum. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,15,28,29</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in our trial, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was the most effective option for induction therapy for patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. Our results also suggest that in the absence of availability of amphotericin B or in conditions in which amphotericin B cannot be administered safely, the oral combination of fluconazole plus flucytosine provides an effective and sustainable alternative.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Medical Research Council , United Kingdom (100504) and the French Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis ( ANRS ) ( ANRS 12275), a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust UK (to the Malawi–Liverpool–Wellcome Clinical Research Programme), and a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (2 P30-AI50410-14 to the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research, with support to Dr. van der Horst).

We tested two treatment strategies that could be more sustainable in Africa than the standard of 2 weeks of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and more effective than the widely used fluconazole monotherapy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis to receive an oral regimen (fluconazole \\[1200 mg per day\\] plus flucytosine \\[100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day\\] for 2 weeks), 1 week of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day), or 2 weeks of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day). Each patient assigned to receive amphotericin B was also randomly assigned to receive fluconazole or flucytosine as a partner drug. After induction treatment, all the patients received fluconazole consolidation therapy and were followed to 10 weeks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 721 patients underwent randomization. Mortality in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups was 18.2% (41 of 225), 21.9% (49 of 224), and 21.4% (49 of 229), respectively, at 2 weeks and was 35.1% (79 of 225), 36.2% (81 of 224), and 39.7% (91 of 229), respectively, at 10 weeks. The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in 2-week mortality was 4.2 percentage points for the oral-regimen group versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups and 8.1 percentage points for the 1-week amphotericin B groups versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups, both of which were below the predefined 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin. As a partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (71 deaths \\[31.1%\\] vs. 101 deaths \\[45.0%\\]; hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks, 0.62; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002). One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1). Side effects, such as severe anemia, were more frequent with 2 weeks than with 1 week of amphotericin B or with the oral regimen.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine were effective as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. <mark>(ACTA Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN45035509 . opens in new tab .)</mark>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of adult meningitis in many regions that have a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and accounts for 10 to 20% of all HIV-related deaths, with more than 100,000 deaths each year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This high burden is driven by a high case fatality rate, which in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 70% at 3 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is challenging. The international standard induction treatment of 2 weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus flucytosine 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> is not available in most African clinical centers. Amphotericin B requires intravenous administration and close laboratory monitoring and is associated with phlebitis, secondary infections, anemia, and renal impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Flucytosine is currently unavailable, although the molecule is used widely as a constituent of emtricitabine, and generic manufacture is possible at low cost. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Most countries therefore rely on generic or donated fluconazole induction monotherapy; however, the rate of fungal clearance with fluconazole is slower than that with amphotericin B, even at an elevated dosage, and mortality associated with this treatment is 50 to 60% at 10 weeks and is higher than 70% at 1 year even in study cohorts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Phase 2 studies have defined several promising treatment strategies that are associated with fungal clearance similar to that with 2-week amphotericin B regimens and that have more favorable safety profiles. An oral combination of fluconazole and flucytosine was found to be associated with a rate of clearance of infection similar to that with amphotericin B alone and to be associated with higher survival rates than those with fluconazole alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Shorter-course amphotericin B had a more favorable side-effect profile than standard 2-week courses, with no diminution in the rate of clearance of infection in the second week, perhaps because of the long half-life of amphotericin B in brain tissue. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> The efficacy of shorter-course amphotericin B treatment has also been shown in animal models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】In addition, the drug of choice to combine with amphotericin B remains unclear. In a previous trial, amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates at day 70 than amphotericin B alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Amphotericin B plus flucytosine was not found to differ from amphotericin B plus fluconazole with regard to mortality at 10 weeks, but the results of a secondary analysis at 6 months favored flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, these results have been insufficient to drive wider availability of flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】Therefore, we tested two new treatment strategies that could be more readily sustainable in African centers than 2 weeks of amphotericin B and more effective than fluconazole: oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine, and a shorter course (1 week) of induction therapy with amphotericin B–based treatment. These regimens were compared with a 2-week regimen of amphotericin B–based treatment. In addition, within the amphotericin B groups, we randomly assigned patients to receive either flucytosine or fluconazole as the partner drug.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】We conducted an open-label, phase 3, randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial (Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa \\[ACTA\\]) to compare three treatment strategies (an oral combination regimen of fluconazole plus flucytosine, 1 week of amphotericin B, and the standard 2 weeks of amphotericin B) for the induction treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole were also evaluated as partner drugs with amphotericin B.\n\n【19】Participants were recruited from nine African centers: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, and Zomba Central Hospital, Zomba, Malawi; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; Muhimbili, Amana, and Mwananyamala Hospitals, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; and Hôpital Central, Yaoundé, and Douala General Hospital, Douala, Cameroon. The protocol was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by all the site national research ethics committees and regulatory bodies. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or, in the case of patients with altered mental status, from the next of kin (consent was obtained from these patients after recovery).\n\n【20】Lateral-flow cryptococcal antigen tests were donated by or purchased from IMMY. Trial drugs were purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb (amphotericin B \\[Fungizone\\]), Meda Pharmaceuticals (flucytosine), and Cipla or Medopharm (fluconazole). In places where the Pfizer fluconazole donation program was running, donated fluconazole was used when available. The trial funders, suppliers, and drug manufacturers had no role in trial design; data collection, analysis, and interpretation; or manuscript preparation. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】Trial Participants\n------------------\n\n【22】HIV-seropositive adults (≥18 years old) with a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis who tested positive on India ink staining, cryptococcal antigen assay, or both in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were included. Patients were excluded if they had previously received more than one dose of amphotericin B or more than one treatment dose (1200 mg) or more than seven low doses (200 mg) of fluconazole in the 2 weeks before screening, were pregnant or lactating, were taking contraindicated concomitant drugs, or had any previous adverse reactions to the trial drugs.\n\n【23】An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that was more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count that was less than 500 per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count that was less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter were late-exclusion criteria (i.e., a patient who met one or more of these criteria at baseline was withdrawn from the trial). In addition, if an elevated creatinine level remained above 220 μmol per liter on the day after randomization despite the patient receiving rehydration, the patient was withdrawn from the trial.\n\n【24】Initially, patients were excluded if they had previously been exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, because it became clear that a large number of patients were presenting with cryptococcal meningitis while taking ART or with previous exposure to ART, soon after commencement of the trial (after 4% of total enrollment), a protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of these patients. Full details of the trial design can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.\n\n【25】Interventions and Randomization\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】We assessed three treatment strategies (the use of an oral regimen, a 1-week amphotericin B regimen, and a 2-week amphotericin B regimen), as well as two alternative partner drugs for amphotericin B (fluconazole or flucytosine). The oral regimen consisted of fluconazole (1200 mg per day) plus flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) given orally for 2 weeks. The 1-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 7 days, followed on days 8 through 14 by fluconazole (1200 mg per day). The 2-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 14 days.\n\n【27】Patients underwent block randomization individually, stratified according to site, to one of the three treatment strategies and, for patients who were assigned to an amphotericin B regimen, to one of the two partner drugs. Overall, this strategy resulted in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio of patients assigned to receive one of the five combinations of treatment strategy and partner drug with amphotericin B. For each site, a computer-generated randomization list with block sizes of 18, 24, and 30 was produced. The trial pharmacist and clinician were responsible for conducting the randomization by sequentially drawing sealed envelopes that contained the treatment assignment for each enrolled patient.\n\n【28】Patients who received amphotericin B were given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously daily in addition to usual fluid requirements and preemptive potassium and magnesium (glycerophosphate) supplementation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Oral medications were given through a nasogastric tube if the patient was unable to swallow. Laboratory blood tests were performed regularly during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Baseline and day 7 electrocardiographic monitoring was discontinued at the advice of the data and safety monitoring committee after 100 paired electrocardiograms showed no evidence of clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval in association with fluconazole at a dose of 1200 mg per day. Lumbar punctures were performed at baseline and on days 7 and 14 for quantitative cultures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In addition, patients with high CSF pressure underwent daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until the pressure was controlled. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Patients were followed for 10 weeks after randomization. After 2 weeks, fluconazole was given at 800 mg per day until ART was started at 4 weeks (or restarted in those who had discontinued ART), at 400 mg per day until 10 weeks, and at 200 mg per day thereafter. ART was prescribed in accordance with national guidelines.\n\n【29】End Points\n----------\n\n【30】The primary end point for comparison of the two experimental treatment strategies with the standard therapy of 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based treatment was all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. Two weeks was chosen in view of the noninferiority design of the trial and the fact that mortality at 2 weeks is more likely than mortality at later time points to reflect deaths from cryptococcal meningitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Secondary end points included 4-week and 10-week all-cause mortality, the rate of decrease in the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over 14 days, and clinical and laboratory-defined grade 3 and 4 adverse events.\n\n【31】For the comparison between partner drugs for the amphotericin B regimens, the primary end point was all-cause mortality at 10 weeks. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, rate of clearance of infection, and adverse events.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】A target enrollment of 680 patients (226 per strategy) was set in order to achieve 90% power to show noninferiority with a 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin and under the assumption of 15% mortality at 2 weeks in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. For the comparison of the partner drugs with amphotericin B, with the use of a superiority design and under the assumption of a 10-week mortality of 40% with one partner treatment, the trial had 90% power to detect a 35% lower mortality with the alternative partner treatment.\n\n【34】The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and identity link function was used to calculate differences and upper limits of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the primary end point with a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval, the upper limit of which is equivalent to the upper limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval and the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction (α=0.025) for two comparisons, was also performed. Correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to the analyses of secondary outcomes. The per-protocol population excluded patients who missed more than 1 day of treatment within the first 2 weeks after randomization.\n\n【35】All-cause mortality at 2, 4, and 10 weeks was compared between the groups with the use of log-rank tests. Kaplan–Meier plots were also constructed, and Cox regression models with treatment as a predictor were used to derive hazard ratios and two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were also performed with adjustment for prespecified covariates: site, age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CD4+ cell count, CSF fungal count at baseline, and ART status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses of all-cause mortality were performed under the assumption that all the patients who were lost to follow-up had died.\n\n【36】The analysis of the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over a period of 14 days from baseline was performed with a linear mixed-effects model. For comparison with previous studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> linear regression was also used to calculate slopes of the decrease in CSF fungal count for each patient, and the mean slopes were compared between the groups.\n\n【37】All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【40】Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【42】From January 2013 through November 2016, a total of 721 patients underwent randomization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these patients, 43 were excluded from all analyses: 30 met predefined late-exclusion criteria, 3 immediately withdrew consent, 7 were negative for cryptococcal meningitis, and 3 had had cryptococcal meningitis previously. A total of 16 patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: 14 missed more than 1 day of treatment within the 2-week induction period, and 2 did not receive the correct randomly assigned treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in the treatment groups and reflected the severity of immunosuppression in the population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In total, 59% of patients were taking or had previously taken ART. Patients who had never taken ART started the therapy at a median of 28 days (interquartile range, 27 to 34) after randomization.\n\n【43】Mortality\n---------\n\n【44】Table 2. Table 2.

Panel D shows a noninferiority graph for differences in all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. The differences in the risk of death and the two-sided 90% confidence intervals for both between-group comparisons in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses are shown. The dashed line indicates the prespecified noninferiority margin.\n\n【46】A total of 678 patients were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these patients, 1 was lost to follow-up within 2 weeks and 3 were lost to follow-up between 2 weeks and 10 weeks. Mortality was similar in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups: 18.2%, 21.9%, and 21.4%, respectively, at 2 weeks and 35.1%, 36.2%, and 39.7%, respectively, at 10 weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2A )</u>. The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mortality at 2 weeks (primary end point) was 3.0 percentage points for the comparison of the oral-regimen group with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P<0.001) and 6.8 percentage points for the comparison of the 1-week amphotericin B groups with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P=0.007) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D )</u>. The upper limits of the one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction for the comparisons) both remained below the noninferiority margin 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The hazard ratios for death at 2 weeks, as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B groups, were 0.82 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.25) in the oral-regimen group and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51) in the 1-week amphotericin B groups; the corresponding hazard ratios for death at 10 weeks were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.21) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The results were similar in the per-protocol analysis, adjusted analysis, and sensitivity analyses 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D , and Tables S4, S5, and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Table 3.

Unadjusted Time-to-Event Analysis of Mortality and Rate of Fungal Clearance in CSF According to Treatment Strategy and Partner Treatment with Amphotericin B in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【48】As partner treatment with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks with flucytosine vs. fluconazole, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Figure 2B )</u>. This difference was driven by a difference in mortality between the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group and the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group. The results of separate analyses of the five groups are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2C , with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group as the comparator. The 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group had the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1), significantly lower than any other amphotericin B group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.56 \\[95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91\\], and adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59 \\[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96\\], as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group). The hazard ratio for death by 10 weeks, with the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group used as the comparator, was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.42) in the oral-regimen group, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.60 to 4.05) in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group, and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.17) in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【49】There was no significant difference in mortality between patients who had never taken ART and those who had previously been exposed to ART 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Rate of Clearance of Infection\n------------------------------\n\n【51】The rate of clearance of infection (measured as the decrease in log <sub>10 </sub> colony-forming units per milliliter of CSF per day) was similar in the 1-week and 2-week amphotericin B groups and more rapid in the amphotericin B groups than in the oral-regimen group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Flucytosine as the partner drug given with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance than fluconazole 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Results were similar when linear regression was used, as in previous studies 删除2:<u>(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Safety\n------\n\n【53】Table 5.  Table 5. Laboratory-Defined and Clinical Adverse Events That Occurred within 21 Days after Randomization, According to Treatment Strategy.\n\n【54】Laboratory-defined side effects were less frequent in the oral-regimen group than in the 1-week or 2-week amphotericin B groups 删除2:<u>( Table 5 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Grade 4 anemia developed in 0.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 4.9% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups; the median decrease from baseline in hemoglobin level over the first 2 weeks was 0.4, 1.8, and 2.7 g per deciliter, respectively, and 5.5%, 10.3%, and 20.2%, respectively, of patients in each group received a transfusion. A grade 3 or 4 increase in the serum creatinine level developed in 4.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 6.2% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in only one patient, most likely because preemptive electrolyte replacement was provided for patients receiving amphotericin B. Grade 4 neutropenia was recorded in 3.2% of the patients who were taking a regimen that included 2 weeks of flucytosine, in 0.9% of those taking 1 week of flucytosine, and in 1.3% of those taking a flucytosine-free regimen. A grade 4 increase in the alanine aminotransferase level developed in only two patients, one of whom was taking fluconazole. Clinical adverse events were frequent with all regimens, which was reflective of the severe immunosuppression in this patient population.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this trial, we recruited patients from centers in southern, eastern, and central Africa, where the burden of cryptococcal meningitis is highest. We found that combination oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine and shorter-course 1-week amphotericin B–based treatment were noninferior to 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based therapy and that, as the partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was associated with lower mortality than fluconazole. This latter difference was driven by the superiority of flucytosine to fluconazole in the 1-week amphotericin B groups. Indeed, although caution is appropriate in interpreting these results, given the secondary nature of the comparisons involved, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates than the other regimens, although the difference only just met the criteria for significance in the comparison with the oral combination and, in an adjusted analysis, in the comparison with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine regimen.\n\n【57】The results were consistent in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, as well as in adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Few patients (0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Patients with severe disease were not excluded, so that the study population reflected patients presenting at centers across Africa. Also supportive of the generalizability of the results was the finding that mortality in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group (41.3% at 10 weeks) was the same as that seen in the placebo group of the recent multicenter trial of adjunctive glucocorticoids in which the same antifungal regimen was used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】The results were consistent with those in animal models and in our phase 2 studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-13 </a></sup></u> and may reflect, at least in part, a balance between the rate of clearance of infection and the drug-related side effects. Flucytosine as the partner drug with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance of infection than fluconazole and had a similar side-effect profile, as was previously shown in a study in Vietnam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Clearance of infection was as rapid in the 1-week amphotericin B groups as it was in the 2-week amphotericin B groups, and, as expected, the shorter regimens had fewer side effects, with, in particular, less anemia. Our results with 1 week of amphotericin B–flucytosine lend further support to the concept of prolonged efficacy after an initial loading of brain compartments with amphotericin B, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,21 </a></sup></u> as was also recently shown with the use of a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Of note, we implemented full preemptive management and monitoring of amphotericin B toxic effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> It is likely that in resource-limited settings, the challenges of transfusion and monitoring would further disadvantage the 2-week amphotericin B regimens, as evidenced by the continued very high mortality rates reported from African centers where 2 weeks of amphotericin B has been used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> The amphotericin B–free oral combination regimen had few laboratory-defined side effects and also had efficacy, despite slower clearance of infection.\n\n【59】All the best-performing regimens in our trial contained flucytosine. In particular, mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group was significantly lower than that in the other amphotericin B groups, whereas mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group was the highest. It may be that the more effective partner drug is particularly important in the context of shorter courses of amphotericin B. In addition to rapid fungicidal activity, flucytosine may also have other properties, such as a more prolonged postantibiotic effect than fluconazole, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> to help explain this difference.\n\n【60】Despite the fact that patients in resource-limited settings have access to ART, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is not decreasing in many centers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> Widespread availability of generic flucytosine is urgently needed as an essential part of global programs to reduce HIV-related mortality, as is continued investigation into new drug therapies. Efforts by international agencies to make flucytosine available are gaining momentum. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,15,28,29</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in our trial, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was the most effective option for induction therapy for patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. Our results also suggest that in the absence of availability of amphotericin B or in conditions in which amphotericin B cannot be administered safely, the oral combination of fluconazole plus flucytosine provides an effective and sustainable alternative.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Medical Research Council , United Kingdom (100504) and the French Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis ( ANRS ) ( ANRS 12275), a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust UK (to the Malawi–Liverpool–Wellcome Clinical Research Programme), and a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (2 P30-AI50410-14 to the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research, with support to Dr. van der Horst).

We tested two treatment strategies that could be more sustainable in Africa than the standard of 2 weeks of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and more effective than the widely used fluconazole monotherapy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis to receive an oral regimen (fluconazole \\[1200 mg per day\\] plus flucytosine \\[100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day\\] for 2 weeks), 1 week of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day), or 2 weeks of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day). Each patient assigned to receive amphotericin B was also randomly assigned to receive fluconazole or flucytosine as a partner drug. After induction treatment, all the patients received fluconazole consolidation therapy and were followed to 10 weeks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 721 patients underwent randomization. Mortality in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups was 18.2% (41 of 225), 21.9% (49 of 224), and 21.4% (49 of 229), respectively, at 2 weeks and was 35.1% (79 of 225), 36.2% (81 of 224), and 39.7% (91 of 229), respectively, at 10 weeks. The upper limit of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in 2-week mortality was 4.2 percentage points for the oral-regimen group versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups and 8.1 percentage points for the 1-week amphotericin B groups versus the 2-week amphotericin B groups, both of which were below the predefined 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin. As a partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (71 deaths \\[31.1%\\] vs. 101 deaths \\[45.0%\\]; hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks, 0.62; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002). One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1). Side effects, such as severe anemia, were more frequent with 2 weeks than with 1 week of amphotericin B or with the oral regimen.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】One week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 2 weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine were effective as induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. <mark>(ACTA Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN45035509 . opens in new tab .)</mark>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common form of adult meningitis in many regions that have a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and accounts for 10 to 20% of all HIV-related deaths, with more than 100,000 deaths each year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This high burden is driven by a high case fatality rate, which in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 70% at 3 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is challenging. The international standard induction treatment of 2 weeks of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus flucytosine 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> is not available in most African clinical centers. Amphotericin B requires intravenous administration and close laboratory monitoring and is associated with phlebitis, secondary infections, anemia, and renal impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Flucytosine is currently unavailable, although the molecule is used widely as a constituent of emtricitabine, and generic manufacture is possible at low cost. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Most countries therefore rely on generic or donated fluconazole induction monotherapy; however, the rate of fungal clearance with fluconazole is slower than that with amphotericin B, even at an elevated dosage, and mortality associated with this treatment is 50 to 60% at 10 weeks and is higher than 70% at 1 year even in study cohorts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Phase 2 studies have defined several promising treatment strategies that are associated with fungal clearance similar to that with 2-week amphotericin B regimens and that have more favorable safety profiles. An oral combination of fluconazole and flucytosine was found to be associated with a rate of clearance of infection similar to that with amphotericin B alone and to be associated with higher survival rates than those with fluconazole alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Shorter-course amphotericin B had a more favorable side-effect profile than standard 2-week courses, with no diminution in the rate of clearance of infection in the second week, perhaps because of the long half-life of amphotericin B in brain tissue. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> The efficacy of shorter-course amphotericin B treatment has also been shown in animal models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】In addition, the drug of choice to combine with amphotericin B remains unclear. In a previous trial, amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates at day 70 than amphotericin B alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Amphotericin B plus flucytosine was not found to differ from amphotericin B plus fluconazole with regard to mortality at 10 weeks, but the results of a secondary analysis at 6 months favored flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, these results have been insufficient to drive wider availability of flucytosine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】Therefore, we tested two new treatment strategies that could be more readily sustainable in African centers than 2 weeks of amphotericin B and more effective than fluconazole: oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine, and a shorter course (1 week) of induction therapy with amphotericin B–based treatment. These regimens were compared with a 2-week regimen of amphotericin B–based treatment. In addition, within the amphotericin B groups, we randomly assigned patients to receive either flucytosine or fluconazole as the partner drug.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】We conducted an open-label, phase 3, randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial (Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa \\[ACTA\\]) to compare three treatment strategies (an oral combination regimen of fluconazole plus flucytosine, 1 week of amphotericin B, and the standard 2 weeks of amphotericin B) for the induction treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Flucytosine and fluconazole were also evaluated as partner drugs with amphotericin B.\n\n【19】Participants were recruited from nine African centers: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, and Zomba Central Hospital, Zomba, Malawi; University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia; Muhimbili, Amana, and Mwananyamala Hospitals, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; and Hôpital Central, Yaoundé, and Douala General Hospital, Douala, Cameroon. The protocol was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee and by all the site national research ethics committees and regulatory bodies. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or, in the case of patients with altered mental status, from the next of kin (consent was obtained from these patients after recovery).\n\n【20】Lateral-flow cryptococcal antigen tests were donated by or purchased from IMMY. Trial drugs were purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb (amphotericin B \\[Fungizone\\]), Meda Pharmaceuticals (flucytosine), and Cipla or Medopharm (fluconazole). In places where the Pfizer fluconazole donation program was running, donated fluconazole was used when available. The trial funders, suppliers, and drug manufacturers had no role in trial design; data collection, analysis, and interpretation; or manuscript preparation.

Patients were excluded if they had previously received more than one dose of amphotericin B or more than one treatment dose (1200 mg) or more than seven low doses (200 mg) of fluconazole in the 2 weeks before screening, were pregnant or lactating, were taking contraindicated concomitant drugs, or had any previous adverse reactions to the trial drugs.\n\n【23】An alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level that was more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range, a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count that was less than 500 per cubic millimeter, or a platelet count that was less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter were late-exclusion criteria (i.e., a patient who met one or more of these criteria at baseline was withdrawn from the trial). In addition, if an elevated creatinine level remained above 220 μmol per liter on the day after randomization despite the patient receiving rehydration, the patient was withdrawn from the trial.\n\n【24】Initially, patients were excluded if they had previously been exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, because it became clear that a large number of patients were presenting with cryptococcal meningitis while taking ART or with previous exposure to ART, soon after commencement of the trial (after 4% of total enrollment), a protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of these patients. Full details of the trial design can be found in the protocol and statistical analysis plan.\n\n【25】Interventions and Randomization\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】We assessed three treatment strategies (the use of an oral regimen, a 1-week amphotericin B regimen, and a 2-week amphotericin B regimen), as well as two alternative partner drugs for amphotericin B (fluconazole or flucytosine). The oral regimen consisted of fluconazole (1200 mg per day) plus flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) given orally for 2 weeks. The 1-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 7 days, followed on days 8 through 14 by fluconazole (1200 mg per day). The 2-week amphotericin B regimen consisted of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day administered intravenously) plus either fluconazole (1200 mg per day) or flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) for 14 days.\n\n【27】Patients underwent block randomization individually, stratified according to site, to one of the three treatment strategies and, for patients who were assigned to an amphotericin B regimen, to one of the two partner drugs. Overall, this strategy resulted in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio of patients assigned to receive one of the five combinations of treatment strategy and partner drug with amphotericin B. For each site, a computer-generated randomization list with block sizes of 18, 24, and 30 was produced. The trial pharmacist and clinician were responsible for conducting the randomization by sequentially drawing sealed envelopes that contained the treatment assignment for each enrolled patient.\n\n【28】Patients who received amphotericin B were given 1 liter of normal saline intravenously daily in addition to usual fluid requirements and preemptive potassium and magnesium (glycerophosphate) supplementation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Oral medications were given through a nasogastric tube if the patient was unable to swallow. Laboratory blood tests were performed regularly during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Baseline and day 7 electrocardiographic monitoring was discontinued at the advice of the data and safety monitoring committee after 100 paired electrocardiograms showed no evidence of clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval in association with fluconazole at a dose of 1200 mg per day. Lumbar punctures were performed at baseline and on days 7 and 14 for quantitative cultures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In addition, patients with high CSF pressure underwent daily therapeutic lumbar punctures until the pressure was controlled. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Patients were followed for 10 weeks after randomization. After 2 weeks, fluconazole was given at 800 mg per day until ART was started at 4 weeks (or restarted in those who had discontinued ART), at 400 mg per day until 10 weeks, and at 200 mg per day thereafter. ART was prescribed in accordance with national guidelines.\n\n【29】End Points\n----------\n\n【30】The primary end point for comparison of the two experimental treatment strategies with the standard therapy of 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based treatment was all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. Two weeks was chosen in view of the noninferiority design of the trial and the fact that mortality at 2 weeks is more likely than mortality at later time points to reflect deaths from cryptococcal meningitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Secondary end points included 4-week and 10-week all-cause mortality, the rate of decrease in the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over 14 days, and clinical and laboratory-defined grade 3 and 4 adverse events.\n\n【31】For the comparison between partner drugs for the amphotericin B regimens, the primary end point was all-cause mortality at 10 weeks. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, rate of clearance of infection, and adverse events.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】A target enrollment of 680 patients (226 per strategy) was set in order to achieve 90% power to show noninferiority with a 10-percentage-point noninferiority margin and under the assumption of 15% mortality at 2 weeks in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. For the comparison of the partner drugs with amphotericin B, with the use of a superiority design and under the assumption of a 10-week mortality of 40% with one partner treatment, the trial had 90% power to detect a 35% lower mortality with the alternative partner treatment.\n\n【34】The primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat population. A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and identity link function was used to calculate differences and upper limits of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for mortality. Post-hoc analysis of the primary end point with a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval, the upper limit of which is equivalent to the upper limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval and the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction (α=0.025) for two comparisons, was also performed. Correction for multiple comparisons was not applied to the analyses of secondary outcomes. The per-protocol population excluded patients who missed more than 1 day of treatment within the first 2 weeks after randomization.\n\n【35】All-cause mortality at 2, 4, and 10 weeks was compared between the groups with the use of log-rank tests. Kaplan–Meier plots were also constructed, and Cox regression models with treatment as a predictor were used to derive hazard ratios and two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were also performed with adjustment for prespecified covariates: site, age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, CD4+ cell count, CSF fungal count at baseline, and ART status at baseline. Sensitivity analyses of all-cause mortality were performed under the assumption that all the patients who were lost to follow-up had died.\n\n【36】The analysis of the log <sub>10 </sub> CSF fungal count over a period of 14 days from baseline was performed with a linear mixed-effects model. For comparison with previous studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> linear regression was also used to calculate slopes of the decrease in CSF fungal count for each patient, and the mean slopes were compared between the groups.\n\n【37】All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).

Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【42】From January 2013 through November 2016, a total of 721 patients underwent randomization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these patients, 43 were excluded from all analyses: 30 met predefined late-exclusion criteria, 3 immediately withdrew consent, 7 were negative for cryptococcal meningitis, and 3 had had cryptococcal meningitis previously. A total of 16 patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis: 14 missed more than 1 day of treatment within the 2-week induction period, and 2 did not receive the correct randomly assigned treatment. Baseline characteristics were similar in the treatment groups and reflected the severity of immunosuppression in the population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In total, 59% of patients were taking or had previously taken ART. Patients who had never taken ART started the therapy at a median of 28 days (interquartile range, 27 to 34) after randomization.\n\n【43】Mortality\n---------\n\n【44】Table 2. Table 2.

Panel D shows a noninferiority graph for differences in all-cause mortality at 2 weeks. The differences in the risk of death and the two-sided 90% confidence intervals for both between-group comparisons in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses are shown. The dashed line indicates the prespecified noninferiority margin.\n\n【46】A total of 678 patients were eligible for inclusion in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these patients, 1 was lost to follow-up within 2 weeks and 3 were lost to follow-up between 2 weeks and 10 weeks. Mortality was similar in the oral-regimen, 1-week amphotericin B, and 2-week amphotericin B groups: 18.2%, 21.9%, and 21.4%, respectively, at 2 weeks and 35.1%, 36.2%, and 39.7%, respectively, at 10 weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2A )</u>. The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mortality at 2 weeks (primary end point) was 3.0 percentage points for the comparison of the oral-regimen group with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P<0.001) and 6.8 percentage points for the comparison of the 1-week amphotericin B groups with the 2-week amphotericin B groups (P=0.007) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D )</u>. The upper limits of the one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (the use of which is equivalent to applying a Bonferroni correction for the comparisons) both remained below the noninferiority margin 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The hazard ratios for death at 2 weeks, as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B groups, were 0.82 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.25) in the oral-regimen group and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.51) in the 1-week amphotericin B groups; the corresponding hazard ratios for death at 10 weeks were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.21) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.

Unadjusted Time-to-Event Analysis of Mortality and Rate of Fungal Clearance in CSF According to Treatment Strategy and Partner Treatment with Amphotericin B in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【48】As partner treatment with amphotericin B, flucytosine was superior to fluconazole (hazard ratio for death at 10 weeks with flucytosine vs. fluconazole, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P=0.002) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Figure 2B )</u>. This difference was driven by a difference in mortality between the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group and the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group. The results of separate analyses of the five groups are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2C , with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group as the comparator. The 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group had the lowest 10-week mortality (24.2%; 95% CI, 16.2 to 32.1), significantly lower than any other amphotericin B group (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.56 \\[95% CI, 0.35 to 0.91\\], and adjusted hazard ratio, 0.59 \\[95% CI, 0.36 to 0.96\\], as compared with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group). The hazard ratio for death by 10 weeks, with the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group used as the comparator, was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.42) in the oral-regimen group, 2.54 (95% CI, 1.60 to 4.05) in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group, and 1.97 (95% CI, 1.22 to 3.17) in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【49】There was no significant difference in mortality between patients who had never taken ART and those who had previously been exposed to ART 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Rate of Clearance of Infection\n------------------------------\n\n【51】The rate of clearance of infection (measured as the decrease in log <sub>10 </sub> colony-forming units per milliliter of CSF per day) was similar in the 1-week and 2-week amphotericin B groups and more rapid in the amphotericin B groups than in the oral-regimen group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Flucytosine as the partner drug given with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance than fluconazole 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Results were similar when linear regression was used, as in previous studies 删除2:<u>(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Safety\n------\n\n【53】Table 5.  Table 5. Laboratory-Defined and Clinical Adverse Events That Occurred within 21 Days after Randomization, According to Treatment Strategy.\n\n【54】Laboratory-defined side effects were less frequent in the oral-regimen group than in the 1-week or 2-week amphotericin B groups 删除2:<u>( Table 5 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Grade 4 anemia developed in 0.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 4.9% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups; the median decrease from baseline in hemoglobin level over the first 2 weeks was 0.4, 1.8, and 2.7 g per deciliter, respectively, and 5.5%, 10.3%, and 20.2%, respectively, of patients in each group received a transfusion. A grade 3 or 4 increase in the serum creatinine level developed in 4.9% of patients in the oral-regimen group, 6.2% of patients in the 1-week amphotericin B groups, and 8.8% of patients in the 2-week amphotericin B groups. Grade 4 hypokalemia developed in only one patient, most likely because preemptive electrolyte replacement was provided for patients receiving amphotericin B. Grade 4 neutropenia was recorded in 3.2% of the patients who were taking a regimen that included 2 weeks of flucytosine, in 0.9% of those taking 1 week of flucytosine, and in 1.3% of those taking a flucytosine-free regimen. A grade 4 increase in the alanine aminotransferase level developed in only two patients, one of whom was taking fluconazole. Clinical adverse events were frequent with all regimens, which was reflective of the severe immunosuppression in this patient population.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this trial, we recruited patients from centers in southern, eastern, and central Africa, where the burden of cryptococcal meningitis is highest. We found that combination oral therapy with higher-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine and shorter-course 1-week amphotericin B–based treatment were noninferior to 2 weeks of amphotericin B–based therapy and that, as the partner drug with amphotericin B, flucytosine was associated with lower mortality than fluconazole. This latter difference was driven by the superiority of flucytosine to fluconazole in the 1-week amphotericin B groups. Indeed, although caution is appropriate in interpreting these results, given the secondary nature of the comparisons involved, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was associated with higher survival rates than the other regimens, although the difference only just met the criteria for significance in the comparison with the oral combination and, in an adjusted analysis, in the comparison with the 2-week amphotericin B–flucytosine regimen.\n\n【57】The results were consistent in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, as well as in adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Few patients (0.6%) were lost to follow-up. Patients with severe disease were not excluded, so that the study population reflected patients presenting at centers across Africa. Also supportive of the generalizability of the results was the finding that mortality in the 2-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group (41.3% at 10 weeks) was the same as that seen in the placebo group of the recent multicenter trial of adjunctive glucocorticoids in which the same antifungal regimen was used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】The results were consistent with those in animal models and in our phase 2 studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-13 </a></sup></u> and may reflect, at least in part, a balance between the rate of clearance of infection and the drug-related side effects. Flucytosine as the partner drug with amphotericin B was associated with more rapid clearance of infection than fluconazole and had a similar side-effect profile, as was previously shown in a study in Vietnam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Clearance of infection was as rapid in the 1-week amphotericin B groups as it was in the 2-week amphotericin B groups, and, as expected, the shorter regimens had fewer side effects, with, in particular, less anemia. Our results with 1 week of amphotericin B–flucytosine lend further support to the concept of prolonged efficacy after an initial loading of brain compartments with amphotericin B, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,21 </a></sup></u> as was also recently shown with the use of a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin B. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Of note, we implemented full preemptive management and monitoring of amphotericin B toxic effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> It is likely that in resource-limited settings, the challenges of transfusion and monitoring would further disadvantage the 2-week amphotericin B regimens, as evidenced by the continued very high mortality rates reported from African centers where 2 weeks of amphotericin B has been used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> The amphotericin B–free oral combination regimen had few laboratory-defined side effects and also had efficacy, despite slower clearance of infection.\n\n【59】All the best-performing regimens in our trial contained flucytosine. In particular, mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–flucytosine group was significantly lower than that in the other amphotericin B groups, whereas mortality in the 1-week amphotericin B–fluconazole group was the highest. It may be that the more effective partner drug is particularly important in the context of shorter courses of amphotericin B. In addition to rapid fungicidal activity, flucytosine may also have other properties, such as a more prolonged postantibiotic effect than fluconazole, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> to help explain this difference.\n\n【60】Despite the fact that patients in resource-limited settings have access to ART, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis is not decreasing in many centers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> Widespread availability of generic flucytosine is urgently needed as an essential part of global programs to reduce HIV-related mortality, as is continued investigation into new drug therapies. Efforts by international agencies to make flucytosine available are gaining momentum. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,15,28,29</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In conclusion, in our trial, 1 week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine was the most effective option for induction therapy for patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings. Our results also suggest that in the absence of availability of amphotericin B or in conditions in which amphotericin B cannot be administered safely, the oral combination of fluconazole plus flucytosine provides an effective and sustainable alternative.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Medical Research Council , United Kingdom (100504) and the French Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis ( ANRS ) ( ANRS 12275), a strategic award from the Wellcome Trust UK (to the Malawi–Liverpool–Wellcome Clinical Research Programme), and a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (2 P30-AI50410-14 to the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research, with support to Dr. van der Horst).

We compared the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon alfa-2a (peginterferon alfa-2a) plus either ribavirin or placebo with those of interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients who were also infected with HIV.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】A total of 868 persons who were infected with both HIV and HCV and who had not previously been treated with interferon or ribavirin were randomly assigned to receive one of three regimens: peginterferon alfa-2a (180 μg per week) plus ribavirin (800 mg per day), peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, or interferon alfa-2a (3 million IU three times a week) plus ribavirin. Patients were treated for 48 weeks and followed for an additional 24 weeks. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response (defined as a serum HCV RNA level below 50 IU per milliliter at the end of follow-up, at week 72).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The overall rate of sustained virologic response was significantly higher among the recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin than among those assigned to interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (40 percent vs. 12 percent, P<0.001), or peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (40 percent vs. 20 percent, P<0.001). Among patients infected with HCV genotype 1, the rates of sustained virologic response were 29 percent with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, 14 percent with peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, and 7 percent with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. The corresponding rates among patients infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 were 62 percent, 36 percent, and 20 percent. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were more common among patients treated with regimens that contained peginterferon alfa-2a, and anemia was more common among patients treated with regimens containing ribavirin.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients infected with both HIV and HCV, the combination of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was significantly more effective than either interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin or peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Potent antiretroviral therapy has reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> At the same time, the pattern of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons has shifted, and clinicians responsible for the care of HIV-infected persons have been confronted with new challenges. Complications associated with concurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have emerged as one of the most frequent and complex issues in the care of patients with HIV infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】The current standard of care for chronic infection with HCV in persons without other infections is pegylated interferon (peginterferon) plus ribavirin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> This combination eradicates HCV infection and produces sustained virologic responses in 54 to 63 percent of patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> The efficacy of this combination of drugs in persons with both HIV and HCV infection has not been established. In the AIDS Pegasys Ribavirin International Coinfection Trial (APRICOT), we studied the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in people coinfected with HCV and HIV in an international, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Selection of Patients\n---------------------\n\n【15】To be eligible for the study, patients had to be more than 18 years of age, to be infected with both HIV and HCV, and to have anti-HCV antibodies in serum, detectable serum levels of HCV RNA (>600 IU per milliliter), elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels documented on two or more occasions within the previous 12 months, findings on liver biopsy within the past 15 months that were consistent with the presence of chronic hepatitis C infection, and compensated liver disease (without compromise of liver function or clinically important portal hypertension).\n\n【16】The presence of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) disease was confirmed by detection of anti–HIV-1 antibodies or HIV-1 RNA in serum (Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test, version 1.5). Patients with CD4+ cell counts of 200 per cubic millimeter or higher were eligible regardless of the HIV RNA level; those with CD4+ cell counts between 100 per cubic millimeter and 199 per cubic millimeter were eligible if their HIV-1 RNA load was less than 5000 copies per milliliter. Subjects were required either to have been receiving stable antiretroviral therapy for at least six weeks before study entry, with no changes expected for the first eight weeks of the study, or not to have received any antiretroviral therapy for at least eight weeks before randomization and to be able to delay the initiation of antiretroviral therapy for at least six weeks. For the remainder of the study, changes to an existing antiretroviral therapy regimen or initiation of antiretroviral therapy was permitted at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n【17】Subjects with the following conditions were excluded: an active HIV-related opportunistic infection or cancer; an absolute neutrophil count below 1500 per cubic millimeter; a platelet count below 70,000 per cubic millimeter; a hemoglobin level below 11 g per deciliter for women, or below 12 g per deciliter for men; a serum creatinine level more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; concurrent infection with hepatitis A or B virus; evidence of decompensated liver disease; severe psychiatric disease, especially depression; clinically significant coexisting medical conditions; and, for women, pregnancy or unwillingness to practice contraception. Participants were also excluded if they had previously received interferon or ribavirin.\n\n【18】Study Design\n------------\n\n【19】The study was conducted at 95 centers in 19 countries between June 2000 and September 2003. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 48 weeks of treatment with one of three regimens: subcutaneous interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A, Roche), at a dose of 3 million IU given three times per week, plus oral ribavirin (Copegus, Roche), at a dose of 400 mg given twice daily (total daily dose, 800 mg); peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys, Roche), at a dose of 180 μg given once weekly, plus oral placebo twice daily; or peginterferon alfa-2a plus oral ribavirin. The 48-week treatment period was followed by a 24-week observation period. The sponsor, investigators, and subjects were blinded to the assignment to ribavirin or placebo in the peginterferon alfa-2a groups. Treatment assignment was centralized and performed with the Pocock–Simon covariate adaptive procedure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Stratification factors included the HCV genotype (genotype 1 vs. other genotypes), the CD4+ cell count (<200 per cubic millimeter vs. ≥200 per cubic millimeter), HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy vs. no antiretroviral therapy), histologic findings on liver biopsy (cirrhosis vs. no cirrhosis), qualifying alanine aminotransferase quotient (the patient's value at baseline divided by the upper limit of normal for the assay), and geographic region. Baseline findings on liver biopsy were scored by local pathologists using the Ishak Modified Histological Activity Scoring System. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> With this system, biopsy findings are assigned scores for necroinflammatory grade (0 to 18, with 0 indicating no necroinflammation) and fibrosis stage (0 indicates no fibrosis and 6 probable or definite cirrhosis). The sum of the necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores is referred to as the total histologic-activity index score.\n\n【20】Institutional review boards at participating centers approved the protocol. All patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practices guidelines. The study was designed by the sponsor in collaboration with consultant physicians with expertise in the treatment of HCV and HIV infections and in clinical-trial design. Data were collected by the APRICOT study group and analyzed by the sponsor and the authors. Decisions regarding all aspects of the manuscript were made by the authors, and no limitations on publication were imposed by the sponsor.\n\n【21】Assessment of Efficacy and End Points\n-------------------------------------\n\n【22】Serum HCV RNA was measured by means of a qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay (Cobas Amplicor HCV Test, version 2.0, Roche Diagnostics; limit of detection, 50 IU per milliliter) at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 during treatment and after 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up after the cessation of study treatment (study weeks 60 and 72). HCV RNA was quantified by PCR (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor Test, version 2.0; limit of detection, 600 IU per milliliter) in all patients with detectable HCV RNA. The primary efficacy end point was a sustained virologic response, defined as a serum HCV RNA level below the limit of detection of the assay (<50 IU per milliliter) at the end of 24 weeks of follow-up. In patients without an HCV RNA measurement at week 72, treatment was considered to have failed. An early virologic response was defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA level on quantitative PCR assay or a decrease of more than 2 log <sub>10 </sub> in the serum HCV RNA level on quantitative PCR assay at week 12 or 24. HCV and HIV RNA determinations and HCV genotyping (Versant HCV Genotype Assay, Bayer) were performed by Cenetron Diagnostics, Cedar Creek, Texas.\n\n【23】Assessment of Safety\n--------------------\n\n【24】Safety was assessed by means of physical examinations, laboratory tests, and spontaneous reports of clinical adverse events during patients' visits to the clinic at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12, at six-week intervals thereafter during treatment, and at weeks 52, 60, and 72 during follow-up.\n\n【25】Stepwise reductions in the dose of peginterferon alfa-2a to 135, 90, or 45 μg per week, stepwise reductions in the dose of interferon alfa-2a to 2.25 or 1.5 million units three times per week, and sequential reductions in the dose of ribavirin or ribavirin placebo by 200 mg per day, but to no lower than 600 mg per day, were allowed when necessary to manage clinically significant adverse events or laboratory abnormalities, according to a defined protocol. If the adverse effect or abnormality improved or resolved, a return to the initial dose was permitted at the discretion of the investigator. Patients could continue to receive peginterferon alfa- 2a or interferon alfa-2a if ribavirin was discontinued. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and erythropoietin was permitted to manage hematologic adverse events.\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】The study treatment was discontinued if peginterferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa-2a was permanently stopped. The analysis was conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Patients who missed the study visit at week 72 were considered to have had treatment failure. The population for the efficacy analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of either study drug. The safety analysis included all treated patients who had at least one safety evaluation after baseline. Patients who withdrew from treatment were encouraged to return for follow-up appointments.\n\n【28】For comparisons between two treatment groups, the study had 80 percent power to detect an improvement in the rate of sustained virologic response from 30 percent to 45 percent, with a two-sided significance level of 0.025. As defined in the protocol, a closed testing procedure allowed for three pairwise comparisons between the treatment groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> The global hypothesis of no differences among treatment groups was to be tested first at a significance level of 0.05. If it was rejected, each of the three pairwise comparisons was to be tested at a significance level of 0.05. The Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test was used, with stratification according to geographic region, HCV genotype, and CD4+ cell count; multiple logistic-regression analysis was used to examine the effect of all five stratification factors on sustained virologic response and to confirm the results of the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.\n\n【29】Stepwise and backward logistic-regression analyses were used to identify pretreatment factors that were predictive of a sustained virologic response. All P values are two-sided.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Demographic Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Study Enrollment and Outcomes.\n\n【33】Of the eight patients who underwent randomization but were not treated, seven declined treatment and one failed to return to the study center. One patient who was randomly assigned to peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was mistakenly treated with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (classified in the group given interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin). Patients who withdrew from treatment were encouraged to return at weeks 48, 60, and 72 for follow-up assessments.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】Of 1158 subjects screened, 868 were randomly assigned to a treatment group, and 860 received study medication. The distribution of participants in the trial is shown in Figure 1 . The characteristics of the treatment groups were similar at baseline 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The patients were predominantly white and male and had well-controlled HIV infection. Sixteen percent had cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis.\n\n【35】Virologic Response\n------------------\n\n【36】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Virologic Responses at the End of Treatment (Panel A) and at the End of Follow-up (Panels B and C), According to HCV Genotype and Baseline HCV RNA Level.\n\n【37】A virologic response was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA level (<50 IU per milliliter). The number above each bar shows the percentage, and the numbers below each bar show the number of patients with a response and the total number in the subgroup. Only patients who received at least one dose of study treatment are included in this analysis. The asterisk indicates P=0.008 for the comparison with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, the dagger indicates P<0.001 for the comparisons with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, and the double dagger indicates that three patients had missing baseline HCV RNA data.\n\n【38】The overall rate of sustained virologic response at the end of follow-up, the primary efficacy end point, was significantly higher among patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin than among those treated with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (40 percent vs. 12 percent; odds ratio, 5.40; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 3.20 to 9.12; P<0.001) or peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (40 percent vs. 20 percent; odds ratio, 2.89; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 1.83 to 4.58; P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. The rate of sustained virologic response was significantly lower among recipients of interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin than among recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (odds ratio, 0.53; 97.5 percent confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.91; P=0.008).\n\n【39】When the patients were grouped according to HCV genotype, the rates of sustained virologic response reflected those in the overall study population, with the highest rates consistently observed among recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 had consistently lower rates of sustained virologic response than those infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3. Both overall and among patients infected with HCV genotype 1, patients in all three treatment groups who had high pretreatment HCV RNA levels (>800,000 IU per milliliter) had consistently lower rates of sustained virologic response than did those with lower pretreatment HCV RNA levels 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>. The pretreatment HCV RNA level did not affect the rate of sustained virologic response among patients infected with genotype 2 or 3.\n\n【40】### _Independent Factors Associated with a Sustained Virologic Response_\n\n【41】A prospectively defined multiple logistic-regression analysis was used to identify pretreatment factors that were predictive of a sustained virologic response among patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. The factors analyzed were age, sex, race (white vs. nonwhite), body-surface area, HCV RNA level, total histologic-activity index score, qualifying alanine aminotransferase quotient (the alanine aminotransferase value divided by upper limit of normal), HCV genotype (1 vs. others), CD4+ cell count, use or nonuse of antiretroviral therapy, and histologic findings on liver biopsy (presence or absence of cirrhosis). The final model included two factors that are associated with independently and significantly increased odds of a sustained virologic response: an HCV genotype other than 1 (odds ratio, 3.37; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.96 to 5.80; P<0.001) and a baseline HCV RNA level of 800,000 IU or less per milliliter (odds ratio, 3.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.00 to 6.36; P<0.001). HIV-related factors including the CD4+ cell count and the use or nonuse of antiretroviral therapy, which are variables of particular interest in this population, did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the final model.\n\n【42】### _Predictive Value of an Early Virologic Response_\n\n【43】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Early Virologic Response as a Predictor of Sustained Virologic Response.\n\n【44】An early virologic response was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA level (<50 IU per milliliter) or a decrease of 2 log or more in the HCV RNA level by week 12. Only patients who received at least one dose of study treatment are included in this analysis. Patients who did not have an early virologic response were highly unlikely to have a sustained virologic response at week 72.\n\n【45】Patients with an early virologic response, defined as an undetectable HCV RNA level or a decrease of 2 log or more in the HCV RNA level by week 12, were more likely to achieve a sustained virologic response 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Of patients who had an early virologic response by week 12, 30 percent in the group given interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, 37 percent of those assigned to peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, and 56 percent of those given peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin had sustained virologic responses at week 72. Only two patients without an early virologic response went on to have a sustained virologic response; one was a patient with HCV genotype 1b who became HCV RNA–negative at week 24, and the other was a patient infected with HCV genotype 4 who became HCV RNA–negative at week 36. Overall, only 2 percent or less of the patients in each treatment group who did not have an early response went on to have a sustained response. When an early virologic response was defined as one occurring by week 24, the results were similar.\n\n【46】### _Safety_\n\n【47】Table 2.  Table 2. Patients Withdrawn from Study Treatment, Dose Reductions, Adverse Events, and Changes in HIV Status According to Treatment Group.\n\n【48】The frequency of dose reductions in response to clinical adverse events was generally similar among the three groups; however, the rate of dose reductions in response to laboratory abnormalities varied according to the treatment 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells per cubic millimeter) occurred in 1 recipient of interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (<1 percent), 37 recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (13 percent), and 31 recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (11 percent). Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (<20,000 cells per cubic millimeter) occurred in one recipient of peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo and one recipient of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. Grade 4 anemia (hemoglobin level, <6.5 g per deciliter) occurred in five recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (2 percent) and two recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (1 percent). Two patients withdrew from treatment with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, three from treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, and two from treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin because of anemia; one, seven, and four, respectively, withdrew because of thrombocytopenia, and none, two, and three because of neutropenia.\n\n【49】The proportion of patients withdrawn from treatment differed among treatment groups 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and Table 2 )</u>. Overall, 39 percent of patients withdrew from treatment with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, 31 percent from treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo, and 25 percent from treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (P<0.001 for the comparison between interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin). The number of patients reporting adverse events or serious adverse events was generally similar among the treatment groups; serious events judged to be related to treatment were more frequent in the two groups that received peginterferon alfa-2a 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Absolute mean CD4+ cell counts decreased uniformly in all three groups during treatment, whereas the mean percentage of CD4 + lymphocytes (CD4+ percentage) increased slightly 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Mean HIV-1 RNA levels decreased in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a who had detectable HIV RNA at baseline. Ten AIDS-defining events occurred during the study; these were evenly distributed among the three groups.\n\n【51】The incidence of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis was low 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Hepatic decompensation occurred in 14 of the 860 patients who received at least one dose of study medication and was evenly distributed among the treatment groups. All 14 patients had cirrhosis and Child–Pugh scores of 5 or higher at baseline; 6 of the 14 died. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Ten deaths occurred during the study, and two after the end of treatment and follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The death of one patient who received interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, attributed to respiratory failure, and of one who received peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin, attributed to suicide, were judged to be possibly related to treatment.\n\n【52】Discussion\n----------\n\n【53】In this large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin elicited significantly higher rates of sustained virologic response than interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in patients infected with both HIV and HCV (40 percent vs. 12 percent, P<0.001). These data are consistent with published results from a study of patients with HCV infection but without HIV infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy was also significantly more effective than interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in our study (rate of sustained virologic response, 20 percent vs. 12 percent; P=0.008), a finding that suggests that peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy is a suitable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate or have a contraindication to ribavirin.\n\n【54】The 29 percent rate of sustained virologic response in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who were treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin is higher than the rates previously reported in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. In the two groups that received ribavirin, relapse rates, indicated by the difference between responses at the end of treatment and responses at the end of follow-up, were remarkably low and similar to those in patients infected only with HCV, underscoring the importance of ribavirin in viral clearance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The highest response rate was among patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 who received peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. The similar responses at the end of treatment (48 weeks) and the end of follow-up in our trial (72 weeks) — 64 percent and 62 percent — contrast with the high relapse rate (35 percent) reported after 24 weeks of treatment in another trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Thus, although patients infected only with HCV genotype 2 or 3 require only 24 weeks of treatment, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> 48 weeks of combination therapy appears to be appropriate for patients infected with both HIV and HCV genotype 2 or 3.\n\n【55】Although outcomes according to HCV genotype and pretreatment HCV RNA level are consistent with previously published data, the rates of sustained virologic response in our trial were generally lower than those reported for patients with HCV infection alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Several factors may contribute to this finding. First, more than 70 percent of our subjects had high pretreatment HCV RNA titers (>800,000 IU per milliliter). Second, the viral kinetic response to anti-HCV therapy is slower in patients infected with HCV and HIV. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Although our study population was relatively immunocompetent, as reflected by their absolute CD4+ counts, some as yet unrecognized qualitative defects in immune function might also have affected their ability to eradicate HCV. Finally, we used a fixed, 800-mg daily dose of ribavirin. In patients with HCV infection alone, a recent trial showed that even higher doses of ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg per day) resulted in better rates of sustained virologic response in patients infected with HCV genotype 1. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> This finding provides a rationale for the use of a higher initial dose of ribavirin in future studies.\n\n【56】Patients who did not have an early virologic response at week 12 were highly unlikely to have a sustained virologic response. The negative predictive value of the absence of an early response was not improved when such a response was defined as occurring by week 24. Thus, in accordance with current guidelines for HCV-infected patients without HIV coinfection, discontinuation of therapy can be considered if patients do not have a virologic response by week 12. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】The spectrum and frequency of adverse events were similar to those previously reported in HCV infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Hematologic abnormalities were more frequent among patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a. The overall frequency of AIDS-defining events and of death, as well as events associated with mitochondrial toxicity, such as pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, was low, and it was similar among the treatment groups. Although combination therapy was associated with a decline in absolute CD4+ cell counts, it had no effect on the CD4+ percentage. Notably, mean HIV RNA levels did not increase during treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and, in fact, decreased by approximately 0.7 log <sub>10 </sub> copy in patients who had detectable HIV-1 RNA at baseline.\n\n【58】The overall rate of sustained virologic response among patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (40 percent, as compared with 12 percent for those treated with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin) was considerably higher than that in other recent trials of peginterferon and ribavirin in patients with both HIV and HCV infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,17 </a></sup></u> In the AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5071 study, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> the rates of sustained virologic response were 27 percent with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and 12 percent with interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin. The rates of sustained virologic response were similar in a French multicenter study that compared peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin with interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin (26 percent vs. 18 percent). 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Although the results must be interpreted with caution, there are several possible reasons for the better responses observed in our trial. These include differences in study design, the use of a different type of peginterferon in one study 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> and a different dose of ribavirin in the other, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> and differences in patient populations.\n\n【59】In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the current regimen used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C alone can also be applied to patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin has a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio when used to treat such patients, a substantial proportion of whom are likely to benefit from therapy with this combination.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Roche, Basel, Switzerland.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>The following authors report having served as consultants, having served as advisors, having received lecture fees, having received grant support, or a combination, for the pharmaceutical companies indicated: Dr. Carosi, for Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, and Roche; Dr. Dieterich, for Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, and Schering-Plough; Dr. Gonzalez-García for Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and Schering-Plough; Dr. Katlama, for Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, and GlaxoSmithKline; Dr. Lazzarin, for Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, and Roche; Dr. Lissen, for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and Schering-Plough; Dr. Montaner, for Abbott, Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer, Borean Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb, DuPont Pharma, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Immune Response Corporation, Janssen-Ortho, Kucera Pharmaceutical, Merck Frosst Laboratories, Pfizer Canada, Roche, Shire Biochem, Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, and Trimeris; Dr. Rockstroh, for Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eller/Essex Pharma GmbH, Gilead, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Pfizer, Roche, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals; Dr. Rodriguez-Torres, for AstraZeneca, Intermune, SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Tibotec, Roche, and Valeant Pharma; Dr. Sasadeusz, for GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Roche; and Dr. Torriani, for Boehringer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, and Serono.

We report two cases of successful unilateral lung transplantation for end-stage respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis. The patients, both oxygen-dependent, had progressive disease refractory to all treatment, with an anticipated life expectancy of less than one year on the basis of the rate of progression of the disease. Both patients were discharged six weeks after transplantation and returned to normal life. They are alive and well at 26 months and 14 months after the procedure. Pulmonary-function studies have shown substantial improvement in their lung volumes and diffusing capacities. For both patients, arterial oxygen tension is now normal and there is no arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise.\n\n【2】This experience shows that unilateral lung transplantation, for selected patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease, provides a good functional result.

Insulin icodec is a basal insulin analogue designed for once-weekly administration that is in development for the treatment of diabetes.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec as compared with once-daily insulin glargine U100 in patients who had not previously received long-term insulin treatment and whose type 2 diabetes was inadequately controlled (glycated hemoglobin level, 7.0 to 9.5%) while taking metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor. The primary end point was the change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 26. Safety end points, including episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin-related adverse events, were also evaluated.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 247 participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive icodec or glargine. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups; the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin level was 8.09% in the icodec group and 7.96% in the glargine group. The estimated mean change from baseline in the glycated hemoglobin level was −1.33 percentage points in the icodec group and −1.15 percentage points in the glargine group, to estimated means of 6.69% and 6.87%, respectively, at week 26; the estimated between-group difference in the change from baseline was −0.18 percentage points (95% CI, –0.38 to 0.02, P=0.08). The observed rates of hypoglycemia with severity of level 2 (blood glucose level, <54 mg per deciliter) or level 3 (severe cognitive impairment) were low (icodec group, 0.53 events per patient-year; glargine group, 0.46 events per patient-year; estimated rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.65). There was no between-group difference in insulin-related key adverse events, and rates of hypersensitivity and injection-site reactions were low. Most adverse events were mild, and no serious events were deemed to be related to the trial medications.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Once-weekly treatment with insulin icodec had glucose-lowering efficacy and a safety profile similar to those of once-daily insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by Novo Nordisk; NN1436-4383 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03751657 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 QUICK TAKE  \nOnce-Weekly Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes  \n_01:42_\n\n【12】Evolving guidelines for standards of care from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend treatment escalation when individualized glycemic targets are not reached in patients with type 2 diabetes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Despite these recommendations, clinical inertia is highly prevalent in the management of type 2 diabetes, with the longest delays reported for insulin initiation (median time from initiation of treatment with one or more oral antidiabetic drugs to initiation of insulin treatment, 1.2 to 4.9 years). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Previous data have indicated that patients with type 2 diabetes would generally prefer fewer injections and greater flexibility than is typical of the current once-daily treatment options. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Therefore, reducing the number of injections could potentially increase acceptance of and adherence to insulin treatment among patients with type 2 diabetes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> thereby potentially improving glycemic control.\n\n【13】Insulin icodec (proposed international nonproprietary name) is a basal insulin analogue administered once weekly that is in development for the treatment of patients with diabetes. With a time to maximum concentration of 16 hours and a half-life of approximately 1 week, insulin icodec has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile suitable for once-weekly injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Here, we report the findings of a phase 2 clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly insulin icodec as compared with once-daily insulin glargine U100 in patients who had not received insulin previously and whose type 2 diabetes was inadequately controlled while taking metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【16】We conducted a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, treat-to-target, active-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase 2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous icodec plus once-daily placebo or once-daily subcutaneous glargine plus once-weekly placebo; randomization was stratified according to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor use 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>. The trial included a 2-week screening period, a 26-week treatment period, and a 5-week follow-up period. The treatment exposure period was defined as the period from the date of first dose of icodec or glargine until the last follow-up visit or the day of the last dose of icodec or glargine plus 5 weeks (for glargine) or 6 weeks (for icodec), whichever came first. The treatment exposure period without ancillary treatment was defined as the period from the date of first dose of icodec or glargine until the initiation of ancillary treatment (defined as any diabetes medication other than the trial drugs, metformin, or a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor), an increase in metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor doses, or the end date of the treatment exposure period if no ancillary treatment was initiated.\n\n【17】Patients who were 18 to 75 years of age and who had not previously received long-term insulin treatment, who had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at least 180 days before screening, who were receiving stable daily doses of metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, and who had a glycated hemoglobin level of 7.0 to 9.5% were eligible for enrollment. Previous short-term insulin treatment (maximum of 14 days) or previous insulin treatment for gestational diabetes were allowed. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table S1.\n\n【18】Treatment\n---------\n\n【19】The starting dose of icodec was 70 U once per week, and the starting dose of glargine was 10 U once per day. After randomization, insulin doses were adjusted weekly to achieve a pre-breakfast patient-measured blood glucose target of 70 to 108 mg per deciliter (3.9 to 6.0 mmol per liter). The adjustment algorithm, which was based on the three preceding patient-measured blood glucose levels, is summarized in Table S2. Once-weekly injections were performed with a pen injector, and once-daily injections were performed with a vial and syringe.\n\n【20】Efficacy End Points\n-------------------\n\n【21】The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 26, with the primary “estimand” (a precisely defined estimated measure of treatment effect) being the trial-product estimand, defined as the between-group difference in the change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 26 among all patients who underwent randomization, had all patients continued to receive the trial product without receiving ancillary therapies. A more detailed explanation of the rationale for estimands and of the estimands used in this trial is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Key secondary end points included the changes in fasting plasma glucose level, body weight, and the mean of the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profile from baseline to week 26 and the mean weekly insulin dose during the last 2 weeks of treatment. In addition, the time spent with the blood glucose level in the tight glycemic range of 70 to 140 mg per deciliter (3.9 to 7.8 mmol per liter), monitored by flash glucose monitoring (FreeStyle Libre Pro) during the last 2 weeks of treatment, was a prespecified exploratory end point. Both the investigators and the patients were unaware of the flash glucose monitoring results. Only patients with at least 70% flash glucose monitoring coverage over 13 days were included in the analysis.\n\n【22】Safety End Points\n-----------------\n\n【23】Key safety end points included the number of adverse events during the treatment exposure period from baseline to week 31 (end of the 5-week follow-up period), including serious adverse events, the number of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemic alert events (level 1; blood glucose level, ≥54 and <70 mg per deciliter \\[≥3.0 and <3.9 mmol per liter\\], confirmed by blood glucose meter), the number of hypoglycemic events that were either clinically significant (level 2; <54 mg per deciliter \\[<3.0 mmol per liter\\], confirmed by blood glucose meter) or severe (level 3; severe cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery), and the number of severe hypoglycemic events only. Whenever a hypoglycemic event was suspected, patient-measured blood glucose levels were obtained to provide confirmation. In addition, all hypoglycemic events confirmed during patient-measured blood glucose monitoring were recorded, even if the patient was asymptomatic. Reported major adverse cardiovascular events, hypersensitivity, and injection-site reactions were adjudicated by an independent, external committee, the members of which were unaware of the treatment-group assignments.\n\n【24】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【25】The trial was conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference for Harmonisation. The protocol , which is available at NEJM.org, was reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and independent ethics committees. All patients provided written informed consent before trial entry.\n\n【26】A combination of academic authors and authors who are employees of the sponsor participated in developing the trial concept and design and in collecting the data. All the authors were involved in the analysis and interpretation of data and participated in preparing the manuscript that was submitted, with the support of a medical writing agency (paid for by Novo Nordisk). The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. All the authors read and approved the submitted version of the manuscript.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】All presented analyses, with the exception of the incidence of hypoglycemia, were prespecified. The sample size was determined such that the width of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference, under an assumption of normally distributed data for the change in glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to 26 weeks, was 0.5 percentage points. The standard deviation for the glycated hemoglobin level was expected to be 1.0% for all treatment groups on the basis of previous observations with glargine. A total of 246 patients, with 123 in each treatment group, would meet this requirement. The trial was not powered to detect significant differences between the treatments in any of the end points, and no adjustment for multiplicity was applied.\n\n【29】All efficacy end points were summarized and analyzed with the trial-product estimand period (treatment exposure period without ancillary treatment) and the full analysis set, defined as all patients who underwent randomization 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. Safety end points were summarized with the use of the treatment exposure period and the safety analysis set, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of trial medication, and were analyzed with the use of the full analysis set.\n\n【30】The change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level after 26 weeks was analyzed with a linear mixed model for repeated measures with an unstructured covariance matrix. The model included the use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (yes or no), geographic region, assigned treatment, and visit as fixed factors and baseline glycated hemoglobin level as covariate. Interactions between visit and all factors and covariates were also included in the model. Missing data were imputed with a mixed model for repeated measures to reflect the primary estimand. The estimated mean treatment difference and the confidence interval are provided together with the corresponding two-sided P value. In the following, this mixed model for repeated measures will be referred to as the “standard” mixed model for repeated measures. The binary response end points, defined as whether a patient had had a hypoglycemic event or met a specific glycated hemoglobin target (<7% or ≤6.5%) at 26 weeks, were analyzed with a logistic-regression model with the same factors and covariates (with the exception of visit) after imputing missing glycated hemoglobin measurements with the use of a mixed model for repeated measures.\n\n【31】Changes from baseline in fasting plasma glucose level, body weight, and the mean of the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profiles were analyzed with the standard mixed model for repeated measures, with relevant baseline values as the covariates. A linear mixed-effects model was fitted to the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profile data at week 26. The model included treatment, geographic region, use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, time, interaction between treatment and time, interaction between geographic region and time, and interaction between use of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor and time as fixed factors and patient as a random effect. The time spent in the tight glycemic range and the logarithmically transformed mean weekly dose during the last 2 weeks of treatment were evaluated by analysis of covariance, including use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (yes or no), geographic region, and treatment as fixed factors. Missing end-point values were not imputed.\n\n【32】Adverse events during the treatment exposure period were evaluated descriptively as the number of patients with at least one event, the percentage of patients with at least one event, the number of events, and the event rate (events per patient-year of exposure). Hypoglycemic events were summarized and analyzed for each category separately with a negative binomial regression model in which treatment, geographic region, and use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (yes or no) were used as fixed factors and the logarithm of the time period in which the hypoglycemic events were considered was used as an offset.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Patients\n--------\n\n【35】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Full Analysis Set).\n\n【36】Of the 385 patients who underwent screening, 247 were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups; 125 were assigned to receive icodec, and 122 were assigned to receive glargine. All 247 patients were included in the full analysis set and the safety analysis set. Similar numbers of patients in each group completed the week 26 visit without having discontinued treatment (121 \\[96.8%\\] in the icodec group and 115 \\[94.3%\\] in the glargine group). In total, 4 patients in the icodec group and 7 in the glargine group discontinued treatment, and 1 and 2 patients, respectively, initiated ancillary treatment 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. The demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups, with the exception of a slightly longer duration of diabetes in the icodec group 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【37】Efficacy End Points\n-------------------\n\n【38】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Efficacy End Points.\n\n【39】Panel A shows the mean change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin levels over time among patients who received either once-weekly insulin icodec or once-daily insulin glargine U100. Error bars indicate the standard error. The data shown at week 26\\* are the estimated mean values and corresponding 95% confidence intervals at week 26 derived on the basis of a mixed model for repeated measures with an unstructured covariance matrix. The model included use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (yes or no), geographic region, treatment, and visit as fixed factors and the glycated hemoglobin baseline value as the covariate. Interactions between visit and all factors and covariates were also included in the model. Panel B shows estimated percentages of patients who had reached a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7% or of 6.5% or lower after 26 weeks. The binary response end points after 26 weeks were analyzed with a logistic-regression model with the same factors and covariates (except for visit) after imputing missing glycated hemoglobin measurements with the use of a mixed model for repeated measures. Panel C shows the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profiles at baseline and at week 26. Patient-measured blood glucose levels were assessed with a glucose meter as plasma equivalent values of capillary whole-blood glucose. The 9-point profile values after 26 weeks were analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model. The model included treatment, geographic region, use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, time (within the 9-point profile), the interaction between treatment and time, the interaction between geographic region and time, and the interaction between use of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor and time as fixed factors and patient as a random effect; measurements within patients were assumed to be correlated with a compound symmetry covariance matrix. Panel D shows the mean weekly insulin dose over time.\n\n【40】The mean (±SD) glycated hemoglobin level in the icodec group decreased from 8.09±0.70% at baseline to an estimated mean of 6.69% at week 26; in the glargine group, the level decreased from 7.96±0.65% to 6.87%. The estimated mean change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline at week 26 was −1.33 percentage points for icodec and −1.15 percentage points for glargine 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>, for an estimated mean treatment difference of −0.18 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.38 to 0.02; P=0.08). The estimated percentages of patients reaching a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7% at week 26 were 72% in the icodec group and 68% in the glargine group (estimated odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.13), and the percentages of patients reaching a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or less were 49% and 39%, respectively (estimated odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.85 to 2.52) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. The results of the analysis of the glycated hemoglobin level with the use of the treatment-policy estimand, which reflects an intention-to-treat analysis, are shown in Table S4.\n\n【41】Table 2.  Table 2. Key Secondary End Points.\n\n【42】The mean patient-measured blood glucose level was lower in the icodec group than in the glargine group at all time points 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>. A greater reduction in the mean 9-point patient-measured blood glucose level from baseline to week 26, a lower insulin dose, and a greater time spent within the tight glycemic range (70 to 140 mg per deciliter) during the last 2 weeks of treatment were also found in the icodec group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 1D )</u>. The change from baseline to week 26 in the fasting plasma glucose level and in body weight were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【43】Safety End Points\n-----------------\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Key Safety Measures and Adverse Events during the Treatment Exposure Period (Safety Analysis Set).\n\n【45】Approximately 50% of patients in each treatment group had an adverse event 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Two serious adverse events were reported in 2 patients receiving icodec, and 12 serious adverse events, including 10 events occurring in 1 patient, were reported in 3 patients treated with glargine 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>. None of the serious adverse events were considered by the investigators to be possibly or probably related to the trial medications. Injection-site reactions were reported in 5 patients treated with icodec (28 events, including 20 events of mild erythema reported in 1 patient) and in 3 patients treated with glargine (4 events); all reactions were mild and resolved quickly. None of the confirmed adjudicated hypersensitivity reactions (1 with icodec and 3 with glargine) were considered by the investigators to be related to the trial medications. No deaths occurred during the trial.\n\n【46】The observed incidence of level 1 hypoglycemia alerts was 53.6% in the icodec group and 37.7% in the glargine group, and the observed rates of this end point during the treatment exposure period were 5.09 and 2.11 events per patient-year of exposure for icodec and glargine, respectively (estimated rate ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.50 to 3.88). For both icodec and glargine, the observed incidence of combined level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia was low (16.0% and 9.8%, respectively); the observed event rates were 0.53 and 0.46 events per patient-year of exposure, respectively, with an estimated rate ratio of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.45 to 2.65) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The odds ratios for a level 1 and a level 2 or 3 hypoglycemic event are shown in Table 3 .\n\n【47】The numbers of level 1 and level 2 nocturnal hypoglycemic events were very low in both treatment groups, with no level 3 events occurring 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. One patient in the icodec group had a severe hypoglycemic event that was defined by the investigator as requiring external assistance; however, it was characterized by a blood glucose level of 58 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter), and the patient had a full recovery with only oral carbohydrate administration.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】In this 26-week, phase 2 clinical trial investigating a once-weekly basal insulin analogue, the use of icodec resulted in glycemic control similar to that of once-daily glargine without significantly affecting rates of clinically relevant hypoglycemia (level 2 or 3) in patients with type 2 diabetes that had been inadequately controlled with metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor. During the trial, a similarly robust reduction in the glycated hemoglobin level was observed with both drugs, with more than two thirds of patients reaching a glycated hemoglobin level of less than 7%; the reduction in the fasting plasma glucose level was also similar in the two groups, and greater improvements in the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profile were observed with once-weekly insulin icodec than with once-daily glargine, which is currently the most commonly used basal insulin analogue. Insulin icodec had a favorable side-effect profile, and no unexpected safety findings occurred. In our trial, the blinded design with a double-dummy strategy provided robustness to the efficacy and safety findings.\n\n【50】The findings in the present trial suggest that once-weekly insulin has the potential to facilitate insulin management, providing clinical benefits and reducing the number of injections per year from 365 to 52. In addition to the improvement in the mean of the 9-point patient-measured blood glucose profile and the better post-breakfast and post-lunch measurements in that profile with icodec than with glargine, patients treated with once-weekly icodec spent a greater amount of time in the tight glycemic range (70 to 140 mg per deciliter) than did those treated with once-daily glargine. The estimated treatment difference was 5.4 percentage points, corresponding approximately to an extra 78 minutes spent in the target glycemic range per day in the icodec group. It is worth noting that the most recent consensus paper on time spent in the glycemic range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter states that each 5% incremental increase in that measure is associated with clinically significant benefits. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-11</a></sup></u>\n\n【51】Once-weekly insulin icodec had a favorable side-effect profile, with rates of level 2 hypoglycemic events similar to those with glargine. The higher number of level 1 hypoglycemic events in the icodec group than in the glargine group may reflect the trial design and suggests that the fasting glucose target may need to be slightly higher and the insulin dose increments smaller to ensure an efficacious initiation and adjustment of insulin icodec with even fewer hypoglycemic events. However, it is reassuring that the incidence of clinically significant (level 2) and severe (level 3) hypoglycemia was similar with the two types of insulin, with only one case of questionable severe hypoglycemia reported in a patient receiving icodec, which was resolved with oral carbohydrate administration. Moreover, in previous treat-to-target insulin trials in which glargine was evaluated, the overall numbers of events of hypoglycemia per patient-year (using values similar to level 1 and level 2) with glargine were generally higher than what we observed in the current trial in either group, although this comparison should be considered in the context of differences in methods, threshold, and oral antidiabetic treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-14</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】The mean weekly insulin dose was higher in the glargine group than in the icodec group. Given the expected equipotency between the two drugs, this finding awaits further clinical trials to determine whether the difference is observed consistently. Despite the observed difference in dose, no difference in changes in body weight was noted between the two treatment groups.\n\n【53】Published data have indicated that treatment with an injectable once-weekly glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist was associated with significantly better treatment adherence and persistence than once-daily treatment, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and greater treatment satisfaction without compromising glycemic control was also observed in patients with type 2 diabetes who switched from once-daily to once-weekly therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Extrapolating these data to our trial results could suggest that once-weekly insulin icodec has the potential to improve treatment satisfaction, adherence, and persistence in patients who are going to receive basal insulin. The smaller number of injections associated with once-weekly icodec than with once-daily basal insulin may facilitate treatment initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not previously taken insulin, by reducing clinical inertia and promoting better acceptance of insulin therapy.\n\n【54】A strength of this study was the double-blind, double-dummy design. The high number of patients who completed therapy during the 26-week treatment period was another strength. However, the results should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. This phase 2 trial was not powered to detect significant differences between treatments for any end point, but these data suggest that such a trial design may be worth exploring in the future. In addition, the double-blind, double-dummy design and the requirement to use a treat-to-target approach in regulatory trials necessitated an identical dose-adjustment frequency for both treatments, which meant that insulin adjustment was not tailored for each treatment. Patients treated with sulfonylureas were excluded from the trial, and further investigation will be needed in a larger and more diverse patient population to evaluate the hypoglycemic profile of icodec.\n\n【55】In this trial, the once-weekly basal insulin analogue, insulin icodec, provided glucose-lowering effects and a safety profile similar to those of once-daily glargine.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Novo Nordisk .</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Rosenstock reports receiving grant support, paid to his institution, advisory board fees, and travel support from Applied Therapeutics, Intarcia, and Oramed, grant support, paid to his institution, advisory board fees, lecture fees, and travel support from Boehringer Ingelheim, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi US Services, grant support, paid to his institution, and advisory board fees from Eli Lilly, and grant support, paid to his institution, from AstraZeneca, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen Biotech, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Pfizer, and REMD Biotherapeutics; Dr. Bajaj, receiving grant support from Amgen, Kowa, and Sanofi US Services and grant support and lecture fees from AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Janssen Global Services, and Novo Nordisk; Dr. Janež, receiving lecture fees from AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Sanofi Pasteur Biologics and advisory board fees and lecture fees from Novo Nordisk; Dr. Silver, receiving fees for serving on a speakers bureau from AstraZeneca and fees for serving on a speakers bureau and advisory board fees from Novo Nordisk; Dr. Begtrup, being employed by and owning stock in Novo Nordisk; Dr. Hansen, being employed by and owning stock in Novo Nordisk; Dr. Jia, being employed by and owning stock in Novo Nordisk; and Dr. Goldenberg, receiving research support and lecture fees from Abbott Canada, advisory board fees and fees for medical education form AstraZeneca Canada, research support, advisory board fees, and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi, research support from GlaxoSmithKline, Medtronic, and Novartis, advisory board fees and lecture fees from HLS Therapeutics, research support, lecture fees, advisory board fees, and fees for medical education from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, research support and advisory board fees from Roche, lecture fees from Servier, and research support, advisory board fees, and fees for medical education from Takeda Pharmaceutical.

I think that the first target to treat diabetes patients to achieve a glycemic target and the second target should be to avoid hypoglycemia. Glargine acts up to 24 hours. Due to changes in some amino acid sequences, glargine becomes soluble at pH 4.0 and this insulin administered with pH 4.0 which becomes insoluble in the normal body fluid with higher pH. Such insoluble form gradually and slowly becomes soluble and acts for up to 24 hrs. Another ultra-long acting, degludec, forms multi-hexamers after administration resulting in slow release of active form. This analogue acts for more than 36 hrs. Icodec after administration strongly but reversibly binds to albumin resulting in novel form of action e.g. half life of which is around 196 hours. I think hypoglycemic effect of icodec may also be long lasting which may create a serious problem in clinical practice. So a well established starting dose and proper titration strategy is required from larger studies with icodec only before using in clinical practice.</u>\n\n【99】参考删除-1:<u>Gauranga Dhar  \nNov 28, 2020</u>\n\n【100】参考删除-1:<u>Gauranga Dhar  \nPhysician, FAMILY MEDICINE  \nDisclosure: None  \n_Bangladesh_</u>\n\n【101】参考删除-1:<u>The most promising treatment option of type 2 diabetes</u>\n\n【102】参考删除-1:<u>Usually we start treatment of T2DM with metformin.

At last Icodec, once weekly insulin, if we, the physicians, can make understand the patients the superiority, we can start it in patients at diagnosis.

Selective publication of clinical trials — and the outcomes within those trials — can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk–benefit ratio.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We obtained reviews from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for studies of 12 antidepressant agents involving 12,564 patients. We conducted a systematic literature search to identify matching publications. For trials that were reported in the literature, we compared the published outcomes with the FDA outcomes. We also compared the effect size derived from the published reports with the effect size derived from the entire FDA data set.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among 74 FDA-registered studies, 31%, accounting for 3449 study participants, were not published. Whether and how the studies were published were associated with the study outcome. A total of 37 studies viewed by the FDA as having positive results were published; 1 study viewed as positive was not published. Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69% for individual drugs and was 32% overall.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, from decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish, or both. Selective reporting of clinical trial results may have adverse consequences for researchers, study participants, health care professionals, and patients.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Medical decisions are based on an understanding of publicly reported clinical trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> If the evidence base is biased, then decisions based on this evidence may not be the optimal decisions. For example, selective publication of clinical trials, and the outcomes within those trials, can lead to unrealistic estimates of drug effectiveness and alter the apparent risk–benefit ratio. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Attempts to study selective publication are complicated by the unavailability of data from unpublished trials. Researchers have found evidence for selective publication by comparing the results of published trials with information from surveys of authors, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> registries, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> institutional review boards, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> and funding agencies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> and even with published methods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Numerous tests are available to detect selective-reporting bias, but none are known to be capable of detecting or ruling out bias reliably. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-16</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) operates a registry and a results database. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Drug companies must register with the FDA all trials they intend to use in support of an application for marketing approval or a change in labeling. The FDA uses this information to create a table of all studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> The study protocols in the database must prospectively identify the exact methods that will be used to collect and analyze data. Afterward, in their marketing application, sponsors must report the results obtained using the prespecified methods. These submissions include raw data, which FDA statisticians use in corroborative analyses. This system prevents selective post hoc reporting of favorable trial results and outcomes within those trials.\n\n【14】How accurately does the published literature convey data on drug efficacy to the medical community? To address this question, we compared drug efficacy inferred from the published literature with drug efficacy according to FDA reviews.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Data from FDA Reviews\n---------------------\n\n【17】We identified the phase 2 and 3 clinical-trial programs for 12 antidepressant agents approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2004 (median, August 1996), involving 12,564 adult patients. For the eight older antidepressants, we obtained hard copies of statistical and medical reviews from colleagues who had procured them through the Freedom of Information Act. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Reviews for the four newer antidepressants were available on the FDA Web site. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,20 </a></sup></u> This study was approved by the Research and Development Committee of the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center; because of its nature, informed consent from individual patients was not required.\n\n【18】From the FDA reviews of submitted clinical trials, we extracted efficacy data on all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of drugs for the short-term treatment of depression. We included data pertaining only to dosages later approved as safe and effective; data pertaining to unapproved dosages were excluded.\n\n【19】We extracted the FDA's regulatory decisions — that is, whether, for purposes of approval, the studies were judged to be positive or negative with respect to the prespecified primary outcomes (or primary end points). 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> We classified as questionable those studies that the FDA judged to be neither positive nor clearly negative — that is, studies that did not have significant findings on the primary outcome but did have significant findings on several secondary outcomes. Failed studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> were also classified as questionable 删除7:<u>(for more information, see the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u>. For fixed-dose studies (studies in which patients are randomly assigned to receive one of two or more dose levels or placebo) with a mix of significant and nonsignificant results for different doses, we used the FDA's stated overall decisions on the studies. We used double data extraction and entry, as detailed in the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【20】Data from Journal Articles\n--------------------------\n\n【21】Our literature-search strategy consisted of the following steps: a search of articles in PubMed, a search of references listed in review articles, and a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; contact by telephone or e-mail with the drug sponsor's medical-information department; and finally, contact by means of a certified letter sent to the sponsor's medical-information department, including a deadline for responding in writing to our query about whether the study results had been published. If these steps failed to reveal any publications, we concluded that the study results had not been published.\n\n【22】We identified the best match between the FDA-reviewed clinical trials and journal articles on the basis of the following information: drug name, dose groups, sample size, active comparator (if used), duration, and name of principal investigator. We sought published reports on individual studies; articles covering multiple studies were excluded. When the results of a trial were reported in two or more primary publications, we selected the first publication.\n\n【23】Few journal articles used the term “primary efficacy outcome” or a reasonable equivalent. Therefore, we identified the apparent primary efficacy outcome, or the result highlighted most prominently, as the drug–placebo comparison reported first in the text of the results section or in the table or figure first cited in the text. As with the FDA reviews, we used double data extraction and entry (see the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix for details).\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】We categorized the trials on the basis of the FDA regulatory decision, whether the trial results were published, and whether the apparent primary outcomes agreed or conflicted with the FDA decision. We calculated risk ratios with exact 95% confidence intervals and Pearson's chi-square analysis, using Stata software, version 9. We used a similar approach to examine the numbers of patients within the studies. Sample sizes were compared between published and unpublished studies with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n\n【26】For our major outcome indicator, we calculated the effect size for each trial using Hedges's g — that is, the difference between two means divided by their pooled standard deviation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> However, because means and standard deviations (or standard errors) were inconsistently reported in both the FDA reviews and the journal articles, we used the algebraically equivalent computational equation 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> :\n\n【27】g = t × the square root of (1/n <sub>drug </sub> \\+ 1/n <sub>placebo </sub> ).\n\n【28】We calculated the t statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> using the precise P value and the combined sample size as arguments in Microsoft Excel's TINV (inverse T) function, multiplying t by −1 when the study drug was inferior to the placebo. Hedges's correction for small sample size was applied to all g values. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u>\n\n【29】Precise P values were not always available for the above calculation. Rather, P values were often indicated as being below or above a certain threshold — for example, P<0.05 or “not significant” (i.e., P>0.05). In these cases, we followed the procedure described in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【30】For each fixed-dose (multiple-dose) study, we computed a single study-level effect size weighted by the degrees of freedom for each dose group. On the basis of the study-level effect-size values for both fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies, we calculated weighted mean effect-size values for each drug and for all drugs combined, using a random-effects model with the method of DerSimonian and Laird 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> in Stata. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28</a></sup></u>\n\n【31】Within the published studies, we compared the effect-size values derived from the journal articles with the corresponding effect-size values derived from the FDA reviews. Next, within the FDA data set, we compared the effect-size values for the published studies with the effect-size values for the unpublished studies. Finally, we compared the journal-based effect-size values with those derived from the entire FDA data set — that is, both published and unpublished studies.\n\n【32】We made these comparisons at the level of studies and again at the level of the 12 drugs. Because the data were not normally distributed, we used the nonparametric rank-sum test for unpaired data and the signed-rank test for paired data. In these analyses, all the effect-size values were given equal weight.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Study Outcome and Publication Status\n------------------------------------\n\n【35】Table 1.  Table 1. Overall Publication Status of FDA-Registered Antidepressant Studies.\n\n【36】Of the 74 FDA-registered studies in the analysis we could not find evidence of publication for 23 (31%) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The difference between the sample sizes for the published studies (median, 153 patients) and the unpublished studies (median, 146 patients) was neither large nor significant (5% difference between medians; P=0.29 by the rank-sum test).\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Effect of FDA Regulatory Decisions on Publication.\n\n【38】Among the 74 studies reviewed by the FDA (Panel A), 38 were deemed to have positive results, 37 of which were published with positive results; the remaining study was not published. Among the studies deemed to have questionable or negative results by the FDA, there was a tendency toward nonpublication or publication with positive results, conflicting with the conclusion of the FDA. Among the 12,564 patients in all 74 studies (Panel B), data for patients who participated in studies deemed positive by the FDA were very likely to be published in a way that agreed with the FDA. In contrast, data for patients participating in studies deemed questionable or negative by the FDA tended either not to be published or to be published in a way that conflicted with the FDA's judgment.\n\n【39】The data in Table 1 are displayed in terms of the study outcome in Figure 1A . The questions of whether the studies were published and, if so, how the results were reported were strongly related to their overall outcomes. The FDA deemed 38 of the 74 studies (51%) positive, and all but 1 of the 38 were published. The remaining 36 studies (49%) were deemed to be either negative (24 studies) or questionable (12). Of these 36 studies, 3 were published as not positive, whereas the remaining 33 either were not published (22 studies) or were published, in our opinion, as positive (11) and therefore conflicted with the FDA's conclusion. Overall, the studies that the FDA judged as positive were approximately 12 times as likely to be published in a way that agreed with the FDA analysis as were studies with nonpositive results according to the FDA (risk ratio, 11.7; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 6.2 to 22.0; P<0.001). This association of publication status with study outcome remained significant when we excluded questionable studies and when we examined publication status without regard to whether the published conclusions and the FDA conclusions were in agreement (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【40】Overall, 48 of the 51 published studies were reported to have positive results (94%; binomial 95% CI, 84 to 99). According to the FDA, 38 of the 74 registered studies had positive results (51%; 95% CI, 39 to 63). There was no overlap between these two sets of confidence intervals.\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Publication Status and FDA Regulatory Decision by Study and by Drug.\n\n【42】Panel A shows the publication status of individual studies. Nearly every study deemed positive by the FDA (top row) was published in a way that agreed with the FDA's judgment. By contrast, most studies deemed negative (bottom row) or questionable (middle row) by the FDA either were published in a way that conflicted with the FDA's judgment or were not published. Numbers shown in boxes indicate individual studies and correspond to the study numbers listed in Table A of the Supplementary Appendix . Panel B shows the numbers of patients participating in the individual studies indicated in Panel A. Data for patients who participated in studies deemed positive by the FDA were very likely to be published in a way that agreed with the FDA's judgment. By contrast, data for patients who participated in studies deemed negative or questionable by the FDA tended either not to be published or to be published in a way that conflicted with the FDA's judgment.\n\n【43】These data are broken down by drug and study number in Figure 2A . For each of the 12 drugs, the results of at least one study either were unpublished or were reported in the literature as positive despite a conflicting judgment by the FDA.\n\n【44】Number of Study Participants\n----------------------------\n\n【45】As shown in Table 1 , a total of 12,564 patients participated in these trials. The data from 3449 patients (27%) were not published. Data from an additional 1843 patients (15%) were reported in journal articles in which the highlighted finding conflicted with the FDA-defined primary outcome. Thus, the percentages for the patients closely mirrored those for the studies 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【46】Whether a patient's data were reported in a way that was in concert with the FDA review was associated with the study outcome 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u> (risk ratio, 27.1), which was consistent with the above-reported finding with the studies. Figure 2B shows these same data according to the drug being evaluated.\n\n【47】Qualitative Description of Selective Reporting within Trials\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】The methods reported in 11 journal articles appear to depart from the prespecified methods reflected in the FDA reviews 删除2:<u>(Table B of the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Although for each of these studies the finding with respect to the protocol-specified primary outcome was nonsignificant, each publication highlighted a positive result as if it were the primary outcome. The nonsignificant results for the prespecified primary outcomes were either subordinated to nonprimary positive results (in two reports) or omitted (in nine). (Study-level methodologic differences are detailed in the footnotes to Table B of the Supplementary Appendix .)\n\n【49】Effect Size\n-----------\n\n【50】The effect-size values derived from the journal reports were often greater than those derived from the FDA reviews. The difference between these two sets of values was significant whether the studies (P=0.003) or the drugs (P=0.012) were used as the units of analysis (see Table D in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【51】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Mean Weighted Effect Size According to Drug, Publication Status, and Data Source.\n\n【52】Values for effect size are expressed as Hedges's g (the difference between two means divided by their pooled standard deviation). Effect-size values of 0.2 and 0.5 are considered to be small and medium, respectively. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> Effect-size values for unpublished studies and published studies, as extracted from data in FDA reviews, are shown in Panel A. Horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals. There were no unpublished studies for controlled-release paroxetine or fluoxetine. For each of the other antidepressants, the effect size for the published subgroup of studies was greater than the effect size for the unpublished subgroup of studies. Overall effect-size values (i.e., based on data from the FDA for published and unpublished studies combined), as compared with effect-size values based on data from corresponding published reports, are shown in Panel B. For each drug, the effect-size value based on published literature was higher than the effect-size value based on FDA data, with increases ranging from 11 to 69%. For the entire drug class, effect sizes increased by 32%.\n\n【53】The effect sizes of the published and unpublished studies reviewed by the FDA are compared in Figure 3A . The overall mean weighted effect-size value was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.41) for published studies and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.22) for unpublished studies. The difference was significant whether the studies (P<0.001) or the drugs (P=0.005) were used as the units of analysis 删除2:<u>(Table D in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】The mean effect-size values for all FDA studies, both published and unpublished, are compared with those for all published studies, as shown in Figure 3B . Again, the differences were significant whether the studies (P<0.001) or the drugs (P=0.002) were used as units of analysis 删除2:<u>(Table D in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【55】For each of the 12 drugs, the effect size derived from the journal articles exceeded the effect size derived from the FDA reviews (sign test, P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. The magnitude of the increases in effect size between the FDA reviews and the published reports ranged from 11 to 69%, with a median increase of 32%. A 32% increase was also observed in the weighted mean effect size for all drugs combined, from 0.31 (95% CI, 0.27 to 0.35) to 0.41 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.45).\n\n【56】A list of the study-level effect-size values used in the above analyses — derived from both the FDA reviews and the published reports — is provided in Table C of the Supplementary Appendix . These effect-size values are based on P values and sample sizes shown in Table A of the Supplementary Appendix , which also lists reference information for the publications consulted.\n\n【57】Discussion\n----------\n\n【58】We found a bias toward the publication of positive results. Not only were positive results more likely to be published, but studies that were not positive, in our opinion, were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome. We analyzed these data in terms of the proportion of positive studies and in terms of the effect size associated with drug treatment. Using both approaches, we found that the efficacy of this drug class is less than would be gleaned from an examination of the published literature alone. According to the published literature, the results of nearly all of the trials of antidepressants were positive. In contrast, FDA analysis of the trial data showed that roughly half of the trials had positive results. The statistical significance of a study's results was strongly associated with whether and how they were reported, and the association was independent of sample size. The study outcome also affected the chances that the data from a participant would be published. As a result of selective reporting, the published literature conveyed an effect size nearly one third larger than the effect size derived from the FDA data.\n\n【59】Previous studies have examined the risk–benefit ratio for drugs after combining data from regulatory authorities with data published in journals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,30-32 </a></sup></u> We built on this approach by comparing study-level data from the FDA with matched data from journal articles. This comparative approach allowed us to quantify the effect of selective publication on apparent drug efficacy.\n\n【60】Our findings have several limitations: they are restricted to antidepressants, to industry-sponsored trials registered with the FDA, and to issues of efficacy (as opposed to “real-world” effectiveness 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> ). This study did not account for other factors that may distort the apparent risk–benefit ratio, such as selective publication of safety issues, as has been reported with rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck) 删除3:<u><sup><a>34 </a></sup></u> and with the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for depression in children. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Because we excluded articles covering multiple studies, we probably counted some studies as unpublished that were — technically — published. The practice of bundling negative and positive studies in a single article has been found to be associated with duplicate or multiple publication, 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> which may also influence the apparent risk–benefit ratio.\n\n【61】There can be many reasons why the results of a study are not published, and we do not know the reasons for nonpublication. Thus, we cannot determine whether the bias observed resulted from a failure to submit manuscripts on the part of authors and sponsors, decisions by journal editors and reviewers not to publish submitted manuscripts, or both.\n\n【62】We wish to clarify that nonsignificance in a single trial does not necessarily indicate lack of efficacy. Each drug, when subjected to meta-analysis, was shown to be superior to placebo. On the other hand, the true magnitude of each drug's superiority to placebo was less than a diligent literature review would indicate.\n\n【63】We do not mean to imply that the primary methods agreed on between sponsors and the FDA are necessarily preferable to alternative methods. Nevertheless, when multiple analyses are conducted, the principle of prespecification controls the rate of false positive findings (type I error), and it prevents HARKing, 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> or hypothesizing after the results are known.\n\n【64】It might be argued that some trials did not merit publication because of methodologic flaws, including problems beyond the control of the investigator. However, since the protocols were written according to international guidelines for efficacy studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> and were carried out by companies with ample financial and human resources, to be fair to the people who put themselves at risk to participate, a cogent public reason should be given for failure to publish.\n\n【65】Selective reporting deprives researchers of the accurate data they need to estimate effect size realistically. Inflated effect sizes lead to underestimates of the sample size required to achieve statistical significance. Underpowered studies — and selectively reported studies in general — waste resources and the contributions of investigators and study participants, and they hinder the advancement of medical knowledge. By altering the apparent risk–benefit ratio of drugs, selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and, thus, the public health.\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Turner reports having served as a medical reviewer for the Food and Drug Administration.

Acquired (somatic) mutations of either gene occur within pathologic cells in patients with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Renal angiomyolipomas occur in both disorders, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The proteins TSC1 and TSC2 regulate signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to control processes including growth, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and autophagy. Constitutive activation of mTOR and its downstream targets occurs in lesions associated with tuberous sclerosis or lymphangioleiomyomatosis, suggesting that mTOR inhibitors might have potential as molecularly targeted therapies in patients with these conditions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Case studies have shown shrinkage of tuberous sclerosis–associated angiomyolipomas and subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in response to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> We are conducting a multicenter, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus in adults with tuberous sclerosis or lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Patients are being treated for 2 years; here, we report our interim findings in 13 patients treated for up to 1 year.\n\n【3】Table 1.  Table 1. Changes in Size of Renal Angiomyolipomas and Results of Lung-Function Testing in Seven Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) and Six Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) during Treatment with Sirolimus.\n\n【4】Eligible patients had one or more renal angiomyolipomas that were more than 2 cm in the longest diameter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study was approved by a U.K. multicenter research ethics committee and by the ethics review board of each participating center. Patients received daily oral doses of sirolimus to achieve initial trough blood levels of 3 to 6 ng per milliliter, with an increase to 6 to 10 ng per milliliter at 2 months, unless all measured angiomyolipomas showed a reduction in the longest diameter of 10% or more. The sum of the longest diameters of up to five target angiomyolipomas (each with an initial longest diameter >2 cm) in each kidney was calculated after MRI at baseline, at 2 months, at 6 months, and at 12 months 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Respiratory function was measured at baseline, at 4 months, at 6 months, and at 12 months in patients with tuberous sclerosis–associated or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Shrinkage of angiomyolipomas was seen in all patients and the mean (±SD) reduction in the sum of the longest diameters at 12 months was 26.1±10.3%. However, no clear improvement in lung function was observed.\n\n【5】All patients had grade 1 or 2 adverse events (including mouth ulcers, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral edema) that, in all but one patient, resulted in periods of dose reduction or cessation of therapy.

Patients with pemphigus foliaceus have antibodies to a complex of three polypeptides of 260, 160, and 85 kd (the foliaceus complex), whereas patients with pemphigus vulgaris have antibodies to a complex of 210-kd, 130-kd, and 85-kd polypeptides (the vulgaris complex). The 160-kd polypeptide of the foliaceus complex has been identified as desmoglein, a desmosomal glycoprotein. We suspected that the 85-kd component in both these antigenic complexes might be plakoglobin, another molecule in the adhering junctions of cells.\n\n【2】To characterize these antigenic complexes, we used the serum of five patients with pemphigus foliaceus, that of four patients with pemphigus vulgaris, and monoclonal antiplakoglobin antibodies. We found that monoclonal antibodies to plakoglobin immunoprecipitated the 85-kd polypeptide from the dissociated foliaceus and vulgaris complexes and precipitated both complexes from epidermal extracts. Serum from patients with pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus vulgaris (but not from four normal controls) bound desmoglein and the 130-kd polypeptide, respectively, showing that these peptides (and not plakoglobin) are the antigenic binding sites in these disorders.\n\n【3】We conclude that plakoglobin, a protein of the adhering junctions of epidermal cells, is the 85-kd molecule in the antigenic complexes found in both pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, although it is not the binding site in either disorder. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1989; 321:631–5.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 15:14:00", "endTime": "2024/08/12 15:14:17", "cost": 17.455}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:22", "update_time": "2024-08-11 23:14:18", "grab_time": "2024-08-11 23:14:01"}

Trials that included only patients with extensive disease were excluded.\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】The meta-analysis included 13 trials and 2140 patients with limited disease. A total of 433 patients with extensive disease were excluded. Overall, 1862 of 2103 patients who could be evaluated died; the median follow-up period for the surviving patients was 43 months. The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the chemotherapy group was 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.94; P = 0.001), corresponding to a 14 percent reduction in the mortality rate. The benefit in terms of overall survival at three years (±SD) was 5.4±1.4 percent. Indirect comparison of early with late radiotherapy and of sequential with non-sequential radiotherapy did not reveal any optimal time for treatment. There was a trend toward a larger reduction in mortality among younger patients: the relative risk of death in the combined-therapy as compared with the chemotherapy group ranged from 0.72 for patients less than 55 years old (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.93) to 1.07 (0.70 to 1.64) for patients over 70.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】Thoracic radiotherapy moderately improves survival in patients with limited small-cell lung cancer who are treated with combination chemotherapy. Identification of the optimal combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy will require further trials. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1992; 327:1618–24.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】THE role of thoracic radiotherapy in the management of limited small-cell lung cancer remains controversial. Most investigators agree that it decreases the risk of thoracic recurrence significantly, but no agreement has been reached concerning its possible effect on survival. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Sixteen randomized trials have been conducted in the past 15 years, with inconsistent results 删除2:<u>(Appendix 2)</u>; thus, the controversy persists. If the heterogeneity of the patients studied is assumed not to be too great, there are three main possible explanations for the inconsistency: (1) that technical factors such as the radiation dose, tissue volume treated, drug administered, and timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy are so critical that differences in them may modify the effect of treatment 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> ; (2) that thoracic radiotherapy has no effect at all on survival, and the differences in results are simply the effect of statistical variations around the mean zero effect; or (3) that thoracic radiotherapy has a moderate effect on survival, but the trials did not have sufficient statistical power to test the hypothesis. The latter two explanations could be ruled out by a study that included a large number of patients. As has been demonstrated in breast cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> the meta-analysis of randomized trials is a useful tool to evaluate adjuvant treatments that produce a moderate increase in overall survival — i.e., an increase of 5 to 10 percent at five years. Such a small benefit would be of value to patients with limited small-cell lung cancer, among whom survival at five years is only about 10 percent. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】The hypothesis that we tested in our meta-analysis was that thoracic radiotherapy produces a moderate improvement in the overall survival of patients with limited small-cell lung cancer. To detect a survival benefit of 6 percent — for example, an increase from 10 to 16 percent — more than 1000 patients would be needed, assuming that the Type I and II errors were equal to 0.05 (by two-sided test). The meta-analysis included 2140 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer studied in 13 randomized trials 删除2:<u>(Appendix 2)</u>. Such a meta-analysis should be a reliable test of the effect of treatment, but it may not provide definitive information about details of treatment, such as the dose and timing of radiation.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Data Collection\n---------------\n\n【15】The collection of data started in September 1989.\n\n【16】### __Inclusion Criteria__\n\n【17】All randomized trials that included patients with small-cell lung cancer and compared chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus thoracic radiotherapy were studied. Trials limited to patients with extensive disease were excluded, as were patients with extensive disease in trials addressing both limited and extensive disease. Trials with enrollment that had not ended before December 31, 1988, were also excluded.\n\n【18】### __Identification of Trials__\n\n【19】Multiple sources of information were used to identify trials. The first step involved discussion with the investigators and scrutiny of review articles; this was supplemented by a MEDLINE literature search and examination of proceedings of oncology meetings. The list of identified trials was sent to all trial members participating in the meta-analysis. The comparison of our list with the list of randomized trials of treatments of lung cancer compiled by Nicolucci et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> revealed no additional trials. Appendix 2 lists the included and excluded trials and the reasons for exclusion.\n\n【20】### __Data from Individual Trials__\n\n【21】Table 1.  Table 1. Enrollment of Patients with Limited Disease and Exclusions from Analysis in Randomized Trials of Thoracic Radiotherapy for Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Chemotherapy.\n\n【22】We sought data on each patient ever enrolled in the trials studied. All trial members provided such data on either a standard paper questionnaire or a magnetic tape. The collected data included identifying information, the extent of disease as defined in each trial, the treatment assigned, the dates of randomization and of the last follow-up evaluation, vital status at the last evaluation, and three covariates — sex, age, and performance status. Because the coding of performance status varied among trials, it could only be summarized in two ways: as a performance status of 0 or 1 as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) or a Karnofsky index above 60 percent, and as a WHO performance status of 2 to 4 or a Karnofsky index of 60 percent or less. Data on the assigned treatment and on follow-up were available for 98.2 percent of the patients. Table 1 shows the number of patients in each trial and the number excluded from the published analyses and the present meta-analysis. Information on sex, age, and performance status was obtained for 98.2 percent, 97.9 percent, and 95.6 percent of patients, respectively. It was impossible to obtain data from three small trials; one had 35 patients (only 12 with limited disease), another had 32, and the third had 18.\n\n【23】### __Data Checking__\n\n【24】Data on patients who were entered in trials but excluded from analyses were systematically sought to avoid the potential bias of postrandomization exclusion. In cases of imbalance in the sizes of the treatment groups, we checked for improper exclusion or undocumented changes in treatment assignment. The treatment groups were also checked for imbalances in sex, age, performance status, and the proportion of patients lost to follow-up. A patient was considered lost to follow-up if no information was available after September 1, 1988, one year before the beginning of data collection for the meta-analysis. Of the 190 patients lost to follow-up, 43 (22.6 percent) were lost after three years of follow-up.\n\n【25】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【26】All comparisons were performed according to the treatment assigned by randomization (intention-to-treat analysis).\n\n【27】The statistical method used has been described elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> For each trial, the number of deaths observed (O) among patients assigned to combined therapy (chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy) was compared with the number of deaths expected (E) under the assumption that the probability of death was unrelated to treatment. The variance (V) of the observed number minus the expected number (O − E) was also computed. The values for O − E and V were then summed over the whole set of trials to produce a grand total (GT) and a total variance (V <sub>T </sub> ). The ratio  or z, tests treatment effect for significance.\n\n【28】For each trial, the relative risk of death was estimated as exp\\[(0 − E)/V\\]. The pooled relative risk was estimated as exp(GT/V <sub>T </sub> ), with a 95 percent confidence interval estimated as exp  . The percent reduction in the relative risk of death (r) was estimated as 100 − 100 exp(GT/V <sub>T </sub> ) and expressed with its approximate standard deviation, −r/z.\n\n【29】Tests of heterogeneity among different trials 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> were performed, but such tests are of limited value because of their low power. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity does not invalidate the results of a meta-analysis. An interaction test 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> was used for indirect comparisons of trial subgroups according to the timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This test was also used for subgroup analyses according to sex, age, and performance status. All P values are two-tailed. The standard deviations for the reduction in the relative risk and the difference between survival rates are given.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Description of the Included Trials\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】Table 2.  Table 2. Design of Randomized Trials Evaluating the Role of Thoracic Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Limited Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Chemotherapy.\\*\n\n【33】This meta-analysis was based on 13 randomized trials that included 2573 patients (range per trial, 54 to 426). Table 2 shows the heterogeneity of these trials with respect to the timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, doses and fractionation of radiation, drug regimens, and study design. Five trials included both patients with limited disease and patients with extensive disease 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. A total of 433 patients with extensive disease were excluded from the metaanalysis. Among the 2140 patients with limited disease, there were enough data on 2103 to permit them to be included in the study. Of these 2103 patients, 1862 died; the median follow-up period for the surviving patients was 43 months. One hundred eleven patients who had not been included in the analyses of individual trials were included in the meta-analysis 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【34】Meta-Analysis\n-------------\n\n【35】Figure 1. Figure 1. Relative Risk of Death among Patients Receiving Both Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy (CT + RT) as Compared with Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Alone (CT). Figure 2.  Figure 2. Survival Curves for the Combined-Therapy Group and the Chemotherapy Group.\n\n【36】The three-year survival rates were 14.3±1.1 percent in the combined-therapy group and 8.9±0.9 percent in the chemotherapy group (for a difference of 5.4± 1.4 percent; P = 0.001 by stratified log-rank test). Each I bar denotes the standard deviation.\n\n【37】Among the 2103 patients with limited disease, there were 890 deaths among the 992 patients assigned to chemotherapy and 972 among the 1111 patients assigned to chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. Figure 1 shows the results of the meta-analysis for patients with limited disease. The overall relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the chemotherapy group was 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.94; P = 0.001). This result corresponded to a 14 percent reduction in the risk of death, in favor of combined therapy. The increase in terms of overall survival at three years was 5.4±1.4 percent 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【38】Sensitivity Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【39】### __Analysis without the Copenhagen Trial__\n\n【40】The results of 1 of the 13 trials, the Copenhagen trial, showed borderline significance in favor of chemotherapy alone 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u>. Since these results might be partially explained by the difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients with complete tumor resection (11 of 76 patients in the chemotherapy group vs. 3 of 72 in the combined-therapy group; P = 0.047 by Fisher's exact test) and in age distribution (mean ±SD, 58.5±6.9 vs. 60.8±6.2 years, respectively; P = 0.04 by t-test), a second analysis was performed without this trial. The pooled relative risk derived from this analysis was 0.82 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.91; P<0.001), corresponding to an 18 percent reduction in the risk of death. When the Copenhagen trial was excluded, the test of heterogeneity produced a P value of 0.76 instead of 0.15. This trial was a major source of heterogeneity among the trials included in the meta-analysis, as shown in Figure 1 . In the few instances in which the tests of heterogeneity showed significance or some trend, they did not show it after this trial was excluded.\n\n【41】### __Analysis without the GETCB Trial__\n\n【42】All the trials had ended enrollment by 1986 except the trial by the Groupe d'Etude et de Traitement des Cancers Bronchiques (GETCB), which enrolled patients from 1986 to 1988. Failure to include other unpublished and concurrent trials could have resulted in a bias. When the GETCB trial was excluded, the pooled relative risk remained virtually unchanged, at 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.94).\n\n【43】### __Analysis with Censoring of Follow-up at Three Years__\n\n【44】To avoid the possible bias resulting from better follow-up of the combined-therapy group than of the chemotherapy group, the analysis was repeated after censoring of the follow-up data available at three years. The resulting analysis yielded a very similar result, with a pooled relative risk of 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 0.92; P<0.001).\n\n【45】### __Analysis Including Patients with Extensive Disease__\n\n【46】To avoid bias related to the exclusion of patients in the five trials that studied both limited and extensive disease, the 433 patients with extensive disease were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 2536 patients, 2293 died, leading to a very similar relative risk, 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.94; P<0.001).\n\n【47】Indirect Comparisons\n--------------------\n\n【48】### __Trials with Early and Late Radiotherapy__\n\n【49】The analysis limited to the trials with early radiotherapy — defined as radiation given within 60 days after the beginning of treatment — yielded a pooled relative risk of 0.88 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.98); when the Copenhagen trial was excluded from this analysis, the pooled relative risk was 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.93). The analysis limited to trials with late radiotherapy yielded a pooled relative risk of 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.94). The relative risks generated in these analyses of early and late radiotherapy were not significantly different.\n\n【50】### __Trials with or without Sequential Radiotherapy__\n\n【51】The analysis limited to the trials with sequential radiotherapy yielded a pooled relative risk of 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.00). The analysis limited to the trials with nonsequential (alternating or concurrent) radiotherapy yielded a pooled relative risk of 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96), with significant heterogeneity (P = 0.03). When the Copenhagen trial was excluded from the analysis of trials with nonsequential radiotherapy, the pooled relative risk was 0.79 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.90) (heterogeneity test, P = 0.78). The relative risks in the analyses of sequential and nonsequential radiotherapy were not significantly different.\n\n【52】Subgroup Analysis\n-----------------\n\n【53】### __Treatment Effect According to Age__\n\n【54】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Relative Risk of Death in the Combined-Therapy Group (CT + RT) as Compared with the Chemotherapy Group (CT), According to Age.\n\n【55】The test for trend was significant (P = 0.01). The percentage reduction in the pooled relative risk (±SD) was 16±5 percent. See the legend to Figure 1 for an explanation of the symbols.\n\n【56】Figure 3 shows a significant trend (P = 0.01) toward a larger proportional effect on mortality among younger patients than among older patients in favor of the combined-therapy group: the relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the chemotherapy group ranged from 0.72 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.93) among patients less than 55 years old to 1.07 (0.70 to 1.64) among patients more than 70 years old; the reductions in the risk of death were 28±8 percent and -7±17 percent, respectively. The exclusion of the Copenhagen trial did not modify this result. Among patients less than 55 years old, the three-year survival rates estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method were 9.2±1.9 percent in the chemotherapy group and 17.4±2.2 percent in the combined-therapy group; among patients more than 70 years old, the rates were 10.2±3.4 percent and 8.7±2.7 percent, respectively.\n\n【57】### __Treatment Effect According to Sex__\n\n【58】The pooled relative risk for the 667 women was 0.79 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94), and that for the 1434 men was 0.88 (0.78 to 0.98). These two relative risks were not significantly different. The three-year survival rates were 13.8 percent for women and 10.8 percent for men.\n\n【59】### __Treatment Effect According to Performance Status__\n\n【60】The pooled relative risk for the 1808 patients with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1 was 0.86 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.95), and that for the 237 patients with a performance status of 2 to 4 was 0.76 (0.57 to 1.01). These two relative risks were not significantly different. The three-year survival rates were 12.1 percent for the patients with a status of 0 or 1 and 10.4 percent for those with a status of 2 to 4.\n\n【61】Discussion\n----------\n\n【62】Among the 16 published trials comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy for limited small-cell lung cancer, including 5 trials reported as abstracts, 5 showed that combined therapy had a significant benefit as compared with chemotherapy (the trials by Bunn et al., Birch et al., Perry et al., and Creech et al. and the excluded trial by Schütte et al., all listed in Appendix 2); among the 5 largest trials, 3 showed a significant benefit (the trials by Birch et al., Perry et al., and Creech et al.). The meta-analysis of the 13 largest trials showed that the administration of thoracic radiotherapy led to a 14 percent reduction in the mortality rate (P = 0.001), corresponding to a 5 percent increase in the three-year survival rate. If the three smallest trials excluded because of a lack of individual data had been included in the meta-analysis, the results would not have been significantly different, because the patients in these three trials represented 2.8 percent of those included in trials potentially suitable for the meta-analysis. Because of the lack of heterogeneity among the trials, particularly when the Copenhagen trial was excluded, statistical methods taking this heterogeneity into account, such as the DerSimonian and Laird method, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> would have led to similar conclusions.\n\n【63】We found that the benefit from radiotherapy was greatest in patients under 55 years of age. The smaller effect of treatment in the older patients could be explained by increased toxicity, but it is not possible to examine this hypothesis with the available data. However, the lack of a clearly significant reduction in mortality among patients over the age of 64 is not good evidence that the effect of treatment on survival is negligible among such patients, because of the difficulty of proving a negative result and the large confidence intervals. Therefore, this subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution.\n\n【64】Nicolucci et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> concluded after reviewing randomized trials of the treatment of lung cancer that a meta-analysis of existing trials would not be constructive; however, their review was based only on trials published as full papers before 1987. Our meta-analysis was based on data on individual patients submitted by each trial group, and we did not exclude unpublished data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> This method allowed us to avoid the exclusion of trials with insufficient published information on survival, to check for imbalances between treatment groups, to recover data on patients who had been excluded from analyses in published studies, to update follow-up information, and to take into account the whole follow-up period when comparing treatments. As a result, our analysis is more powerful and less subject to bias.\n\n【65】The present meta-analysis did not allow a good estimation of the survival rates after three years, because of the large proportion of patients lost to follow-up thereafter (16 percent); further follow-up will be needed. However, since approximately 90 percent of the patients included in these trials died, the results of the meta-analysis would not have been changed significantly if information about patients lost to follow-up had been included.\n\n【66】We were unable to evaluate the nonlethal toxicity of treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Complication rates varied, and information about toxicity was heterogeneous.\n\n【67】Intention-to-treat analysis serves as an unbiased test of whether treatment has a real effect, but it may underestimate the size of the effect — i.e., the difference between the two treatment groups if all patients comply fully with their regimen. Furthermore, results may improve as more modern regimens are formulated. The results obtained in the patients receiving chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy probably do not give a true picture of what combined treatment might offer today. It is likely that there would be a major benefit if treatment variables such as the radiation dose, tissue volume, drugs administered, and timing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy were optimized.\n\n【68】The selection of an optimal schedule of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy that would lead to a major increase in survival with minimal toxicity is the principal challenge raised by our study. There are theoretical reasons to favor early radiotherapy and concurrent or alternating chemotherapeutic regimens. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> We hope that the results of future trials will settle this question.\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by a grant from the Groupement des Entreprises Françaises dans la Lutte contre le Cancer.</u>\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Ben Affaied, Andrew Kramar, and Serge Koscielny for programming support; to Ariane Auquier and Catherine Hill for fruitful discussions; to Lorna Saint Ange for assistance in revising the manuscript; and to Sylviane Iacobelli for assistance in the preparation of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>From the Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France (J.-P.P., R.A.); the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md.

For use that lasted at least one year, the rate-ratio estimate for Stage I or II cancer was 5.2 (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.7 to 7.2), and for Stages III and IV combined it was 3.1 (1.5 to 6.4).

We aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons with this condition.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was <50 kg or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose adjustment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year (range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. The mean (±SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40±2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P<0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2±15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2±14.4 in the levothyroxine group; between-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −2.0 to 2.1) or the Tiredness score (3.2±17.7 and 3.8±18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% CI, −2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-outcome measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespecified as being of special interest.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660126 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin level and a serum free thyroxine level within the reference range. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Between 8% and 18% of adults 65 years of age or older have these biochemical features, and the prevalence is higher among women than among men. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Subclinical hypothyroidism is a possible contributor to many problems in older persons. Thyroid hormones have multiple effects, since they act as an essential regulatory factor in numerous physiological systems, including the vascular tree and the heart, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> the brain (including cognition), 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> skeletal muscle, and bone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Tiredness is the most important symptom of overt hypothyroidism, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> but most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism have no symptoms or have nonspecific symptoms. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> There is a convincing epidemiologic association with subsequent coronary heart disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Randomized, controlled trials of levothyroxine replacement for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been small 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> and have yielded only limited evidence regarding the possible benefits and risks of treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> We aimed to determine whether there are clinical benefits from levothyroxine replacement in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Overview\n--------------\n\n【16】The trial protocol , which was published previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the relevant ethics committees and regulatory authorities in all the countries involved in the trial. Participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【17】The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics at the University of Glasgow was the trial data and biostatistics center.\n\n【18】The European Union FP7 provided primary financial support for the conduct of the trial. Supplies of levothyroxine and matching placebo were provided free of charge by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The funder, the trial sponsors (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board and University of Glasgow, United Kingdom; University College Cork, Ireland; Leiden University Medical Center, the Netherlands; and University of Bern and Bern University Hospital, Switzerland), and Merck played no role in the design, analysis, or reporting of the trial. The main sponsor (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board) contributed to the writing of the protocol. None of the sponsors had any involvement in the analysis or the reporting of the results. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses reported and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【19】Participants\n------------\n\n【20】Participants were identified from clinical laboratory and general practice databases and records. The inclusion criteria were an age of 65 years or more and persistent subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated thyrotropin level (4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter) that was measured on at least two occasions that were 3 months to 3 years apart, with the free thyroxine level within the reference range. The main exclusion criteria for the trial were a current prescription for levothyroxine, antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, or lithium; thyroid surgery or receipt of radioactive iodine within the previous 12 months; dementia; hospitalization for a major illness or an elective surgery within the previous 4 weeks; an acute coronary syndrome (including myocardial infarction or unstable angina) within the previous 4 weeks; and terminal illness. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Trial Design and Regimen\n------------------------\n\n【22】We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial of levothyroxine versus placebo. Patients underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification according to country, sex, and starting dose, with the use of randomly permuted blocks.\n\n【23】The active intervention started with levothyroxine at a dose of 50 μg daily (or 25 μg in patients with a body weight of <50 kg or with known coronary heart disease \\[previous myocardial infarction or symptoms of angina pectoris\\]) or matching placebo. Dose adjustment in the levothyroxine group was aimed to result in a thyrotropin level within the reference range (0.40 to 4.59 mIU per liter). Details regarding how the dose was adjusted and the mock adjustment in the placebo group are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. All dose adjustments were generated and executed by means of computer without the intervention of a physician. The participants, investigators, and treating physicians were unaware of the results of thyrotropin measurements throughout the course of the trial.\n\n【24】Procedures and Outcomes\n-----------------------\n\n【25】The two primary outcomes for the trial were the change from baseline to 12 months in the Thyroid-Related Quality-of-Life Patient-Reported Outcome measure (ThyPRO) Hypothyroid Symptoms score (4 items) and Tiredness score (7 items); each scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms and tiredness, respectively. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> A recent systematic review recommended ThyPRO as the preferred measurement tool for the assessment of health-related quality of life in patients with benign thyroid disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The ThyPRO and other instruments were administered in English, French, German, or Dutch as appropriate. We had initially planned for cardiovascular events and thyroid-specific quality of life to be the two primary outcomes. However, this plan was modified during the trial to thyroid-specific quality-of-life scores as the two primary outcomes and cardiovascular events as a secondary outcome when it became apparent that the trial would be underpowered for cardiovascular events owing to delays and difficulties in recruitment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【26】The secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in generic health-related quality of life (as assessed by the EuroQoL \\[EQ\\] Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire \\[EQ-5D\\]; scores on the EQ-5D descriptive index range from −0.59 to 1.00, and scores on the EQ visual-analogue scale range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> comprehensive thyroid-related quality of life (as assessed by the ThyPRO-39 score, a shorter version of the ThyPRO measure, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> at final follow-up only), hand-grip strength (as assessed by means of the Jamar isometric dynamometer, with the recorded score as the best of three measures in the dominant hand), 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> executive cognitive function (as assessed with the letter–digit coding test, which indicates the speed of processing according to the number of correct responses in matching nine letters with nine digits in 90 seconds; minimum score, 0, with higher scores indicating better executive cognitive function; there is no maximum score), 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), weight, body-mass index, waist circumference, activities of daily living (as assessed by the Barthel Index of functional levels in activities of daily living, on a scale ranging from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating better performance), 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score (on a scale from 0 to 14, with higher scores indicating better performance in activities of daily living), 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. The minimum follow-up was 1 year, and the maximum follow-up was 3 years.\n\n【27】Safety and Recording of Adverse Events\n--------------------------------------\n\n【28】Adverse events were assessed, managed, recorded, reported, and analyzed in accordance with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). Adverse events of special interest included new atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fracture, and new diagnosis of osteoporosis. The score on the ThyPRO Hyperthyroid Symptoms scale was recorded as a measure of possible adverse effects (on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms; minimum clinically important difference has been estimated as 9 points). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The Hypothyroid Symptoms and Tiredness scores from the ThyPRO 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> were the two primary outcomes, with the required P value for statistical significance split equally to each test (0.05/2=0.025 for each test). We assumed standard deviations for data at 1 year of 13.3 and 18.3 on the 100-point scales, respectively, after adjustment for baseline values. These calculations provided the trial with 80% power to detect a change with levothyroxine treatment (vs. placebo) of 3.0 points on the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and 4.1 points on the Tiredness score with our revised maximum expected number of recruited participants of 750, and with changes of 3.5 points and 4.9 points, respectively, with our minimum expected number of 540 participants. Justification for these power calculations is provided in the trial protocol. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【31】The methods of analysis of the continuous efficacy outcomes involving measurements at baseline and follow-up were analyzed at each time point for the comparison of the two trial groups, with adjustment for stratification variables (country, sex, and starting dose of levothyroxine) and baseline levels of the same variable with the use of multivariate linear regression (see the Supplementary Appendix ). The efficacy and safety analyses were carried out in a modified intention-to-treat population, which included participants with data on the outcome of interest. Patients who discontinued the trial regimen continued to be followed for the modified intention-to-treat analysis. These analyses were supported with sensitivity analyses that used mixed-effects models and multiple imputations for missing data. The primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months were also analyzed in prespecified subgroups according to sex and baseline thyrotropin level. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Analyses were repeated in the per-protocol population, which included participants who continued to take the trial regimen per the trial protocol.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【34】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Randomization, Follow-up, and Dose Levels.\n\n【35】Exclusions for other reasons included use of antithyroid medication (in 17 persons), recent thyroid surgery (in 1), recent acute coronary syndrome (in 1), current participation in another trial (in 1), and adrenal insufficiency (in 1). Two patients who were excluded because the thyrotropin level reverted to less than 4.60 mIU per liter also had an additional exclusion of galactose intolerance. Extended follow-up beyond 12 months was conducted in a subgroup of patients, with a median duration of follow-up from baseline of 24.2 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.3) in the placebo group and 24.5 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.5) in the levothyroxine group.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline.\n\n【36】We screened 2647 community-dwelling persons who were at least 65 years of age and who were identified as having biochemical subclinical hypothyroidism. A total of 737 participants underwent randomization, 369 of whom were assigned to receive placebo and 368 to receive levothyroxine 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The characteristics at baseline were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. A score of 0 (indicating no symptoms) at baseline was observed in 199 of 737 participants (27.0%) on the Hypothyroid Symptoms scale and in 64 (8.7%) on the Tiredness scale; 36 participants (4.9%) had a score of 0 in both domains.\n\n【37】A total of 337 participants (91.3%) who were randomly assigned to the placebo group completed 12-month follow-up, as did 332 (90.2%) in the levothyroxine group. The median follow-up for all the participants who underwent randomization (including participants who discontinued the trial regimen) was 17.3 months (interquartile range, 12.0 to 24.4) in the placebo group and 18.0 months (interquartile range, 11.0 to 25.4) in the levothyroxine group. The median dose of levothyroxine at 1 year was 50 μg. The numbers of patients who were included in the analyses are presented in Figure 1 .\n\n【38】Thyroid-Function Tests\n----------------------\n\n【39】Table 2. Table 2. Outcomes at 12 Months and Extended Follow-up. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Thyrotropin Levels in the Placebo Group and Levothyroxine Group.\n\n【40】Shown are the results of a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Data are means, and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Extended follow-up beyond 12 months was conducted in a subgroup of patients, with a median duration of follow-up from baseline of 24.2 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.3) in the placebo group and 24.5 months (interquartile range, 18.4 to 30.5) in the levothyroxine group. P<0.001 for between-group differences in the thyrotropin level at 6 to 8 weeks, 12 months, and extended follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for stratification variables (country, sex, and starting dose of levothyroxine) and baseline thyrotropin level with the use of linear regression; data for the extended follow-up visit were additionally adjusted for time to visit.\n\n【41】The mean (±SD) thyrotropin level at baseline was 6.40±2.01 mIU per liter. The thyrotropin levels were reduced from baseline to a greater extent in the levothyroxine group than in the placebo group at all time points of review, with a mean between-group difference of 2.29 mIU per liter at 6 to 8 weeks after randomization (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. At 12 months, the mean thyrotropin level was 5.48±2.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63±2.11 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group, resulting in a between-group difference of 1.92 mIU per liter (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2 )</u>. There was a significant interaction between the trial group and the office visit (P=0.03), with a reduction in the thyrotropin level being the greatest at 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n【42】Free thyroxine levels were not routinely measured, although the data were available in a subgroup of patients. The mean free thyroxine level was 2.3 pmol per liter (0.2 ng per deciliter) higher in the levothyroxine group than in the placebo group both at 6 to 8 weeks and at 12 months (P<0.001 for both comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【43】Thyroid-Specific Quality of Life\n--------------------------------\n\n【44】The mean Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 months (with adjustment for baseline score) was 16.7±17.5 in the placebo group and 16.6±16.9 in the levothyroxine group (P=0.99). The mean Tiredness score was 28.6±19.5 in the placebo group and 28.7±20.2 in the levothyroxine group (P=0.77). We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2±15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2±14.4 in the levothyroxine group) or the Tiredness score (3.2±17.7 and 3.8±18.4, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There were no significant between-group differences in either of these measures at 6 to 8 weeks 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was a small-magnitude between-group difference in the Tiredness score, with a lower value in the levothyroxine group than in the placebo group (difference, −3.49; P=0.05) at the extended follow-up review 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Prespecified analyses according to sex and baseline thyrotropin level did not reveal any subgroups of patients who benefited from treatment with levothyroxine. Per-protocol analyses and sensitivity analyses with the use of multiple imputation of missing values showed no significant differences between the levothyroxine group and the placebo group 删除2:<u>(Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【45】Other Outcome Measures\n----------------------\n\n【46】The EQ-5D descriptive index showed a small deterioration at 12 months (mean difference between the levothyroxine group and the placebo group, −0.025; P=0.05) but a minor improvement at extended follow-up (mean difference, 0.040; P=0.03); there were no significant between-group differences at 6 to 8 weeks. There were no significant between-group differences in the score on the EQ visual-analogue scale 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical Outcomes and Adverse Events.\n\n【48】No significant effects were seen in any of the other secondary-outcome measures, either in the modified intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses or in the prespecified subgroups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Tables S4, S6, S7, and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Results regarding cardiovascular events and total and cardiovascular mortality are provided in Table 3 and in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【49】Adverse Effects and Events\n--------------------------\n\n【50】We found no significant difference in the Hyperthyroid Symptoms score (according to the ThyPRO assessment) with levothyroxine, as compared with placebo, at any time point 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The incidence of serious adverse events of special interest (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fracture, or new diagnosis of osteoporosis) was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The number of patients with at least one serious adverse event was slightly higher in the placebo group than in the levothyroxine group (P=0.049), as was the total number of serious adverse events. However, we observed no pattern of event type that contributed to this difference. The proportions of patients who discontinued the trial regimen or who withdrew from follow-up were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving older participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine was associated with a persistently lower serum thyrotropin level than was placebo (between-group difference, approximately 2 mIU per liter), with the maximum effects seen at time of first review (6 to 8 weeks). We found that levothyroxine had no consistent beneficial effect on thyroid-related symptoms. This finding was true in both older men and older women and for different thyrotropin levels at baseline. Our trial had good statistical power to detect a clinically meaningful effect on thyroid-related quality of life, with 95% confidence intervals that excluded a beneficial effect greater than 2.1 points (on a scale from 0 to 100) in either of the two primary outcomes. If a symptom benefit was to have occurred, it would have been expected to be seen at 12 months.\n\n【53】The subsequent small-magnitude between-group difference in tiredness with levothyroxine versus placebo in the subgroup of patients who had extended follow-up is likely to be a chance finding. In contrast, an observational study of the treatment of autoimmune hypothyroidism in middle-age participants (median baseline thyrotropin level, 8.1 mIU per liter) showed that the Tiredness score improved markedly (reduction of 12 points at 6 months) and that the Hypothyroid Symptoms score also was reduced (by 2 points). 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> A small reduction in tiredness has previously been shown in a short-term trial of levothyroxine for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in 120 middle-age participants. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> There are limited data from high-quality, randomized, controlled trials regarding the effects of levothyroxine replacement in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Studies have generally been small (≤120 participants) and underpowered, often focusing on younger participants and with a short duration of follow-up. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】Levothyroxine treatment yielded no significant beneficial effects on a range of secondary-outcome measures. We found a slight deterioration (of borderline statistical significance) in the EQ-5D descriptive index with levothyroxine versus placebo at 12 months but an improvement versus placebo in the subgroup of patients who completed extended follow-up (median, 24.5 months). The effects we observed were in opposite directions at these different time points and were of very small magnitude (−0.025 at 12 months and 0.040 at extended follow-up), and therefore these are likely to be random chance findings. The estimated minimally important difference in the EQ-5D descriptive index that has been reported for other conditions is summarized in a recent review as being between 0.037 and 0.069. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> No effect of treatment was seen with regard to the EQ visual-analogue scale scores. Therefore, it appears that levothyroxine had no clinically significant effects on generic health-related quality of life.\n\n【55】Muscle function has been described as being adversely affected by underactive thyroid. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> However, we found that hand-grip strength did not change from baseline significantly more with levothyroxine treatment than with placebo. Similarly, it has been suggested that the speed of information processing is slowed in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> However, we found no benefit with levothyroxine with regard to executive cognitive function as measured by the letter–digit coding test. There also was no effect of treatment on blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, body-mass index, or the Barthel Index or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores.\n\n【56】Participants were monitored closely for adverse effects from levothyroxine treatment. We found no increase in hyperthyroid symptoms after the initiation of treatment, and there was no significant excess of serious adverse events of special interest, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fracture, or new diagnosis of osteoporosis. We believe that the slight excess of patients who had serious adverse events in the placebo group is a chance finding; the events were spread among a range of body systems, and no particular pattern was observed. Observational studies also have not shown any association of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with an increased risk of adverse events. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Many older persons with biochemical results that are consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism will have reversion to a euthyroid state if they are followed up without treatment. In total, approximately three out of five persons that we screened for entry into the trial on the basis of previously elevated thyrotropin levels had reversion to normal thyroid biochemical results and were therefore excluded from the trial. These data are consistent with several other observational and trial cohorts that showed a high proportion of participants with an elevated thyrotropin level having reversion to biochemical euthyroidism during follow-up. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,27,28</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】Our trial has certain strengths. The trial included a sufficient number of participants to provide good statistical power to show no benefits regarding symptoms. We used validated measures of thyroid-specific quality of life that have been shown to be sensitive to change, 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,17 </a></sup></u> as well as a range of secondary outcomes of clinical relevance. However, the trial also had certain limitations. First, we chose to set a thyrotropin target of 0.40 to 4.60 mIU per liter with levothyroxine treatment, which is an approach that reflects recent guidelines, particularly for older persons. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> However, some authorities have recommended a lower thyrotropin target (e.g., 0.40 to 2.50 mIU per liter). 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> We cannot exclude the possibility that this more aggressive treatment approach might be beneficial. Second, since few participants had a baseline thyrotropin level of more than 10 mIU per liter, we cannot address whether there are benefits from treatment in this subgroup. Third, the symptom levels at trial entry were low, so we cannot exclude the possibility of benefit in persons with more marked symptoms. Fourth, we did not measure thyroid antibody levels. Antibody-positive patients are more likely than antibody-negative patients to have progressive hypothyroidism and therefore may be more likely to have a benefit from long-term levothyroxine treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Finally, our trial was underpowered to detect any effect of levothyroxine on the incidence of cardiovascular events or mortality. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that treatment with levothyroxine may provide cardiovascular protection or cause harm.\n\n【59】In conclusion, this trial indicated that treatment with levothyroxine in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism provided no symptomatic benefits.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a research grant (278148) from the European Union FP7-HEALTH-2011 program and by grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 320030-150025, to Dr. Rodondi; P2BEP3\\_165409, to Dr. Baumgartner; and PZ00P3-167826, to Dr. Collet) and the Swiss Heart Foundation and Velux Stiftung (974a, to Dr. Rodondi).</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on April 3, 2017, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>We thank the staff of Mawdsley-Brooks (United Kingdom) who were responsible for the implementation of the randomization schedule, the packaging and labeling of levothyroxine and placebo, and the distribution to national trial sites; the members of the independent data and safety monitoring committee (Dr. Gary Ford, Dr. Thompson G.

We recruited 3654 people 49 to 97 years of age; the participation rate was 82 percent. We collected information by questionnaire on potential risk factors for cataracts, including the current or prior use of inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide). Photographs of the subjects' lenses were graded, without information on the subjects, to determine the presence and severity of cortical, nuclear, and posterior subcapsular cataracts.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Three hundred seventy subjects reported using inhaled corticosteroids, 164 currently and 206 previously. Among these subjects, after adjustment for age and sex, there was a higher prevalence of nuclear cataracts (relative prevalence, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.9) and posterior subcapsular cataracts (relative prevalence, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.8) than among the subjects with no inhaled-corticosteroid use, but the prevalence of cortical cataracts was not significantly higher (relative prevalence, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3). Higher cumulative lifetime doses of beclomethasone were associated with higher risks of posterior subcapsular cataracts (P for trend <0.001); the highest prevalence (27 percent) was found in subjects whose lifetime dose was over 2000 mg (relative prevalence, 5.5). Adjusting for the use of systemic corticosteroids and other potential confounders had little effect on the magnitude of the associations. The associations with posterior subcapsular cataracts, but not those with nuclear cataracts, were less marked when the analyses were restricted to subjects who had never used systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with the development of posterior subcapsular and nuclear cataracts.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cataracts are classified according to their anatomical location; the most common types are cortical, nuclear, and posterior subcapsular. Posterior subcapsular cataracts are the most visually disabling type and account for the majority of cataract extractions. With advancing age, cortical and nuclear cataracts become increasingly important causes of visual loss. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】The use of systemic corticosteroids is an established risk factor for the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> A case report in 1980 suggested that inhaled corticosteroids may also cause cataracts, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> but most subsequent studies of patients attending asthma clinics have found no such association. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-10 </a></sup></u> Because nearly all subjects in studies to date have also used systemic corticosteroids, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of inhaled corticosteroids from those of systemic corticosteroids. Furthermore, most studies have involved only children, in whom cataracts are extremely rare. We report the results of a community-based study of cataracts in older adults, including a substantial number of users of inhaled corticosteroids who never used systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】The Blue Mountains Eye Study is a population-based study of vision and common eye diseases in an urban population in the Blue Mountains region, west of Sydney, Australia. The details of the recruitment methods have been reported elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> In brief, after conducting a door-to-door census of the region, we invited all permanent residents born before January 1, 1943, to visit a local clinic for a detailed eye examination. Of the 4433 people identified as eligible by the census, 3654 visited the study clinic between January 1992 and January 1994.\n\n【15】Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Western Sydney Area Health Service, and written informed consent was obtained from all the study subjects.\n\n【16】Eye Examinations and Grading of Cataracts\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【17】The lens of each eye was photographed after dilation of the pupil with 1 percent tropicamide and 10 percent phenylephrine. The protocol for lens photography and grading closely followed the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System and is described in detail elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12-14 </a></sup></u> To assess the severity of nuclear cataracts, slit-lamp photographs were taken (SL-7E, Topcon Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Retroillumination photographs of the anterior and posterior lens were taken to assess the presence and severity of cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts (Cataract CT-R camera, Neitz Instruments, Tokyo).\n\n【18】The severity of nuclear cataracts was assessed on a five-point scale by comparing the photographs of the subjects' eyes with a set of four standard photographs. A grade 1 cataract was defined as less dense than, or as dense as, the cataract on the first standard photograph. A grade 2 cataract was more dense than the cataract on the first photograph, but no more dense than the cataract on the second photograph. Cataracts of grades 3, 4, and 5 were similarly defined.\n\n【19】Cortical cataracts were identified and their severity graded by placing a circular grid over the Neitz photographs that was divided into eight wedges of equal size and a central circle. The graders estimated the proportion of each of these nine areas that was involved by cataract. The percentages were summed to give an estimate of the total area of the lens that was affected by the cataract.\n\n【20】Posterior subcapsular cataracts were graded similarly. Photographs in which either the vertical or the horizontal diameter of the pupils was less than 4 mm were excluded from the analyses of cortical cataracts. The standard photographs of nuclear cataracts and the grid were provided by Dr. Barbara Klein of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. All the photographs were assessed by one of two graders who were unaware of any data on the patients. The quadratic weighted kappas for the reproducibility of measurements between graders were 0.79 for nuclear cataracts (measured in 260 eyes), 0.78 for cortical cataracts (in 379 eyes), and 0.57 for posterior subcapsular cataracts (in 383 eyes). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Data on the presence or absence of cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts were missing for about 3 percent of subjects, either because the photographs could not be graded or none were taken. Mainly because of camera malfunction (a short circuit in the camera wiring that caused the photographs to be underexposed), 1045 subjects (29 percent) did not have photographs suitable for nuclear-cataract grading. These subjects were similar to the subjects with photographs that could be graded. The mean ages of the two groups were similar (66.1 years for the subjects without photographs as compared with 65.7 years for the subjects with photographs), as were the proportions with cortical cataracts (25 percent vs. 23 percent), posterior subcapsular cataracts (6 percent vs. 7 percent), a history of using inhaled corticosteroids (12 percent vs. 10 percent), and a history of using systemic corticosteroids (10 percent vs. 8 percent).\n\n【22】Questionnaire Data\n------------------\n\n【23】A questionnaire on a wide range of possible risk factors for cataracts was administered by an interviewer. The subjects also brought all their current medications to the study center, where the names of the medications were recorded. They were asked how long they had used each one and whether they had ever taken any other medications for more than three months. A series of questions was specifically concerned with corticosteroid use, including these: “Have you ever used a beclomethasone inhaler, a brown-colored inhaler used to treat asthma and other chest conditions?” and “Have you ever taken corticosteroid tablets, such as prednisone, cortisone, or dexamethasone, for asthma, arthritis, or another condition?” Further questions concerned the usual number of puffs of beclomethasone per day or week and the total duration of use of systemic corticosteroids. Data on the duration of use were missing for 40 of 164 current users of inhaled corticosteroids. Among those who had used beclomethasone at any time, data on the number of puffs per week were missing for 97 of 339 subjects; data on the duration of use of systemic corticosteroids were missing for 51 of 303 subjects.\n\n【24】The questionnaire data were used to classify the subjects as having ever (either currently or in the past) or never used inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, budesonide, or both). The subjects who had used beclomethasone were further classified according to the usual number of puffs per week (14 or less, 15 to 28, or more than 28). For current users, the data on the number of years of beclomethasone use and the usual number of puffs per week were combined to give an estimated lifetime dose (less than 1000 mg, 1000 to 1999 mg, or 2000 mg or more). (We assumed that each puff contained 100 μg of beclomethasone.) Unfortunately, the duration of use was unknown in the case of past users. Current and past users of systemic corticosteroids were classified according to the total number of years those drugs had been used (less than 1, 1 to 4.9, or 5 or more).\n\n【25】The questionnaire also asked about known risk factors for cataracts, including the subject's history of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Subjects were asked if a doctor had ever told them that they had diabetes or high blood pressure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured. Hypertension was defined as a history of high blood pressure reported by the subject, a diastolic blood pressure over 95 mm Hg, a systolic blood pressure over 160 mm Hg, or a combination of these. Our measure of socioeconomic status was the attainment of a further degree or certificate after high school. We assessed sun-related skin damage by examining the arms, hands, and face and rated it on a four-level scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe).\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】All the analyses involved only data on the subject's more severely affected eye. Initially, age- and sex-adjusted relative-prevalence ratios were calculated in stratified analyses 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> with the data on each type of cataract dichotomized (for nuclear cataracts, below grade 4 vs. grade 4 or higher; for cortical cataracts, less than 5 percent involvement of the lens vs. 5 percent or more; and for posterior subcapsular cataracts, no lens involvement vs. any involvement). Further analysis was performed by ordinal regression, with the cumulative odds model, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> which gives odds ratios for the probability of having a cataract of a particular severity (or worse) as compared with the probability of having a less severe cataract or none. Nuclear cataracts were modeled as a four-level variable (with grades 4 and 5 combined), and posterior subcapsular cataracts were included as a variable with three levels (no lens involvement, less than 5 percent involvement, or 5 percent involvement or greater). Relative-prevalence ratios cannot be calculated from ordinal regression models. Because nuclear cataracts are common, the reported odds ratios are larger than the relative-prevalence ratios.\n\n【28】In ordinal regression models, we tested for trends among categorized ordered variables by selecting the median value in each category and then modeling exposure as a single continuous variable. Mantel's extension of the Mantel–Haenszel test was used to test for trend in stratified analyses. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【29】All the analyses were done with SAS statistical software (SAS, Cary, N.C.). P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All P values were based on two-sided tests.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】There were 3654 subjects in the Blue Mountains Eye Study; the rate of participation was 82 percent. The subjects ranged in age from 49 to 97 years (median, 65). One hundred eight subjects were aphakic, had intraocular lenses in both eyes, or both. Among those for whom at least one lens photograph could be evaluated for the specific type of cataract, 217 (6 percent of 3444 subjects) had posterior subcapsular cataracts in some degree, 817 (24 percent of 3435) had more than 5 percent of a lens involved by a cortical cataract, and 467 (19 percent of 2501) had grade 4 or 5 nuclear cataracts.\n\n【32】Data on corticosteroid use were available for 3313 subjects. Of these, 111 had used both systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, 241 had only used inhaled corticosteroids, and 177 had only used systemic corticosteroids. (For 33 subjects there were data on the use of oral corticosteroids \\[15 subjects\\] or inhaled corticosteroids \\[18 subjects\\], but not both.) Of the 164 current users of inhaled corticosteroids, 103 used beclomethasone and 66 used budesonide (5 subjects used both). Because budesonide became available in Australia only in late 1991, beclomethasone was the only inhaled corticosteroid that the subjects could have used for more than a year or two.\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of 3313 Study Subjects According to Their History of Corticosteroid Use.\n\n【34】Table 1 shows the distribution of the risk factors for cataracts according to the subjects' history of corticosteroid use. There were no important differences between users and nonusers of corticosteroids or between users of inhaled corticosteroids and users of systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【35】Table 2.  Table 2. Adjusted Relative-Prevalence Ratios and 95 Percent Confidence Intervals for the Associations between the Use of Corticosteroids, Inhaled or Systemic, and the Presence of Cataracts.\n\n【36】Table 2 shows age- and sex-adjusted relative-prevalence ratios for the associations between the use of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids and the presence of cataracts. The use of inhaled corticosteroids at any time was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of nuclear cataracts (relative prevalence, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.9) and posterior subcapsular cataracts (relative prevalence, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.8). An increased prevalence of posterior subcapsular cataracts was associated with current use of inhaled corticosteroids (relative prevalence, 2.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 4.0) but not with past use. Higher cumulative lifetime doses of beclomethasone were associated with higher risks of posterior subcapsular cataracts. The highest prevalence (27 percent) of posterior subcapsular cataracts was among subjects whose lifetime dose of beclomethasone was over 2000 mg (relative prevalence, 5.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 13.0). This group also had a high prevalence (40 percent) of grade 4 or 5 nuclear cataracts (relative prevalence, 4.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 9.3). Current use of inhaled corticosteroids was associated with an increased prevalence of cortical cataracts (relative prevalence, 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.7).\n\n【37】The use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with an increased prevalence of posterior subcapsular cataracts; there was a dose–response relation between the duration of use and the prevalence of such cataracts. The only significant association between the use of systemic corticosteroids and the presence of nuclear or cortical cataracts was a relative prevalence of 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.4) for cortical cataracts among subjects who had used systemic corticosteroids for more than five years.\n\n【38】Ordinal regression (with posterior subcapsular cataracts graded in three levels and nuclear cataracts graded in four levels) was used to assess the associations of cataracts with inhaled corticosteroids, with adjustment for potential confounding according to age, sex, smoking history, diabetes, hypertension, sun-related skin damage, and use of systemic corticosteroids. Further control for confounding by the use of systemic corticosteroids was achieved by excluding subjects who had ever used systemic corticosteroids from the analyses.\n\n【39】Table 3.  Table 3. Adjusted Odds Ratios and 95 Percent Confidence Intervals Derived from Ordinal Regression Models for the Association between the Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids and the Presence of Posterior Subcapsular Cataracts.\n\n【40】Adjustment for multiple confounders in models that included users of systemic corticosteroids had little effect on the strength of the association between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and the presence of posterior subcapsular cataracts 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. However, in the model restricted to subjects who had never used systemic corticosteroids, the dose–response relation between the lifetime dose of beclomethasone and the presence of a posterior subcapsular cataract was less evident (P = 0.06).\n\n【41】Table 4.  Table 4. Adjusted Odds Ratios and 95 Percent Confidence Intervals Derived from Ordinal Regression Models for the Association between the Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids and the Presence of Nuclear Cataracts.\n\n【42】Adjusted data on the association between inhaled corticosteroids and nuclear cataracts are shown in Table 4 . High doses of beclomethasone were associated with nuclear cataracts in both the models that included systemic-corticosteroid users and those that did not.\n\n【43】Because people may alter their use of medications once a cataract has been diagnosed, we repeated all the analyses in the 3028 subjects who said that they had never been told they had a cataract. The results for these subjects were essentially the same as those for all study subjects (data not shown).\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】Our community-based study of older Australians suggests that the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and nuclear cataracts. This is consistent with the relation between the use of systemic corticosteroids and the presence of posterior subcapsular cataracts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> It has been increasingly recognized that inhaled corticosteroids have systemic effects. They can suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and they may cause osteoporosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,18,19 </a></sup></u> Our finding that the use of inhaled corticosteroids is more strongly associated with posterior subcapsular cataracts than with other types of cataracts is not surprising, because this region of the lens is particularly sensitive to metabolic insult, including those caused by diabetes and oral corticosteroids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,20 </a></sup></u> The biologic mechanisms by which corticosteroids cause posterior subcapsular cataracts remain uncertain but are likely to include the inhibition of sodium–potassium pumps in the lens epithelium, leading to the accumulation of water in lens fibers and the agglutination of lens proteins. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> A previous study of inhaled corticosteroids and cataracts in older adults involved 48 people (mean age, 61 years) attending a specialist asthma clinic. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> All but one had used oral corticosteroids at some time. Slit-lamp examination revealed that 14 subjects had posterior subcapsular cataracts. That study found no association between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and the presence of the cataracts.\n\n【46】Because cataracts in children are very rare, even quite large increases in risk may be missed in studies of young people. Simons and colleagues performed slit-lamp examinations of the lenses of 96 young patients with asthma who had used inhaled corticosteroids for an average of five years, and none had any evidence of cataract. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Tinkelman et al. found no cataracts in 108 children treated with inhaled beclomethasone for one year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Abuekteish et al. examined 140 young people with asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids and found a 13-year-old girl who had bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts: she had received numerous courses of oral corticosteroids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Nassif et al. identified one posterior subcapsular cataract among 32 children treated with inhaled corticosteroids for an average of 1.3 years; all the subjects had used oral corticosteroids in the past. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【47】The strengths of our study include the high participation rate, the careful grading of the lens photographs to identify the presence and severity of cataracts, the large sample, and the control for confounding variables. Because the study was community-based, we were able to compare the prevalence of cataracts between users and nonusers of inhaled corticosteroids, and we could also examine the associations in a large subgroup of subjects who had never used systemic corticosteroids.\n\n【48】Our study had several limitations. The amount of information we collected on corticosteroid use was more limited than that in previous clinic-based studies. For example, perhaps the best measure of exposure to inhaled corticosteroids, the cumulative lifetime dose of beclomethasone, could only be estimated in current users. Another limitation is the large amount of missing data regarding both exposure-related variables and confounders. For example, the multivariate-adjusted model for the association between the lifetime dose of beclomethasone and the presence of posterior subcapsular cataracts included only 78 percent of the study subjects. Finally, our study was cross-sectional; the temporal relation between the use of inhaled corticosteroids and the presence of cataracts is difficult to assess.\n\n【49】Our study was conducted in 1992 and 1993. Inhaled budesonide was approved for use in Australia in late 1991. Hence, beclomethasone was the only inhaled corticosteroid used for any extended period. We have no reason to suspect, however, that the effect of budesonide would differ from that of beclomethasone.\n\n【50】Several criteria are commonly used to assess whether a statistically significant association in an epidemiologic study represents a true causal relation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> The association we found between inhaled corticosteroids and posterior subcapsular cataracts fulfills several of these criteria. The association was strong, with posterior subcapsular cataracts three times more prevalent in users of inhaled corticosteroids than in nonusers. There was a strong dose–response relation. The relation is biologically plausible. Two other criteria were not adequately fulfilled: consistency and temporality. Our findings need to be replicated in different groups, and prospective studies should examine whether the use of inhaled corticosteroids precedes the onset of cataract.\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Australian Department of Health, Housing, and Community Services and by the Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney.</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Michael Neider and Paula Cisternas for their valuable assistance.</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>From the Departments of Public Health and Community Medicine (R.G.C., S.R.L.) and Ophthalmology (P.M.), University of Sydney, and Westmead Hospital (P.M.) — both in Sydney, Australia.</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Cumming at the Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Bldg.

Preventing exacerbations remains an important goal of therapy. There is evidence that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway is associated with the risk of exacerbations.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 61 subjects who had refractory eosinophilic asthma and a history of recurrent severe exacerbations. Subjects received infusions of either mepolizumab, an anti–interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (29 subjects), or placebo (32) at monthly intervals for 1 year. The primary outcome measure was the number of severe exacerbations per subject during the 50-week treatment phase. Secondary outcomes included a change in asthma symptoms, scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ, in which scores range from 1 to 7, with lower values indicating more severe impairment and a change of 0.5 unit considered to be clinically important), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) after use of a bronchodilator, airway hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophil counts in the blood and sputum.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Mepolizumab was associated with significantly fewer severe exacerbations than placebo over the course of 50 weeks (2.0 vs. 3.4 mean exacerbations per subject; relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.02) and with a significant improvement in the score on the AQLQ (mean increase from baseline, 0.55 vs. 0.19; mean difference between groups, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.62; P=0.02). Mepolizumab significantly lowered eosinophil counts in the blood (P<0.001) and sputum (P=0.002). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to symptoms, FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use, or airway hyperresponsiveness. The only serious adverse events reported were hospitalizations for acute severe asthma.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Mepolizumab therapy reduces exacerbations and improves AQLQ scores in patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma. The results of our study suggest that eosinophils have a role as important effector cells in the pathogenesis of severe exacerbations of asthma in this patient population.

Persons with asthma present with variable symptoms of cough, breathlessness, and wheezing; these episodes may be punctuated by periods of more severe and sustained deterioration in control of symptoms — termed exacerbations — that necessitate emergency treatment. Exacerbations are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and with considerable health care costs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Exacerbations differ from day-to-day symptoms in that they respond poorly to usual inhaled therapy and are more closely linked to increased airway inflammation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The link to eosinophilic airway inflammation may be particularly important, since infiltration of the airway mucosa with activated eosinophils is seen in postmortem examinations of patients who have died of acute severe asthma, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and markers of eosinophilic airway inflammation increase well before the onset of exacerbations that are induced by the withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Moreover, management strategies that control eosinophilic airway inflammation as well as the clinical manifestations of asthma are associated with a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】A study of asthma therapy involving mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, offers the prospect of clarifying the role of eosinophils in exacerbations, since mepolizumab is a selective and effective inhibitor of eosinophilic inflammation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-11 </a></sup></u> Results of clinical trials of this agent among persons with asthma have been disappointing, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,11 </a></sup></u> although these studies have focused on outcome measures that are not closely associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation and have included populations that were selected on the basis of clinical and physiological characteristics rather than the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】We tested the hypothesis that eosinophils are important in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations by studying the effect of treatment with mepolizumab for 12 months on the frequency of exacerbations among subjects who had refractory asthma and evidence of eosinophilic airway inflammation despite treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. Secondary aims included assessments of the effects of treatment on airway inflammation, asthma symptoms, asthma-related quality of life, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ), and, since chronic eosinophilic airway inflammation may be associated with airway remodeling, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> airway structure as assessed with the use of computed tomography (CT).\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Subjects\n--------\n\n【17】All subjects were older than 18 years of age and had a clinical diagnosis of asthma that was supported by one or more of the following criteria: variability in the maximum diurnal peak expiratory flow of more than 20% over the course of 14 days, an increase in FEV <sub>1 </sub> of more than 15% after inhalation of 200 μg of albuterol, and a 20% reduction in FEV <sub>1 </sub> in response to a provocative concentration of inhaled methacholine (PC <sub>20 </sub> ) of less than 8 mg per milliliter. Subjects were recruited among patients attending a refractory-asthma clinic that provided secondary asthma care for a mixed urban and rural population of 1 million people and tertiary care for 4 million people. Patients who attend this clinic undergo a standardized assessment, which includes a noninvasive assessment of airway inflammation every 2 to 4 months by means of an analysis of induced-sputum specimens. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of refractory asthma according to American Thoracic Society criteria, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> a sputum eosinophil percentage of more than 3% on at least one occasion in the previous 2 years despite high-dose corticosteroid treatment, and at least two exacerbations requiring rescue prednisolone treatment in the previous 12 months. Additional criteria for inclusion were stable treatment requirements and an absence of exacerbations for more than 6 weeks before enrollment in the study. Exclusion criteria were current smoking, serologic evidence of a parasitic infection, a serious coexisting illness, the possibility of conception, and poor adherence to treatment.\n\n【18】All subjects provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the local research ethics committee and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.\n\n【19】Design of the Study\n-------------------\n\n【20】The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial conducted from April 2006 through August 2008. The funding organization (GlaxoSmithKline) supplied the study drug and placebo but had no role in the accrual or analysis of the data. Representatives of the funding organization contributed to the study design and to the preparation of the manuscript. The academic authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication and vouch for the accuracy and integrity of the contents.\n\n【21】The study measurements are described in the Supplementary Appendix 删除7:<u>(available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>, and the protocol is summarized in Figure 1 in the Supplementary Appendix . At a baseline visit, information on demographic characteristics was collected from all subjects, and spirometry was performed before and after use of a bronchodilator. Regular treatment was kept constant from this time until completion of the study. After a 2-week run-in period, baseline PC <sub>20 </sub> was measured; a day later, the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE <sub>NO </sub> ) was measured, symptoms were assessed, and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was administered. Symptoms were assessed with the use of three 100-mm visual-analogue scales — one assessing cough, one assessing breathlessness, and one assessing wheezing — each of which had “no symptoms” at one end and “the worst symptoms ever” at the other end, and with the use of the modified Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (JACQ), which assesses daytime and nighttime symptoms and activity limitation on the basis of five questions that are scored on a scale of 0 to 6, with lower numbers representing better control of symptoms. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Quality of life was assessed with the use of the AQLQ, a questionnaire comprising 32 items, each of which is scored on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating better asthma-related quality of life. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The items are grouped into four domains, and the reported score is the mean of responses across the four domains. The minimal clinically important change in the JACQ and AQLQ scores is 0.5. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】To assess both the responsiveness of symptoms, FE <sub>NO </sub> , and FEV <sub>1 </sub> to treatment with oral corticosteroids and the way in which the responsiveness was influenced by mepolizumab therapy, subjects were treated with oral prednisolone for 2 weeks at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, with a maximum dose of 40 mg per day, at the beginning and end of the study. For the subgroup of participants who consented to have a bronchoscopic examination, the procedure was performed before treatment with prednisolone. At visit 3, after completing the 2-week course of prednisolone and before receiving the first study treatment, subjects underwent a further assessment of symptom scores, measurement of FE <sub>NO </sub> , and spirometry before and after bronchodilator use, as well as CT scanning in the subgroup of patients who provided consent for this assessment.\n\n【23】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of Subjects in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【24】Subjects were randomly assigned with the use of the minimization method 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> to receive 12 infusions of either 750 mg of mepolizumab delivered intravenously or matched placebo (150 ml of 0.9% saline) at monthly intervals between visits 3 and 14. The criteria used for minimization were the frequency of exacerbations in the previous 12 months, the baseline eosinophil count in the sputum, and the number of subjects taking oral corticosteroids. FE <sub>NO </sub> , spirometry before and after use of a bronchodilator, and symptom scores were recorded at each visit; the AQLQ was administered at visits 5, 8, 11, and 14; and PC <sub>20 </sub> was measured the day before visits 8 and 14. The treatment phase ended 2 weeks after visit 14 — that is, 50 weeks after treatment was started. At this time, bronchoscopy was performed in subjects who consented to the procedure, and all subjects were given an additional 2-week course of oral prednisolone. After the course of oral prednisolone was completed, FE <sub>NO </sub> and symptom scores were assessed, and spirometry and, in the subgroup of patients who provided consent, CT scanning were performed.\n\n【25】Exacerbations during the treatment phase of the study were managed in accordance with standard clinical guidelines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Subjects who initiated treatment at home did so with guidance from their personalized management plan. In all cases, subjects were instructed to seek medical advice as soon as possible after starting therapy. Oral prednisolone therapy was prescribed at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram per day, with a maximum dose of 40 mg per day. Decisions about whether to use adjunctive therapy such as antibiotics and about the need for hospitalization were made by the study physician or the subject's general practitioner. For subjects who were assessed by the study team within 72 hours after an exacerbation, assessments included symptom scores, FE <sub>NO </sub> , peak expiratory flow, and spirometry performed before and after use of a bronchodilator. In addition, sputum samples were obtained for cell counts and microbial analysis.\n\n【26】Because of the expected anti-eosinophil effects of mepolizumab, results of FE <sub>NO </sub> measurements, sputum analyses, and leukocyte differential counts that were obtained during scheduled and unscheduled visits were not disclosed to investigators. Exacerbations requiring hospitalization were managed by the admitting clinical team, whose members were unaware of the treatment assignments and of the results of the measurements of inflammatory factors.\n\n【27】Safety Assessment\n-----------------\n\n【28】Safety was assessed on the basis of laboratory tests, physical examinations, measurement of vital signs both before and after infusion, and adverse-event reports. Serious adverse events were also reported to GlaxoSmithKline as part of their ongoing collection of data.\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The primary outcome measure of the study was the number of severe exacerbations of asthma per subject; exacerbations were defined as periods of deterioration in asthma control in subjects who had been treated with high-dose oral prednisolone for at least 5 days. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Exacerbations that occurred in the 50 weeks between the completion of the first treatment visit and 2 weeks after the final treatment visit were included in the analysis. A recurrence of asthma symptoms shortly after completion of a course of prednisolone was recorded as a separate exacerbation if baseline control of symptoms had been restored for a period of at least 5 days. Secondary outcome measures were changes in eosinophil values in blood and sputum samples, FE <sub>NO </sub> , FEV <sub>1 </sub> (percent of the predicted value) after bronchodilator use, PC <sub>20 </sub> , AQLQ score, symptom scores, CT assessment of airway-wall geometry, and bronchoscopic assessment of eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n\n【31】All subjects who completed at least one treatment visit were included in an intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome. In the case of subjects who withdrew from the study, the adjusted number of exacerbations was calculated with the use of the following equation: recorded number of exacerbations + \\[(visits remaining ÷ total visits) × mean exacerbation frequency in the study group\\]. Exacerbation frequency was calculated and compared between the study groups with the use of a negative binomial model and verified with the Mann–Whitney U test, as previously described. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In a study of a similar cohort, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> the mean (±SD) number of exacerbations was 3.2±2.1 per subject per year. Assuming a mean of two exacerbations per subject per year, we needed to include 60 subjects in order to have 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in exacerbation frequency. Secondary-outcome values were log-transformed where appropriate. Between-group and within-group comparisons were made for the mean change between baseline values and the mean or geometric mean of the posttreatment values with the use of unpaired and paired t-tests, respectively, for parametric distributions and the Mann–Whitney U test for nonparametric distributions. Proportions were compared with the use of Fisher's exact test. Statistical software packages used for various analyses included SPSS, version 13 (SPSS), Stata, version 7 (Stata), and GraphPad Prism, version 4 (GraphPad Software).\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Enrollment and Baseline Characteristics\n---------------------------------------\n\n【34】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Numbers of Patients Who Were Screened, Enrolled, and Assigned to a Study Group and Who Completed the Study.\n\n【35】All subjects were recruited from a database of patients who were attending our refractory-asthma clinic. Of the 449 persons in the database, 52.3% had a history of sputum eosinophilia of more than 3% on at least one occasion in the previous 2 years, and 63.4% of these patients had been treated with two or more courses of oral corticosteroid therapy in the previous 12 months.\n\n【36】Figure 1 shows the numbers of subjects who were screened, enrolled, and randomly assigned to a study group and who completed the study. A total of 61 of the 63 subjects who were screened started treatment and constituted the modified intention-to-treat population. Thirty-two subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo. Overall, 94.9% of treatment visits were completed. Subjects who withdrew completed a mean of 4.6 treatment visits (38.3%). Subjects in the two groups were well matched with respect to baseline characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【37】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【38】### _Frequency of Severe Exacerbations_\n\n【39】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Severe Exacerbations during the Course of the Study.\n\n【40】Panel A shows the cumulative number of severe exacerbations that occurred in each study group over the course of 50 weeks. Panel B shows the distribution of the number of exacerbations among subjects in each study group during the treatment period of the study. The mean number of exacerbations per subject over the course of the 50-week treatment period was 2.0 in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 3.4 in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.02).\n\n【41】The median treatment period was 348 days in the mepolizumab group and 340 days in the placebo group (P=0.30). During this period, a total of 57 exacerbations occurred in the group of subjects who were assigned to receive mepolizumab and 109 in the group assigned to receive placebo 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. The mean number of severe exacerbations per subject was 2.0 in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 3.4 in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A and 2B )</u>. The difference in the number of exacerbations remained significant with nonparameteric analysis (P=0.04). Thirty-one percent of the subjects in the mepolizumab group had no exacerbations during the study period, as compared with 16% in the placebo group (P=0.23) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. The mean duration of prednisolone therapy per exacerbation was similar in the two groups (10.9 days in the mepolizumab group and 11.7 days in the placebo group, P=0.31). There were three hospital admissions for exacerbations of asthma in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 11 admissions in the placebo group (P=0.07). The total number of days in the hospital was significantly less for the subjects receiving mepolizumab treatment than for those receiving placebo (12 days vs. 48 days, P<0.001).\n\n【42】Treatment for an exacerbation was initiated by the subject in 20% of the cases, by the primary care physician or a physician at a hospital other than the study site in 25%, and by the study team in 55%. In the 77% of cases in which exacerbations were assessed within 72 hours after the initiation of prednisolone therapy, there were no significant differences between the groups in peak expiratory flow, FEV <sub>1 </sub> before and after bronchodilator use, symptom scores, or rescue bronchodilator use. Sputum samples were obtained from patients during 61% of the exacerbations. The geometric mean eosinophil percentage in the sputum during an exacerbation was significantly lower in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group (1.5% vs. 4.4%), with the values differing by a factor of 2.9 (95% CI, 1.4 to 6.1; P=0.005), but the mean total neutrophil count in the sputum did not differ significantly between the two groups (3846 cells per milligram of sputum in the mepolizumab group and 4122 cells per milligram in the placebo group, P=0.80). The eosinophil percentage in the sputum was higher than 3% in 59% of the episodes in the placebo group and in 36% of the episodes in the mepolizumab group (P=0.04).\n\n【43】### _Inflammatory Markers_\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Comparison of Secondary Outcomes between Study Groups.\n\n【45】Panel A shows geometric mean (log <sub>10 </sub> SE) eosinophil counts in blood and sputum specimens, the provocative concentration of methacholine required to cause a 20% fall in FEV <sub>1 </sub> (PC <sub>20 </sub> ), and mean scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The AQLQ comprises 32 items, each of which is scored on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating better asthma-related quality of life. The items are grouped into four domains, and the reported score is the mean of responses across the four domains. Longitudinal data on PC <sub>20 </sub> were available for 16 and 18 subjects in the mepolizumab and placebo groups, respectively. Panel B shows mean symptom scores, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) after bronchodilator use, and the geometric mean (log <sub>10 </sub> SE) fraction of exhaled nitric oxide at an expiratory flow of 50 ml per second (FE <sub>NO </sub> ) before, during, and after the treatment phase of the study. The score on the modified Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (JACQ) represents the mean of responses to five questions about daytime and nighttime symptoms and limitation of activities, with each response scored on a scale of 0 to 6; higher scores represent worse symptoms. The mean visual-analogue score represents the total scores divided by 3 for cough, wheezing, and breathlessness, each of which was assessed on a 100-mm scale, with “no symptoms” at one end and “the worst symptoms ever” at the other end. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms. These factors were evaluated before and after administration of 0.5 mg of prednisolone per kilogram per day, with a maximum dose of 40 mg per day, for 14 days, at the beginning and end of the treatment phase. The purple bars represent the 2-week course of prednisolone therapy. P values are for the mean difference between the groups for the change from baseline to the mean or geometric mean of the post-treatment values. Further details are given in Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Appendix . The term ppb denotes parts per billion.\n\n【46】Mepolizumab therapy was associated with significant between-group and within-group reductions in eosinophil counts in both blood and sputum 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. The geometric mean of eosinophil counts in the blood during the treatment phase, as compared with the baseline value, was reduced by a factor of 6.6 in the mepolizumab group and by a factor of 1.1 in the placebo group, with the changes from baseline differing between the groups by a factor of 6.1 (95% CI, 4.1 to 8.9; P<0.001). Sputum induction at 90% of visits resulted in cytospin preparations that could be assessed for eosinophil counts. The geometric mean eosinophil count in the sputum was reduced by a factor of 7.1 in the mepolizumab group and by a factor of 1.9 in the placebo group, with the changes from baseline differing between the groups by a factor of 3.7 (95% CI, 1.6 to 8.4; P=0.002). There were no significant between-group differences in the change in FE <sub>NO </sub> (P=0.29) or the total neutrophil count in the sputum (P=0.22) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B , and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Paired bronchial-biopsy specimens (specimens obtained before and after the study treatment) were available for 14 subjects (of whom 9 were in the mepolizumab group), paired bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens for 11 subjects (8 in the mepolizumab group), and paired bronchial-wash specimens for 10 subjects (7 in the mepolizumab group). Changes in eosinophil counts after infusions of mepolizumab, as compared with changes after placebo infusions, were reduced by a factor of 2.1 (95% CI, 0.6 to 68.1; P=0.68) in bronchial-biopsy specimens, by a factor of 8.2 (95% CI, 0.9 to 75.4; P=0.06) in bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens, and by a factor of 16.0 (95% CI, 1.8 to 140; P=0.02) in bronchial-wash specimens (see Table 1 and Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【48】### _Other Outcomes_\n\n【49】There were no significant differences between the groups in the change from baseline symptom scores, whether they were assessed with the use of visual-analogue scales or JACQ 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B , and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The mean improvement in the AQLQ score was 0.55 in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 0.19 in the placebo group (mean difference between the groups, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.63; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. There were no significant between-group differences in changes from baseline values for FEV <sub>1 </sub> after bronchodilator use or PC <sub>20 </sub> 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B , and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】There were no significant between-group differences in the changes in FEV <sub>1 </sub> or symptom scores after prednisolone treatment given at the end of the study period, as compared with prednisolone given at the beginning of the study period 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B , and Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Nine subjects who were assigned to the mepolizumab group had more than a 0.5-point decrease in JACQ scores after the 2-week course of prednisolone that was given before the initiation of mepolizumab therapy. These subjects had a similar within-group decrease in JACQ scores after the prednisolone treatment that was given at the end of the study (mean reduction, 1.2 points before mepolizumab therapy and 0.9 points afterward; mean difference, −0.3; 95% CI, −1.0 to 0.4; P=0.32).\n\n【51】CT scans were obtained before and after the treatment phase of the study in 26 patients in each group. The results of all CT assessments are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix . There was a significant between-group difference in the change from baseline for airway wall area (mean between-group difference, 1.1 mm 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> per square meter of body-surface area; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.1; P=0.02) and in the change in total area (mean between-group difference, 1.5 mm 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> per square meter; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8; P=0.03).\n\n【52】At the completion of the study, subjects were asked to guess their treatment assignment. Forty-five percent of the subjects were unsure of their treatment assignment, 36% guessed correctly, and 19% guessed incorrectly. There was no significant difference between the study groups in the proportions of patients choosing each response (P=0.42).\n\n【53】Safety\n------\n\n【54】Table 2.  Table 2. Reported Adverse Events during the 50-Week Treatment Phase of the Study.\n\n【55】Intravenous mepolizumab had an acceptable adverse-event and side-effect profile throughout the 12 months of treatment. The only serious adverse events reported were hospitalizations for acute severe asthma 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. No local effects of infusion were observed. One subject was withdrawn from the study because of a transient maculopapular rash that developed 24 hours after the first infusion of mepolizumab.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】We found that mepolizumab treatment significantly reduced the number of asthma exacerbations that resulted in the prescription of corticosteroid therapy and increased asthma-related quality of life in subjects who had refractory eosinophilic asthma and a history of recurrent exacerbations. There was no significant improvement in symptoms or in FEV <sub>1 </sub> , measures that are commonly used for quantifying asthma control. Treatment effectively lowered eosinophil counts in the blood and sputum and was well tolerated over the course of the 12-month study period.\n\n【58】Previous studies of mepolizumab treatment in patients with less severe asthma have been too short to evaluate the effect of treatment on the frequency of exacerbations, although the largest study to date, like ours, showed a reduction in severe exacerbations, which approached significance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The lack of effect of mepolizumab on symptoms, FEV <sub>1 </sub> , and airway responsiveness in our study is also consistent with the results of previous studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-11 </a></sup></u> Treatment had a larger effect on eosinophil numbers in blood and sputum samples than on those in biopsy specimens, findings that are consistent with earlier work, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> although sputum eosinophilia was present in 36% of the exacerbations, despite mepolizumab therapy. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in the biologic response to mepolizumab and the relative resistance of eosinophils in tissue to anti–interleukin-5.\n\n【59】We have previously shown that the main effect of a management strategy that suppresses eosinophilic airway inflammation is a reduction in the frequency of exacerbations and have suggested a causal link between eosinophilic airway inflammation and exacerbations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> This view is strongly supported by the results of the current study, since mepolizumab is a selective inhibitor of eosinophilic airway inflammation.\n\n【60】Mepolizumab treatment had no effect on asthma symptoms, FE <sub>NO </sub> , or lung function, although these measures did improve in some subjects after prednisolone treatment, even when the prednisolone was administered after mepolizumab treatment, when eosinophilic airway inflammation was suppressed. This finding suggests that symptoms, FE <sub>NO </sub> , and lung function can be disassociated from eosinophilic inflammation and are improved with corticosteroid treatment through another mechanism. Modulation of the interaction between airway smooth muscle and infiltrating mast cells 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> is a possible explanation for the effect of prednisolone on lung function and symptoms. The absence of an association between the risk of exacerbations and eosinophilic airway inflammation, on the one hand, and lung function and day-to-day clinical manifestations of asthma, on the other, has important implications for the way asthma is managed and assessed in patients with refractory asthma. Our study showed a small but significant improvement in asthma-related quality of life with mepolizumab therapy, perhaps reflecting the value to patients of the prevention of exacerbations.\n\n【61】We found that airway-wall thickness and total wall area, as measured by CT, were reduced in subjects who were treated with mepolizumab as compared with those who were given placebo. The CT scans were obtained after a 2-week course of prednisolone and after administration of bronchodilators, so the findings are unlikely to be confounded by bronchomotor tone and acute airway inflammation. Whether the changes in airway-wall dimensions translate into important long-term clinical effects requires further investigation.\n\n【62】The therapeutic effect that was seen with mepolizumab treatment shows how we can learn more about the pathogenesis of different airway responses by studying selective inhibitors of inflammation. The patients who were included in this study had refractory eosinophilic asthma despite maximum tolerated therapy, which in many cases included regular use of oral corticosteroids. Their asthma resembled the exacerbation-prone phenotype of severe asthma, as described by Moore et al., 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and the phenotype of asthma with predominant eosinophilic inflammation, which we have described. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Our results should not be extrapolated beyond the highly selected group of patients we recruited for this study. However, further clinical trials should be performed to establish more clearly the risks and benefits of mepolizumab treatment in a wider population of patients.

Among patients with fewer than 100 granulocytes per cubic millimeter throughout therapy, the response rates were 6 percent with ceftazidime and short-course amikacin and 50 percent with ceftazidime and long-course amikacin (P = 0.03).

Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which patients with severe, moderate-to-severe, or moderate acute TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4 to 12, on a scale from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness) were randomly assigned to intravenous progesterone or placebo, with the study treatment initiated within 4 hours after injury and administered for a total of 96 hours. Efficacy was defined as an increase of 10 percentage points in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome, as determined with the use of the stratified dichotomy of the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 6 months after injury. Secondary outcomes included mortality and the Disability Rating Scale score.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 882 of the planned sample of 1140 patients underwent randomization before the trial was stopped for futility with respect to the primary outcome. The study groups were similar with regard to baseline characteristics; the median age of the patients was 35 years, 73.7% were men, 15.2% were black, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 24.4 (on a scale from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating greater severity). The most frequent mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle accident. There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66). There were no significant differences in the other prespecified safety outcomes.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and others; PROTECT III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00822900 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】More than 2.4 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths are related to traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually, and approximately 5.3 million Americans are living with disability from TBI. The aggregate annual cost of TBI in the United States now approaches $76.5 billion. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Survivors of severe TBI typically require 5 to 10 years of intensive therapy and are often left with substantial disability. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Despite decades of research, no pharmacologic agent has been shown to improve outcomes after TBI.\n\n【12】Progesterone is a potent neurosteroid synthesized in the central nervous system. Preclinical studies in laboratory animals indicated that the early administration of progesterone after experimental TBI reduced cerebral edema, neuronal loss, and behavioral deficits. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Enthusiasm for progesterone as a treatment for TBI was further stimulated by two single-center clinical trials showing decreased mortality and improved functional outcomes with progesterone as compared with placebo. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> We performed a large, controlled, multicenter trial to determine the efficacy of early administration of progesterone for the treatment of severe, moderate-to-severe, or moderate TBI.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】The Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury, Experimental Clinical Treatment (PROTECT III) trial was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to determine the efficacy of early intravenous administration of progesterone versus placebo for treating patients with acute nonpenetrating TBI caused by a blunt mechanism. The trial was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and was conducted through the NINDS-funded Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network. The NETT network is organized into 22 academic medical centers that operate as clinical hubs, each of which has one or more study sites. The investigators were responsible for all the elements of the trial, including the design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. All the authors wrote the manuscript and vouch for the data and analysis. The trial was conducted under Investigational New Drug application 104,188 with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【16】The PROTECT III trial was conducted at 49 trauma centers in the United States. Rigorous training and certification of the investigators, coordinators, and outcomes assessors were performed initially and updated throughout the study. In addition to strict compliance with the study protocol, critical elements of TBI management were standardized across the study sites to minimize the effects of practice variability and secular trends. Adherence to both the study protocol and the TBI management guidelines of the trial were centrally monitored daily. Failures of adherence to the study protocol were identified as protocol deviations, and failures of adherence to standardized care guidelines were defined as clinical transgressions. Both required a prompt response and corrective action.\n\n【17】The trial met the exception from informed-consent requirements for emergency research under FDA code of regulations 21 CFR 50.24. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> As specified by the federal regulations, the institutional review board at each site reviewed and approved local community consultation and public disclosure activities. When a legally authorized representative was available, written informed consent was obtained before enrollment of the patient. For patients enrolled under the exemption from informed consent, patients or their legally authorized representatives were notified about enrollment by the study team as soon as possible and were asked to provide written informed consent to continue in the study. Safety oversight was provided by an NINDS-appointed data and safety monitoring board and two independent medical safety monitors.\n\n【18】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【19】Eligible patients were adults who had severe, moderate-to-severe, or moderate TBI due to a blunt mechanism, with a Glasgow Coma Scale 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> (GCS) score of 4 to 12 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness). Patients were enrolled if the study treatment could be initiated within 4 hours after injury.\n\n【20】Patients were excluded if, before enrollment, the treatment team determined clinically that the injury sustained was nonsurvivable; the patient had bilateral dilated, unresponsive pupils; cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed; or the patient had physiological findings of hypoxemia, hypotension, spinal cord injury, or status epilepticus. Additional exclusion criteria were pregnancy, status as a prisoner or ward of the state, severe intoxication (ethanol level, >249 mg per deciliter), and a known history of reproductive cancer, allergy to progesterone or a fat-emulsion vehicle, or a blood-clotting disorder. Patients with active myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep-vein thrombosis were also excluded. In addition, patients were excluded if they were wearing an opt-out bracelet or were listed in a registry of persons preemptively requesting not to participate in this trial.\n\n【21】Study Intervention\n------------------\n\n【22】Immediately after enrollment, patients were randomly assigned to receive an infusion containing either progesterone or placebo. Randomization was performed with the use of a combination of minimization and biased-coin algorithms to avoid imbalances in initial injury severity, sex, age, or enrollment site.\n\n【23】Study-drug kits containing four vials of progesterone in ethanol (active treatment) or ethanol alone (placebo) were prepared by the Emory Investigational Drug Service. Drug kits and their contents were identical in appearance, and study assignments remained concealed from all site pharmacists and study teams. Site pharmacists prepared the coded kit assigned by the randomization algorithm by mixing a weight-based dose (0.05 mg of progesterone per kilogram of body weight per milliliter of infusate) from the provided vials and a 250-ml bag of fat-emulsion vehicle (Intralipid 20%, Fresenius Kabi) every 24 hours. The study treatment was initiated within 4 hours after injury and consisted of a 1-hour loading dose, 71 hours of maintenance infusion, and a 24-hour infusion taper. The study drug was infused continuously through a dedicated intravenous catheter at a dose of 14.3 ml per hour for 1 hour and then at 10 ml per hour for 71 hours; the dose was then tapered by 2.5 ml per hour every 8 hours, for a total treatment duration of 96 hours.\n\n【24】Local study teams followed the patients closely. Data on serious adverse events were collected throughout the duration of the study (6 months), and data on all adverse events were collected during the first week. Data on clinical transgressions were collected and reported daily during hospitalization.\n\n【25】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome was functional recovery as determined with the use of the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> (GOS-E) at 6 months (±30 days) after randomization. A GOS-E score of 1 indicates death, 2 indicates a vegetative state, 3 or 4 indicates severe disability, 5 or 6 indicates moderate disability, and 7 or 8 indicates good recovery. Consistent scoring was ensured by means of rigorous training and quality assessment.\n\n【27】A favorable outcome was defined with the use of a stratified dichotomy of the GOS-E scores in which the definition of favorable depended on the severity of the initial injury. The index GCS score, the highest reliable GCS score documented before randomization, determined the initial injury severity. (If the patient was intubated, the index GCS motor score was used to assess severity; scores on the motor component of the GCS range from 1 to 6, with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness.) Patients with a less severe initial injury had to have a better recovery than those with a more severe injury in order to have a favorable outcome. Patients with a severe initial injury (an index GCS score of 4 to 5 or, if the patient was intubated, an index GCS motor score of 2 to 3) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 3 or higher. Patients with a moderate-to-severe initial injury (an index GCS score of 6 to 8 or, if the patient was intubated, an index GCS motor score of 4 to 5) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 5 or higher, and those with a moderate initial injury (an index GCS score of 9 to 12) were considered to have a favorable outcome if the 6-month GOS-E score was 7 or higher.\n\n【28】Secondary outcome measures included mortality, the Disability Rating Scale score, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> the rates of nine prespecified adverse events that were considered to be potentially associated with treatment, and the rates of all reported adverse events and serious adverse events. Data on cognitive, psychological, and neurologic outcomes were also collected but are not reported here.\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The primary objective was to determine whether progesterone was associated with an absolute increase of 10 percentage points, as compared with placebo, in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome. We estimated that a total sample of 1140 patients was required in order for the study to detect that effect with 85% power, assuming that 50% of the patients in the placebo group would have a favorable outcome and assuming a two-sided type I error probability of 0.05. This calculation included inflation for a 10% nonadherence rate (owing to withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or treatment crossover) and two equally spaced interim analyses for efficacy and futility with the use of O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundaries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【31】After randomization, patients were included in the primary analysis under the intention-to-treat principle. The primary efficacy hypothesis was tested with the use of a generalized linear model relating the probability of a favorable outcome to the study treatment, with adjustment for index GCS score strata, sex, and age. Standard multiple-imputation methods 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> were used to impute outcomes for patients without the primary outcome or with the primary outcome obtained outside the specified time window. A complete case sensitivity analysis was also performed. Prespecified covariates were evaluated for an interaction effect with the study treatment. Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, race, ethnic group, and index GCS score strata, regardless of interaction effect. Other subgroups were considered only if the interaction was statistically significant (alpha level of 0.20), was clinically significant, and involved a sufficiently large sample (>100 patients).\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Enrollment and Characteristics of the Patients\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【35】Of 17,681 persons screened, 882 patients underwent randomization between April 5, 2010, and October 30, 2013 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org)</u></u>. The study groups were well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline clinical characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Initial injury severity was similar in the two groups (as determined with the use of the index GCS score, the total Injury Severity Score, the head component score of the Abbreviated Injury Scale, and the Rotterdam classification on the basis of computed tomographic results 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> ). Most patients (53.5%) had moderate-to-severe injury (index GCS score, 6 to 8). The study treatment was initiated an average of 218.1 minutes after injury.\n\n【36】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【37】Table 2.  Table 2. Outcomes at 6 Months.\n\n【38】After the second interim analysis, the trial was stopped because of futility. For the primary hypothesis comparing progesterone with placebo, favorable outcomes occurred in 51.0% of patients assigned to progesterone and in 55.5% of those assigned to placebo 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>; the model estimated a relative benefit of 0.95 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35), with a relative benefit of less than 1.00 indicating fewer favorable outcomes in the progesterone group than in the placebo group. Additional adjustment for clinical hub yielded a similar result. The results of the complete case analysis were similar.\n\n【39】A secondary analysis of the GOS-E score with the use of a fixed dichotomy (in which a score ≥5 was considered to indicate a favorable outcome, regardless of the severity of the initial injury) was concordant (relative benefit, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.08). An additional secondary analysis of the target population, excluding 332 patients who had an eligibility deviation or did not receive a complete course of the study drug, was also concordant with the primary analysis (relative benefit, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.10).\n\n【40】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Distribution of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) Scores, Stratified According to Initial Injury Severity.\n\n【41】The GOS-E is an ordinal scale on which each increment represents a better quality of recovery. A GOS-E score of 1 indicates death, 2 a vegetative state, 3 or 4 severe disability, 5 or 6 moderate disability, and 7 or 8 good recovery. Each cell corresponds to a score on the GOS-E; the width of the cell indicates the proportion of patients with equivalent scores, and the number and percentage of patients are shown within the cell. The diagonal line between the two study groups indicates the favorable-outcome dichotomization in each severity stratum.\n\n【42】The distribution of the GOS-E score stratified according to initial injury severity, and the different criteria for a favorable outcome in each stratum, are shown in Figure 1 . Overall, approximately half the patients had favorable outcomes as determined according to the stratified dichotomy, with a lower proportion meeting the criteria in the moderate-injury group as compared with the severe-injury group (relative benefit, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64).\n\n【43】Safety Outcomes\n---------------\n\n【44】The 6-month mortality in the study population was 17.2%, ranging from 13.0% in the moderate-injury group to 27.6% in the severe-injury group. There was no significant difference in mortality between the progesterone group and the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.63). The cause of death was neurologic in 67.1% of the patients who died.\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Adverse Events Potentially Associated with the Study Drug.\n\n【46】Progesterone was associated with an acceptable safety profile. Eight prospectively defined adverse events that were deemed to be potentially associated with the study drug were similar in frequency in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. However, phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was significantly more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.96 to 4.66). Episodes of phlebitis were frequently categorized as not serious and were self-limited. The rates of other serious and nonserious adverse events were also similar in the two study groups 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Subgroup Analyses\n-----------------\n\n【48】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Adjusted Relative Benefit in Predefined Subgroups, as Assessed According to the Stratified Dichotomy of the GOS-E Score.\n\n【49】Models were adjusted for initial injury severity, sex, and age, as specified for the primary analysis. The significance of the interaction effect between study assignment and the corresponding subgroup is provided. Other prespecified subgroups that were considered according to the statistical analysis plan were based on the Rotterdam computed tomographic classification, score on the Injury Severity Scale, score on the Abbreviated Injury Scale head-injury component, time from injury to infusion, pupillary response, and medical histories (neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, metabolic, renal, reproductive, psychiatric, social, hematologic, oncologic, and related to the eyes, ears, nose, and throat). The statistical analysis plan limited the reporting of these additional subgroups to those with both clinical and statistical significance.\n\n【50】The results of the subgroup analyses are shown in the forest plot in Figure 2 . Interactions with the study treatment were suggested only for sex and for isolated head injury.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】Despite extensive preclinical data and two promising single-center trials, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6 </a></sup></u> progesterone was not associated with any benefit over placebo, as measured by the GOS-E score at 6 months, in this large, multicenter clinical trial. The groups were well balanced for injury severity, and both the intention-to-treat analysis and the a priori planned analysis of the target population were congruent in showing no treatment effect.\n\n【53】The PROTECT III trial joins a growing list of negative or inconclusive trials in the arduous search for a treatment for TBI. To date, more than 30 clinical trials have investigated various compounds for the treatment of acute TBI, yet no treatment has succeeded at the confirmatory trial stage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Many reasons for the disappointing record of translating promising agents from the laboratory to the clinic have been postulated, including limited preclinical development work, poor drug penetration into the brain, delayed initiation of treatment, heterogeneity of injuries, variability in routine patient care across sites, and insensitive outcome measures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In the design of the PROTECT III trial, we attempted to mitigate many of the barriers to translation identified in prior trials. Preclinical data supporting the treatment strategy were robust and met all of the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable recommendations for moving from preclinical to clinical studies, with the exception of testing in a nonhuman primate. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Progesterone has been shown to penetrate the brain rapidly in high concentrations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> The window for treatment in our study was limited to 4 hours after injury, with a 2-hour target (average injury-to-enrollment time, 2.9 hours; average injury-to-treatment time, 3.6 hours). The early administration of therapy is a difficult task for a trial involving patients with acute TBI, and one that required exception from informed consent. Treatment variability across sites was reduced with a standardized management protocol, multidisciplinary commitment at each site, meticulous monitoring of patients in real time, and immediate feedback to sites about clinical transgressions and noncompliance. To address the concern that the GOS was insufficiently sensitive, we used the higher-fidelity extended scale (GOS-E) as our primary outcome measure and designed a stratified dichotomy analysis rather than using a single threshold for all patients regardless of injury severity.\n\n【55】Despite these design strategies and extensive efforts, the trial did not confirm the efficacy of progesterone in patients with acute TBI. It is possible that the heterogeneity of the injury, confounding preexisting conditions, and characteristics of individual patients (e.g., resilience), which can be well controlled in animal models, play too large a role to overcome in human disease. Approaches are needed to reduce heterogeneity, but they come at the cost of more homogeneous pathological findings and decreased generalizability of the results. Success at translating from bench to bedside may require new paradigms, including innovative clinical-trial methods (e.g., adaptive designs and profiling of patients who have a response) in early-phase clinical trials to identify effective drug doses and timing (e.g., prehospital administration), the use of targeted outcomes based on the mechanism of injury, and rigorous preclinical multicenter trials in animals that better simulate subsequent human trials and make more accurate predictions regarding results.\n\n【56】TBI is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite promising preclinical data and supporting preliminary evidence, progesterone did not improve the outcome of patients with acute TBI in the PROTECT III trial.\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health or other supporting entities.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NS062778, 5U10NS059032, and U01NS056975) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (UL1TR000454) and by the Emory Emergency Neurosciences Laboratory in the Department of Emergency Medicine, Emory School of Medicine, and Grady Memorial Hospital.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Wright reports receiving royalties from a patent related to progesterone for the treatment of traumatic brain injury (U.S. patents 7,473,687, 7,915,244, and 8,455,468), which is licensed to BHR Pharma.

It has been caused attention why a number of new potential therapeutic targets on TBI always fail in clinical trials. We think this is due to the complexity and large heterogeneity of the patients with TBI. The treatment for TBI patients in acute phase is a complex process.

A public health order represents a minimum disease-prevention standard, adherence to which is not elective, but may not satisfy all legal requirements with respect to the personal safety of workers and others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The “general duty” clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act requires all employers to take reasonable steps to reduce risk to employees, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> and establishments have common-law obligations to ensure that their premises that are open to the public are maintained in a safe condition without concealed, reasonably avoidable hazards. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Responsible conduct of a business or facility in a pandemic represents opportunities for private entities to contribute to public health by implementing traditional and innovative disease-control measures, such as contact tracing with the use of mobile applications (“apps”) on personal devices.\n\n【3】The Massachusetts High Technology Council, as the leading technology and biomedical industry association in that state, recently assembled a group of medical, business, and legal experts (including the first author) to address these issues and assist state government in determining reopening standards. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> In this article, building on the work of that expert panel, we seek to identify the major public health challenges faced by private entities in resuming on-site operations and explore ways in which this might be done most effectively, consistent with applicable regulations. We focus primarily on the operation of commercial establishments, particularly in regard to workers and customers. Educational and other institutional and service settings face broader challenges, because of their custodial and quasi-custodial relationships with students and clients, who most often have no employment relationship to these entities but whose close institutional ties lead them to spend much continuous time within their facilities. We highlight instances in which student and client relationships pose challenges that are substantially different from those that attend commercial establishments. Health care facilities, owing to acute risk of transmission from ill persons, require more intensive infection-control practices already well explored and not recapitulated here.\n\n【4】“Low-Tech” Prevention Measures in Daily Operations\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Table 1.

Potential Policies to Reduce Transmission.\n\n【6】Throughout the country, many industries, services, and offices that are deemed to represent “essential operations” under relevant federal guidance 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> and state public health orders 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> have remained open, including hospitals and some clinics, in which the services provided require personal attendance and close contact. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Use of personal protective equipment and environmental and sanitation controls in these settings have limited the acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by these workers. Indeed, there are multiple low-tech solutions to prevent transmission, including deferral from attending work or public venues by those who feel unwell, frequent hand washing, use of masks of appropriate design and manufacture, and practices of avoiding as far as possible close physical contact with others 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. These measures are labor-intensive, requiring that individual workers and customers take protective actions in real time, and proper adherence requires active monitoring of workplace or public behavior. To ensure adherence, imposition of corrective actions may be warranted, such as employee discipline or exclusion of nonadherent persons from a physical facility. Furthermore, to encourage hourly workers to defer from attending work when ill, employers have found it necessary to offer or extend sick-leave benefits. Although not legally required, this represents ethical employer behavior to accommodate illness and thus prevent transmission.\n\n【7】Table 2.  Table 2. Daily Symptom Checklist.\n\n【8】In commercial and other public settings, operational considerations and concerns for transmission risk are broad and encompass areas traditionally not within management’s ken or responsibility. Resumption of day care and school operations is a crucial factor, because many employees are simply unable, given family circumstances, to return to work if education and day care for children and elderly or disabled family members remain closed. In revising public health orders, state and local governments therefore must coordinate reopening of industry with resumption of schools, day care, and day treatment. Transmission concerns include conditions of transportation (e.g., mass transit) to and from work, as well as social, religious, and leisure activities of workers outside of work hours, in which failure to maintain personal protective measures can put the person at risk for infection. Transmission risk from outside of the workplace or institution is then transferred into it when the person returns on subsequent days for work or study. To assess these risks, many essential-workplace employers that have continued operations throughout the pandemic have administered daily health questionnaires, with review of symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and inquiries about household and social contacts with a recent diagnosis of infection or presumed infection. Some employers and institutions have adopted pre-entry temperature screening with the use of equipment that scans foreheads or measures body temperatures with ease of use that prevents undue delays and entry bottlenecks. Positive responses on daily questionnaires, or an elevated body temperature indicated by electronic scanning, lead to detailed analysis of whether the employee, visitor, or student presents a risk to others meriting exclusion from entry and referral to testing and an at-home quarantine period. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> In residential settings, such as residential colleges or schools, quarantine may require that the institution itself provide facilities for this purpose, unless the person can be safely referred or transferred to a personal home setting.\n\n【9】Environmental, Engineering, and Administrative Controls\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Environmental and engineering controls can enhance infection control and safety. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> By changing the architecture of how we work, study, shop, and interact within facilities, such environmental measures do not depend on individual cooperation and thus require less monitoring. Placing partitions or other barriers between workers or between employees and customers, rigorously adhering to standards for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> and improving air exchange and air filtration in closed settings, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> and reducing personnel density through staggered work schedules can reduce transmission risk among workers, customers, and visitors, supplementing continued work-at-home practices by a portion of the workforce. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> The use of short-wavelength ultraviolet (ultraviolet C) light in facilities to sterilize surfaces and air also may offer some preventive effect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18,19 </a></sup></u> These mechanisms are more expensive than low-tech interventions that depend on individual adherence but reduce the need for monitoring and corrective action, with the architecture itself preventing deviations from infection-control practices.\n\n【11】Administrative measures under consideration by employers and institutions include excluding from the physical workplace — on a voluntary or mandatory basis — any person at elevated risk for symptomatic disease and severe clinical outcomes from Covid-19. The most common criteria for elevated risk are exceeding an age threshold or having certain coexisting conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Because contagiousness does not always correlate with the clinical severity of disease, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> exclusion of broad categories of workers and others may not have the desired effect of entirely reducing transmissions. Exclusion from the physical workplace or facility based on these categories is replete with clinical, ethical, and legal challenges, primarily because exclusions rest on statistical generalizations applied to individual persons. Under principles of antidiscrimination law as embodied in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> and similar state civil rights laws, discriminatory employment actions are prohibited when based on demographic characteristics or disability status. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> Decisions with regard to persons with disabilities must be based on individualized assessments. Exclusion is justifiable only if based on demonstrated “direct threat” (to self or others) that cannot be abated through work adjustments that in turn do not impose an undue hardship on the employer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> Similarly, exclusion of a person with an actual or perceived disability from a public facility, such as a school or university, is not allowed under federal civil rights laws and many state laws, unless the person presents a direct threat that cannot be abated by reasonable program or facility changes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Under the ADEA, advanced age by itself would never be a lawful reason to exclude a person from the workplace or to subject a person to differentiated work rules, despite aggregate statistics indicating that risk of severe symptoms of Covid-19 rises with age, especially over 60 years of age. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> Under these principles, for example, a 65-year-old triathlete with diabetes who lives alone and responsibly practices social distancing can convincingly argue that she not be excluded from the workplace when a 25-year-old coworker who flouts public health recommendations nevertheless is allowed to continue to work. Antidiscrimination laws and principles suggest that employers and institutions can encourage persons over a certain age limit or who have a clinically significant coexisting condition to remain working, participating, or studying from home but cannot mandate exclusion from the physical facility without a case-specific determination of direct threat to others. The corollary under disability rights laws is that employers have a duty to make a reasonable accommodation to allow self-deferring workers to perform their duties remotely or through job-duty alterations that reduce risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Arranging for continued remote work, or altered job duties, for self-deferring workers until community-wide risk abates — as long as this does not pose undue burden on the employer — therefore will be a necessary part of return-to-work strategy. If an employer is not reasonably able to offer accommodation such as work at home or job changes, then the employer’s legal obligation to the employee ends. In educational institutions, although most students will not fall into the category of persons of advanced age, some may have coexisting conditions that would put them at higher risk, and program enhancements or accommodations, such as extending remote learning opportunities, will be required.\n\n【13】Some employers and institutions have considered requiring that workers, customers, and others execute a waiver that informs them of risks of returning to physical workplaces if their personal health conditions or age place them at higher risk and that prospectively waives claims for on-site acquisition of illness. Although providing written information regarding workplace or facility risks may be useful to promote prudent personal choices about attendance, an employee cannot waive liability prospectively for worker’s compensation recovery, 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> and in some states, it is illegal for an employer to ask an employee to do so. 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> For nonemployees present in a facility, such as customers and students, such waiver forms may be offered and may have some limited legal effect, although waivers are typically not enforceable to shield a party from liability for a violation of a regulatory obligation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> In the context of Covid-19, therefore, if a facility operator has not taken appropriate preventive measures consistent with applicable public health authority orders and guidance, then a waiver by a customer, visitor, or student would be ineffective.\n\n【14】Workforce Segmentation and Work Travel Policies\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Because reduced density in facilities decreases transmission risk, employers have explored various methods of segmenting their workforces, both by timing of work presence and by encouraging continued remote work schedules. A strategy of staggering work shifts and allowing both very early and very late shifts reduces workplace density and allows employees and others to use mass transit at off-peak, less crowded hours, thus also reducing commuting risk. Some employers have separated their workforce into teams, with assigned workplace and work-from-home days for each team. Concurrently, employers can also stratify their workforces according to necessity of on-site work for each employee and the employee’s membership in categories of workers for whom transmission risk is enhanced. Thus, for example, an employer might choose first to bring back those for whom workplace presence is job-essential; second, to bring back in stages those for whom remote working remains feasible; and third, to ask those who are of advanced age or have coexisting conditions to delay their return to the physical workplace until community spread has been greatly reduced. These independent variables — timing of shifts, shift duration, degree of necessity of on-site work, feasibility of continued remote work, and degree of personal health risk — complicate planning for return to the workplace and require individualized, employee-by-employee analysis. Educational institutions and other services providers should consider undertaking a similar segmentation strategy, with individualized assessment of appropriate time and circumstance for return of students and others to physical presence.\n\n【16】Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers spent a majority of work time in travel for customer service and for business negotiations. Although those activities largely shifted to remote means in recent months, face-to-face business meetings may be deemed essential by some workers and employers. The risks of business travel can be mitigated by well-established infection-control strategies, such as avoiding crowding and the wearing of masks. 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> Employers should consider segmenting the workforce for any resumption of work travel, using such variables as necessity of in-person meetings, disease risk in destinations, personal health risks, and destination policies that require quarantine of arrivals for defined periods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>33,34</a></sup></u>\n\n【17】Testing\n-------\n\n【18】To limit risk in returning employees to the workplace and receiving customers and visitors, employers have begun to consider two other primary strategies, each of which has received considerable public and government attention: first, testing workers for infection with SARS-CoV-2, with the use of either molecular or antibody methods, and second, deploying electronic tracking of infection through apps downloaded onto employee mobile telephone devices. Each of these strategies holds promise for controlling workplace transmission but also has serious limitations.\n\n【19】Under guidelines issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), mandatory testing of employees for Covid-19 to identify and prevent direct threats to workplace safety is allowable under federal antidiscrimination laws, as long as the testing is reliable and accurate and the confidentiality of employees’ medical information is maintained. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> The EEOC has opined that antibody tests, owing to the uncertain meaning of results, do not meet the standards for return-to-work testing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> Testing for Covid-19 has intrinsic appeal for workplace safety and for safety in custodial or quasi-custodial institutions. Not only is it allowed by the EEOC as the cognizant federal employment authority in this area, but a comprehensive testing program appears to offer a high degree of certainty about what persons to allow back into the workplace.\n\n【20】However, practical issues surrounding testing for SARS-CoV-2 limit the applicability of this strategy. First, molecular testing (and more recently available antigen testing 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> ) yields a valid result only for the time at which the specimen for testing was obtained. 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> It is unclear with what frequency such testing should take place, which would necessarily vary depending on the incidence of Covid-19 in a community, with testing needed to be conducted more frequently in a high-incidence setting. As an example, long-term care facilities in New York State currently require workers to undergo twice-weekly tests. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> Second, if testing is offered or arranged by an employer, results that are processed by laboratories typically can be returned directly to the employer only with an authorization or consent executed by the tested worker — execution of which may be required by the employer — under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act regulations, 删除3:<u><sup><a>38 </a></sup></u> as well as the Privacy Rule requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 删除3:<u><sup><a>39 </a></sup></u> and various state medical-privacy laws. Without such an authorization, the employer must rely on an employee’s own report of a positive test result for infection. Third, increasing evidence suggests that not all positive molecular tests require exclusion of a person from the physical workplace, provided the onset of symptoms was sufficiently remote. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines include a provision allowing a person who has had a positive infection test but who has been completely asymptomatic for at least 10 days to end isolation even without a subsequent negative test result. 删除3:<u><sup><a>40 </a></sup></u> This provision is based on emerging data showing that positive test results may reflect shedding not of replication-competent virus but instead viral fragments that may pose no risk of infection to others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>41</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Fourth, even if molecular testing is required for return to work, it is a personal medical procedure — one that is potentially quite uncomfortable — for which consent is needed, and consent should include disclosure of the nature of the testing and the consequences of testing either negative or positive. Fifth, testing is dependent on both the quality of the specimen obtained and the reliability of the laboratory performing the test, and antibody tests are of uncertain significance for personal immunity. Most recently, the CDC has actively discouraged the use of antibody testing for making return-to-work determinations about individual employees. 删除3:<u><sup><a>42 </a></sup></u> When widely available, antigen tests probably will have greater specificity but may have reduced sensitivity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> Given the rapid development and refinement of all three categories of testing, it is not possible at present to make a durable recommendation about the use of testing for workplace and institutional safety. Testing will be most useful if accurate and periodic and if administered in higher-prevalence populations. Judgments about testing programs should be revisited as testing improves and as the trajectory of illness in the relevant community becomes clearer.\n\n【22】Contact Tracing and the Use of Mobile Apps\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The identification and assessment of the contacts of an index patient with a diagnosed case — often referred to as “contact tracing” — is traditional public health practice. It has proven useful in efforts to prevent Covid-19 transmission in various locations, including Israel, 删除3:<u><sup><a>43 </a></sup></u> Singapore, China, and South Korea, 删除3:<u><sup><a>44 </a></sup></u> but when the pandemic appeared in the United States, the limited availability of testing meant that Covid-19 spread widely before contact tracing could be effectively implemented. 删除3:<u><sup><a>45 </a></sup></u> This was unfortunate in light of our current understanding that many cases arise from “super spreader” events, in which one person may spread the infection to multiple others at a single encounter.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>46,47 </a></sup></u> Contact tracing — if done rapidly at the onset of symptoms — might allow the isolation of contacts before they in turn could transmit infection during their own presymptomatic state. Even if testing had been widely available at the outset of the U.S. pandemic, many public health departments had insufficient capacity for contact tracing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>48,49</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】Employers with diagnosed cases among their workers often have not been able to obtain contact-tracing assistance from local and state public health departments, owing to personnel shortages; this is regrettable because employer jurisdiction to trace contacts, unlike that of a local public health authority, extends only to workplace contacts, not the contacts made during private, off-duty worker activities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>50 </a></sup></u> Some employers have chosen to perform tracing of workplace contacts using their own resources, such as employee health services or contracted physicians. Workers who were identified as having had close, sustained contact with a person who had received a diagnosis of Covid-19 were, consistent with public health guidelines, asked to remain at home for a defined period to ensure that they remained symptom-free and then were able to return to work. Owing to restricted availability of testing, many identified contacts were unable to receive testing that could have identified transmission from the index patient. With increases in testing capacity, contact tracing with the use of testing can be more widely deployed; indeed, the use of testing as an adjunct to contact assessment can become the most useful deployment of testing in the workplace, as well as in other environments in which the facility operator has a robust relationship to the index patient and to the patient’s probable contacts, as, for example, in a university or human services setting.\n\n【25】Methods of performing automated contact tracing with the use of mobile apps have emerged, with such entities as PricewaterhouseCoopers, 删除3:<u><sup><a>51 </a></sup></u> Apple, and Google, 删除3:<u><sup><a>52 </a></sup></u> among others, offering such electronic approaches. Some apps for this purpose — such as one deployed as a statewide strategy in Utah — have been designed for specific geographic areas. 删除3:<u><sup><a>53 </a></sup></u> These solutions use geolocation or associational information relayed by personal devices to identify, through electronic algorithms, recent close contacts of persons who have received a diagnosis of Covid-19. Such contacts can be notified, either through their personal devices or through direct personal contact, and advised to seek testing or self-quarantine. Like testing, electronic contact tracing in the workplace has attracted employer interest and has attracted institutional interest in using this technology in residential and human services settings.\n\n【26】Like testing, however, the strategy of using electronic mobile apps has limitations. The algorithms depend on an index patient voluntarily reporting a diagnosis through the app. These apps cannot identify use of infection-control measures, such as room partitions and wearing of masks, and therefore could produce results that overestimate risk based solely on proximity. Even if required, adoption of the app by workers and visitors may not be uniform, which would have the opposite effect of failing to identify at-risk persons. Practical issues in certain jobs could make employees choose not to carry their devices during the workday: in manufacturing settings, workers often place street clothes and telephones in lockers before proceeding to the factory floor. In addition, contact tracing with the use of an app has the same ultimate limitations as traditional contact tracing: it depends on the cooperation of the identified contact to act on information regarding risk, which an app itself cannot guarantee. Even though employers (and custodial institutions) are able under federal and state law to defend, as a strategy of preventing direct health threats, mandatory downloading of apps by employees and others (in some cases subject to applicable collective-bargaining agreements or other contracts), employers and institutions will need to consider limitations of the technology, particularly before taking any adverse or exclusionary action against someone on the basis of information produced by an app. Mandating the downloading and activation of the app for return to work or school would require employers and institutions to make smart phones available to those who lack them, in order to ensure equal treatment among workers and students, and apps should clearly describe the probable consequences of their downloading and use.\n\n【27】Ensuring an Orderly and Safe Return to Work\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The current pandemic poses challenges — unprecedented in the modern developed economy of the United States — for a broad range of workplaces, businesses, and institutions. All are struggling in their activities and on their premises to prevent transmission of a dangerous, highly infectious airborne pathogen. The foundations of employer and institutional prevention are relatively inexpensive personal protective equipment whose use is taught and monitored; basic administrative controls such as segmenting the workforce, reducing density, and mandating self-deferral from work for those who feel ill; and environmental controls such as the use of physical barriers and the careful management of air exchange and filtration. Testing, at present, is most effectively used for accurate assessment and follow-up of contacts, whereas the use of contact-tracing apps and mandatory screening by means of molecular, antibody, or antigen tests currently appears to be more complicated, less efficient, and less effective than more traditional public health measures.\n\n【29】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>Although the authors are solely responsible for this article and its content, the article builds on the work of the Massachusetts High Technology Council Covid-19 expert panel, as well as of the efforts of Scientists to Stop COVID-19.

Mr. H. had been incarcerated for more than half his adult life, but he seemed content inside the hotel, where residents were confined to their rooms. Mr. H. had always found the constraints of hospitalization challenging, frequently leaving against medical advice. It was his contention that the isolation imposed by hospitalization and the hospital’s rules, including prohibition of smoking, made the hospital resemble a prison.\n\n【4】Humvees surrounded the isolation hotel, with state police at the entrance and volunteer emergency medical technicians (EMTs) checking temperatures of staff members and asking them screening questions. The smell of sanitizing solution was everywhere. High-top bar tables were now workstations; conference rooms stored clothing and snacks for residents; and the ballroom was now the National Guard’s headquarters, complete with large screens for surveillance video. Residents’ rooms were on the upper floors, where meals, medications, and care packages were delivered by National Guard members clad in personal protective equipment.\n\n【5】During the day, the hotel bustled with staff — a registered nurse, case managers, National Guard members, and peer specialists. After hours, the staff became just two volunteer EMTs, who “admitted” people from shelters, emergency departments, and inpatient units, but without any accompanying medical information.\n\n【6】“There’s just one thing missing,” Mr. H. told us. “I don’t have my Suboxone.” He was not alone; the hotel staff had no consistent system for addressing medical issues, including opioid use disorder. It was clear that although the social-service framework was robust, near misses related to gaps in medical care were happening too frequently. Responding to feedback from onsite staff, we mobilized a group of attending physicians, trainees, and medical students who volunteered their time to evaluate people who were being referred to the hotel and assess their medical needs over the phone. These interviews led to several people being redirected to more appropriate care settings, including hospitals, psychiatric units, and nursing homes.\n\n【7】The admissions became the easy part. At several points during the ensuing days, we worried that Mr. H. would try to leave, as he had so often left the hospital. After a week of enjoying the hotel bed, bubble baths, and TV, he started to feel the weight of his solitude. He asked, “Is there any chance to get out of here at all? I need a cigarette so bad right now.” He hadn’t had any Covid-19 symptoms, and the nicotine-replacement products were not enough. His history of congregate living — whether in prison or in a shelter — was also compounding his experience of isolation.\n\n【8】Knowing the risks associated with ending his isolation early, we tried to tailor our support. We arranged for regular video check-ins with his community health worker, a telemedicine visit with his primary care provider, and, perhaps most important to Mr. H., some cigarettes. We did not make the decision to have cigarettes delivered — nor the decision to provide alcohol to people with alcohol dependence — lightly. Mr. H., along with all the other residents, remained at the hotel voluntarily until meeting the health department’s criteria for safe discharge.\n\n【9】As the number of Covid-19 cases in Rhode Island has declined, so has the number of people in need of isolation; the facility was closed at the end of June. During its 3 months in operation, 179 people were admitted for isolation, staying an average of 10 days; only 8 people required transfer to a hospital. The most frequent discharge destination was a shelter, but 18 people went to substance-use programs. Mr. H., like many others, was discharged back to the street. He quickly found home in a tent encampment in a park north of Providence.\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Onagh W. MacKenzie, M.P.H.  \nM.

A local organization that typically hosts an overflow shelter petitioned the city to quarantine those with high-risk comorbidities at greatest risk for COVID-19 complications in a local hotel. Medical students, with Attending Physician support, have similarly filled gaps by meeting and gathering information from guests upon intake, providing COVID screenings, assisting in obtaining prescriptions, and connecting/facilitating transport of patients to the appropriate healthcare resources (often establishing primary care). The striking similarities between that described above and what I’ve been involved with highlight the general necessity and feasible role for healthcare professionals in this intervention.

The tricyclic antidepressants had no effect on left ventricular ejection fraction at rest or during maximal exercise, as measured by radionuclide ventriculograms obtained before and after treatment. Premature ventricular contractions were reduced by imipramine but were not consistently changed by doxepin or placebo. Treatment with imipramine and doxepin, but not placebo, was associated with significant improvement (P<0.001) in standard ratings of depression. Our findings underscore the need for a reappraisal of the cardiovascular risks of tricyclic antidepressants and suggest that in the absence of severe impairment of myocardial performance, depressed patients with preexisting heart disease can be effectively treated with these agents without an adverse effect on ventricular rhythm or hemodynamic function. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med. 1982; 306:954–9.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 18:08:58", "endTime": "2024/08/12 18:09:02", "cost": 3.462}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:22", "update_time": "2024-08-12 02:09:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 02:08:59"}

Unfortunately, the red hue of hydroxocobalamin interferes with certain colorimetric laboratory analyses, rendering them inaccurate for variable time periods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Because hydroxocobalamin has a light-absorption peak at 532 nm, its presence may interfere with the use of CO-oximetry to measure carboxyhemoglobin (which has a light-absorption peak of 525 and 575 nm). We describe two patients with severe carbon monoxide poisoning and carboxyhemoglobin levels that were significantly falsely lowered after hydroxocobalamin therapy.\n\n【4】A 42-year-old woman was found unconscious in a running car with the tailpipe obstructed by snow. Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel extracted her, provided oxygen, and administered 5 g of hydroxocobalamin for unclear reasons. On arrival at the emergency department, she had a normal neurologic examination. The initial carboxyhemoglobin level measured with the use of a Siemens RapidLab 1265 analyzer in blood obtained in the emergency department was reported as 2.5%. However, analysis of the blood drawn by EMS personnel before the administration of hydroxocobalamin revealed a carboxyhemoglobin level of 34.9%. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen and had a full recovery.\n\n【5】A 25-year-old man had a cardiac arrest in the back of a trailer where he was running a lawn mower to stay warm. (Another victim was dead on arrival of the EMS personnel, and his postmortem carboxyhemoglobin level was 45.0%.) EMS personnel administered hydroxocobalamin along with standard protocols for ventricular fibrillation. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient had return of spontaneous circulation. The carboxyhemoglobin level measured with the use of a GEM Premier 4000 analyzer in blood drawn in the emergency department was 10.7%. However, analysis of the blood drawn by EMS personnel before the administration of hydroxocobalamin revealed a carboxyhemoglobin level of 44.0%. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen and had an incomplete neurologic recovery.\n\n【6】Although one study showed a dose-dependent false elevation in carboxyhemoglobin levels after hydroxocobalamin administration in rabbits, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> another in vitro study revealed that carboxyhemoglobin levels may vary depending on the instrument used. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Since spectrophotometric interference between determination of hydroxocobalamin and carboxyhemoglobin levels is probably dependent on both concentration and instrumentation, measured carboxyhemoglobin levels may become unreliable after hydroxocobalamin administration. This interference might result in inaccurate diagnosis, leading to either the inappropriate use or withholding of therapy. Caution is warranted in relying on CO-oximetry laboratory analysis after hydroxocobalamin administration until further research better defines this interaction.\n\n【7】参考删除-2:<u>Zhanna Livshits, M.D.  \nDaniel M.

The degree of beta-blockade was measured as the reduction in the heart rate and blood pressure in the supine and upright positions and during treadmill exercise testing.\n\n【2】The Chinese subjects had at least a twofold greater sensitivity to the beta-blocking effects of propranolol than the white subjects, as indicated by the mean (±SEM) plasma concentrations producing a 20 percent reduction in the heart rate in both the supine position (197±31 vs. 536±58 nmol per liter; P<0.05) and the upright position (131±27 vs. 343±39 nmol per liter; P<0.05) and after exercise testing (96±12 vs. 185±23 nmol per liter; P<0.05). In addition, the Chinese subjects had much greater sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of propranolol, as shown by the concentrations that reduced blood pressure by 10 percent in the supine position (73±5 vs. 748±7 nmol per liter; P<0.01) and in the upright position (89±5 vs. 401±6 nmol per liter; P<0.01). No difference in beta-receptor density or affinity of lymphocytes was found between the groups. The Chinese group had a 45 percent higher free fraction of propranolol in plasma, which may have contributed to the increased drug effect but cannot explain it entirely. This group metabolized propranolol more rapidly than the white group, which resulted in a 76 percent higher clearance of an oral dose (3740±737 vs. 2125±214 ml per minute; P<0.05) because of increased metabolism through multiple metabolic pathways.\n\n【3】We conclude that Chinese men have greater sensitivity than white men to the effects of propranolol on heart rate and blood pressure.

Accurate estimates of the weight gain related to the cessation of smoking in the general population are not available, however.\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】We related changes in body weight to changes in smoking status in adults 25 to 74 years of age who were weighed in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1971 to 1975) and then weighed a second time in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982 to 1984). The cohort included continuing smokers (748 men and 1137 women) and those who had quit smoking for a year or more (409 men and 359 women).\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】The mean weight gain attributable to the cessation of smoking, as adjusted for age, race, level of education, alcohol use, illnesses related to change in weight, base-line weight, and physical activity, was 2.8 kg in men and 3.8 kg in women. Major weight gain (>13 kg) occurred in 9.8 percent of the men and 13.4 percent of the women who quit smoking. The relative risk of major weight gain in those who quit smoking (as compared with those who continued to smoke) was 8.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 14.9) in men and 5.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 9.1) in women, and it remained high regardless of the duration of cessation. For both sexes, blacks, people under the age of 55, and people who smoked 15 cigarettes or more per day were at higher risk of major weight gain after quitting smoking. Although at base line the smokers weighed less than those who had never smoked, they weighed nearly the same at follow-up.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】Major weight gain is strongly related to smoking cessation, but it occurs in only a minority of those who stop smoking. Weight gain is not likely to negate the health benefits of smoking cessation, but its cosmetic effects may interfere with attempts to quit. Effective methods of weight control are therefore needed for smokers trying to quit. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1991; 324:739–45.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】DESPITE the well-publicized adverse health effects of tobacco and the declining prevalence of smoking in the United States, slightly more than one in four adults continue to smoke cigarettes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Some smokers may be reluctant to stop smoking because the disadvantages of smoking cessation are realized soon after they quit, whereas the advantages are less certain and occur in the future. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> One potential disadvantage of smoking cessation – weight gain – is a widely held concern of both the public at large and health professionals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> In fact, surveys of both smokers and nonsmokers report that concern about body weight is related to starting and continuing to smoke and may be related to the resumption of smoking in those who quit. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> <sup><a>6 </a></sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> <sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【12】There is an inverse relation between smoking and body weight. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Several mechanisms by which smoking decreases body weight have been proposed, including alterations in insulin homeostasis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> lipoprotein lipase activity, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> physical activity, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> and preferences in food consumption. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】The recent report of the Surgeon General 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> reviewed 15 prospective epidemiologic studies and estimated that the average weight gain attributable to the cessation of smoking was about 1.8 kg (4 lb) in both sexes.

To provide such estimates we studied a nationally representative cohort of smokers and nonsmokers followed from 1971 to 1984 to determine the sex-specific mean weight gain attributable to the cessation of smoking, as well as the effect of quitting smoking on the risk of gaining various amounts of weight. We also sought to identify the characteristics of smokers that increase the risk of weight gain after quitting.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【17】The data we analyzed were from the 1982–1984 Epidemiologie Follow-up Study of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I), a prospective study of subjects first examined from 1971 to 1975. NHANES I was a national probability survey carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics, based on a multistage stratified cluster sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Between 1982 and 1984, an attempt was made to follow up all 14,407 adults whose age at base line was 25 to 74 years. By 1984, 93 percent of the cohort had been successfully traced and their vital status determined. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【18】Of the 14,407 members of the original cohort, the following were excluded from this analysis: 1024 (7.1 percent) for whom vital status was missing at follow-up; 838 (5.8 percent) who were found to be alive but were not reinterviewed; 2022 (14.0 percent) who had died; 101 (0.7 percent) who were pregnant at either base line or follow-up; 560 (3.9 percent) whose height or weight was unknown at either base line or follow-up; 299 (2.1 percent) for whom values for smoking status were missing or inconsistent at base line or follow-up; and 231 (1.6 percent) with missing values for one or more of the covariates used in the analysis. This left 9332 members of the original cohort.\n\n【19】Definition of Smoking Status\n----------------------------\n\n【20】Information on smoking habits at base line was available from the NHANES I data for the random half of the respondents who received a detailed examination. At the follow-up interview a history of lifetime smoking patterns, including periods of stopping and starting, was sought from all respondents. For those not asked their smoking status at base line, the detailed smoking history obtained at follow-up was used to establish the status at base line. This is a highly accurate method of determining smoking status. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】We defined six mutually exclusive groups based on smoking status at the base-line and follow-up interviews. Those who had never smoked were defined as those who reported at both the base-line and follow-up interviews that they had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lives. Former smokers were defined as those who were exsmokers at both the base-line and follow-up interviews and had not started smoking in the interim. Intermittent smokers were defined as those who smoked at both base line and follow-up but had quit for more than a year in the interim. Continuing smokers were defined as those who smoked at both base line and follow-up and had not quit smoking for a year or more in the interim. Sustained quitters were defined as those who smoked at base line but had quit smoking for a year or more at follow-up. Recent quitters were defined as those who smoked at base line but had quit within a year of their follow-up interview. The subgroup of smokers who were interviewed at base line were asked how much they currently smoked. At the follow-up interview all the respondents who had ever smoked cigarettes were asked to report the amount they had usually smoked when they were smokers. Separate categorical variables were used to measure the number of cigarettes smoked per day: 1 to 14, 15 to 24, and 25 or more. The duration of cessation (in years) in sustained quitters was determined by subtracting their reported age at cessation from their age at follow-up. Information on the age at cessation was unavailable for 142 subjects.\n\n【22】Groups with relatively rare patterns of smoking (3.6 percent of the sample) were excluded because of limited power to estimate their sex-specific changes in weight. These groups included 22 subjects who started smoking for the first time after the base-line examination, 126 who reported smoking cigarettes but never on a regular basis, 120 who reported being exsmokers at base line but current smokers at follow-up, and 60 who reported being exsmokers at both base line and follow-up but who had smoked for a year or more in the interim. A total of 9004 persons (3365 men and 5639 women) were thus included in the final sample.\n\n【23】Weight Gain\n-----------\n\n【24】The methods used to measure height and weight in this study have been previously described. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> At base line the subjects' height and weight were measured under controlled conditions in mobile examination trailers. Weight was measured with a self-balancing scale. Examination clothing consisted of disposable paper uniforms and slippers. At follow-up, the subjects were weighed without shoes on a portable spring scale in their homes. Height was not measured again. We adjusted for the weight of indoor clothing by subtracting 1.6 kg from the measured weight, as has been done in other studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>23</a></sup></u>\n\n【25】In this analysis we examined weight change in kilograms as both a continuous and categorical variable. We defined four categories of weight gain. The first category included persons who had gained 3.0 kg or less during the follow-up period (2299 men and 3618 women). The second category included those who had gained more than 3.0 but not more than 8.0 kg (704 men and 1211 women). The third category included those who had gained more than 8.0 but not more than 13.0 kg (245 men and 495 women), and the fourth category included those who had gained more than 13.0 kg ( 117 men and 315 women).\n\n【26】Covariates\n----------\n\n【27】We adjusted for several potential confounders of the relation between weight gain and smoking status. Both age and body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) at base line were coded as continuous variables with quadratic terms to account for possible nonlinear effects on change in weight. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Race was dichotomized as white or nonwhite, and level of education was coded according to number of years of schooling: <12, 12, and >12. In some analyses, base-line weight was coded as a categorical variable; overweight was defined as a body-mass index of 3≥27.8 in men and ≥27.3 in women, and underweight was defined as a body-mass index of ≤20.7 in men and ≤19.1 in women. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【28】Information on levels (low, medium, or high) of recreational and nonrecreational physical activity as reported by the subjects was available from the base-line and follow-up interviews. The subjects' responses were divided into five categories: high at both interviews, moderate at both interviews, low at both interviews, activity increased from base line to follow-up, and activity decreased from base line to follow-up.\n\n【29】A series of similar questions was used at the base-line and follow-up interviews to assess alcohol consumption. Four categories of drinking were defined: nondrinker at both interviews, drinker at both interviews, started drinking after base line, and stopped drinking after base line.\n\n【30】We identified conditions reported at the follow-up interview that could have affected body weight. These were diagnoses of thyroid problems, a heart condition, diabetes, or hypertension by a physician, and reported hospitalization since 1970 for cancer, chronic lung disease, colitis, or cirrhosis. The number of conditions reported was used as a continuous (one through five) variable. We also used a set of categorical variables defined as none, one, or two or more conditions and a model in which persons with any of these conditions were excluded. Since the relation between smoking cessation and weight gain was similar in each model, only results from the models in which the conditions were reported as a continuous variable are presented.\n\n【31】On the basis of the reproductive history obtained at the follow-up interview, the women were divided into four groups: nulliparous, parous with the last live birth before the base-line examination, parous with the first live birth after the base-line examination, and parous with live births both before and after the base-line examination.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】We carried out sex-specific analyses, first adjusting only for age at base line and duration of follow-up (mean in the men, 9.8 years; range, 6.7 to 12.6; and mean in the women, 10.0; range, 6.7 to 12.5), then reestimating the results with adjustment for all the covariates listed above. The results of the partially and fully adjusted analyses were similar. All the results reported here are fully adjusted.\n\n【34】Multiple linear-regression analysis was used to estimate the mean difference in weight change between the subjects who continued to smoke and the other groups, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> and to estimate the mean absolute weight gain for each group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> We used multinomial logisticregression analysis to estimate the odds ratios for the categories of weight gain of more than 3.0 kg for each smoking-status group relative to continuing smokers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> Because there were relatively few subjects in the highest category of weight gain (>13 kg), the odds ratios for this level of weight gain will closely estimate the relative risk. We also estimated the odds ratios (relative to continuing smokers) for the categories of weight gain for sustained quitters of one to three, four to six, and seven or more years' duration. In a separate analysis, sex-specific multinomial logistic-regression models were analyzed for sustained quitters only, in order to identify base-line characteristics of quitters that might be related to subsequent weight gain.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Base-Line Characteristics\n-------------------------\n\n【37】Table 1.  Table 1. Base-Line Characteristics of the Study Subjects, According to Smoking Status.\n\n【38】As compared with the continuing smokers, the sustained quitters tended to be somewhat older and better educated 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. They were also more likely to be white and more likely to have been lighter smokers. Former smokers and those who had never smoked tended to be the oldest and to have the highest mean body-mass indexes among the groups. These results were similar for both men and women.\n\n【39】As compared with the continuing smokers, those who became sustained quitters had a slightly higher mean body-mass index at base line; the mean difference in the men was 0.6 (P = 0.04), and in the women 0.5 (P = 0.16). These results were related to differences in the amount smoked by continuing smokers and the amount sustained quitters had smoked; after we adjusted for the amount smoked the mean differences decreased to 0.4 (P = 0.10) in the men and 0.3 (P = 0.31) in the women.\n\n【40】Differences in Mean Weight Gain\n-------------------------------\n\n【41】Table 2.  Table 2. Linear Regression Estimates of the Mean Difference in Weight Gain between Continuing Smokers and Other Groups.\\*\n\n【42】Regardless of smoking status, the women tended to gain about 1 to 2 kg more than the men during the follow-up period 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Among both men and women, the sustained quitters gained the most weight, whereas the women who continued to smoke and the men who smoked intermittently gained the least. The mean weight gain attributable to the cessation of smoking (the difference between sustained quitters and continuing smokers) was 1 kg higher in the women (3.8 kg) than in the men (2.8 kg). The mean weight gain of the former smokers and those who had never smoked was very similar in both men and women.\n\n【43】Effects on Level of Weight Gain\n-------------------------------\n\n【44】Table 3.  Table 3. Category of Weight Gain According to Smoking Status.\n\n【45】Table 3 shows that the majority of subjects gained 3 kg or less during the follow-up period, regardless of smoking status. The only exception was the women who were sustained quitters; slightly fewer than half of them gained 3 kg or less.\n\n【46】Among men, the risk of gaining 3 to 8 kg varied little from one group to another, whereas the risk of gaining >8 to 13 kg varied substantially, ranging from 20.2 percent in the recent quitters to 4.7 percent in the former smokers. The sustained quitters had the greatest risk of gaining more than 13 kg (9.8 percent), and former smokers, those who had never smoked, and continuing smokers had the smallest risk.\n\n【47】Among women, there was relatively little variation according to smoking status in the risk of gaining 13 kg or less. As with men, however, the sustained quitters had the greatest risk of gaining more than 13 kg (13.4 percent), whereas the women who had never smoked, former smokers, and continuing smokers had the smallest risk.\n\n【48】Table 4.  Table 4. Odds Ratios Estimated by Logistic Regression for the Effect of Smoking Status and Duration of Cessation on the Severity of Weight Gain.\\*\n\n【49】The results of the multinomial logistic-regression analyses indicated that smoking cessation had a strong effect on the degree of weight gain 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Relative to the continuing smokers, the odds ratios for weight gain in both men and women who were sustained quitters increased with the degree of weight gain, with the highest odds ratios, 8.1 in men and 5.8 in women, for a gain of more than 13 kg. Among both men and women, recent cessation was less strongly associated with a gain of more than 13 kg, and the intermittent smokers, those who had never smoked, and former smokers had only moderately elevated odds ratios for any category of weight gain.\n\n【50】Among sustained quitters the odds ratios for the categories of weight gain remained substantially elevated regardless of the duration of smoking cessation. For a weight gain of more than 13 kg, however, the peak odds ratio occurred four to six years after smoking cessation in both sexes.\n\n【51】Attained Weight at Base Line and Follow-up\n------------------------------------------\n\n【52】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Mean Body-Mass Index in the Study Subjects at Base Line (1971–1975) and Follow-up (1982–1984), According to Smoking Status.\n\n【53】Squares indicate continuing smokers, triangles quitters, circles former smokers, and diamonds those who had never smoked. The estimates were adjusted for age, race, and level of education at the base-line examination, and for duration of follow-up and changes in physical activity, drinking status, reproductive history (in women), and morbidity between the base-line and follow-up examinations.\n\n【54】Differences in attained weight were also examined. Figure 1 shows the sex-specific mean values for body-mass index at base line and follow-up for the sustained quitters and the continuing smokers, those who had never smoked, and former smokers (data for intermittent smokers and recent quitters are not shown in order to improve visual clarity). These values were adjusted for the same set of covariates used in the previous multivariate analyses, except body-mass index at base line. For both men and women, the average effect of smoking cessation was to raise the body weights of those who quit smoking to a level similar to that of the subjects who had never smoked. The mean base-line values for body-mass index in the continuing smokers and the sustained quitters were not significantly different for men (P>0.16) or women (P>0.44), whereas the mean values in the sustained quitters and those who had never smoked were significantly different (P<0.0003 for the men and <0.0001 for the women). At follow-up the values were not significantly different (P>0.66 for the men and >0.41 for the women). The results were similar for the comparisons of body-mass index between the sustained quitters and the former smokers.\n\n【55】Predictors of Weight Gain in the Sustained Quitters\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Table 5.  Table 5. Logistic Regression Estimates of the Effects of Base-Line Characteristics on the Odds of Subsequent Weight Gain among Persons Who Quit Smoking for a Year or More.\\*\n\n【57】We examined several variables that might be collected by smoking-cessation programs and used to identify persons at greatest risk of subsequent weight gain. For this purpose, our analysis was limited to sustained quitters only 删除2:<u>( Table 5 )</u>. In both men and women, black quitters had substantially higher odds of weight gain than their nonblack counterparts. This was especially true for weight gain in excess of 13 kg, in which the odds in blacks were about three times the odds in nonblacks (2.9 in men and 3.3 in women). Base-line weight had little relation to subsequent weight gain in the men who quit smoking. In the women, however, being underweight increased the odds of gaining more than 13 kg nearly fourfold. In both men and women, level of education had an inconsistent relation to level of weight gain, with wide confidence intervals around the estimates of odds ratios. The amount smoked was strongly related to the risk of subsequent severe weight gain; as compared with the odds ratios in those who smoked fewer than 15 cigarettes per day, the odds ratios for gaining more than 13 kg for those who smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day were 5.7 in men and 4.7 in women. Men who reported low recreational physical activity at base line were somewhat less likely to gain weight after quitting smoking. In women, however, low recreational physical activity was related to an increased risk of weight gain, and the odds ratios increased in magnitude with increasing levels of weight gain, from 1.1 to 1.6 to 3.2. Both men and women under the age of 55 who quit smoking had a much higher risk of subsequent weight gain than older subjects; the odds ratios for gaining more than 13 kg in men and women were 5.3 and 8.3, respectively. As compared with nulliparous women, those who had had one or more live births were at increased risk of weight gain after they stopped smoking. Although the effect of parity increased with increasing levels of weight gain, the confidence intervals were wide.\n\n【58】In order to see whether these factors had similar effects on weight gain in those who had not quit smoking during the study period, we repeated these analyses with separate sex-specific models for those who had never smoked, former smokers, and continuing smokers (data not shown). In general, race was only weakly related to subsequent weight gain in these groups, except for men who had never smoked, among whom blacks were about two to three times as likely as nonblacks to gain more than 8 kg. The effect of baseline weight in the men in the other groups was similar to that in the sustained quitters. For women, however, overweight rather than underweight was more strongly related to subsequent weight gain in the other groups. For both men and women, level of education, physical activity, and age showed relations to weight gain that were similar to those found in the sustained quitters.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】In this national cohort of adults followed for 10 years, the mean weight gain after cessation of smoking was 2.8 kg in men and 3.8 kg in women. However, 9.8 percent of the men and 13.4 percent of the women who quit gained more than 13 kg, and they were, respectively, 8.1 and 5.8 times more likely than continuing smokers to have gained more than 13 kg. For the average quitter, the increased risk of major weight gain remained high, regardless of the duration of cessation. By the end of the study, however, the mean body weight of those who had quit had increased only to that of those who had never smoked.\n\n【61】We also found that among recent quitters (≤1 year) both the mean weight gain and the relative risk of major weight gain were lower than among the sustained quitters (>1 year). This may explain the lower estimate of weight gain (1.8 kg) in the Surgeon General's report, which was based on 15 studies with a median duration of cessation of only two years, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> as compared with five years in this study.\n\n【62】Using women's weight histories, one study reported an increase in weight for at least 25 years after the cessation of smoking. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> In our study the relative risk of weight gain in those who had quit smoking before the base-line examination (the former smokers) was only about one quarter that in the sustained quitters 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Given that the median duration of cessation in former smokers was 19 years, our findings suggest that the rate of weight gain in those who quit smoking does decrease, but only after an extended period.\n\n【63】At base line and follow-up the mean body-mass index of the subjects who had never smoked and the former smokers was similar, but higher than that of the continuing smokers. By the end of the study, smoking cessation had raised the mean body-mass index of the quitters to that of the subjects who had never smoked, but not higher 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u>. This suggests that smoking lowers weight and that after one quits, weight tends to return to the level of people who have never smoked.\n\n【64】Little is known about the characteristics of those who quit smoking and gain large amounts of weight. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Younger age, lean body build, and heavier smoking have been related to weight gain after quitting. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> Our study found that people of either sex who smoked 15 or more cigarettes a day or were under the age of 55 had more than double the risk of major weight gain. Only in women, however, did we find that being underweight and sedentary were strong predictors of major weight gain. We also found blacks of both sexes to have a substantially higher risk of weight gain after cessation, whereas race had little effect on weight gain among those who had never smoked, former smokers, and continuing smokers. This unique finding needs to be confirmed by other studies.\n\n【65】Few studies have examined the effect of smoking cessation on the degree of weight gain. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> In a study of 1302 Swedish women followed for six years 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> the risk of gaining 10 kg or more was 4 percent in continuing smokers and 13 percent in quitters. Lower risks of major weight gain were found in over 13,000 smokers in California who were followed for an average of 1.5 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> ; the risk of gaining ≥9.1 kg (≥20 lb) was below 2 percent in the continuing smokers and about 4 percent in those who quit. These lower estimates are probably due to the short period of follow-up.\n\n【66】On average, the women who quit smoking gained more weight than the men, a finding consistent with studies in which nicotine had greater effects on body weight in female rats than male rats. 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> The greater risk of weight gain in women may thus be due to biologic rather than cultural factors.\n\n【67】A potential limitation of our study was the use of self-reports to assess smoking status. This may have resulted in the misclassification of some smokers as quitters, especially later in the study, as smoking became less socially acceptable. However, underreporting of smoking does not appear to have increased in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>34 </a></sup></u> Moreover, underreporting would have led to an underestimation of the effect of smoking cessation on weight gain.\n\n【68】The health benefits of quitting smoking may have been partly reduced in the subjects who gained large amounts of weight. In women, gaining more than 10 kg after the age of 18 increases the risk of coronary heart disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> Any deleterious effects of major weight gain in former smokers are small, however, when compared with the harmful effects of smoking, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, pulmonary disease, and peripheral vascular disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> In our view, a resumption of smoking due to the unwanted cosmetic effects of weight gain is the most serious potential consequence for those trying to quit. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> In addition, the experience of the minority of quitters who gain large amounts of weight may discourage other smokers from quitting.\n\n【69】Both smoking-cessation programs and weight-control programs have limited effectiveness. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> <sup>, </sup> 删除3:<u><sup><a>38 </a></sup></u> Few trials have combined smoking cessation and weight control, and their results are disappointing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Research aimed at minimizing weight gain after smoking cessation is thus sorely needed. Such research might shed light on the equally vexing problem of preventing obesity and at the same time help increase the percentage of smokers who can quit permanently.\n\n【70】Those who counsel smokers should emphasize that the average person who quits smoking will gain only 2 to 4 kg, and that about half those who quit will gain less. The beneficial effects of quitting smoking are not likely to be negated by the weight gain that may follow.\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Dr. Neil Grunberg for his many helpful suggestions; to Dr. Robert Klesges, Dr. Frederick Trowbridge, Dr. Ronald Davis, Dr. Juliette Kendrick, Dr. Richard Rothenberg, Ms. Barbara Gray, and Dr. Henry Kahn for their useful comments; and to Dr. Dana Flanders for advice on statistical aspects of the analysis.</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta (D.F.W., R.F.A., G.A.G., T.B.), and the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md.

Then, my heart racing, I learned that Prude was murdered in my city, where he’d been admitted to my hospital and seen by my colleagues the day before he died.\n\n【3】His death hit me hard: another Black victim of police brutality, he was also a patient harmed by care decisions. As I learned more, my numbness turned to outrage. This man had been acutely psychotic after discharge from the emergency department; he had still needed medical care.\n\n【4】Mental health conditions are ubiquitous, and it is critical to seek help for them. For Black people, however, help comes with substantial risk. One manifestation of this risk ended Daniel Prude’s life, but it does not have to end his story.\n\n【5】Recalling that my great-grandmother was named Margaret Prude, I checked with relatives and discovered that Daniel and I were cousins. I found myself screaming inside, trying to find my voice as the world remained silent. Had I known this cousin was in Rochester, could I have advocated for him? Could I have persuaded my psychiatry colleagues to keep him in the hospital for monitoring? As I wondered, I was filled with guilt.\n\n【6】I had never forgiven my grandfather for exposing me to the pain that comes with substance use and mental illness. Blaming him for his disease, I ran away from him — thereby missing an opportunity to meet Daniel at our last family reunion. The stigma of mental illness had deprived me of my heritage.\n\n【7】I can only imagine Daniel’s sense of confusion and helplessness during his last moments. Naked, hooded, vomiting, breathless, he lay with his head pinned to the pavement under a police officer’s weight. My cousin was someone’s brother, son, and nephew. He was known as a comedian who could light up a room with his jokes. And there he lay, suffocating on Jefferson Avenue.\n\n【8】Having neglected, as a country, to adequately address both disparities in mental health care and police brutality, we are all responsible for my cousin’s death.

How could the kind of actions that led to the death of my cousin go unchecked for so long on the watch of a Black police chief, a Black mayor, and a Black attorney general? A lack of transparency, accountability, and systematic practices promoted a culture of complacency.\n\n【11】Deaths in police custody continue to be attributed to “excited delirium,” a condition that is not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association or the American Medical Association. Described as a stress response to overstimulation of dopamine and NMDA receptors, leading to cardiac arrest, it is used disproportionately to justify the deaths of Black and Brown victims of police brutality. But death by suffocation is not excited delirium. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> We need a cultural shift to the expectation that deaths occurring at the hands of police are independently investigated.

We can advocate for more resources for inpatient psychiatric beds. We can hold health care systems and police departments accountable.\n\n【13】As a Black community, we can encourage our children to pursue careers in mental health. As loved ones, we can recognize mental illness as a disease, not a choice. Medical and graduate schools can promote a more diverse workforce and build bridges with the community.

Whether benefit occurs in patients early after myocardial infarction is unknown.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial, a randomized, open-label comparison of ICD therapy (in 332 patients) and no ICD therapy (in 342 patients) 6 to 40 days after a myocardial infarction. We enrolled patients who had reduced left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.35 or less) and impaired cardiac autonomic function (manifested as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated average 24-hour heart rate on Holter monitoring). The primary outcome was mortality from any cause. Death from arrhythmia was a predefined secondary outcome.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】During a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 30±13 months, there was no difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups: of the 120 patients who died, 62 were in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio for death in the ICD group, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; P=0.66). There were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; P=0.009). In contrast, there were 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group and 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Prophylactic ICD therapy does not reduce overall mortality in high-risk patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Although ICD therapy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death due to arrhythmia, that was offset by an increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to prolong life in several populations of patients with serious heart disease and reduced left ventricular function. Previous trials, however, have included relatively few patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The first 6 to 12 months after myocardial infarction constitute a period during which there is a particularly high risk of death from arrhythmia, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> and pharmacologic therapies other than beta-blockers have not been shown to be effective in counteracting this risk.\n\n【12】The Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT) was designed to test whether prophylactic implantation of an ICD would reduce mortality in survivors of a recent myocardial infarction who are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Because several large studies have shown that markers of impaired autonomic function are associated with increased mortality, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> only survivors of infarction who had severe left ventricular dysfunction as well as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated 24-hour heart rate were eligible for the trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Organization of the Trial\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The DINAMIT trial was initiated by the investigators. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all 73 participating investigational sites in 12 countries worldwide. All the patients gave written informed consent before randomization. An external data and safety monitoring committee independently reviewed the results at regular intervals throughout the trial. A description of the design and study protocol has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Patient Population\n------------------\n\n【17】Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had recently had a myocardial infarction (6 to 40 days previously) and if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or less, as assessed by angiography, radionuclide scanning, or echocardiography. Patients also had to have a standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals of 70 msec or less or a mean RR interval of 750 msec or less (heart rate, 80 beats per minute or greater) over a 24-hour period, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> as assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring performed at least three days after the infarction.\n\n【18】The following exclusion criteria were applied: congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association class IV at the time of randomization; noncardiac disease that limited life expectancy; coronary artery bypass grafting performed since the qualifying infarction or planned to be performed within four weeks after randomization; three-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention performed since the qualifying infarction; name on a waiting list for a heart transplant; current, ongoing ICD therapy; prior implantation of a permanent pacemaker; requirement for an ICD (i.e., sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation more than 48 hours after the qualifying infarction); low probability that the study ICD could be implanted within seven days after randomization; and expected poor compliance with the protocol.\n\n【19】Study Design\n------------\n\n【20】Patients were stratified according to clinical center and underwent central randomization, which was performed at the study coordinating and methods center (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre, Hamilton, Ont., Canada). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to receive an ICD (the ICD group) or not to receive an ICD (the control group). The randomization sequence was stratified according to center and balanced within randomly varying blocks of two, four, or six patients.\n\n【21】The study protocol mandated that patients receive the best conventional medical therapy. Investigators were encouraged to treat all study patients with angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and lipid-lowering drugs, as appropriate. Reasons for not giving these medications were documented.\n\n【22】Patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD were required to undergo implantation of a market-approved, single-chamber ICD (St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.) within one week after randomization. Implanted leads were required to achieve an R wave of more than 4.9 mV, a pacing threshold of less than 2.1 V at 0.5 msec, and a defibrillation threshold with a safety margin of at least 10 J. Postoperatively, the ICD was set to detect ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The detection rate for tachycardia was set at 175 or more beats per minute for at least 16 beats. The device was programmed to deliver all discharges at maximal output in the ventricular-fibrillation zone (200 beats per minute or greater). Bradycardia pacing was programmed for activation at a minimum of 40 beats per minute. Antitachycardia pacing within the ventricular-tachycardia zone (175 to 200 beats per minute) could be activated to deliver four bursts of 6 to 10 beats beginning at 81 percent of the tachycardia cycle length, with 10-msec decrements between bursts.\n\n【23】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【24】Patients were followed with respect to all outcomes for a maximum of four years, beginning on the date of randomization. The study commenced in April 1998, and follow-up ended in September 2003, about 15 months after the last patient had been recruited. Follow-up visits were scheduled to take place three and six months after randomization and at six-month intervals thereafter.\n\n【25】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome in DINAMIT was death from any cause. Death due to cardiac arrhythmia was the secondary outcome. Ascertainment of the cause of death of patients in the trial was the responsibility of the local investigators. Documentation of the cause of death was based on information obtained from witnesses, family members, death certificates, hospital records, and autopsy reports, when available, but not from ICD telemetry.\n\n【27】The blinded central validation committee independently reviewed information on all deaths. Classification of each death based on the surrounding circumstances was agreed on by these reviewers. The committee classified deaths as either arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic in nature on the basis of criteria originally developed by Hinkle and Thaler 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and previously validated in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> These criteria are based on the clinical circumstances of death and do not rely on ICD information.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】Data analysis was performed at Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center by two of the authors (Mr. Roberts and Dr. Gent). All investigators had full access to the data. The primary study outcome was evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. The cumulative risks of death from any cause and from specific causes over time were estimated separately for each treatment group with use of the Kaplan–Meier procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and were compared between groups with use of the Mantel–Haenszel test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> On the basis of mortality data from similar populations of patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> it was anticipated that the control group would have a three-year mortality rate of 30.0 percent and that 40.0 percent of these deaths would be accounted for by deaths due to arrhythmia. The net effect of preventing 80.0 percent of these deaths due to arrhythmia with use of an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate to 20.4 percent — a reduction considered biologically plausible and clinically relevant. Based on a one-sided test at an alpha level of 0.05, we determined that 525 patients would be required in order for the study to have 80 percent power to identify a difference between the groups. Because mortality rates were lower than expected during the study, the target enrollment was increased to 674 patients.\n\n【30】A single interim analysis of efficacy was performed by an external safety and efficacy monitoring committee after 66 deaths — about half the anticipated number — had occurred. A one-sided P value of less than 0.001 would have resulted in early termination of the study. Before unblinding, a decision was made to use two-sided statistical testing.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】A total of 674 patients were enrolled; 332 were randomly assigned to the ICD group and 342 to the control group. Twenty of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD subsequently refused to have one implanted. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups are provided in Table 1 . Most patients had new Q-wave infarctions, and 72.1 percent were anterior in location. Two thirds of the patients had received thrombolytic therapy, had undergone acute percutaneous intervention, or both. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.28. In a subgroup of 321 patients in whom assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction was repeated six to eight weeks after randomization, there was a mean (±SD) increase of 0.02±0.11. The average time from myocardial infarction to randomization was 18 days and was similar in the two groups.\n\n【35】There was excellent adherence to optimal medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Amiodarone was prescribed to 27 of the patients who had been randomly assigned to receive an ICD (8.1 percent) and to 46 of the control patients (13.5 percent) (P=0.04). During the course of the study, percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization was performed in 33 ICD recipients (9.9 percent), as compared with 50 patients in the control group (14.6 percent) (P=0.08). Only partial follow-up was available for four patients (all members of the control group).\n\n【36】Death from Any Cause\n--------------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1.

Mortality Rates.\n\n【39】The cumulative-mortality curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 1 . During an average observation period of 30±13 months, 120 patients died, 62 in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; two-sided P=0.66) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The annual mortality rates were 7.5 and 6.9 percent, respectively. The adjudicated causes of death are listed in Table 2 . Two patients who had been randomly assigned to the ICD group died before they received an ICD.\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2.

For each feature, the ICD effect remained consistent and did not differ significantly between or among subgroups.\n\n【43】Death from Arrhythmic and Nonarrhythmic Causes\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Arrhythmia (Panel A) and from Nonarrhythmic Causes (Panel B), According to Study Group.\n\n【45】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.\n\n【46】In the ICD group, there were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia, as compared with 29 in the control group (annual rate, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. This difference was highly statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; two-sided P=0.009). There were 50 deaths due to nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. Of the three prespecified subcategories of deaths from nonarrhythmic causes, the only one found to occur at a significantly increased rate in the ICD group was death from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes (P=0.05) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Of the 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, 39 (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature (i.e., due to cardiac, nonarrhythmic or vascular, noncardiac causes); in the control group, 23 of 29 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes (79 percent) were cardiovascular in nature.\n\n【47】Complications of ICD Therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【48】The average time between randomization and ICD implantation was 6.3±7.3 days. Of the 332 patients assigned to receive an ICD, 310 actually received a device. The time between ICD implantation and discharge from the hospital averaged 4.7±6.4 days. In-hospital device-related complications occurred in 25 patients; the most common of these complications were lead dislodgment, pneumothorax, and inappropriate shocks. There were no deaths related to device implantation. To prevent inappropriate pacing, bradycardia pacing was typically programmed to 40 to 45 beats per minute (maximum, 55 beats per minute).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this randomized trial of high-risk patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction, overall survival was not improved by prophylactic implantation of an ICD. The study groups were well balanced with respect to their baseline clinical characteristics and the early use of reperfusion therapy. There was a high rate of use of appropriate medical therapy. It is unlikely that the similarity between the two groups in the rate of death from all causes represents a false negative result due to inadequate sample size. The 95 percent confidence interval of the hazard ratio for death from any cause rules out a reduction in mortality of 25 percent or greater.\n\n【51】The ICD group, as compared with the control group, had a large, statistically significant reduction (by more than 50 percent) in the risk of death due to arrhythmia; however, this effect was offset by a significant increase, of similar magnitude, in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes. The ICD is expected to reduce mortality by preventing sudden cardiac deaths due to ventricular fibrillation without any effect on death from nonarrhythmic causes. This pattern has been consistently observed in previous trials of ICD therapy in patients at high risk. In several trials of ICD therapy — the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study, the Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators trial, and the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg — there was a 50 percent reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia and almost no effect on the rate of death from other causes; the net effect was a 25 percent reduction in overall mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial I (MADIT I) and MADIT II, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> which evaluated prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, the rate of death due to arrhythmia was markedly reduced and the rate of death from other causes was not increased.\n\n【52】In DINAMIT, the reduction in the rate of arrhythmia-related death was very similar to that observed in previous trials of ICD therapy. However, in contrast to the previous trials, DINAMIT revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes among patients assigned to receive an ICD. Most of these deaths (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature. It appears that in this trial, as in previous trials of ICD therapy, the ICD prevented death from ventricular fibrillation. However, preventing death from ventricular fibrillation did not reduce overall mortality in these patients.\n\n【53】The reason for the unexpected and unprecedented increase in mortality from causes other than arrhythmia in patients assigned to receive an ICD is not clear. The most likely explanation is that the patients “saved” from an arrhythmia-related death by ICD therapy are also at high risk for death from other cardiac causes. There was no sign of an increased rate of death in association with the surgical procedure or complications with the use of the ICD. It is unlikely that the increased rate of deaths from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes were due to excessive pacing, as in the Dual-Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> because the backup pacing was programmed at a very low rate in almost all the patients in the ICD group.\n\n【54】It has been speculated that ICDs might, by shocking ventricular fibrillation, merely transform sudden death to eventual death from pump failure, without significantly prolonging life, especially when ventricular fibrillation is occurring in a patient with end-stage heart failure or a large acute myocardial infarction. There is some evidence that such a possibility may have factored into the results of the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and it provides a reasonable hypothesis for the results of DINAMIT.\n\n【55】The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in DINAMIT was significantly reduced (at 0.28) and did not increase appreciably six weeks later. However, the mean ejection fraction was somewhat higher than that in MADIT II (0.23) 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> — a difference that may explain the higher overall mortality observed in MADIT II. The main differences between patients in DINAMIT and those in previous trials is the temporal proximity to acute infarction and the abnormal results of autonomic-function tests at baseline. In DINAMIT, the ratio of death due to arrhythmia to death from any cause was 34 percent, similar to the ratio in other ICD trials. A recent analysis of the MADIT II trial, which also enrolled patients with a previous myocardial infarction, supports the main finding of DINAMIT — that patients who have recently had an infarction do not benefit from ICD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> In MADIT II, the mean time from the most recent infarction to enrollment in the study was 6.5 years; the subgroup of patients with the most recent infarction did not benefit at all from ICD therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> This finding was in marked contrast to the outcome in patients whose infarction had occurred in the remote past, in whom the benefit from the ICD was large.\n\n【56】Although several clinical studies had indicated that the results of tests of autonomic function carry prognostic implications after myocardial infarction, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> the recently published Azimilide Post Infarct Survival Evaluation, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> which provided definitive information on the prognostic value of heart-rate variability, has demonstrated that impaired heart-rate variability is associated with increased mortality but not specifically mortality from arrhythmic causes. Nonetheless, the proportion of deaths in the DINAMIT control group that were attributable to arrhythmia was 50 percent — as high as in any previous trial of ICD therapy for secondary or primary prevention.\n\n【57】Use of amiodarone was more common in the control group than it was in the ICD group. Most likely, this difference is a reflection of physicians' desire in this unblinded study to provide additional optimal therapy in the absence of an ICD. However, as recently demonstrated in a large, randomized trial, amiodarone does not offer any survival benefit if given for primary prevention in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ventricular function. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Most likely, amiodarone had no effect on survival in our trial as well.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Whether benefit occurs in patients early after myocardial infarction is unknown.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial, a randomized, open-label comparison of ICD therapy (in 332 patients) and no ICD therapy (in 342 patients) 6 to 40 days after a myocardial infarction. We enrolled patients who had reduced left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.35 or less) and impaired cardiac autonomic function (manifested as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated average 24-hour heart rate on Holter monitoring). The primary outcome was mortality from any cause. Death from arrhythmia was a predefined secondary outcome.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】During a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 30±13 months, there was no difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups: of the 120 patients who died, 62 were in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio for death in the ICD group, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; P=0.66). There were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; P=0.009). In contrast, there were 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group and 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Prophylactic ICD therapy does not reduce overall mortality in high-risk patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Although ICD therapy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death due to arrhythmia, that was offset by an increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to prolong life in several populations of patients with serious heart disease and reduced left ventricular function. Previous trials, however, have included relatively few patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The first 6 to 12 months after myocardial infarction constitute a period during which there is a particularly high risk of death from arrhythmia, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> and pharmacologic therapies other than beta-blockers have not been shown to be effective in counteracting this risk.\n\n【12】The Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT) was designed to test whether prophylactic implantation of an ICD would reduce mortality in survivors of a recent myocardial infarction who are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Because several large studies have shown that markers of impaired autonomic function are associated with increased mortality, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> only survivors of infarction who had severe left ventricular dysfunction as well as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated 24-hour heart rate were eligible for the trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Organization of the Trial\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The DINAMIT trial was initiated by the investigators. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all 73 participating investigational sites in 12 countries worldwide. All the patients gave written informed consent before randomization. An external data and safety monitoring committee independently reviewed the results at regular intervals throughout the trial. A description of the design and study protocol has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Patient Population\n------------------\n\n【17】Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had recently had a myocardial infarction (6 to 40 days previously) and if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or less, as assessed by angiography, radionuclide scanning, or echocardiography. Patients also had to have a standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals of 70 msec or less or a mean RR interval of 750 msec or less (heart rate, 80 beats per minute or greater) over a 24-hour period, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> as assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring performed at least three days after the infarction.\n\n【18】The following exclusion criteria were applied: congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association class IV at the time of randomization; noncardiac disease that limited life expectancy; coronary artery bypass grafting performed since the qualifying infarction or planned to be performed within four weeks after randomization; three-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention performed since the qualifying infarction; name on a waiting list for a heart transplant; current, ongoing ICD therapy; prior implantation of a permanent pacemaker; requirement for an ICD (i.e., sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation more than 48 hours after the qualifying infarction); low probability that the study ICD could be implanted within seven days after randomization; and expected poor compliance with the protocol.\n\n【19】Study Design\n------------\n\n【20】Patients were stratified according to clinical center and underwent central randomization, which was performed at the study coordinating and methods center (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre, Hamilton, Ont., Canada). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to receive an ICD (the ICD group) or not to receive an ICD (the control group). The randomization sequence was stratified according to center and balanced within randomly varying blocks of two, four, or six patients.\n\n【21】The study protocol mandated that patients receive the best conventional medical therapy. Investigators were encouraged to treat all study patients with angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and lipid-lowering drugs, as appropriate. Reasons for not giving these medications were documented.\n\n【22】Patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD were required to undergo implantation of a market-approved, single-chamber ICD (St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.) within one week after randomization. Implanted leads were required to achieve an R wave of more than 4.9 mV, a pacing threshold of less than 2.1 V at 0.5 msec, and a defibrillation threshold with a safety margin of at least 10 J. Postoperatively, the ICD was set to detect ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The detection rate for tachycardia was set at 175 or more beats per minute for at least 16 beats. The device was programmed to deliver all discharges at maximal output in the ventricular-fibrillation zone (200 beats per minute or greater). Bradycardia pacing was programmed for activation at a minimum of 40 beats per minute. Antitachycardia pacing within the ventricular-tachycardia zone (175 to 200 beats per minute) could be activated to deliver four bursts of 6 to 10 beats beginning at 81 percent of the tachycardia cycle length, with 10-msec decrements between bursts.\n\n【23】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【24】Patients were followed with respect to all outcomes for a maximum of four years, beginning on the date of randomization. The study commenced in April 1998, and follow-up ended in September 2003, about 15 months after the last patient had been recruited. Follow-up visits were scheduled to take place three and six months after randomization and at six-month intervals thereafter.\n\n【25】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome in DINAMIT was death from any cause. Death due to cardiac arrhythmia was the secondary outcome. Ascertainment of the cause of death of patients in the trial was the responsibility of the local investigators. Documentation of the cause of death was based on information obtained from witnesses, family members, death certificates, hospital records, and autopsy reports, when available, but not from ICD telemetry.\n\n【27】The blinded central validation committee independently reviewed information on all deaths. Classification of each death based on the surrounding circumstances was agreed on by these reviewers. The committee classified deaths as either arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic in nature on the basis of criteria originally developed by Hinkle and Thaler 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and previously validated in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> These criteria are based on the clinical circumstances of death and do not rely on ICD information.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】Data analysis was performed at Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center by two of the authors (Mr. Roberts and Dr. Gent). All investigators had full access to the data. The primary study outcome was evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. The cumulative risks of death from any cause and from specific causes over time were estimated separately for each treatment group with use of the Kaplan–Meier procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and were compared between groups with use of the Mantel–Haenszel test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> On the basis of mortality data from similar populations of patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> it was anticipated that the control group would have a three-year mortality rate of 30.0 percent and that 40.0 percent of these deaths would be accounted for by deaths due to arrhythmia. The net effect of preventing 80.0 percent of these deaths due to arrhythmia with use of an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate to 20.4 percent — a reduction considered biologically plausible and clinically relevant. Based on a one-sided test at an alpha level of 0.05, we determined that 525 patients would be required in order for the study to have 80 percent power to identify a difference between the groups. Because mortality rates were lower than expected during the study, the target enrollment was increased to 674 patients.\n\n【30】A single interim analysis of efficacy was performed by an external safety and efficacy monitoring committee after 66 deaths — about half the anticipated number — had occurred. A one-sided P value of less than 0.001 would have resulted in early termination of the study. Before unblinding, a decision was made to use two-sided statistical testing.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】A total of 674 patients were enrolled; 332 were randomly assigned to the ICD group and 342 to the control group. Twenty of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD subsequently refused to have one implanted. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups are provided in Table 1 . Most patients had new Q-wave infarctions, and 72.1 percent were anterior in location. Two thirds of the patients had received thrombolytic therapy, had undergone acute percutaneous intervention, or both. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.28. In a subgroup of 321 patients in whom assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction was repeated six to eight weeks after randomization, there was a mean (±SD) increase of 0.02±0.11. The average time from myocardial infarction to randomization was 18 days and was similar in the two groups.\n\n【35】There was excellent adherence to optimal medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Amiodarone was prescribed to 27 of the patients who had been randomly assigned to receive an ICD (8.1 percent) and to 46 of the control patients (13.5 percent) (P=0.04). During the course of the study, percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization was performed in 33 ICD recipients (9.9 percent), as compared with 50 patients in the control group (14.6 percent) (P=0.08). Only partial follow-up was available for four patients (all members of the control group).\n\n【36】Death from Any Cause\n--------------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Any Cause, According to Study Group.\n\n【38】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.Table 2.  Table 2. Mortality Rates.\n\n【39】The cumulative-mortality curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 1 . During an average observation period of 30±13 months, 120 patients died, 62 in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; two-sided P=0.66) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The annual mortality rates were 7.5 and 6.9 percent, respectively. The adjudicated causes of death are listed in Table 2 . Two patients who had been randomly assigned to the ICD group died before they received an ICD.\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Hazard Ratios for Death from Any Cause, According to Selected Clinical Characteristics.\n\n【41】The horizontal lines represent the 95 percent confidence intervals. NYHA denotes New York Heart Association, and SD standard deviation.\n\n【42】A set of baseline clinical features was examined for potential subgroup effects 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. For each feature, the ICD effect remained consistent and did not differ significantly between or among subgroups.\n\n【43】Death from Arrhythmic and Nonarrhythmic Causes\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Arrhythmia (Panel A) and from Nonarrhythmic Causes (Panel B), According to Study Group.\n\n【45】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.\n\n【46】In the ICD group, there were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia, as compared with 29 in the control group (annual rate, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. This difference was highly statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; two-sided P=0.009). There were 50 deaths due to nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. Of the three prespecified subcategories of deaths from nonarrhythmic causes, the only one found to occur at a significantly increased rate in the ICD group was death from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes (P=0.05) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Of the 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, 39 (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature (i.e., due to cardiac, nonarrhythmic or vascular, noncardiac causes); in the control group, 23 of 29 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes (79 percent) were cardiovascular in nature.\n\n【47】Complications of ICD Therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【48】The average time between randomization and ICD implantation was 6.3±7.3 days. Of the 332 patients assigned to receive an ICD, 310 actually received a device. The time between ICD implantation and discharge from the hospital averaged 4.7±6.4 days. In-hospital device-related complications occurred in 25 patients; the most common of these complications were lead dislodgment, pneumothorax, and inappropriate shocks. There were no deaths related to device implantation. To prevent inappropriate pacing, bradycardia pacing was typically programmed to 40 to 45 beats per minute (maximum, 55 beats per minute).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this randomized trial of high-risk patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction, overall survival was not improved by prophylactic implantation of an ICD. The study groups were well balanced with respect to their baseline clinical characteristics and the early use of reperfusion therapy. There was a high rate of use of appropriate medical therapy. It is unlikely that the similarity between the two groups in the rate of death from all causes represents a false negative result due to inadequate sample size. The 95 percent confidence interval of the hazard ratio for death from any cause rules out a reduction in mortality of 25 percent or greater.\n\n【51】The ICD group, as compared with the control group, had a large, statistically significant reduction (by more than 50 percent) in the risk of death due to arrhythmia; however, this effect was offset by a significant increase, of similar magnitude, in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes. The ICD is expected to reduce mortality by preventing sudden cardiac deaths due to ventricular fibrillation without any effect on death from nonarrhythmic causes. This pattern has been consistently observed in previous trials of ICD therapy in patients at high risk. In several trials of ICD therapy — the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study, the Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators trial, and the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg — there was a 50 percent reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia and almost no effect on the rate of death from other causes; the net effect was a 25 percent reduction in overall mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial I (MADIT I) and MADIT II, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> which evaluated prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, the rate of death due to arrhythmia was markedly reduced and the rate of death from other causes was not increased.\n\n【52】In DINAMIT, the reduction in the rate of arrhythmia-related death was very similar to that observed in previous trials of ICD therapy. However, in contrast to the previous trials, DINAMIT revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes among patients assigned to receive an ICD. Most of these deaths (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature. It appears that in this trial, as in previous trials of ICD therapy, the ICD prevented death from ventricular fibrillation. However, preventing death from ventricular fibrillation did not reduce overall mortality in these patients.\n\n【53】The reason for the unexpected and unprecedented increase in mortality from causes other than arrhythmia in patients assigned to receive an ICD is not clear. The most likely explanation is that the patients “saved” from an arrhythmia-related death by ICD therapy are also at high risk for death from other cardiac causes. There was no sign of an increased rate of death in association with the surgical procedure or complications with the use of the ICD. It is unlikely that the increased rate of deaths from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes were due to excessive pacing, as in the Dual-Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> because the backup pacing was programmed at a very low rate in almost all the patients in the ICD group.\n\n【54】It has been speculated that ICDs might, by shocking ventricular fibrillation, merely transform sudden death to eventual death from pump failure, without significantly prolonging life, especially when ventricular fibrillation is occurring in a patient with end-stage heart failure or a large acute myocardial infarction. There is some evidence that such a possibility may have factored into the results of the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and it provides a reasonable hypothesis for the results of DINAMIT.\n\n【55】The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in DINAMIT was significantly reduced (at 0.28) and did not increase appreciably six weeks later. However, the mean ejection fraction was somewhat higher than that in MADIT II (0.23) 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> — a difference that may explain the higher overall mortality observed in MADIT II. The main differences between patients in DINAMIT and those in previous trials is the temporal proximity to acute infarction and the abnormal results of autonomic-function tests at baseline. In DINAMIT, the ratio of death due to arrhythmia to death from any cause was 34 percent, similar to the ratio in other ICD trials. A recent analysis of the MADIT II trial, which also enrolled patients with a previous myocardial infarction, supports the main finding of DINAMIT — that patients who have recently had an infarction do not benefit from ICD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> In MADIT II, the mean time from the most recent infarction to enrollment in the study was 6.5 years; the subgroup of patients with the most recent infarction did not benefit at all from ICD therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> This finding was in marked contrast to the outcome in patients whose infarction had occurred in the remote past, in whom the benefit from the ICD was large.\n\n【56】Although several clinical studies had indicated that the results of tests of autonomic function carry prognostic implications after myocardial infarction, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> the recently published Azimilide Post Infarct Survival Evaluation, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> which provided definitive information on the prognostic value of heart-rate variability, has demonstrated that impaired heart-rate variability is associated with increased mortality but not specifically mortality from arrhythmic causes. Nonetheless, the proportion of deaths in the DINAMIT control group that were attributable to arrhythmia was 50 percent — as high as in any previous trial of ICD therapy for secondary or primary prevention.\n\n【57】Use of amiodarone was more common in the control group than it was in the ICD group. Most likely, this difference is a reflection of physicians' desire in this unblinded study to provide additional optimal therapy in the absence of an ICD. However, as recently demonstrated in a large, randomized trial, amiodarone does not offer any survival benefit if given for primary prevention in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ventricular function. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Most likely, amiodarone had no effect on survival in our trial as well.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Whether benefit occurs in patients early after myocardial infarction is unknown.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial, a randomized, open-label comparison of ICD therapy (in 332 patients) and no ICD therapy (in 342 patients) 6 to 40 days after a myocardial infarction. We enrolled patients who had reduced left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.35 or less) and impaired cardiac autonomic function (manifested as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated average 24-hour heart rate on Holter monitoring). The primary outcome was mortality from any cause. Death from arrhythmia was a predefined secondary outcome.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】During a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 30±13 months, there was no difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups: of the 120 patients who died, 62 were in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio for death in the ICD group, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; P=0.66). There were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; P=0.009). In contrast, there were 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group and 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Prophylactic ICD therapy does not reduce overall mortality in high-risk patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Although ICD therapy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death due to arrhythmia, that was offset by an increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to prolong life in several populations of patients with serious heart disease and reduced left ventricular function. Previous trials, however, have included relatively few patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The first 6 to 12 months after myocardial infarction constitute a period during which there is a particularly high risk of death from arrhythmia, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> and pharmacologic therapies other than beta-blockers have not been shown to be effective in counteracting this risk.\n\n【12】The Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT) was designed to test whether prophylactic implantation of an ICD would reduce mortality in survivors of a recent myocardial infarction who are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Because several large studies have shown that markers of impaired autonomic function are associated with increased mortality, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> only survivors of infarction who had severe left ventricular dysfunction as well as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated 24-hour heart rate were eligible for the trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Organization of the Trial\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The DINAMIT trial was initiated by the investigators. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all 73 participating investigational sites in 12 countries worldwide. All the patients gave written informed consent before randomization. An external data and safety monitoring committee independently reviewed the results at regular intervals throughout the trial. A description of the design and study protocol has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Patient Population\n------------------\n\n【17】Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had recently had a myocardial infarction (6 to 40 days previously) and if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or less, as assessed by angiography, radionuclide scanning, or echocardiography. Patients also had to have a standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals of 70 msec or less or a mean RR interval of 750 msec or less (heart rate, 80 beats per minute or greater) over a 24-hour period, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> as assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring performed at least three days after the infarction.\n\n【18】The following exclusion criteria were applied: congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association class IV at the time of randomization; noncardiac disease that limited life expectancy; coronary artery bypass grafting performed since the qualifying infarction or planned to be performed within four weeks after randomization; three-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention performed since the qualifying infarction; name on a waiting list for a heart transplant; current, ongoing ICD therapy; prior implantation of a permanent pacemaker; requirement for an ICD (i.e., sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation more than 48 hours after the qualifying infarction); low probability that the study ICD could be implanted within seven days after randomization; and expected poor compliance with the protocol.\n\n【19】Study Design\n------------\n\n【20】Patients were stratified according to clinical center and underwent central randomization, which was performed at the study coordinating and methods center (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre, Hamilton, Ont., Canada). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to receive an ICD (the ICD group) or not to receive an ICD (the control group). The randomization sequence was stratified according to center and balanced within randomly varying blocks of two, four, or six patients.\n\n【21】The study protocol mandated that patients receive the best conventional medical therapy. Investigators were encouraged to treat all study patients with angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and lipid-lowering drugs, as appropriate. Reasons for not giving these medications were documented.\n\n【22】Patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD were required to undergo implantation of a market-approved, single-chamber ICD (St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.) within one week after randomization. Implanted leads were required to achieve an R wave of more than 4.9 mV, a pacing threshold of less than 2.1 V at 0.5 msec, and a defibrillation threshold with a safety margin of at least 10 J. Postoperatively, the ICD was set to detect ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The detection rate for tachycardia was set at 175 or more beats per minute for at least 16 beats. The device was programmed to deliver all discharges at maximal output in the ventricular-fibrillation zone (200 beats per minute or greater). Bradycardia pacing was programmed for activation at a minimum of 40 beats per minute. Antitachycardia pacing within the ventricular-tachycardia zone (175 to 200 beats per minute) could be activated to deliver four bursts of 6 to 10 beats beginning at 81 percent of the tachycardia cycle length, with 10-msec decrements between bursts.\n\n【23】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【24】Patients were followed with respect to all outcomes for a maximum of four years, beginning on the date of randomization. The study commenced in April 1998, and follow-up ended in September 2003, about 15 months after the last patient had been recruited. Follow-up visits were scheduled to take place three and six months after randomization and at six-month intervals thereafter.\n\n【25】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome in DINAMIT was death from any cause. Death due to cardiac arrhythmia was the secondary outcome. Ascertainment of the cause of death of patients in the trial was the responsibility of the local investigators. Documentation of the cause of death was based on information obtained from witnesses, family members, death certificates, hospital records, and autopsy reports, when available, but not from ICD telemetry.\n\n【27】The blinded central validation committee independently reviewed information on all deaths. Classification of each death based on the surrounding circumstances was agreed on by these reviewers. The committee classified deaths as either arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic in nature on the basis of criteria originally developed by Hinkle and Thaler 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and previously validated in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> These criteria are based on the clinical circumstances of death and do not rely on ICD information.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】Data analysis was performed at Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center by two of the authors (Mr. Roberts and Dr. Gent). All investigators had full access to the data. The primary study outcome was evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. The cumulative risks of death from any cause and from specific causes over time were estimated separately for each treatment group with use of the Kaplan–Meier procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and were compared between groups with use of the Mantel–Haenszel test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> On the basis of mortality data from similar populations of patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> it was anticipated that the control group would have a three-year mortality rate of 30.0 percent and that 40.0 percent of these deaths would be accounted for by deaths due to arrhythmia. The net effect of preventing 80.0 percent of these deaths due to arrhythmia with use of an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate to 20.4 percent — a reduction considered biologically plausible and clinically relevant. Based on a one-sided test at an alpha level of 0.05, we determined that 525 patients would be required in order for the study to have 80 percent power to identify a difference between the groups. Because mortality rates were lower than expected during the study, the target enrollment was increased to 674 patients.\n\n【30】A single interim analysis of efficacy was performed by an external safety and efficacy monitoring committee after 66 deaths — about half the anticipated number — had occurred. A one-sided P value of less than 0.001 would have resulted in early termination of the study. Before unblinding, a decision was made to use two-sided statistical testing.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】A total of 674 patients were enrolled; 332 were randomly assigned to the ICD group and 342 to the control group. Twenty of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD subsequently refused to have one implanted. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups are provided in Table 1 . Most patients had new Q-wave infarctions, and 72.1 percent were anterior in location. Two thirds of the patients had received thrombolytic therapy, had undergone acute percutaneous intervention, or both. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.28. In a subgroup of 321 patients in whom assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction was repeated six to eight weeks after randomization, there was a mean (±SD) increase of 0.02±0.11. The average time from myocardial infarction to randomization was 18 days and was similar in the two groups.\n\n【35】There was excellent adherence to optimal medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Amiodarone was prescribed to 27 of the patients who had been randomly assigned to receive an ICD (8.1 percent) and to 46 of the control patients (13.5 percent) (P=0.04). During the course of the study, percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization was performed in 33 ICD recipients (9.9 percent), as compared with 50 patients in the control group (14.6 percent) (P=0.08). Only partial follow-up was available for four patients (all members of the control group).\n\n【36】Death from Any Cause\n--------------------\n\n【37】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Any Cause, According to Study Group.\n\n【38】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.Table 2.  Table 2. Mortality Rates.\n\n【39】The cumulative-mortality curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 1 . During an average observation period of 30±13 months, 120 patients died, 62 in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; two-sided P=0.66) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The annual mortality rates were 7.5 and 6.9 percent, respectively. The adjudicated causes of death are listed in Table 2 . Two patients who had been randomly assigned to the ICD group died before they received an ICD.\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Hazard Ratios for Death from Any Cause, According to Selected Clinical Characteristics.\n\n【41】The horizontal lines represent the 95 percent confidence intervals. NYHA denotes New York Heart Association, and SD standard deviation.\n\n【42】A set of baseline clinical features was examined for potential subgroup effects 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. For each feature, the ICD effect remained consistent and did not differ significantly between or among subgroups.\n\n【43】Death from Arrhythmic and Nonarrhythmic Causes\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Arrhythmia (Panel A) and from Nonarrhythmic Causes (Panel B), According to Study Group.\n\n【45】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.\n\n【46】In the ICD group, there were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia, as compared with 29 in the control group (annual rate, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. This difference was highly statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; two-sided P=0.009). There were 50 deaths due to nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. Of the three prespecified subcategories of deaths from nonarrhythmic causes, the only one found to occur at a significantly increased rate in the ICD group was death from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes (P=0.05) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Of the 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, 39 (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature (i.e., due to cardiac, nonarrhythmic or vascular, noncardiac causes); in the control group, 23 of 29 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes (79 percent) were cardiovascular in nature.\n\n【47】Complications of ICD Therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【48】The average time between randomization and ICD implantation was 6.3±7.3 days. Of the 332 patients assigned to receive an ICD, 310 actually received a device. The time between ICD implantation and discharge from the hospital averaged 4.7±6.4 days. In-hospital device-related complications occurred in 25 patients; the most common of these complications were lead dislodgment, pneumothorax, and inappropriate shocks. There were no deaths related to device implantation. To prevent inappropriate pacing, bradycardia pacing was typically programmed to 40 to 45 beats per minute (maximum, 55 beats per minute).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this randomized trial of high-risk patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction, overall survival was not improved by prophylactic implantation of an ICD. The study groups were well balanced with respect to their baseline clinical characteristics and the early use of reperfusion therapy. There was a high rate of use of appropriate medical therapy. It is unlikely that the similarity between the two groups in the rate of death from all causes represents a false negative result due to inadequate sample size. The 95 percent confidence interval of the hazard ratio for death from any cause rules out a reduction in mortality of 25 percent or greater.\n\n【51】The ICD group, as compared with the control group, had a large, statistically significant reduction (by more than 50 percent) in the risk of death due to arrhythmia; however, this effect was offset by a significant increase, of similar magnitude, in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes. The ICD is expected to reduce mortality by preventing sudden cardiac deaths due to ventricular fibrillation without any effect on death from nonarrhythmic causes. This pattern has been consistently observed in previous trials of ICD therapy in patients at high risk. In several trials of ICD therapy — the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study, the Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators trial, and the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg — there was a 50 percent reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia and almost no effect on the rate of death from other causes; the net effect was a 25 percent reduction in overall mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial I (MADIT I) and MADIT II, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> which evaluated prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, the rate of death due to arrhythmia was markedly reduced and the rate of death from other causes was not increased.\n\n【52】In DINAMIT, the reduction in the rate of arrhythmia-related death was very similar to that observed in previous trials of ICD therapy. However, in contrast to the previous trials, DINAMIT revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes among patients assigned to receive an ICD. Most of these deaths (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature. It appears that in this trial, as in previous trials of ICD therapy, the ICD prevented death from ventricular fibrillation. However, preventing death from ventricular fibrillation did not reduce overall mortality in these patients.\n\n【53】The reason for the unexpected and unprecedented increase in mortality from causes other than arrhythmia in patients assigned to receive an ICD is not clear. The most likely explanation is that the patients “saved” from an arrhythmia-related death by ICD therapy are also at high risk for death from other cardiac causes. There was no sign of an increased rate of death in association with the surgical procedure or complications with the use of the ICD. It is unlikely that the increased rate of deaths from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes were due to excessive pacing, as in the Dual-Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> because the backup pacing was programmed at a very low rate in almost all the patients in the ICD group.\n\n【54】It has been speculated that ICDs might, by shocking ventricular fibrillation, merely transform sudden death to eventual death from pump failure, without significantly prolonging life, especially when ventricular fibrillation is occurring in a patient with end-stage heart failure or a large acute myocardial infarction. There is some evidence that such a possibility may have factored into the results of the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and it provides a reasonable hypothesis for the results of DINAMIT.\n\n【55】The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in DINAMIT was significantly reduced (at 0.28) and did not increase appreciably six weeks later. However, the mean ejection fraction was somewhat higher than that in MADIT II (0.23) 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> — a difference that may explain the higher overall mortality observed in MADIT II. The main differences between patients in DINAMIT and those in previous trials is the temporal proximity to acute infarction and the abnormal results of autonomic-function tests at baseline. In DINAMIT, the ratio of death due to arrhythmia to death from any cause was 34 percent, similar to the ratio in other ICD trials. A recent analysis of the MADIT II trial, which also enrolled patients with a previous myocardial infarction, supports the main finding of DINAMIT — that patients who have recently had an infarction do not benefit from ICD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> In MADIT II, the mean time from the most recent infarction to enrollment in the study was 6.5 years; the subgroup of patients with the most recent infarction did not benefit at all from ICD therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> This finding was in marked contrast to the outcome in patients whose infarction had occurred in the remote past, in whom the benefit from the ICD was large.\n\n【56】Although several clinical studies had indicated that the results of tests of autonomic function carry prognostic implications after myocardial infarction, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> the recently published Azimilide Post Infarct Survival Evaluation, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> which provided definitive information on the prognostic value of heart-rate variability, has demonstrated that impaired heart-rate variability is associated with increased mortality but not specifically mortality from arrhythmic causes. Nonetheless, the proportion of deaths in the DINAMIT control group that were attributable to arrhythmia was 50 percent — as high as in any previous trial of ICD therapy for secondary or primary prevention.\n\n【57】Use of amiodarone was more common in the control group than it was in the ICD group. Most likely, this difference is a reflection of physicians' desire in this unblinded study to provide additional optimal therapy in the absence of an ICD. However, as recently demonstrated in a large, randomized trial, amiodarone does not offer any survival benefit if given for primary prevention in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ventricular function. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Most likely, amiodarone had no effect on survival in our trial as well.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

Whether benefit occurs in patients early after myocardial infarction is unknown.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial, a randomized, open-label comparison of ICD therapy (in 332 patients) and no ICD therapy (in 342 patients) 6 to 40 days after a myocardial infarction. We enrolled patients who had reduced left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.35 or less) and impaired cardiac autonomic function (manifested as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated average 24-hour heart rate on Holter monitoring). The primary outcome was mortality from any cause. Death from arrhythmia was a predefined secondary outcome.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】During a mean (±SD) follow-up period of 30±13 months, there was no difference in overall mortality between the two treatment groups: of the 120 patients who died, 62 were in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio for death in the ICD group, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; P=0.66). There were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; P=0.009). In contrast, there were 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group and 29 in the control group (hazard ratio in the ICD group, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Prophylactic ICD therapy does not reduce overall mortality in high-risk patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Although ICD therapy was associated with a reduction in the rate of death due to arrhythmia, that was offset by an increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to prolong life in several populations of patients with serious heart disease and reduced left ventricular function. Previous trials, however, have included relatively few patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The first 6 to 12 months after myocardial infarction constitute a period during which there is a particularly high risk of death from arrhythmia, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> and pharmacologic therapies other than beta-blockers have not been shown to be effective in counteracting this risk.\n\n【12】The Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT) was designed to test whether prophylactic implantation of an ICD would reduce mortality in survivors of a recent myocardial infarction who are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Because several large studies have shown that markers of impaired autonomic function are associated with increased mortality, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> only survivors of infarction who had severe left ventricular dysfunction as well as depressed heart-rate variability or an elevated 24-hour heart rate were eligible for the trial.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Organization of the Trial\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The DINAMIT trial was initiated by the investigators. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of all 73 participating investigational sites in 12 countries worldwide. All the patients gave written informed consent before randomization. An external data and safety monitoring committee independently reviewed the results at regular intervals throughout the trial. A description of the design and study protocol has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Patient Population\n------------------\n\n【17】Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had recently had a myocardial infarction (6 to 40 days previously) and if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.35 or less, as assessed by angiography, radionuclide scanning, or echocardiography. Patients also had to have a standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals of 70 msec or less or a mean RR interval of 750 msec or less (heart rate, 80 beats per minute or greater) over a 24-hour period, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> as assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring performed at least three days after the infarction.\n\n【18】The following exclusion criteria were applied: congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association class IV at the time of randomization; noncardiac disease that limited life expectancy; coronary artery bypass grafting performed since the qualifying infarction or planned to be performed within four weeks after randomization; three-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention performed since the qualifying infarction; name on a waiting list for a heart transplant; current, ongoing ICD therapy; prior implantation of a permanent pacemaker; requirement for an ICD (i.e., sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation more than 48 hours after the qualifying infarction); low probability that the study ICD could be implanted within seven days after randomization; and expected poor compliance with the protocol.\n\n【19】Study Design\n------------\n\n【20】Patients were stratified according to clinical center and underwent central randomization, which was performed at the study coordinating and methods center (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Centre, Hamilton, Ont., Canada). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to receive an ICD (the ICD group) or not to receive an ICD (the control group). The randomization sequence was stratified according to center and balanced within randomly varying blocks of two, four, or six patients.\n\n【21】The study protocol mandated that patients receive the best conventional medical therapy. Investigators were encouraged to treat all study patients with angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and lipid-lowering drugs, as appropriate. Reasons for not giving these medications were documented.\n\n【22】Patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD were required to undergo implantation of a market-approved, single-chamber ICD (St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.) within one week after randomization. Implanted leads were required to achieve an R wave of more than 4.9 mV, a pacing threshold of less than 2.1 V at 0.5 msec, and a defibrillation threshold with a safety margin of at least 10 J. Postoperatively, the ICD was set to detect ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The detection rate for tachycardia was set at 175 or more beats per minute for at least 16 beats. The device was programmed to deliver all discharges at maximal output in the ventricular-fibrillation zone (200 beats per minute or greater). Bradycardia pacing was programmed for activation at a minimum of 40 beats per minute. Antitachycardia pacing within the ventricular-tachycardia zone (175 to 200 beats per minute) could be activated to deliver four bursts of 6 to 10 beats beginning at 81 percent of the tachycardia cycle length, with 10-msec decrements between bursts.\n\n【23】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【24】Patients were followed with respect to all outcomes for a maximum of four years, beginning on the date of randomization. The study commenced in April 1998, and follow-up ended in September 2003, about 15 months after the last patient had been recruited. Follow-up visits were scheduled to take place three and six months after randomization and at six-month intervals thereafter.\n\n【25】Study Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome in DINAMIT was death from any cause. Death due to cardiac arrhythmia was the secondary outcome. Ascertainment of the cause of death of patients in the trial was the responsibility of the local investigators. Documentation of the cause of death was based on information obtained from witnesses, family members, death certificates, hospital records, and autopsy reports, when available, but not from ICD telemetry.\n\n【27】The blinded central validation committee independently reviewed information on all deaths. Classification of each death based on the surrounding circumstances was agreed on by these reviewers. The committee classified deaths as either arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic in nature on the basis of criteria originally developed by Hinkle and Thaler 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and previously validated in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> and the Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> These criteria are based on the clinical circumstances of death and do not rely on ICD information.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】Data analysis was performed at Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center by two of the authors (Mr. Roberts and Dr. Gent). All investigators had full access to the data. The primary study outcome was evaluated according to the intention-to-treat principle. The cumulative risks of death from any cause and from specific causes over time were estimated separately for each treatment group with use of the Kaplan–Meier procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and were compared between groups with use of the Mantel–Haenszel test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> On the basis of mortality data from similar populations of patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> it was anticipated that the control group would have a three-year mortality rate of 30.0 percent and that 40.0 percent of these deaths would be accounted for by deaths due to arrhythmia. The net effect of preventing 80.0 percent of these deaths due to arrhythmia with use of an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate to 20.4 percent — a reduction considered biologically plausible and clinically relevant. Based on a one-sided test at an alpha level of 0.05, we determined that 525 patients would be required in order for the study to have 80 percent power to identify a difference between the groups. Because mortality rates were lower than expected during the study, the target enrollment was increased to 674 patients.\n\n【30】A single interim analysis of efficacy was performed by an external safety and efficacy monitoring committee after 66 deaths — about half the anticipated number — had occurred. A one-sided P value of less than 0.001 would have resulted in early termination of the study. Before unblinding, a decision was made to use two-sided statistical testing.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】A total of 674 patients were enrolled; 332 were randomly assigned to the ICD group and 342 to the control group. Twenty of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive an ICD subsequently refused to have one implanted. The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups are provided in Table 1 . Most patients had new Q-wave infarctions, and 72.1 percent were anterior in location. Two thirds of the patients had received thrombolytic therapy, had undergone acute percutaneous intervention, or both. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.28. In a subgroup of 321 patients in whom assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction was repeated six to eight weeks after randomization, there was a mean (±SD) increase of 0.02±0.11. The average time from myocardial infarction to randomization was 18 days and was similar in the two groups.\n\n【35】There was excellent adherence to optimal medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Amiodarone was prescribed to 27 of the patients who had been randomly assigned to receive an ICD (8.1 percent) and to 46 of the control patients (13.5 percent) (P=0.04). During the course of the study, percutaneous or surgical coronary revascularization was performed in 33 ICD recipients (9.9 percent), as compared with 50 patients in the control group (14.6 percent) (P=0.08). Only partial follow-up was available for four patients (all members of the control group).\n\n【36】Death from Any Cause\n--------------------\n\n【37】<mark>Figure 1.

Mortality Rates.\n\n【39】The cumulative-mortality curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 1 . During an average observation period of 30±13 months, 120 patients died, 62 in the ICD group and 58 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.55; two-sided P=0.66) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The annual mortality rates were 7.5 and 6.9 percent, respectively. The adjudicated causes of death are listed in Table 2 . Two patients who had been randomly assigned to the ICD group died before they received an ICD.\n\n【40】<mark>Figure 2.

NYHA denotes New York Heart Association, and SD standard deviation.\n\n【42】A set of baseline clinical features was examined for potential subgroup effects 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. For each feature, the ICD effect remained consistent and did not differ significantly between or among subgroups.\n\n【43】Death from Arrhythmic and Nonarrhythmic Causes\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Risk of Death from Arrhythmia (Panel A) and from Nonarrhythmic Causes (Panel B), According to Study Group.\n\n【45】ICD denotes implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.\n\n【46】In the ICD group, there were 12 deaths due to arrhythmia, as compared with 29 in the control group (annual rate, 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. This difference was highly statistically significant (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.83; two-sided P=0.009). There were 50 deaths due to nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, as compared with 29 in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.76; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. Of the three prespecified subcategories of deaths from nonarrhythmic causes, the only one found to occur at a significantly increased rate in the ICD group was death from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes (P=0.05) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Of the 50 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes in the ICD group, 39 (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature (i.e., due to cardiac, nonarrhythmic or vascular, noncardiac causes); in the control group, 23 of 29 deaths from nonarrhythmic causes (79 percent) were cardiovascular in nature.\n\n【47】Complications of ICD Therapy\n----------------------------\n\n【48】The average time between randomization and ICD implantation was 6.3±7.3 days. Of the 332 patients assigned to receive an ICD, 310 actually received a device. The time between ICD implantation and discharge from the hospital averaged 4.7±6.4 days. In-hospital device-related complications occurred in 25 patients; the most common of these complications were lead dislodgment, pneumothorax, and inappropriate shocks. There were no deaths related to device implantation. To prevent inappropriate pacing, bradycardia pacing was typically programmed to 40 to 45 beats per minute (maximum, 55 beats per minute).\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this randomized trial of high-risk patients who had recently had a myocardial infarction, overall survival was not improved by prophylactic implantation of an ICD. The study groups were well balanced with respect to their baseline clinical characteristics and the early use of reperfusion therapy. There was a high rate of use of appropriate medical therapy. It is unlikely that the similarity between the two groups in the rate of death from all causes represents a false negative result due to inadequate sample size. The 95 percent confidence interval of the hazard ratio for death from any cause rules out a reduction in mortality of 25 percent or greater.\n\n【51】The ICD group, as compared with the control group, had a large, statistically significant reduction (by more than 50 percent) in the risk of death due to arrhythmia; however, this effect was offset by a significant increase, of similar magnitude, in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes. The ICD is expected to reduce mortality by preventing sudden cardiac deaths due to ventricular fibrillation without any effect on death from nonarrhythmic causes. This pattern has been consistently observed in previous trials of ICD therapy in patients at high risk. In several trials of ICD therapy — the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study, the Antiarrhythmics versus Implantable Defibrillators trial, and the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg — there was a 50 percent reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia and almost no effect on the rate of death from other causes; the net effect was a 25 percent reduction in overall mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial I (MADIT I) and MADIT II, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> which evaluated prophylactic ICD therapy in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, the rate of death due to arrhythmia was markedly reduced and the rate of death from other causes was not increased.\n\n【52】In DINAMIT, the reduction in the rate of arrhythmia-related death was very similar to that observed in previous trials of ICD therapy. However, in contrast to the previous trials, DINAMIT revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of death from nonarrhythmic causes among patients assigned to receive an ICD. Most of these deaths (78 percent) were cardiovascular in nature. It appears that in this trial, as in previous trials of ICD therapy, the ICD prevented death from ventricular fibrillation. However, preventing death from ventricular fibrillation did not reduce overall mortality in these patients.\n\n【53】The reason for the unexpected and unprecedented increase in mortality from causes other than arrhythmia in patients assigned to receive an ICD is not clear. The most likely explanation is that the patients “saved” from an arrhythmia-related death by ICD therapy are also at high risk for death from other cardiac causes. There was no sign of an increased rate of death in association with the surgical procedure or complications with the use of the ICD. It is unlikely that the increased rate of deaths from cardiac, nonarrhythmic causes were due to excessive pacing, as in the Dual-Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> because the backup pacing was programmed at a very low rate in almost all the patients in the ICD group.\n\n【54】It has been speculated that ICDs might, by shocking ventricular fibrillation, merely transform sudden death to eventual death from pump failure, without significantly prolonging life, especially when ventricular fibrillation is occurring in a patient with end-stage heart failure or a large acute myocardial infarction. There is some evidence that such a possibility may have factored into the results of the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch Trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and it provides a reasonable hypothesis for the results of DINAMIT.\n\n【55】The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in DINAMIT was significantly reduced (at 0.28) and did not increase appreciably six weeks later. However, the mean ejection fraction was somewhat higher than that in MADIT II (0.23) 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> — a difference that may explain the higher overall mortality observed in MADIT II. The main differences between patients in DINAMIT and those in previous trials is the temporal proximity to acute infarction and the abnormal results of autonomic-function tests at baseline. In DINAMIT, the ratio of death due to arrhythmia to death from any cause was 34 percent, similar to the ratio in other ICD trials. A recent analysis of the MADIT II trial, which also enrolled patients with a previous myocardial infarction, supports the main finding of DINAMIT — that patients who have recently had an infarction do not benefit from ICD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> In MADIT II, the mean time from the most recent infarction to enrollment in the study was 6.5 years; the subgroup of patients with the most recent infarction did not benefit at all from ICD therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> This finding was in marked contrast to the outcome in patients whose infarction had occurred in the remote past, in whom the benefit from the ICD was large.\n\n【56】Although several clinical studies had indicated that the results of tests of autonomic function carry prognostic implications after myocardial infarction, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-11 </a></sup></u> the recently published Azimilide Post Infarct Survival Evaluation, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> which provided definitive information on the prognostic value of heart-rate variability, has demonstrated that impaired heart-rate variability is associated with increased mortality but not specifically mortality from arrhythmic causes. Nonetheless, the proportion of deaths in the DINAMIT control group that were attributable to arrhythmia was 50 percent — as high as in any previous trial of ICD therapy for secondary or primary prevention.\n\n【57】Use of amiodarone was more common in the control group than it was in the ICD group. Most likely, this difference is a reflection of physicians' desire in this unblinded study to provide additional optimal therapy in the absence of an ICD. However, as recently demonstrated in a large, randomized trial, amiodarone does not offer any survival benefit if given for primary prevention in patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ventricular function. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Most likely, amiodarone had no effect on survival in our trial as well.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from St. Jude Medical, Sunnyvale, Calif.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

In 50 patients with 51 courses of therapy adherent to the protocol, 27 courses were with amphotericin B and 24 with the combination. Even though the combination regimen was given for only six weeks and amphotericin B for 10 weeks, the combination cured or improved more patients (16 vs. 11), produced fewer failures or relapses (three vs. 11), more rapid sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid (P<0.001) and less nephrotoxicity (P<0.05) than did amphotericin B alone. The number of deaths was the same (five) with each regimen. Adverse reactions to flucytosine occurred in 11 of 34 patients but were not life threatening. We conclude that combined flucytosine-amphoericin B therapy is the regimen of choice in cryptococcal meningitis. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 301:126–131, 1979)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 18:19:29", "endTime": "2024/08/12 18:21:54", "cost": 144.266}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:21", "update_time": "2024-08-12 02:21:55", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 02:19:22"}

This polypeptide, which appears identical to interleukin-1, is released by leukocytes and signals the onset of fever in the hypothalamus.\n\n【2】In muscles incubated at 37°C, leukocytic pyrogen stimulated net protein degradation by 62 to 118 per cent (P<0.001 ). Proteolysis increased, but rates of muscle-protein synthesis did not change. The pyrogen also dramatically stimulated muscle synthesis of prostaglandin E <sub>2 </sub> , which promotes protein breakdown in this tissue. Addition of indomethacin with leukocytic pyrogen prevented prostaglandin E <sub>2 </sub> synthesis and abolished the increase in proteolysis. The acceleration of protein breakdown induced by pyrogen was also blocked by Ep-475, an inhibitor of lysosomal thiol proteases. When muscles were incubated at 39°C to mimic fever, protein breakdown increased, but addition of leukocytic pyrogen caused a further marked increase in proteolysis and prostaglandin E <sub>2 </sub> production.\n\n【3】Thus, human leukocytic pyrogen can act on skeletal muscle to stimulate intralysosomal proteolysis by increasing the production of prostaglandin E <sub>2 </sub> . These findings suggest that cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of negative nitrogen balance in fever. In addition, the release of prostaglandin E <sub>2 </sub> induced by leukocytic pyrogen may account for the myalgia that accompanies fever. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med. 1983; 308:553–8.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 17:33:01", "endTime": "2024/08/12 17:33:14", "cost": 13.909}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:21", "update_time": "2024-08-12 01:33:16", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 01:33:02"}

We investigated whether this advantage is sustained beyond the perioperative period.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing open repair with endovascular repair in 351 patients who had received a diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm of at least 5 cm in diameter and who were considered suitable candidates for both techniques. Survival after randomization was calculated with the use of Kaplan–Meier analysis and compared with the use of the log-rank test on an intention-to-treat-basis.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Two years after randomization, the cumulative survival rates were 89.6 percent for open repair and 89.7 percent for endovascular repair (difference, –0.1 percentage point; 95 percent confidence interval, –6.8 to 6.7 percentage points). The cumulative rates of aneurysm-related death were 5.7 percent for open repair and 2.1 percent for endovascular repair (difference, 3.7 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval, –0.5 to 7.9 percentage points). This advantage of endovascular repair over open repair was entirely accounted for by events occurring in the perioperative period, with no significant difference in subsequent aneurysm-related mortality. The rate of survival free of moderate or severe complications was also similar in the two groups at two years (at 65.9 percent for open repair and 65.6 percent for endovascular repair; difference, 0.3 percentage point; 95 percent confidence interval, –10.0 to 10.6 percentage points).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The perioperative survival advantage with endovascular repair as compared with open repair is not sustained after the first postoperative year.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Two randomized trials have demonstrated better outcomes with elective endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms than with conventional open repair in the first month after the procedure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The reported in-hospital mortality rates in these two trials were 4.6 percent and 6.0 percent for open repair and 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent for endovascular repair, respectively. Although the relevance of a reduction in perioperative risk should not be underestimated from the patient's perspective, the improvement in early survival with the use of a less invasive technique is not surprising. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Consequently, both reports stressed the need for longer-term data before a decision could be reached about which therapy is better in patients who are suitable candidates for either procedure.\n\n【12】Findings in uncontrolled long-term studies of endovascular aneurysm repair have suggested that the early advantage of endovascular over open repair may not persist over time. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Endovascular repair appeared to be associated with higher rates of reintervention and complications as well as a continued risk of aneurysm rupture. The Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm Management (DREAM) trial was conducted to assess the rates of death from any cause and complications in a multicenter, randomized trial comparing elective open and endovascular aneurysm repair.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Patients\n-------------------------\n\n【15】The design and methods of the trial have been described in detail elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,6 </a></sup></u> In brief, patients referred to surgery clinics at 26 centers in the Netherlands and 4 centers in Belgium who had received a diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm of at least 5 cm in diameter and who were considered suitable candidates for both techniques were randomly assigned to undergo open or endovascular repair after giving written informed consent. Randomization was carried out centrally with the use of a computer-generated permuted-block sequence and stratified according to study center in blocks of four patients.\n\n【16】The study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved the protocol. The corresponding author assumed full responsibility for the conduct of the trial, had full access to all the data, and controlled the decision to publish. The study was publicly funded, and the sponsor had no role in the study design.\n\n【17】Data Collection and Follow-up\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】All data were submitted to the trial-coordination center (Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands). Follow-up visits were scheduled 30 days and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the procedure. Before hospital discharge and at each follow-up visit, all patients underwent a physical examination, which included calculation of the ankle–brachial blood-pressure index; abdominal helical computed tomographic angiography; and abdominal color duplex ultrasonography. In addition, patients in the endovascular group underwent plain abdominal radiography before hospital discharge and 12 and 24 months postoperatively.\n\n【19】Data acquisition was stopped on March 1, 2005, for this report. For all analyses, data on patients were censored after their last follow-up visit. For the crude survival analysis, however, reports on vital status obtained at any time before the cutoff date were also incorporated.\n\n【20】End Points\n----------\n\n【21】The primary end point of the trial was a composite of operative mortality and moderate or severe complications, as discussed in the initial report on the results of the trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Mortality and complications at two years were predetermined secondary end points in the original trial design. The outcome events that we analyzed were deaths from all causes, aneurysm-related deaths, complications, and reinterventions.\n\n【22】The cause and exact date of death were determined by assessment of death certificates and by contacting the physicians involved (surgeons and general practitioners) and patients' relatives if necessary. Aneurysm-related death was defined as death resulting from aneurysm rupture, graft infection, or thrombosis; any death occurring within 30 days after the original procedure or a reintervention; or any death occurring more than 30 days after the original procedure or a reintervention but during the same admission.\n\n【23】Complications were classified and graded according to the reporting standards of the Ad Hoc Committee for Standardized Reporting Practices in Vascular Surgery of the Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Three severity grades (mild, moderate, and severe) were distinguished. Mild complications were not considered in this analysis. A reintervention was defined as any surgical or endovascular procedure performed after the primary aneurysm-repair procedure and related to the aneurysm or the primary procedure, including incisional hernia repairs but exclusive of procedures involving superficial wound complications. An outcome adjudication committee, consisting of five vascular surgeons, assessed the type and severity of each complication and reintervention in a blinded fashion and independently from each other. Disagreements were resolved in a plenary consensus meeting.\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】All data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to analyze survival and other end points, and differences between groups were compared with the use of the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios for the analysis of reintervention rates. Means (±SD) were used to describe continuous variables. Differences between groups were compared with the use of the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for proportions. All reported P values are two-sided and are not adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】Characteristics of the Patients and Treatment Assignments\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Between November 2000 and December 2003, 178 patients were randomly assigned to undergo open repair and 173 to undergo endovascular repair. Six patients did not undergo aneurysm repair after randomization: four declined treatment (three assigned to open repair and one to endovascular repair), one died from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm before undergoing open repair, and one died from pneumonia before undergoing endovascular repair. There were six crossovers: five patients who were randomly assigned to undergo open repair underwent endovascular repair, and one patient assigned to endovascular repair underwent open repair. Overall, the operation was started according to the randomized assignment in 96.6 percent of patients (339 of 351).\n\n【29】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【30】The baseline characteristics of the patients are given in Table 1 . Demographic characteristics, the prevalence of coexisting conditions, cardiovascular-risk profiles, the distribution of American Society of Anesthesiologists risk classes, and medication use were similar in the two groups.\n\n【31】The median interval between randomization and the procedure was 39 days in both the open-repair group (range, 4 to 260) and the endovascular-repair group (range, 1 to 183; P=0.76); 92.6 percent of patients (325 of 351) underwent aneurysm repair within 3 months after randomization. The mean duration of follow-up was 21 months in the open-repair group (range, 0 to 39) and 22 months in the endovascular-repair group (range, 1 to 42). A total of 6 patients were lost to follow-up during the first year (follow-up 98.3 percent complete) and 19 during the first two years (follow-up 94.6 percent complete).\n\n【32】Mortality\n---------\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival among Patients Assigned to Undergo Open or Endovascular Aneurysm Repair.\n\n【34】Two years after randomization, the cumulative survival rates were 89.6 percent for open repair and 89.7 percent for endovascular repair, for a difference of –0.1 percentage point (95 percent confidence interval, –6.8 to 6.7 percentage points; P=0.86) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The small but apparent survival advantage in the first year after endovascular repair did not reach statistical significance (P=0.15) and appeared to be based entirely on a decreased rate of in-hospital (perioperative) mortality.\n\n【35】Table 2.  Table 2. Causes of Death after Open and Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.\n\n【36】There was one preoperative death and eight in-hospital deaths in the open-repair group and one preoperative and two in-hospital deaths in the endovascular-repair group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Taking into account the patients who declined treatment (three in the open-repair group and one in the endovascular-repair group), there were 166 discharges after open repair and 169 discharges after endovascular repair. The causes of death are listed in Table 2 . After discharge, there were more deaths from cardiovascular causes in the endovascular-repair group than in the open-repair group (six vs. three), although this difference was not significant (P=0.50).\n\n【37】There was an unexplained cluster of deaths in the endovascular-repair group approximately one year after randomization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. None of these deaths were considered to be aneurysm-related as defined in the Methods section; two of the deaths were due to heart failure, one to acute cardiac arrest, one to stroke, and one to aspiration pneumonia in a patient with metastatic carcinoma of the bladder.\n\n【38】Aneurysm-Related Mortality\n--------------------------\n\n【39】The cumulative rates of aneurysm-related death two years after randomization were 5.7 percent in the open-repair group and 2.1 percent in the endovascular-repair group, for a difference of 3.7 percentage points (95 percent confidence interval, –0.5 to 7.9 percentage points; P=0.05). The difference in aneurysm-related mortality at two years was based entirely on the difference in in-hospital (perioperative) mortality. After discharge, only one additional aneurysm-related death occurred in each group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Complications\n-------------\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival Free of Severe Events among Patients Assigned to Undergo Open or Endovascular Aneurysm Repair.\n\n【42】Two years after randomization, the rates of survival free of severe events were 80.6 percent for open repair and 83.1 percent for endovascular repair, for a difference of –2.5 percentage points (95 percent confidence interval, –10.9 to 5.9 percentage points; P=0.39) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. As with the data on aneurysm-related mortality, the difference in the rate of survival free from severe events at two years was based entirely on the difference in in-hospital events. The rates of survival free of moderate or severe events two years after randomization were 65.9 percent for open repair and 65.6 percent for endovascular repair, for a difference of 0.3 percentage point (95 percent confidence interval, –10.0 to 10.6 percentage points; P=0.88).\n\n【43】There were no documented postoperative aneurysm ruptures. However, in two patients who died after endovascular repair, the possibility of aneurysm rupture was considered but not proved 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【44】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Freedom from Reintervention among Patients Assigned to Undergo Open or Endovascular Aneurysm Repair.\n\n【45】Kaplan–Meier estimates of the likelihood of freedom from reintervention are shown in Figure 3 . In the first nine months after randomization, the rate of reintervention after endovascular repair was almost three times the rate after open repair (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.2; P=0.03). Thereafter, reintervention rates were roughly parallel (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 9.3; P=0.95).\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】We found that by the end of the first year after randomization, the previously reported perioperative survival advantage of endovascular aneurysm repair over open repair was no longer apparent. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Although a lower rate of aneurysm-related death after endovascular repair did appear to be maintained during the first two years, in terms of overall survival, this was cancelled out by excess mortality from other causes, including cardiovascular causes, in the first two years after discharge.\n\n【48】One other randomized trial, the Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR-1) trial, has compared the results of endovascular aneurysm repair with those of open repair. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Whereas the early results of the two trials were similar, the long-term results of EVAR-1 are not yet available and thus cannot be compared with our findings.\n\n【49】Our results are similar to those of two recently reported retrospective, controlled studies comparing endovascular and open repair. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> In both studies, the respective one-year survival rates after open and endovascular repair were approximately 92 and 95 percent, and the respective two-year survival rates were approximately 88 and 89 percent, all of which are very close to our findings. The rates of aneurysm-related death two years after open and endovascular repair were 4.2 and 0.9 percent, respectively, in the study by Cao et al., 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> as compared with 5.7 and 2.1 percent, respectively, in our study. It is possible that the prospective nature of our study allowed for more complete detection of aneurysm-related deaths. The difference in reintervention rates between the groups in our study is also similar to that reported in both retrospective studies. In one study, the divergence of reintervention rates did not start until after two years of follow-up, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> whereas in our study, there was no significant difference in reintervention rates beyond nine months after randomization. This variation may depend on how aggressively certain complications are addressed.\n\n【50】Although our findings — and those in the other trials discussed above — suggest that endovascular aneurysm repair may provide an early survival advantage over conventional surgery, it appears that this advantage is lost by the end of the first year. It is unknown whether the durability of the endovascular graft will jeopardize long-term outcomes. Although nonrandomized, follow-up studies of patients who have undergone aneurysm repair have failed to show a long-term advantage of open over endovascular repair, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> concerns persist, since the rates of aneurysm-related death and reintervention after endovascular repair have been reported to continue to increase over time. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,11 </a></sup></u> The overall survival curves in our trial appeared to converge in the second year after randomization. Our 2-year data do not exclude the possibility that these curves will actually cross, resulting in a higher rate of death for endovascular repair than for open repair after 24 months.\n\n【51】There may be two possible explanations for the convergence of survival curves in our study. One is that patients who have survived the stress of open repair may be somewhat less likely to die in the first few months after surgery than patients who have undergone endovascular repair, since the latter group has not been subjected to a conventional surgical procedure. In other words, the survival advantage resulting from a less-invasive approach to aneurysm repair may largely be based on postponing death among higher-risk patients from the perioperative period to the subsequent months. Although patients in our trial had to be eligible to undergo conventional open aneurysm repair before they could undergo randomization, the health of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms is often seriously compromised by other types of cardiovascular disease. In our study, 58 percent of the deaths (22 of 38) were due to either cardiovascular causes or causes related to aneurysm repair. This finding is in accordance with those of other follow-up studies of aneurysm repair. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】Another possible explanation for the convergence of survival curves is the failure of endovascular repair to prevent rupture of the aneurysm. However, endograft failure is unlikely to occur during the first two years after implantation, and such failure would be reflected by a convergence of the rates of aneurysm-related death — an effect that was not found in our analysis. Although a grouping of deaths was seen in the endovascular-repair group about one year after randomization, the causes of death were not related to the aneurysm. Furthermore, the apparent grouping of these deaths was seen in a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis that measured the time from randomization, rather than the time from the procedure, indicating that this grouping of deaths was not related to the course after intervention. Only one patient in the endovascular-repair group died of an aneurysm-related cause (an infected endograft) after hospital discharge. Whether the rate of graft failure will increase with further follow-up remains to be seen.\n\n【53】In patients undergoing endovascular repair, efforts should be made to maintain the survival advantage associated with avoiding conventional surgery. This effort may at least in part be a matter of strict risk-factor management. Beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, and statins were each being used in less than 50 percent of our patients at baseline. Clearly, less-than-optimal medication was used in view of current guidelines on risk management for patients with manifestations of atherosclerosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14-16 </a></sup></u> Of course, better perioperative and postoperative management of risk factors could also improve the results of open aneurysm repair.\n\n【54】In conclusion, the two-year results of the DREAM trial indicate that the perioperative survival advantage with endovascular repair as compared with open repair is limited to the first postoperative year.\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (OG 98-068) from the Netherlands National Health Insurance Council.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Buth reports having received lecture fees from Medtronic; Dr. Verhagen, consulting fees from W.L.

Success of the transplantation did not prevent progression of retinopathy across the range of retinopathy studied. Progressive retinopathy was observed more commonly in patients with low retinopathy scores (nonproliferative or mild proliferative retinopathy) at base line in both the study group (13 of 17 eyes, or 76 percent) and the control group (7 of 12 eyes, or 58 percent). Further analysis suggested the possibility that after three years of euglycemia, the study group had less deterioration than the control group, particularly in eyes with advanced retinopathy.

Large gatherings were prohibited, most schools and nonessential businesses were closed, and people were asked to stay at home or shelter in place. But as many parts of the United States see a slow decrease in Covid-19 cases, restrictions are gradually being lifted, particularly as the pandemic’s devastating economic and social consequences mount. Although decisions to gradually reopen societies are ultimately based on a complex calculus of political, economic, and public health considerations, it’s clear that there is a high unmet need for better estimates of communities’ burden of Covid-19 to guide such decision making. Fortunately, some mobile symptom-surveillance tools can be used for predictive modeling to address this critical priority.\n\n【3】To date, most projections of the Covid-19 burden have been based on incidence calculated from Covid-19 testing, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, such estimates are severely limited. First, such data are not uniformly collected on a national scale and rely on a patchwork of variable efforts by regional and local public health authorities. There are also substantial delays in reporting and aggregating data and stark discrepancies in how cases and deaths are counted.\n\n【4】Second, despite advances in diagnostics, the availability of testing for infection continues to be limited. This limitation leads to wide variation in the severity of symptoms and the underlying risk profiles used to qualify people for testing in different states and localities. Thus, confirmed incidence based only on Covid-19–positive tests may depend on these factors rather than reflecting true underlying prevalence in a population.\n\n【5】Third, hospitalizations and death rates largely capture more severe cases of Covid-19. Increasing quantities of data are highlighting the importance of identifying asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic persons who may not seek medical care, since they may account for a significant proportion of community spread. Finally, although antibody-based testing is receiving increasing attention, we don’t yet know how reliable, accurate, or widely available such assays will be, nor what implications the results will have, including whether positive results will indicate immunity to reinfection.\n\n【6】To address this knowledge gap, new and cost-efficient participatory syndromic-surveillance tools have been developed that can be used in real time to rapidly address critical near-term needs. These tools work by capturing data on reported symptoms using mobile technology such as phone apps or Internet-based questionnaires, which often provide more timely signals of infectious disease transmission than more traditional sources. For example, we have launched a Covid Symptom Study app ( http://covid.joinzoe.com . opens in new tab ), developed by Zoe Global with scientific input from Massachusetts General Hospital and King’s College London, that has been used by nearly 3.5 million people in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden; it collects daily information about whether people feel well, and if not, about their symptoms and whether they have been tested for Covid-19. This tool has also been configured to collect additional data on risk factors for and outcomes of Covid-19 that can be used for real-time epidemiologic studies, especially when embedded within existing population-based cohort studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】At Boston Children’s Hospital, we have adapted a Web- and text-message–based syndromic surveillance tool, FluNearYou ( http://flunearyou.org . opens in new tab ), 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> designed to assess patterns of influenza incidence, into a tool for Covid-19 known as CovidNearYou 删除7:<u>( www.covidnearyou.org . opens in new tab )</u>. This platform, which has now captured more than a million reports, is providing insights into Covid-19 symptomology and key demographic risk factors. Syndromic data have been collected by others with the use of fitness trackers, continuous wearable devices, and smart thermometers, all validated to provide early insight into respiratory illness in the community. With each of these tools, symptom data can be used to model population incidence of Covid-19 in the absence of widespread population testing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Since varied but complementary information is collected with the range of available tools, integrating their output could lead to more robust models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】In the early phases of the pandemic, these estimates were used for real-time assessment of viral spread, including identification of new “hot spots” or regions at high risk for a heavy Covid-19 burden. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Many of these tools also entail direct engagement with participants, providing opportunities for real-time communication of study results for public health messaging.\n\n【9】Although syndromic surveillance data play a role in deploying resources to meet surges in health care demand, they may be even more critical for guiding decision making regarding reopening economies and loosening stay-at-home orders. For example, the current White House strategy calls for dependence on data regarding influenza-like and Covid-like illness as part of the gating criteria for easing social distancing guidelines. These data, however, currently rely only on emergency department utilization, which may represent an underestimate, given the documented avoidance of in-person medical care and the explosion of telemedicine visits. Thus, symptom information is vital to providing an earlier window into our progress against viral spread and can be used to complement traditional measures of the pandemic’s severity.\n\n【10】Electronically collected symptom data will be particularly important as a readily adaptable tool that can be applied widely in various populations as states move at variable paces to lift restrictions. Data based on symptom burden have the advantages of avoiding confounding by differences in testing availability and being flexible and sensitive to detecting changes in response to public health recommendations and government mandates.\n\n【11】Nonetheless, crowd-sourced data from mobile apps have limitations. The population providing the information will not perfectly reflect the broader population. Although more than 80% of the U.S. population uses smartphones, there remain many important subgroups, such as older adults and socioeconomically disadvantaged people, whose lack of access to technology will be a barrier to participation. Through the Covid Symptom Study app, we have specifically sought to enhance representation from racial and ethnic groups that are more vulnerable to Covid-19 by recruiting participants within ongoing studies such as the Black Women’s Health Study and the Multiethnic Cohort Study and by launching a Spanish-language app. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In addition, as with any study that relies on voluntary contribution of data, people’s differential willingness to participate may reflect differences in underlying health-seeking behavior and anxiety regarding symptoms.\n\n【12】Moreover, several syndrome-surveillance platforms are already in use, which may lead to consumer confusion; it is thus important for data collectors to collaborate and standardize their platforms through such initiatives as the International Workshop on Participatory Surveillance. Efforts to aggregate data should, however, recognize the potential for compounding limitations related to representativeness unless platforms are specifically adapted to reach different segments of the population.\n\n【13】Finally, the use of any platform that captures health information must balance concerns regarding privacy and data sharing. Tools based on syndromic surveillance do not require identifying information that can be shared with insurers or public health authorities — a key feature distinguishing them from so-called contact-tracing apps, from which information about Covid-19 testing may be shared publicly, albeit in an anonymized form. As we move forward with app-based syndromic surveillance, it will be critical to differentiate this work from efforts based on contact tracing and to offer output complementary to those efforts’ results.\n\n【14】Ultimately, we believe that digital syndromic surveillance as a method of “contactless tracing” holds substantial appeal for the future, beyond the immediate priority of reopening our society. Although caseloads are decreasing, without a universal vaccine or highly effective treatment, we will continue to need to collect data on Covid-19 symptoms for the foreseeable future, particularly given concerns about a resurgence of cases after the summer. These tools will also be valuable for other efforts, including recruiting volunteers for clinical trials, estimating risk of reinfection, and assessing vaccine efficacy on a population scale. Thus, such mobile technology will remain an important weapon in our efforts to defeat Covid-19 and to better position ourselves to respond to the next pandemic.\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on June 5, 2020, and updated on August 05, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>From the Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, the Division of Gastroenterology, and the Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (A.T.C.), the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

Large gatherings were prohibited, most schools and nonessential businesses were closed, and people were asked to stay at home or shelter in place. But as many parts of the United States see a slow decrease in Covid-19 cases, restrictions are gradually being lifted, particularly as the pandemic’s devastating economic and social consequences mount. Although decisions to gradually reopen societies are ultimately based on a complex calculus of political, economic, and public health considerations, it’s clear that there is a high unmet need for better estimates of communities’ burden of Covid-19 to guide such decision making. Fortunately, some mobile symptom-surveillance tools can be used for predictive modeling to address this critical priority.\n\n【3】To date, most projections of the Covid-19 burden have been based on incidence calculated from Covid-19 testing, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, such estimates are severely limited. First, such data are not uniformly collected on a national scale and rely on a patchwork of variable efforts by regional and local public health authorities. There are also substantial delays in reporting and aggregating data and stark discrepancies in how cases and deaths are counted.\n\n【4】Second, despite advances in diagnostics, the availability of testing for infection continues to be limited. This limitation leads to wide variation in the severity of symptoms and the underlying risk profiles used to qualify people for testing in different states and localities. Thus, confirmed incidence based only on Covid-19–positive tests may depend on these factors rather than reflecting true underlying prevalence in a population.\n\n【5】Third, hospitalizations and death rates largely capture more severe cases of Covid-19. Increasing quantities of data are highlighting the importance of identifying asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic persons who may not seek medical care, since they may account for a significant proportion of community spread. Finally, although antibody-based testing is receiving increasing attention, we don’t yet know how reliable, accurate, or widely available such assays will be, nor what implications the results will have, including whether positive results will indicate immunity to reinfection.\n\n【6】To address this knowledge gap, new and cost-efficient participatory syndromic-surveillance tools have been developed that can be used in real time to rapidly address critical near-term needs. These tools work by capturing data on reported symptoms using mobile technology such as phone apps or Internet-based questionnaires, which often provide more timely signals of infectious disease transmission than more traditional sources. For example, we have launched a Covid Symptom Study app ( http://covid.joinzoe.com . opens in new tab ), developed by Zoe Global with scientific input from Massachusetts General Hospital and King’s College London, that has been used by nearly 3.5 million people in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden; it collects daily information about whether people feel well, and if not, about their symptoms and whether they have been tested for Covid-19. This tool has also been configured to collect additional data on risk factors for and outcomes of Covid-19 that can be used for real-time epidemiologic studies, especially when embedded within existing population-based cohort studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】At Boston Children’s Hospital, we have adapted a Web- and text-message–based syndromic surveillance tool, FluNearYou ( http://flunearyou.org . opens in new tab ), 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> designed to assess patterns of influenza incidence, into a tool for Covid-19 known as CovidNearYou 删除7:<u>( www.covidnearyou.org . opens in new tab )</u>. This platform, which has now captured more than a million reports, is providing insights into Covid-19 symptomology and key demographic risk factors. Syndromic data have been collected by others with the use of fitness trackers, continuous wearable devices, and smart thermometers, all validated to provide early insight into respiratory illness in the community. With each of these tools, symptom data can be used to model population incidence of Covid-19 in the absence of widespread population testing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Since varied but complementary information is collected with the range of available tools, integrating their output could lead to more robust models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】In the early phases of the pandemic, these estimates were used for real-time assessment of viral spread, including identification of new “hot spots” or regions at high risk for a heavy Covid-19 burden. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Many of these tools also entail direct engagement with participants, providing opportunities for real-time communication of study results for public health messaging.\n\n【9】Although syndromic surveillance data play a role in deploying resources to meet surges in health care demand, they may be even more critical for guiding decision making regarding reopening economies and loosening stay-at-home orders. For example, the current White House strategy calls for dependence on data regarding influenza-like and Covid-like illness as part of the gating criteria for easing social distancing guidelines. These data, however, currently rely only on emergency department utilization, which may represent an underestimate, given the documented avoidance of in-person medical care and the explosion of telemedicine visits. Thus, symptom information is vital to providing an earlier window into our progress against viral spread and can be used to complement traditional measures of the pandemic’s severity.\n\n【10】Electronically collected symptom data will be particularly important as a readily adaptable tool that can be applied widely in various populations as states move at variable paces to lift restrictions. Data based on symptom burden have the advantages of avoiding confounding by differences in testing availability and being flexible and sensitive to detecting changes in response to public health recommendations and government mandates.\n\n【11】Nonetheless, crowd-sourced data from mobile apps have limitations. The population providing the information will not perfectly reflect the broader population. Although more than 80% of the U.S. population uses smartphones, there remain many important subgroups, such as older adults and socioeconomically disadvantaged people, whose lack of access to technology will be a barrier to participation. Through the Covid Symptom Study app, we have specifically sought to enhance representation from racial and ethnic groups that are more vulnerable to Covid-19 by recruiting participants within ongoing studies such as the Black Women’s Health Study and the Multiethnic Cohort Study and by launching a Spanish-language app. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In addition, as with any study that relies on voluntary contribution of data, people’s differential willingness to participate may reflect differences in underlying health-seeking behavior and anxiety regarding symptoms.\n\n【12】Moreover, several syndrome-surveillance platforms are already in use, which may lead to consumer confusion; it is thus important for data collectors to collaborate and standardize their platforms through such initiatives as the International Workshop on Participatory Surveillance. Efforts to aggregate data should, however, recognize the potential for compounding limitations related to representativeness unless platforms are specifically adapted to reach different segments of the population.\n\n【13】Finally, the use of any platform that captures health information must balance concerns regarding privacy and data sharing. Tools based on syndromic surveillance do not require identifying information that can be shared with insurers or public health authorities — a key feature distinguishing them from so-called contact-tracing apps, from which information about Covid-19 testing may be shared publicly, albeit in an anonymized form. As we move forward with app-based syndromic surveillance, it will be critical to differentiate this work from efforts based on contact tracing and to offer output complementary to those efforts’ results.\n\n【14】Ultimately, we believe that digital syndromic surveillance as a method of “contactless tracing” holds substantial appeal for the future, beyond the immediate priority of reopening our society. Although caseloads are decreasing, without a universal vaccine or highly effective treatment, we will continue to need to collect data on Covid-19 symptoms for the foreseeable future, particularly given concerns about a resurgence of cases after the summer. These tools will also be valuable for other efforts, including recruiting volunteers for clinical trials, estimating risk of reinfection, and assessing vaccine efficacy on a population scale. Thus, such mobile technology will remain an important weapon in our efforts to defeat Covid-19 and to better position ourselves to respond to the next pandemic.\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on June 5, 2020, and updated on August 05, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>From the Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, the Division of Gastroenterology, and the Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School (A.T.C.), the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.H.

These uses of voriconazole are probably attributable to its lower overall toxicity, its ease of oral administration, and its broad antifungal spectrum, especially against aspergillus species.\n\n【3】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of Patients with Breakthrough Zygomycosis.\n\n【4】Since September 2002, when voriconazole became available at our institution, we have noted an increased frequency of cases of zygomycosis among recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplants. From September 2002 to June 2003, 124 patients underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. During this period, zygomycosis was diagnosed in four patients on the basis of pathological or mycologic identification 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The diagnosis was made a median of 125 days after transplantation. All patients had received a diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease and were receiving treatment for it. Voriconazole was being given to three patients as antifungal prophylaxis and to one as empirical treatment for pulmonary nodules for a median of 36 days (range, 21 to 99) before diagnosis and a median of 20 days (range, 0 to 94) before the onset of symptoms that led to the diagnosis of zygomycosis. Initially, clinicians did not consider breakthrough or resistant invasive fungal infections. During the preceding 32 months, 370 patients underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and only 2 had documented zygomycosis (4 cases in 119.6 patient-years, vs. 2 cases in 282.6 patient-years after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation; unadjusted rate ratio, 4.73; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.87 to 25.8). There was no clustering of cases, and no zygomycetes were isolated from samples obtained during hospital environmental surveillance.\n\n【5】Zygomycetes are resistant to voriconazole in vitro. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Thus, selective pressure from prolonged use of voriconazole or increased survival among profoundly immunosuppressed patients may explain the increased frequency of zygomycosis among patients who remain at high risk for invasive fungal infections. This observation underscores the need to make an etiologic diagnosis of such infections, to consider resistant pathogens promptly, and to consider the risks, benefits, and tradeoffs 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> of prophylactic therapy carefully.\n\n【6】参考删除-2:<u>Francisco M.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.Figure 2. Figure 2. Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2. Figure 2. </mark>Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2. Figure 2. </mark>Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). <mark>Figure 3.  Figure 3. </mark>Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not <mark>(Upper Panel)</mark> and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2. Figure 2. </mark>Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). <mark>Figure 3.  Figure 3. </mark>Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not <mark>(Upper Panel)</mark> and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not<mark> (Lower Panel)</mark>.\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2. Figure 2. </mark>Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). <mark>Figure 3.  Figure 3. </mark>Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not <mark>(Upper Panel)</mark> and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not<mark> (Lower Panel)</mark>.\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2. Figure 2. </mark>Number and Incidence (per 10,000 Person-Years) of Cancers, According to Site, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not <mark>(Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel). Figure 3.  Figure 3. Deaths and Mortality Rates (per 10,000 Person-Years), According to Cause of Death, among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Upper Panel) and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not (Lower Panel).</mark>Lower Panel).\n\n【43】The cause of death was unknown for four participants.\n\n【44】A total of 876 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 564 deaths due to lung cancer were identified in the entire cohort. There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown<mark> </mark>in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not, primarily because there were more deaths from lung cancer and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects\\.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Previous studies have suggested that higher intakes of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene may be associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In particular, epidemiologic studies have linked the intake of vegetables rich in beta carotene with a lower risk of cancer (especially lung cancer) and have suggested that certain micronutrients are inhibitors of cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> . The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial undertaken to determine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. A secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of other cancers. Lung cancer was deemed a particularly appropriate target for this trial because of its high incidence, its generally poor prognosis, and the existence of a well-defined high-risk population (i.e., smokers) 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> . In this report we describe the initial overall results of the study, which was conducted in Finland as a joint project of the National Public Health Institute of Finland and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Study Design\n------------\n\n【14】The rationale, design, and methods of the study, the characteristics of the participants, and the measures of compliance have been described in detail elsewhere 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> . Briefly, the participants (n = 29,133) were male smokers who were 50 through 69 years old at entry; they were recruited from the total male population of this age group in 14 geographic areas in southwestern Finland (n = 290,406). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four supplementation regimens: alpha-tocopherol alone (n = 7286), alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene (n = 7278), beta carotene alone (n = 7282), or placebo (n = 7287). Thus, a total of 14,564 men received alpha-tocopherol, and 14,560 received beta carotene. The daily dose of alpha-tocopherol was 50 mg and that of beta carotene, 20 mg. Follow-up continued for 5 to 8 years (median, 6.1), until death or April 30, 1993, with a total of 169,751 person-years contributed by the surviving participants. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and all subjects provided informed consent before randomization.\n\n【15】Eligibility\n-----------\n\n【16】Participants were recruited in 1985 through 1988 from the respondents to a postal survey (n = 224,377) who lived in the designated study region. To be eligible, they had to be smokers (five or more cigarettes per day at entry), 50 to 69 years old, and willing to give informed written consent. Potential participants with a history of cancer or serious disease limiting their ability to participate, those taking supplements of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta carotene in excess of predefined doses, and those being treated with anticoagulant agents were excluded. Before their enrollment, the participants were interviewed at 1 of 14 local study centers to obtain details of their medical, dietary, smoking, and occupational histories and information about other risk factors for cancer. Each participant's dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene was estimated from the diet-history questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene were measured in serum samples by high-performance liquid chromatography 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> . Participants identified after randomization as ineligible (n = 113) were equally distributed among the four intervention groups; they included men with preexisting cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 64), men with lung cancer identified on the base-line chest film (n = 33), users of vitamin supplements in excess of the study limits (n = 15), and 1 nonsmoker.\n\n【17】Randomization and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【18】The participants at each of the 14 study sites were randomly assigned to one of the four intervention groups. Treatment assignments were based on a two-by-two factorial design that permitted assessment of the effects of the two supplements independently. Thus, half the participants received alpha-tocopherol (n = 14,564) and half did not (n = 14,569). Similarly, half received beta carotene (n = 14,560) and half did not (n = 14,573). The proportion of participants who reported yellowing of the skin at any time during active follow-up was 34 percent in the two groups that received beta carotene, as compared with 7 percent in the groups given no beta carotene; persistent yellowing of the skin (during two thirds or more of the follow-up visits) was reported by 8.8 percent of the participants who received beta carotene, as compared with 0.3 percent of those who did not. Participants and all study staff involved in the ascertainment of end points and the assignment of final diagnoses remained blinded to the participants' treatment assignments throughout the trial.\n\n【19】Delivery of Supplements and Assessment of Compliance\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】The study agents were formulated as synthetic dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (50 percent powder) and synthetic beta carotene (10 percent water-soluble beadlets); all formulations were colored with quinoline yellow. Capsules were packaged in coded blister-pack wallets in calendar format provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche (Basel, Switzerland). All participants took a single capsule daily. The participants received a new supply of capsules at each of their thrice-yearly follow-up visits. Visits began in April 1985 for some participants and were concluded in April 1993 for all. Compliance was assessed by counts of the remaining capsules at each visit, by measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene levels after three years of supplementation, and by measurements in random serum samples throughout the study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【21】Assessment of End Points\n------------------------\n\n【22】Cases of lung cancer were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> . All cases known to have been diagnosed up to April 30, 1993, are included in this report. To enhance the ascertainment of cases, a chest film was obtained at a study visit every 28 months and at each participant's exit from the study. For various reasons, the final chest film was not available for 494 of the surviving men. There were no differences among the intervention groups in the proportion of exit chest films available for analysis or in the reasons why no film was obtained. All diagnostic information for each case of lung cancer was reviewed by the Clinical Review Committee for confirmation and staging. Clinical diagnoses were based on histologic features in 77 percent of the cases, on cytologic analysis alone in 15 percent, and on clinical data alone in 8 percent.\n\n【23】Cancers other than lung cancer were also identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry, with medical records reviewed by clinicians at the central study office.\n\n【24】Monitoring of Safety and Efficacy\n---------------------------------\n\n【25】Possible side effects of the interventions were assessed at each follow-up visit by means of a questionnaire covering symptoms and an interview focusing on illnesses since the most recent visit that had led to a visit to a doctor or to hospitalization. Information on morbidity unrelated to cancer was also obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry. Deaths (n = 3570) were identified from the National Death Registry, a branch of Statistics Finland. The underlying cause of death was coded by trained nosologists using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9), and reviewed at the study coordinating center; the death certificate was not available for four participants. In 91 percent of all deaths, the cause was based on the autopsy findings (54 percent), the inpatient diagnosis, or both.\n\n【26】A data and safety monitoring committee was convened twice annually throughout the study to review its progress and integrity and to evaluate unblinded data relevant to safety and efficacy.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses of trial results focused on estimating the overall effect of the two supplements on the incidence of cancer and on mortality due to cancer or other causes. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle; that is, follow-up and case ascertainment continued regardless of whether participants continued in the trial. We tested for an interaction between the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene by means of a proportional-hazards model 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【29】Kaplan-Meier cumulative-incidence plots and two-sided nominal P values derived from the unweighted log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> are presented for each intervention separately: alpha-tocopherol as compared with no alpha-tocopherol, and beta carotene as compared with no beta carotene. The effect of intervention is expressed as the percentage change in the incidence of an end point and its 95 percent confidence interval. Computations of confidence intervals were based on the binomial distribution, derived from conditioning on the number of cases and adjustment of probabilities for the number of person-years of follow-up in the two comparison groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【30】The preliminary data on cancers other than lung cancer are presented in the form of counts and rates of incidence according to intervention group. Two or more of the five primary cancers in a single participant were counted as separate cases in each category, but were counted only once within each category (even in the category “other cancers”). Thus, the cancer counts are not mutually exclusive. Cases of carcinoma in situ of the lung (n = 6) and basal-cell carcinoma of the skin (n = 217) were excluded from the analysis. Cause-specific data on deaths are presented in the form of counts and mortality rates in mutually exclusive cause-of-death categories according to intervention group. The categories are based on the following ICD-9 codes: cancer (140 through 208), ischemic heart disease (410 through 414), hemorrhagic stroke (430 through 432), ischemic stroke (433 through 436 and 438), other cardiovascular disease (390 through 405, 415 through 429, 437, and 440 through 459), injuries and accidents (800 through 999), and other causes (001 through 139, 210 through 389, and 460 through 799). Only cases in which cancer was the underlying cause of death were included among the deaths due to cancer.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Characteristics of the Participants\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】<mark>Table 1.  Table 1.</mark> Median Base-Line Characteristics of the Participants, According to Whether They Received Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene.\n\n【34】At study entry, the men in the cohort averaged 57.2 years of age, smoked an average of 20.4 cigarettes daily, and had smoked for an average of 35.9 years. There were no differences among the intervention groups with respect to any characteristic or risk factor for lung cancer that we evaluated at base line 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> or during follow-up, except those directly related to supplementation. A total of 6131 participants stopped smoking during the trial; the numbers who quit in the various intervention groups differed by less than 26. Similarly, 9061 participants left the study for any reason, including death; the groups differed in the number of such dropouts by less than 37.\n\n【35】Lung Cancer and Base-Line Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Levels\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】When the placebo group was divided according to quartiles with regard to the base-line serum alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene concentration, the incidence of lung cancer was higher among the subjects in the lowest quartile group than among those in the highest (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest quartile group: alpha-tocopherol, 56.8 vs. 41.8; beta carotene, 53.3 vs. 43.1). There was, moreover, an inverse association between dietary intake of alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene at base line and the risk of lung cancer during the trial (incidence per 10,000 person-years, lowest vs. highest: alpha-tocopherol, 61.4 vs. 40.6; beta carotene, 47.9 vs. 39.9).\n\n【37】Compliance\n----------\n\n【38】<mark>Table 2.  Table 2.</mark> Serum Concentrations of Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta Carotene before and after Supplementation, According to Intervention.\n\n【39】Compliance, estimated on the basis of residual-capsule counts, was excellent, with four out of five active participants taking more than 95 percent of their capsules. In addition, there were no differences in capsule consumption among the intervention groups (median percentage of capsules taken, 99.0 percent in each). Participants receiving active treatment accounted for 86 percent of the total follow-up, whereas the remaining 14 percent was contributed by men who died or dropped out and therefore did not consume capsules. Compliance with intervention was confirmed by the substantial increases in serum alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene concentrations in the groups receiving the active agents, whereas the levels changed little in those who did not receive the agents 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Incidence of Lung Cancer and Mortality\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】<mark>Figure 1.  Figure 1. </mark>Kaplan-Meier Curves for the Cumulative Incidence of Lung Cancer among Participants Who Received Alpha-Tocopherol Supplements and Those Who Did Not <mark>(Upper Panel)</mark> and among Participants Who Received Beta Carotene Supplements and Those Who Did Not<mark> (Lower Panel)</mark>.\n\n【42】Data are shown only through 7 1/2 years of follow-up because of the small numbers of participants beyond that time.<mark>Figure 2.

There was no evidence of an interaction between the two supplements in their effect on lung cancer (incidence per 10,000 person-years: alpha-tocopherol alone, 47.3; alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, 55.3; beta carotene alone, 57.2; and placebo, 47.7; likelihood-ratio test for interaction: chi-square = 0.04, P = 0.84). <mark>Our findings regarding the incidence of lung cancer and mortality from that disease according to intervention are shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . </mark>For alpha-tocopherol recipients, the small reduction in incidence (2 percent) during the entire trial was not statistically significant (P = 0.8 by the log-rank test). Among the men who received beta carotene, an excess cumulative incidence of lung cancer was observed after 18 months and increased progressively thereafter, resulting in an 18 percent difference in incidence by the end of the study (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent; P = 0.01) between the participants who received beta carotene and those who did not. The results were essentially identical when the analysis was restricted to men who had no yellowing of the skin or to those with lung cancers detected radiographically during the study. Mortality due to lung cancer was also apparently higher in the groups that received beta carotene than in those that did not (P = 0.08). No difference associated with the presence or absence of beta carotene supplementation was observed in the case fatality rate or in the length of time from diagnosis to death.\n\n【45】The six cases of carcinoma in situ that were excluded from these analyses were distributed as follows: three each among participants who received alpha-tocopherol and those who did not, and two cases among participants who received beta carotene and four among those who did not. There was one new case of lung cancer among the 113 participants excluded after randomization; the man was assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol.\n\n【46】Other Cancers\n-------------\n\n【47】A total of 1415 first cancers other than lung cancer were identified in 1331 subjects during the trial (basal-cell carcinoma of the skin was excluded, as were second cancers at a given site). Figure 2 shows the number of first cancers and their incidence, according to intervention group, at the five most common sites and at all other sites combined. The participants who received alpha-tocopherol had fewer cancers of the prostate and colorectum than those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, whereas more cancers of the bladder, stomach, and other sites combined were diagnosed in the participants who received this supplement. The participants who received beta carotene had more cancers of the prostate and stomach and fewer cases of other cancers than those who did not receive beta carotene. There were two cancers other than lung cancer (melanoma and astrocytoma) among the participants who were excluded after randomization.\n\n【48】Mortality\n---------\n\n【49】Altogether, 3570 deaths occurred during the trial. Among participants receiving alpha-tocopherol, there were fewer deaths caused by ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke than there were among those who did not receive alpha-tocopherol, but more deaths due to cancers other than lung cancer or due to hemorrhagic stroke 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 2 percent higher in the alpha-tocopherol groups than in the groups that received no alpha-tocopherol (95 percent confidence interval, -5 to 9 percent; P = 0.6). There were more deaths due to lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among recipients of beta carotene 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Overall mortality was 8 percent higher among the participants who received beta carotene than among those not given beta carotene (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent; P = 0.02).\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Our results provide no evidence of a beneficial effect of supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) or beta carotene in terms of the prevention of lung cancer. In fact, men who received beta carotene were found to have lung cancer more frequently than those who did not receive beta carotene. These results are sufficiently strong that it is highly unlikely that 20 mg of beta carotene per day confers any material protective effect against lung cancer among smokers over a period of about six years.\n\n【52】The lack of reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among the men given supplemental beta carotene may be explained by bias, an inadequate duration of supplementation, the use of the wrong dose, or an inappropriate study population. Bias can be discounted, since the intervention groups were balanced in terms of all the relevant characteristics we studied. The study population was large, and case ascertainment was essentially complete. In addition, the men in the various intervention groups sought treatment at virtually the same time for lung cancer, as measured by the length of time from diagnosis to death, and even for such minor problems as yellowing of the skin. Moreover, analyses of the incidence of lung cancer that were restricted to participants who did not report yellowing of the skin or to cases diagnosed on the chest film obtained at the study examination yielded results similar to those for the entire cohort; this similarity of results essentially rules out bias caused by self-selection or by differences in diagnostic procedures.\n\n【53】It is plausible that the intervention period was too short to inhibit the development of cancers resulting from a lifetime of exposure to cigarette smoke and other carcinogens. Beta carotene may not be the active cancer-inhibiting component of the fruits and vegetables identified as protective in observational studies, or the intake of beta carotene may be only a nonspecific marker for lifestyles that protect against cancer. Although it is conceivable that the dose we used was too low, this seems unlikely, since that dose exceeded by many times the dietary intake of beta carotene in epidemiologic studies that found a strong inverse association between the consumption of carotene-rich foods and the incidence of lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> . Finally, study findings regarded as showing supplementation to be beneficial or harmful may occur by chance.\n\n【54】The lack of benefit of beta carotene is particularly surprising given the substantial and consistent epidemiologic evidence of an association between a higher beta carotene intake and a lower incidence of lung cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-15 </a></sup></u> including the results of the cohort-based analysis in this study. Furthermore, a recent large trial in China found a significant reduction in mortality due to cancer among persons whose diets were supplemented daily with the combination of beta carotene (15 mg), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 μg) for 5 1/4 years 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【55】We also observed no beneficial effect of alpha-tocopherol on the incidence of lung cancer or on mortality due to this disease. At the start of the trial, the a priori evidence that alpha-tocopherol prevented lung cancer was less substantial than that for beta carotene, and since then little additional evidence has been accumulated 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> . Possible explanations for the lack of effect are similar to those for beta carotene, although the relatively low dose and the short duration of supplementation merit greater consideration in the case of alpha-tocopherol. Furthermore, we observed no interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene in their effect on the incidence of lung cancer.\n\n【56】The apparently protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, against colorectal cancer is intriguing. Although there was little or no evidence linking alpha-tocopherol to the incidence of cancers at either of these sites when the trial started, limited observational data consistent with these findings have now been published 删除3:<u><sup><a>20-22 </a></sup></u> . Although these results are suggestive, many comparisons with these two agents were made in these analyses, increasing the possibility that some of the apparent benefits may have occurred by chance alone. Additional data from the continued follow-up of the participants in this and other intervention studies are needed before conclusions can be drawn about the role of alpha-tocopherol in preventing these cancers.\n\n【57】Our results raise the possibility that supplementation with beta carotene may be harmful in smokers. The higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among the beta carotene recipients requires more detailed analysis, and information from other studies is also needed. We are aware of no other data at this time, however, that suggest harmful effects of beta carotene, whereas there are data indicating benefit 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,23 </a></sup></u> . Furthermore, there are no known or described mechanisms of toxic effects of beta carotene, no data from studies in animals suggesting beta carotene toxicity, and no evidence of serious toxic effects of this substance in humans 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> . In the light of all the data available, an adverse effect of beta carotene seems unlikely; in spite of its formal statistical significance, therefore, this finding may well be due to chance.\n\n【58】The higher mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke among the participants receiving alpha-tocopherol also requires careful review. Alpha-tocopherol has effects on platelet function 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> that could conceivably underlie this observation.\n\n【59】In summary, we found no overall reduction in the incidence of lung cancer or in mortality due to this disease among male smokers who received dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both in this large trial in Finland. The results of this study raise the possibility that these substances may have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Longer observation of the participants in this trial and data from other studies of people at normal risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> or high risk 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> for cancer will be required to determine the full spectrum of effects of these agents. Public health recommendations about supplementation with these micronutrients would be premature at this time.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a contract (NO1-CN-45165) with the National Cancer Institute.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

The procedure can be performed during cardiac surgery undertaken for other reasons.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving participants with atrial fibrillation and a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk of stroke) who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for another indication. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging) or systemic embolism. The participants, research personnel, and primary care physicians (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group, with a mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 4.2. The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001). The incidence of perioperative bleeding, heart failure, or death did not differ significantly between the trial groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among participants with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; LAAOS III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01561651 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 VISUAL ABSTRACT  \nLeft Atrial Appendage Occlusion during Cardiac Surgery to Prevent Stroke\n\n【12】Atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and is responsible for approximately a quarter of ischemic strokes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> many of which are cardioembolic 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and originate from the left atrial appendage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Oral anticoagulation most likely reduces thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage and has proven efficacy and safety in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, oral anticoagulation is limited by nonadherence to prescribed medications, drug discontinuation, underdosing, and, for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. Left atrial appendage occlusion is hypothesized to reduce the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation, but this has not been proved in a randomized trial.\n\n【13】When patients with atrial fibrillation undergo cardiac surgery, concomitant occlusion of the left atrial appendage may be performed as an adjunctive procedure. We hypothesized that concomitant occlusion performed at the time of cardiac surgery would reduce the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation receiving usual care, including anticoagulation. If effective, concomitant occlusion would provide protection against ischemic stroke in addition to the protection provided by anticoagulant therapy. Once performed, the effects of the procedure are permanent.\n\n【14】We conducted the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS III) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion in participants with a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether concomitant occlusion would prevent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in participants who continued to receive usual care, including anticoagulation.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】LAAOS III was a multicenter, randomized trial that was funded by peer-reviewed funding sources. The Population Health Research Institute was the sponsor, served as the coordinating center, and was responsible for the maintenance of the database, validation and analyses of the data, and trial coordination. The funders had no role in the design or conduct of the trial; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the preparation of the manuscript. The trial was designed by the first and last authors, overseen by the steering committee, and carried out by the trial investigators 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The ethics committee at each participating trial site approved the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【18】Participants\n------------\n\n【19】We enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and had a history of atrial fibrillation and a score of at least 2 on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. We excluded patients undergoing off-pump surgery, mechanical-valve implantation, heart transplantation, surgery for complex congenital heart disease, or isolated implantation of a left ventricular assist device; those with a previous surgery that involved opening the pericardium; and those who had previously undergone implantation of a left atrial appendage closure device. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before enrollment.\n\n【20】Procedures\n----------\n\n【21】The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of a Web-based randomization system, to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to trial site, with varying block sizes of 2 and 4. The participants, trial personnel, and clinicians caring for the participants (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. A confidential email that indicated the assigned procedure for the participant was sent only to the surgeons just before surgery. In a follow-up email 24 hours after randomization, the surgeons provided information on whether they had complied with performing the assigned procedure, the method used to perform the surgical occlusion, and whether the occlusion was successful. Surgical reports indicated only that participants were enrolled in LAAOS III and may have undergone occlusion of the left atrial appendage. Surgeons and the intraoperative teams were not involved with ongoing management of antithrombotic therapy or further collection of the data.\n\n【22】Left atrial appendage occlusion was performed during cardiac surgery with the use of any of the following techniques: amputation and closure (preferred), stapler closure, double-layer linear closure from within the atrium in participants undergoing minithoracotomy (this approach required transesophageal echocardiographic confirmation of the occlusion), or closure with an approved surgical occlusion device 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Neither percutaneous closure nor purse-string closure was permitted. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was recommended to confirm successful closure. If the initial closure had failed, additional maneuvers were performed immediately to rectify the failure. If a participant had a thrombus identified in the appendage, the left atrium was opened to remove the thrombus before occlusion.\n\n【23】Participants were followed up by telephone or in person (primarily by telephone) by local trial personnel at 30 days and then every 6 months to a common trial end date (the date of the final visit was January 28, 2021). Physicians who oversaw antithrombotic therapy were unaware of trial-group assignments. Participants were expected to receive guideline-directed stroke prevention and other usual care. Trial personnel collected data on anticoagulation use and, if a participant was not receiving oral anticoagulation during follow-up, on the specific reasons for not doing so. Every 6 months, the participants were questioned with the use of a validated stroke questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> to determine if symptoms indicating a possible stroke had occurred. If such symptoms were reported, source documentation was obtained. Trial centers reported strokes or systemic emboli with specialized report forms. An adjudication committee consisting of physicians trained in the protocol definitions reviewed all strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and systemic emboli in a blinded manner; all strokes and transient ischemic attacks were reviewed by stroke neurologists.\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome was the first occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ) or noncerebral systemic embolism during follow-up. Strokes of undetermined cause were included as ischemic strokes in the primary analysis. Secondary outcomes included any stroke or noncerebral systemic embolism; ischemic stroke, noncerebral systemic embolism, or death from any cause; death from any cause; 30-day mortality; the volume of chest-tube drainage in the first 24 hours after surgery; reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery; hospitalization for heart failure; myocardial infarction; and major bleeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Definitions of trial outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Statistical Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【27】The primary hypothesis was that the risk of stroke or systemic embolism would be lower with surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage added to usual care than with no occlusion added to usual care. Assuming a rate of a primary-outcome event of 2.5% per year in the no-occlusion group and allowing for a rate of crossover of 7% and a rate of loss to follow-up due to nonstroke-related death of 2% per year, we estimated that a sample size of 4700 participants, with a median follow-up of 4 years, would provide the trial 80% power to detect a 25% lower relative risk of a primary-outcome event in the occlusion group than in the no-occlusion group. The estimated rate of a primary-outcome event in the no-occlusion group was based on the assumption that the mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score would be at least 2.3 and that 65% of the participants would continue to receive anticoagulation (a vitamin K antagonist in 45% and a direct oral anticoagulant in 20%) over the follow-up period.\n\n【28】The primary analysis included all the participants who underwent cardiac surgery. All the participants were followed, irrespective of whether they had undergone surgery, as long as they did not withdraw consent. A time-to-event analysis was used to test the primary hypothesis with the use of Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank testing. The treatment effect was estimated as a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval, which was derived with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested with the use of a graphical method 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the unblinded data and performed two prespecified interim analyses of efficacy when 50% and 75% of expected primary-outcome events had occurred. The trial could be stopped if the between-group difference in the incidence of a primary-outcome event was at least 4 standard deviations at the first interim analysis or at least 3 standard deviations at the second. These boundaries needed to be crossed in two consecutive analyses performed at least 3 months apart. Because these boundaries were extreme, we did not adjust the final significance level. We performed a landmark analysis of the primary outcome beyond 30 days. Additional Cox models were used to evaluate interactions between trial-group assignment and subgroups of interest.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【31】From July 2012 through October 2018, a total of 4811 participants from 105 centers in 27 countries were randomly assigned to undergo (2400 participants) or not undergo (2411 participants) left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. On January 28, 2021, after the second formal interim analysis of efficacy, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be stopped and the results reported. Final follow-up visits occurred between January 28, 2021, and March 11, 2021. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years, and follow-up was completed by 97.9% of the participants; 50 participants (1.1%) had withdrawn consent and 49 (1.0%) had been lost to follow-up 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【32】Table 1.

The trial groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The mean age of the participants was 71 years, and 67.5% were men. The mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score was 4.2, and approximately half the participants were receiving oral anticoagulation at baseline. The median time from randomization to surgery was 0.6 days in both groups. The mean cross-clamp time was 86 minutes in the occlusion group and 82 minutes in the no-occlusion group, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes and 113 minutes, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The median chest-tube output was 520 ml in the occlusion group and 500 ml in the no-occlusion group. Reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery occurred in 94 participants (4.0%) in the occlusion group and in 95 (4.0%) in the no-occlusion group. The 30-day mortality was 3.7% in the occlusion group and 4.0% in the no-occlusion group.\n\n【34】At hospital discharge, 83.4% of the participants in the occlusion group and 81.0% of those in the no-occlusion group were receiving oral anticoagulation, and the corresponding values were 79.6% and 78.9% at the 1-year visit and 75.3% and 78.2% at the 3-year visit. More information regarding the use of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants during follow-up is provided in Table S1.\n\n【35】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Cumulative Incidence of Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【37】The participants in the occlusion group underwent left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication, and those in the no-occlusion did not undergo left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery; all participants were expected to receive usual care. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.\n\n【38】The validity of the proportional-hazards assumption was assessed with the use of a log–log plot 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. Ischemic stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 1 )</u>. During the first 30 days after surgery, a primary-outcome event occurred in 53 participants (2.2%) in the occlusion group and in 65 (2.7%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18). After 30 days, a primary-outcome event occurred in 61 participants (2.7%) in the occlusion group and in 103 (4.6%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80).\n\n【39】Secondary and Safety Outcomes\n-----------------------------\n\n【40】Ischemic stroke occurred in 109 participants (4.6%) in the occlusion group and in 164 (6.9%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84). Death occurred in 538 participants in the occlusion group (22.6%) and in 537 (22.5%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13). The cause of death was attributed to stroke in 1.3% of the trial participants 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Hospitalization for heart failure (either prolongation of index hospitalization or new hospitalization) occurred in 183 participants (7.7%) in the occlusion group and in 162 (6.8%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.40). The incidence of major bleeding or myocardial infarction was similar in the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】Additional Analyses\n-------------------\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of the Effect of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion or No Occlusion on Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【43】The sizes of the squares are proportional to the precision of the estimates. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible. Atrial fibrillation or flutter is based on the rhythm at baseline electrocardiography, and the comparator is any other rhythm. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. TIA denotes transient ischemic attack.\n\n【44】The effect of left atrial appendage occlusion on the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was consistent across subgroups 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The results of the primary-outcome analysis were also consistent with those of the per-protocol, as-treated, and intention-to-treat analyses and with those of the analysis that considered death as a competing risk 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The intention-to-treat analysis included the participants who did not undergo surgery in addition to those in the primary analysis population.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In LAAOS III, among participants with atrial fibrillation and risk factors for stroke, the risk of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic thromboembolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during cardiac surgery than without it. On the basis of the Kaplan–Meier estimates, the number of participants — with characteristics similar to those enrolled in the current trial — needed to undergo concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion during cardiac surgery to prevent one stroke over the period of 5 years was 37 (95% CI, 22 to 111). Several methods were used to perform concomitant occlusion during cardiac surgery, most of which incurred minimal additional cost and were performed without perioperative complications. No significant increase in the risk of heart failure or major bleeding was observed with the procedure.\n\n【47】The left atrial appendage is a source of atrial natriuretic peptide, and it has been hypothesized that removal of the appendage might impair renal clearance of salt and water, thereby increasing the risk of heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> A recent nonrandomized study has supported this hypothesis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our trial, we did not observe an increase in hospitalization for heart failure, either early after surgery or during long-term follow-up.\n\n【48】Anticoagulation is the mainstay of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> because it is highly effective. Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke by two thirds, and direct oral anticoagulants are even more effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Although anticoagulation is limited by the increased risk of bleeding, guidelines conclude that the risk–benefit analysis strongly favors lifetime use of oral anticoagulation in the majority of higher-risk patients. Despite these well-established benefits, anticoagulation is limited by problems that include incorrect dosing, temporary interruptions for medical reasons, nonadherence to the prescribed therapy, and, for vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces the risk of stroke by means of a different mechanism from that of anticoagulants, and its effects appear to be additive to those of oral anticoagulation. These additive effects are at least partly due to the continuous and permanent protection against embolic stroke provided by the procedure, which addresses some of the limitations of long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【49】We observed a high rate of stroke in the first 30 days after surgery as compared with the rest of follow-up. This finding is consistent with observations in other studies examining the risk of stroke among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Analyses of the primary outcome in our trial suggested a larger difference between the trial groups after 30 days than during the first 30 days (with hazard ratios of 0.82 \\[95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18\\] during the first 30 days after surgery and 0.58 \\[95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80\\] after 30 days). Early after surgery, some strokes are probably related to the surgery itself (e.g., aortic and intracardiac manipulation), factors against which occlusion is not likely to be effective. After the perioperative period, a greater proportion of strokes are caused by cardiac thromboembolism related to atrial fibrillation, for which occlusion is effective.\n\n【50】LAAOS III did not compare left atrial appendage occlusion with anticoagulation, and it would be incorrect to conclude that occlusion at the time of surgery should be considered as a replacement for anticoagulation. Whereas anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke by approximately two thirds, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> in LAAOS III, concomitant occlusion reduced the risk of stroke by approximately one third. A factor that offsets the possibly smaller reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke with left atrial appendage occlusion is the anticoagulant-related risk of hemorrhagic stroke, a risk that is not present in patients who undergo surgical occlusion and do not receive oral anticoagulants. Without a trial that directly compares oral anticoagulation with left atrial appendage occlusion, it remains uncertain whether occlusion can replace anticoagulation. Our trial therefore does not support concomitant surgical occlusion as a replacement for oral anticoagulation.\n\n【51】The results of LAAOS III have important implications for the use of nonpharmacologic therapies to prevent embolic stroke. In our trial, surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage provided additional protection against stroke when added to anticoagulation. Percutaneous endovascular occlusion devices may also be effective as a complement to anticoagulation rather than as a replacement, but this would require testing. There are notable differences between surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage and occlusion performed with a percutaneous endovascular device. Surgical occlusion is an extravascular procedure, whereas occlusion with an endovascular device may increase the risk of thrombus formation and embolism.\n\n【52】Limitations of our trial include the lack of information about the relative efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion as compared with oral anticoagulation. Furthermore, the findings from LAAOS III apply primarily to surgical occlusion of the appendage performed as a concomitant procedure and not to stand-alone surgical or endovascular occlusion. We cannot discern from our results whether all surgical closure methods are comparable, and we did not examine whether occlusion was sustained over follow-up.\n\n【53】This trial showed that among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network , Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute through the Population Health Research Institute , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada , the Request for Applications Program–Research Strategic Initiatives of Hamilton Health Sciences , the Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally , and McMaster University Surgical Associates .</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Whitlock reports receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche, grant support and honoraria from Boehringer Ingelheim, and consulting fees from AtriCure and PhaseBio; Dr. Belley-Cote, receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche; Dr. Healey, receiving grant support and lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Sharma, receiving grant support and consulting fees from Bayer, grant support and fees for trial leadership from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and fees for trial leadership from Portola; Dr. Budera, receiving consulting fees from AtriCure; Dr. Devereaux, receiving grant support form Abbott Diagnostics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche Diagnostics, and Siemens and donated products from Philips Healthcare; Dr. Boening, receiving grant support and advisory board fees from Somahlution, advisory board fees from Nordic Pharma, grant support and honoraria from Zoll, honoraria from Abiomed, and consulting fees from B.

Atrial switches utilize atrial-level prosthetic or pericardial baffles to shunt pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve to the right (systemic) ventricle and, vice versa, to shunt systemic venous return across the mitral valve to the left (sub-pulmonary) ventricle. Baffle leaks and discrete obstructions are well described short and long term complications of atrial switch procedures and they are often amenable to percutaneous catheter directed interventions. This phenomenon is one that any provider caring for adult patients with congenital heart disease should be familiar with. Non-arteriolar pulmonary hypertension with very large V waves seen in cardiac catheterization is the most important clue to diagnosis. Initial medical therapy is supportive, but we would advise extreme caution with pulmonary vasodilators as they may precipitate significant pulmonary edema in these patients.

The procedure can be performed during cardiac surgery undertaken for other reasons.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving participants with atrial fibrillation and a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk of stroke) who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for another indication. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging) or systemic embolism. The participants, research personnel, and primary care physicians (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group, with a mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 4.2. The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001). The incidence of perioperative bleeding, heart failure, or death did not differ significantly between the trial groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among participants with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; LAAOS III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01561651 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 VISUAL ABSTRACT  \nLeft Atrial Appendage Occlusion during Cardiac Surgery to Prevent Stroke\n\n【12】Atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and is responsible for approximately a quarter of ischemic strokes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> many of which are cardioembolic 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and originate from the left atrial appendage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Oral anticoagulation most likely reduces thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage and has proven efficacy and safety in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, oral anticoagulation is limited by nonadherence to prescribed medications, drug discontinuation, underdosing, and, for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. Left atrial appendage occlusion is hypothesized to reduce the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation, but this has not been proved in a randomized trial.\n\n【13】When patients with atrial fibrillation undergo cardiac surgery, concomitant occlusion of the left atrial appendage may be performed as an adjunctive procedure. We hypothesized that concomitant occlusion performed at the time of cardiac surgery would reduce the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation receiving usual care, including anticoagulation. If effective, concomitant occlusion would provide protection against ischemic stroke in addition to the protection provided by anticoagulant therapy. Once performed, the effects of the procedure are permanent.\n\n【14】We conducted the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS III) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion in participants with a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether concomitant occlusion would prevent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in participants who continued to receive usual care, including anticoagulation.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】LAAOS III was a multicenter, randomized trial that was funded by peer-reviewed funding sources. The Population Health Research Institute was the sponsor, served as the coordinating center, and was responsible for the maintenance of the database, validation and analyses of the data, and trial coordination. The funders had no role in the design or conduct of the trial; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the preparation of the manuscript. The trial was designed by the first and last authors, overseen by the steering committee, and carried out by the trial investigators 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The ethics committee at each participating trial site approved the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【18】Participants\n------------\n\n【19】We enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and had a history of atrial fibrillation and a score of at least 2 on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. We excluded patients undergoing off-pump surgery, mechanical-valve implantation, heart transplantation, surgery for complex congenital heart disease, or isolated implantation of a left ventricular assist device; those with a previous surgery that involved opening the pericardium; and those who had previously undergone implantation of a left atrial appendage closure device. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before enrollment.\n\n【20】Procedures\n----------\n\n【21】The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of a Web-based randomization system, to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to trial site, with varying block sizes of 2 and 4. The participants, trial personnel, and clinicians caring for the participants (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. A confidential email that indicated the assigned procedure for the participant was sent only to the surgeons just before surgery. In a follow-up email 24 hours after randomization, the surgeons provided information on whether they had complied with performing the assigned procedure, the method used to perform the surgical occlusion, and whether the occlusion was successful. Surgical reports indicated only that participants were enrolled in LAAOS III and may have undergone occlusion of the left atrial appendage. Surgeons and the intraoperative teams were not involved with ongoing management of antithrombotic therapy or further collection of the data.\n\n【22】Left atrial appendage occlusion was performed during cardiac surgery with the use of any of the following techniques: amputation and closure (preferred), stapler closure, double-layer linear closure from within the atrium in participants undergoing minithoracotomy (this approach required transesophageal echocardiographic confirmation of the occlusion), or closure with an approved surgical occlusion device 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Neither percutaneous closure nor purse-string closure was permitted. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was recommended to confirm successful closure. If the initial closure had failed, additional maneuvers were performed immediately to rectify the failure. If a participant had a thrombus identified in the appendage, the left atrium was opened to remove the thrombus before occlusion.\n\n【23】Participants were followed up by telephone or in person (primarily by telephone) by local trial personnel at 30 days and then every 6 months to a common trial end date (the date of the final visit was January 28, 2021). Physicians who oversaw antithrombotic therapy were unaware of trial-group assignments. Participants were expected to receive guideline-directed stroke prevention and other usual care. Trial personnel collected data on anticoagulation use and, if a participant was not receiving oral anticoagulation during follow-up, on the specific reasons for not doing so. Every 6 months, the participants were questioned with the use of a validated stroke questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> to determine if symptoms indicating a possible stroke had occurred. If such symptoms were reported, source documentation was obtained. Trial centers reported strokes or systemic emboli with specialized report forms. An adjudication committee consisting of physicians trained in the protocol definitions reviewed all strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and systemic emboli in a blinded manner; all strokes and transient ischemic attacks were reviewed by stroke neurologists.\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome was the first occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ) or noncerebral systemic embolism during follow-up. Strokes of undetermined cause were included as ischemic strokes in the primary analysis. Secondary outcomes included any stroke or noncerebral systemic embolism; ischemic stroke, noncerebral systemic embolism, or death from any cause; death from any cause; 30-day mortality; the volume of chest-tube drainage in the first 24 hours after surgery; reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery; hospitalization for heart failure; myocardial infarction; and major bleeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Definitions of trial outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Statistical Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【27】The primary hypothesis was that the risk of stroke or systemic embolism would be lower with surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage added to usual care than with no occlusion added to usual care. Assuming a rate of a primary-outcome event of 2.5% per year in the no-occlusion group and allowing for a rate of crossover of 7% and a rate of loss to follow-up due to nonstroke-related death of 2% per year, we estimated that a sample size of 4700 participants, with a median follow-up of 4 years, would provide the trial 80% power to detect a 25% lower relative risk of a primary-outcome event in the occlusion group than in the no-occlusion group. The estimated rate of a primary-outcome event in the no-occlusion group was based on the assumption that the mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score would be at least 2.3 and that 65% of the participants would continue to receive anticoagulation (a vitamin K antagonist in 45% and a direct oral anticoagulant in 20%) over the follow-up period.\n\n【28】The primary analysis included all the participants who underwent cardiac surgery. All the participants were followed, irrespective of whether they had undergone surgery, as long as they did not withdraw consent. A time-to-event analysis was used to test the primary hypothesis with the use of Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank testing. The treatment effect was estimated as a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval, which was derived with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested with the use of a graphical method 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the unblinded data and performed two prespecified interim analyses of efficacy when 50% and 75% of expected primary-outcome events had occurred. The trial could be stopped if the between-group difference in the incidence of a primary-outcome event was at least 4 standard deviations at the first interim analysis or at least 3 standard deviations at the second. These boundaries needed to be crossed in two consecutive analyses performed at least 3 months apart. Because these boundaries were extreme, we did not adjust the final significance level. We performed a landmark analysis of the primary outcome beyond 30 days. Additional Cox models were used to evaluate interactions between trial-group assignment and subgroups of interest.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【31】From July 2012 through October 2018, a total of 4811 participants from 105 centers in 27 countries were randomly assigned to undergo (2400 participants) or not undergo (2411 participants) left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. On January 28, 2021, after the second formal interim analysis of efficacy, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be stopped and the results reported. Final follow-up visits occurred between January 28, 2021, and March 11, 2021. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years, and follow-up was completed by 97.9% of the participants; 50 participants (1.1%) had withdrawn consent and 49 (1.0%) had been lost to follow-up 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【32】Table 1. Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline, Antithrombotic Therapy, and Surgical Treatments. Table 2.  Table 2. Trial Outcomes.\n\n【33】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group. The trial groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The mean age of the participants was 71 years, and 67.5% were men. The mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score was 4.2, and approximately half the participants were receiving oral anticoagulation at baseline. The median time from randomization to surgery was 0.6 days in both groups. The mean cross-clamp time was 86 minutes in the occlusion group and 82 minutes in the no-occlusion group, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes and 113 minutes, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The median chest-tube output was 520 ml in the occlusion group and 500 ml in the no-occlusion group. Reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery occurred in 94 participants (4.0%) in the occlusion group and in 95 (4.0%) in the no-occlusion group. The 30-day mortality was 3.7% in the occlusion group and 4.0% in the no-occlusion group.\n\n【34】At hospital discharge, 83.4% of the participants in the occlusion group and 81.0% of those in the no-occlusion group were receiving oral anticoagulation, and the corresponding values were 79.6% and 78.9% at the 1-year visit and 75.3% and 78.2% at the 3-year visit. More information regarding the use of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants during follow-up is provided in Table S1.\n\n【35】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Cumulative Incidence of Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【37】The participants in the occlusion group underwent left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication, and those in the no-occlusion did not undergo left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery; all participants were expected to receive usual care. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.\n\n【38】The validity of the proportional-hazards assumption was assessed with the use of a log–log plot 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. Ischemic stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 1 )</u>. During the first 30 days after surgery, a primary-outcome event occurred in 53 participants (2.2%) in the occlusion group and in 65 (2.7%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18). After 30 days, a primary-outcome event occurred in 61 participants (2.7%) in the occlusion group and in 103 (4.6%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80).\n\n【39】Secondary and Safety Outcomes\n-----------------------------\n\n【40】Ischemic stroke occurred in 109 participants (4.6%) in the occlusion group and in 164 (6.9%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84). Death occurred in 538 participants in the occlusion group (22.6%) and in 537 (22.5%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13). The cause of death was attributed to stroke in 1.3% of the trial participants 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Hospitalization for heart failure (either prolongation of index hospitalization or new hospitalization) occurred in 183 participants (7.7%) in the occlusion group and in 162 (6.8%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.40). The incidence of major bleeding or myocardial infarction was similar in the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】Additional Analyses\n-------------------\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of the Effect of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion or No Occlusion on Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【43】The sizes of the squares are proportional to the precision of the estimates. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible. Atrial fibrillation or flutter is based on the rhythm at baseline electrocardiography, and the comparator is any other rhythm. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. TIA denotes transient ischemic attack.\n\n【44】The effect of left atrial appendage occlusion on the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was consistent across subgroups 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The results of the primary-outcome analysis were also consistent with those of the per-protocol, as-treated, and intention-to-treat analyses and with those of the analysis that considered death as a competing risk 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The intention-to-treat analysis included the participants who did not undergo surgery in addition to those in the primary analysis population.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In LAAOS III, among participants with atrial fibrillation and risk factors for stroke, the risk of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic thromboembolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during cardiac surgery than without it. On the basis of the Kaplan–Meier estimates, the number of participants — with characteristics similar to those enrolled in the current trial — needed to undergo concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion during cardiac surgery to prevent one stroke over the period of 5 years was 37 (95% CI, 22 to 111). Several methods were used to perform concomitant occlusion during cardiac surgery, most of which incurred minimal additional cost and were performed without perioperative complications. No significant increase in the risk of heart failure or major bleeding was observed with the procedure.\n\n【47】The left atrial appendage is a source of atrial natriuretic peptide, and it has been hypothesized that removal of the appendage might impair renal clearance of salt and water, thereby increasing the risk of heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> A recent nonrandomized study has supported this hypothesis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our trial, we did not observe an increase in hospitalization for heart failure, either early after surgery or during long-term follow-up.\n\n【48】Anticoagulation is the mainstay of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> because it is highly effective. Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke by two thirds, and direct oral anticoagulants are even more effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Although anticoagulation is limited by the increased risk of bleeding, guidelines conclude that the risk–benefit analysis strongly favors lifetime use of oral anticoagulation in the majority of higher-risk patients. Despite these well-established benefits, anticoagulation is limited by problems that include incorrect dosing, temporary interruptions for medical reasons, nonadherence to the prescribed therapy, and, for vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces the risk of stroke by means of a different mechanism from that of anticoagulants, and its effects appear to be additive to those of oral anticoagulation. These additive effects are at least partly due to the continuous and permanent protection against embolic stroke provided by the procedure, which addresses some of the limitations of long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【49】We observed a high rate of stroke in the first 30 days after surgery as compared with the rest of follow-up. This finding is consistent with observations in other studies examining the risk of stroke among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Analyses of the primary outcome in our trial suggested a larger difference between the trial groups after 30 days than during the first 30 days (with hazard ratios of 0.82 \\[95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18\\] during the first 30 days after surgery and 0.58 \\[95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80\\] after 30 days). Early after surgery, some strokes are probably related to the surgery itself (e.g., aortic and intracardiac manipulation), factors against which occlusion is not likely to be effective. After the perioperative period, a greater proportion of strokes are caused by cardiac thromboembolism related to atrial fibrillation, for which occlusion is effective.\n\n【50】LAAOS III did not compare left atrial appendage occlusion with anticoagulation, and it would be incorrect to conclude that occlusion at the time of surgery should be considered as a replacement for anticoagulation. Whereas anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke by approximately two thirds, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> in LAAOS III, concomitant occlusion reduced the risk of stroke by approximately one third. A factor that offsets the possibly smaller reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke with left atrial appendage occlusion is the anticoagulant-related risk of hemorrhagic stroke, a risk that is not present in patients who undergo surgical occlusion and do not receive oral anticoagulants. Without a trial that directly compares oral anticoagulation with left atrial appendage occlusion, it remains uncertain whether occlusion can replace anticoagulation. Our trial therefore does not support concomitant surgical occlusion as a replacement for oral anticoagulation.\n\n【51】The results of LAAOS III have important implications for the use of nonpharmacologic therapies to prevent embolic stroke. In our trial, surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage provided additional protection against stroke when added to anticoagulation. Percutaneous endovascular occlusion devices may also be effective as a complement to anticoagulation rather than as a replacement, but this would require testing. There are notable differences between surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage and occlusion performed with a percutaneous endovascular device. Surgical occlusion is an extravascular procedure, whereas occlusion with an endovascular device may increase the risk of thrombus formation and embolism.\n\n【52】Limitations of our trial include the lack of information about the relative efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion as compared with oral anticoagulation. Furthermore, the findings from LAAOS III apply primarily to surgical occlusion of the appendage performed as a concomitant procedure and not to stand-alone surgical or endovascular occlusion. We cannot discern from our results whether all surgical closure methods are comparable, and we did not examine whether occlusion was sustained over follow-up.\n\n【53】This trial showed that among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network , Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute through the Population Health Research Institute , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada , the Request for Applications Program–Research Strategic Initiatives of Hamilton Health Sciences , the Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally , and McMaster University Surgical Associates .</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Whitlock reports receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche, grant support and honoraria from Boehringer Ingelheim, and consulting fees from AtriCure and PhaseBio; Dr. Belley-Cote, receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche; Dr. Healey, receiving grant support and lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Sharma, receiving grant support and consulting fees from Bayer, grant support and fees for trial leadership from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and fees for trial leadership from Portola; Dr. Budera, receiving consulting fees from AtriCure; Dr. Devereaux, receiving grant support form Abbott Diagnostics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche Diagnostics, and Siemens and donated products from Philips Healthcare; Dr. Boening, receiving grant support and advisory board fees from Somahlution, advisory board fees from Nordic Pharma, grant support and honoraria from Zoll, honoraria from Abiomed, and consulting fees from B.

Atrial switches utilize atrial-level prosthetic or pericardial baffles to shunt pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve to the right (systemic) ventricle and, vice versa, to shunt systemic venous return across the mitral valve to the left (sub-pulmonary) ventricle. Baffle leaks and discrete obstructions are well described short and long term complications of atrial switch procedures and they are often amenable to percutaneous catheter directed interventions. This phenomenon is one that any provider caring for adult patients with congenital heart disease should be familiar with. Non-arteriolar pulmonary hypertension with very large V waves seen in cardiac catheterization is the most important clue to diagnosis. Initial medical therapy is supportive, but we would advise extreme caution with pulmonary vasodilators as they may precipitate significant pulmonary edema in these patients.

The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up.

The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001).

However, oral anticoagulation is limited by nonadherence to prescribed medications, drug discontinuation, underdosing, and, for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. Left atrial appendage occlusion is hypothesized to reduce the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation, but this has not been proved in a randomized trial.\n\n【13】When patients with atrial fibrillation undergo cardiac surgery, concomitant occlusion of the left atrial appendage may be performed as an adjunctive procedure. We hypothesized that concomitant occlusion performed at the time of cardiac surgery would reduce the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation receiving usual care, including anticoagulation. If effective, concomitant occlusion would provide protection against ischemic stroke in addition to the protection provided by anticoagulant therapy. Once performed, the effects of the procedure are permanent.\n\n【14】We conducted the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS III) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion in participants with a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether concomitant occlusion would prevent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in participants who continued to receive usual care, including anticoagulation.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】LAAOS III was a multicenter, randomized trial that was funded by peer-reviewed funding sources. The Population Health Research Institute was the sponsor, served as the coordinating center, and was responsible for the maintenance of the database, validation and analyses of the data, and trial coordination. The funders had no role in the design or conduct of the trial; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the preparation of the manuscript. The trial was designed by the first and last authors, overseen by the steering committee, and carried out by the trial investigators 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The ethics committee at each participating trial site approved the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【18】Participants\n------------\n\n【19】We enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and had a history of atrial fibrillation and a score of at least 2 on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. We excluded patients undergoing off-pump surgery, mechanical-valve implantation, heart transplantation, surgery for complex congenital heart disease, or isolated implantation of a left ventricular assist device; those with a previous surgery that involved opening the pericardium; and those who had previously undergone implantation of a left atrial appendage closure device. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before enrollment.\n\n【20】Procedures\n----------\n\n【21】The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of a Web-based randomization system, to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to trial site, with varying block sizes of 2 and 4. The participants, trial personnel, and clinicians caring for the participants (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. A confidential email that indicated the assigned procedure for the participant was sent only to the surgeons just before surgery. In a follow-up email 24 hours after randomization, the surgeons provided information on whether they had complied with performing the assigned procedure, the method used to perform the surgical occlusion, and whether the occlusion was successful. Surgical reports indicated only that participants were enrolled in LAAOS III and may have undergone occlusion of the left atrial appendage. Surgeons and the intraoperative teams were not involved with ongoing management of antithrombotic therapy or further collection of the data.\n\n【22】Left atrial appendage occlusion was performed during cardiac surgery with the use of any of the following techniques: amputation and closure (preferred), stapler closure, double-layer linear closure from within the atrium in participants undergoing minithoracotomy (this approach required transesophageal echocardiographic confirmation of the occlusion), or closure with an approved surgical occlusion device 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Neither percutaneous closure nor purse-string closure was permitted. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was recommended to confirm successful closure. If the initial closure had failed, additional maneuvers were performed immediately to rectify the failure. If a participant had a thrombus identified in the appendage, the left atrium was opened to remove the thrombus before occlusion.\n\n【23】Participants were followed up by telephone or in person (primarily by telephone) by local trial personnel at 30 days and then every 6 months to a common trial end date (the date of the final visit was January 28, 2021). Physicians who oversaw antithrombotic therapy were unaware of trial-group assignments. Participants were expected to receive guideline-directed stroke prevention and other usual care. Trial personnel collected data on anticoagulation use and, if a participant was not receiving oral anticoagulation during follow-up, on the specific reasons for not doing so. Every 6 months, the participants were questioned with the use of a validated stroke questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> to determine if symptoms indicating a possible stroke had occurred. If such symptoms were reported, source documentation was obtained. Trial centers reported strokes or systemic emboli with specialized report forms. An adjudication committee consisting of physicians trained in the protocol definitions reviewed all strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and systemic emboli in a blinded manner; all strokes and transient ischemic attacks were reviewed by stroke neurologists.\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome was the first occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ) or noncerebral systemic embolism during follow-up. Strokes of undetermined cause were included as ischemic strokes in the primary analysis. Secondary outcomes included any stroke or noncerebral systemic embolism; ischemic stroke, noncerebral systemic embolism, or death from any cause; death from any cause; 30-day mortality; the volume of chest-tube drainage in the first 24 hours after surgery; reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery; hospitalization for heart failure; myocardial infarction; and major bleeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Definitions of trial outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Statistical Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【27】The primary hypothesis was that the risk of stroke or systemic embolism would be lower with surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage added to usual care than with no occlusion added to usual care. Assuming a rate of a primary-outcome event of 2.5% per year in the no-occlusion group and allowing for a rate of crossover of 7% and a rate of loss to follow-up due to nonstroke-related death of 2% per year, we estimated that a sample size of 4700 participants, with a median follow-up of 4 years, would provide the trial 80% power to detect a 25% lower relative risk of a primary-outcome event in the occlusion group than in the no-occlusion group. The estimated rate of a primary-outcome event in the no-occlusion group was based on the assumption that the mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score would be at least 2.3 and that 65% of the participants would continue to receive anticoagulation (a vitamin K antagonist in 45% and a direct oral anticoagulant in 20%) over the follow-up period.\n\n【28】The primary analysis included all the participants who underwent cardiac surgery. All the participants were followed, irrespective of whether they had undergone surgery, as long as they did not withdraw consent. A time-to-event analysis was used to test the primary hypothesis with the use of Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank testing. The treatment effect was estimated as a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval, which was derived with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested with the use of a graphical method 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the unblinded data and performed two prespecified interim analyses of efficacy when 50% and 75% of expected primary-outcome events had occurred. The trial could be stopped if the between-group difference in the incidence of a primary-outcome event was at least 4 standard deviations at the first interim analysis or at least 3 standard deviations at the second. These boundaries needed to be crossed in two consecutive analyses performed at least 3 months apart. Because these boundaries were extreme, we did not adjust the final significance level. We performed a landmark analysis of the primary outcome beyond 30 days. Additional Cox models were used to evaluate interactions between trial-group assignment and subgroups of interest.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【31】From July 2012 through October 2018, a total of 4811 participants from 105 centers in 27 countries were randomly assigned to undergo (2400 participants) or not undergo (2411 participants) left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. On January 28, 2021, after the second formal interim analysis of efficacy, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be stopped and the results reported. Final follow-up visits occurred between January 28, 2021, and March 11, 2021. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years, and follow-up was completed by 97.9% of the participants; 50 participants (1.1%) had withdrawn consent and 49 (1.0%) had been lost to follow-up 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n<mark>【32】Table 1. </mark>Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline, Antithrombotic Therapy, and Surgical Treatments. Table 2.  Table 2. Trial Outcomes.\n\n【33】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group. The trial groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The mean age of the participants was 71 years, and 67.5% were men. The mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score was 4.2, and approximately half the participants were receiving oral anticoagulation at baseline. The median time from randomization to surgery was 0.6 days in both groups. The mean cross-clamp time was 86 minutes in the occlusion group and 82 minutes in the no-occlusion group, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes and 113 minutes, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The median chest-tube output was 520 ml in the occlusion group and 500 ml in the no-occlusion group. Reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery occurred in 94 participants (4.0%) in the occlusion group and in 95 (4.0%) in the no-occlusion group. The 30-day mortality was 3.7% in the occlusion group and 4.0% in the no-occlusion group.\n\n【34】At hospital discharge, 83.4% of the participants in the occlusion group and 81.0% of those in the no-occlusion group were receiving oral anticoagulation, and the corresponding values were 79.6% and 78.9% at the 1-year visit and 75.3% and 78.2% at the 3-year visit. More information regarding the use of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants during follow-up is provided in Table S1.\n\n【35】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Cumulative Incidence of Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【37】The participants in the occlusion group underwent left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication, and those in the no-occlusion did not undergo left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery; all participants were expected to receive usual care. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.\n\n【38】The validity of the proportional-hazards assumption was assessed with the use of a log–log plot 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. Ischemic stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 1 )</u>. During the first 30 days after surgery, a primary-outcome event occurred in 53 participants (2.2%) in the occlusion group and in 65 (2.7%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18). After 30 days, a primary-outcome event occurred in 61 participants (2.7%) in the occlusion group and in 103 (4.6%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80).\n\n【39】Secondary and Safety Outcomes\n-----------------------------\n\n【40】Ischemic stroke occurred in 109 participants (4.6%) in the occlusion group and in 164 (6.9%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84). Death occurred in 538 participants in the occlusion group (22.6%) and in 537 (22.5%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13). The cause of death was attributed to stroke in 1.3% of the trial participants 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Hospitalization for heart failure (either prolongation of index hospitalization or new hospitalization) occurred in 183 participants (7.7%) in the occlusion group and in 162 (6.8%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.40). The incidence of major bleeding or myocardial infarction was similar in the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】Additional Analyses\n-------------------\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of the Effect of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion or No Occlusion on Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【43】The sizes of the squares are proportional to the precision of the estimates. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible. Atrial fibrillation or flutter is based on the rhythm at baseline electrocardiography, and the comparator is any other rhythm. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. TIA denotes transient ischemic attack.\n\n【44】The effect of left atrial appendage occlusion on the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was consistent across subgroups 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The results of the primary-outcome analysis were also consistent with those of the per-protocol, as-treated, and intention-to-treat analyses and with those of the analysis that considered death as a competing risk 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The intention-to-treat analysis included the participants who did not undergo surgery in addition to those in the primary analysis population.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In LAAOS III, among participants with atrial fibrillation and risk factors for stroke, the risk of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic thromboembolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during cardiac surgery than without it. On the basis of the Kaplan–Meier estimates, the number of participants — with characteristics similar to those enrolled in the current trial — needed to undergo concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion during cardiac surgery to prevent one stroke over the period of 5 years was 37 (95% CI, 22 to 111). Several methods were used to perform concomitant occlusion during cardiac surgery, most of which incurred minimal additional cost and were performed without perioperative complications. No significant increase in the risk of heart failure or major bleeding was observed with the procedure.\n\n【47】The left atrial appendage is a source of atrial natriuretic peptide, and it has been hypothesized that removal of the appendage might impair renal clearance of salt and water, thereby increasing the risk of heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> A recent nonrandomized study has supported this hypothesis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our trial, we did not observe an increase in hospitalization for heart failure, either early after surgery or during long-term follow-up.\n\n【48】Anticoagulation is the mainstay of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> because it is highly effective. Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke by two thirds, and direct oral anticoagulants are even more effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Although anticoagulation is limited by the increased risk of bleeding, guidelines conclude that the risk–benefit analysis strongly favors lifetime use of oral anticoagulation in the majority of higher-risk patients. Despite these well-established benefits, anticoagulation is limited by problems that include incorrect dosing, temporary interruptions for medical reasons, nonadherence to the prescribed therapy, and, for vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces the risk of stroke by means of a different mechanism from that of anticoagulants, and its effects appear to be additive to those of oral anticoagulation. These additive effects are at least partly due to the continuous and permanent protection against embolic stroke provided by the procedure, which addresses some of the limitations of long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【49】We observed a high rate of stroke in the first 30 days after surgery as compared with the rest of follow-up. This finding is consistent with observations in other studies examining the risk of stroke among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Analyses of the primary outcome in our trial suggested a larger difference between the trial groups after 30 days than during the first 30 days (with hazard ratios of 0.82 \\[95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18\\] during the first 30 days after surgery and 0.58 \\[95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80\\] after 30 days). Early after surgery, some strokes are probably related to the surgery itself (e.g., aortic and intracardiac manipulation), factors against which occlusion is not likely to be effective. After the perioperative period, a greater proportion of strokes are caused by cardiac thromboembolism related to atrial fibrillation, for which occlusion is effective.\n\n【50】LAAOS III did not compare left atrial appendage occlusion with anticoagulation, and it would be incorrect to conclude that occlusion at the time of surgery should be considered as a replacement for anticoagulation. Whereas anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke by approximately two thirds, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> in LAAOS III, concomitant occlusion reduced the risk of stroke by approximately one third. A factor that offsets the possibly smaller reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke with left atrial appendage occlusion is the anticoagulant-related risk of hemorrhagic stroke, a risk that is not present in patients who undergo surgical occlusion and do not receive oral anticoagulants. Without a trial that directly compares oral anticoagulation with left atrial appendage occlusion, it remains uncertain whether occlusion can replace anticoagulation. Our trial therefore does not support concomitant surgical occlusion as a replacement for oral anticoagulation.\n\n【51】The results of LAAOS III have important implications for the use of nonpharmacologic therapies to prevent embolic stroke. In our trial, surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage provided additional protection against stroke when added to anticoagulation. Percutaneous endovascular occlusion devices may also be effective as a complement to anticoagulation rather than as a replacement, but this would require testing. There are notable differences between surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage and occlusion performed with a percutaneous endovascular device. Surgical occlusion is an extravascular procedure, whereas occlusion with an endovascular device may increase the risk of thrombus formation and embolism.\n\n【52】Limitations of our trial include the lack of information about the relative efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion as compared with oral anticoagulation. Furthermore, the findings from LAAOS III apply primarily to surgical occlusion of the appendage performed as a concomitant procedure and not to stand-alone surgical or endovascular occlusion. We cannot discern from our results whether all surgical closure methods are comparable, and we did not examine whether occlusion was sustained over follow-up.\n\n【53】This trial showed that among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network , Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute through the Population Health Research Institute , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada , the Request for Applications Program–Research Strategic Initiatives of Hamilton Health Sciences , the Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally , and McMaster University Surgical Associates .</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Whitlock reports receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche, grant support and honoraria from Boehringer Ingelheim, and consulting fees from AtriCure and PhaseBio; Dr. Belley-Cote, receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche; Dr. Healey, receiving grant support and lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Sharma, receiving grant support and consulting fees from Bayer, grant support and fees for trial leadership from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and fees for trial leadership from Portola; Dr. Budera, receiving consulting fees from AtriCure; Dr. Devereaux, receiving grant support form Abbott Diagnostics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche Diagnostics, and Siemens and donated products from Philips Healthcare; Dr. Boening, receiving grant support and advisory board fees from Somahlution, advisory board fees from Nordic Pharma, grant support and honoraria from Zoll, honoraria from Abiomed, and consulting fees from B.

Atrial switches utilize atrial-level prosthetic or pericardial baffles to shunt pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve to the right (systemic) ventricle and, vice versa, to shunt systemic venous return across the mitral valve to the left (sub-pulmonary) ventricle. Baffle leaks and discrete obstructions are well described short and long term complications of atrial switch procedures and they are often amenable to percutaneous catheter directed interventions. This phenomenon is one that any provider caring for adult patients with congenital heart disease should be familiar with. Non-arteriolar pulmonary hypertension with very large V waves seen in cardiac catheterization is the most important clue to diagnosis. Initial medical therapy is supportive, but we would advise extreme caution with pulmonary vasodilators as they may precipitate significant pulmonary edema in these patients.

The procedure can be performed during cardiac surgery undertaken for other reasons.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial involving participants with atrial fibrillation and a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk of stroke) who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery for another indication. The participants were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage during surgery; all the participants were expected to receive usual care, including oral anticoagulation, during follow-up. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging) or systemic embolism. The participants, research personnel, and primary care physicians (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group, with a mean age of 71 years and a mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 4.2. The participants were followed for a mean of 3.8 years. A total of 92.1% of the participants received the assigned procedure, and at 3 years, 76.8% of the participants continued to receive oral anticoagulation. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001). The incidence of perioperative bleeding, heart failure, or death did not differ significantly between the trial groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among participants with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; LAAOS III ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01561651 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 VISUAL ABSTRACT  \nLeft Atrial Appendage Occlusion during Cardiac Surgery to Prevent Stroke\n\n【12】Atrial fibrillation is common in elderly patients 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and is responsible for approximately a quarter of ischemic strokes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> many of which are cardioembolic 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and originate from the left atrial appendage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Oral anticoagulation most likely reduces thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage and has proven efficacy and safety in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, oral anticoagulation is limited by nonadherence to prescribed medications, drug discontinuation, underdosing, and, for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. Left atrial appendage occlusion is hypothesized to reduce the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation, but this has not been proved in a randomized trial.\n\n【13】When patients with atrial fibrillation undergo cardiac surgery, concomitant occlusion of the left atrial appendage may be performed as an adjunctive procedure. We hypothesized that concomitant occlusion performed at the time of cardiac surgery would reduce the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation receiving usual care, including anticoagulation. If effective, concomitant occlusion would provide protection against ischemic stroke in addition to the protection provided by anticoagulant therapy. Once performed, the effects of the procedure are permanent.\n\n【14】We conducted the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS III) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion in participants with a history of atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether concomitant occlusion would prevent ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in participants who continued to receive usual care, including anticoagulation.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】LAAOS III was a multicenter, randomized trial that was funded by peer-reviewed funding sources. The Population Health Research Institute was the sponsor, served as the coordinating center, and was responsible for the maintenance of the database, validation and analyses of the data, and trial coordination. The funders had no role in the design or conduct of the trial; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the preparation of the manuscript. The trial was designed by the first and last authors, overseen by the steering committee, and carried out by the trial investigators 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The ethics committee at each participating trial site approved the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【18】Participants\n------------\n\n【19】We enrolled patients 18 years of age or older who were scheduled to undergo cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and had a history of atrial fibrillation and a score of at least 2 on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. We excluded patients undergoing off-pump surgery, mechanical-valve implantation, heart transplantation, surgery for complex congenital heart disease, or isolated implantation of a left ventricular assist device; those with a previous surgery that involved opening the pericardium; and those who had previously undergone implantation of a left atrial appendage closure device. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before enrollment.\n\n【20】Procedures\n----------\n\n【21】The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, with the use of a Web-based randomization system, to undergo or not undergo occlusion of the left atrial appendage at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. Randomization was performed according to a computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to trial site, with varying block sizes of 2 and 4. The participants, trial personnel, and clinicians caring for the participants (other than the surgeons) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. A confidential email that indicated the assigned procedure for the participant was sent only to the surgeons just before surgery. In a follow-up email 24 hours after randomization, the surgeons provided information on whether they had complied with performing the assigned procedure, the method used to perform the surgical occlusion, and whether the occlusion was successful. Surgical reports indicated only that participants were enrolled in LAAOS III and may have undergone occlusion of the left atrial appendage. Surgeons and the intraoperative teams were not involved with ongoing management of antithrombotic therapy or further collection of the data.\n\n【22】Left atrial appendage occlusion was performed during cardiac surgery with the use of any of the following techniques: amputation and closure (preferred), stapler closure, double-layer linear closure from within the atrium in participants undergoing minithoracotomy (this approach required transesophageal echocardiographic confirmation of the occlusion), or closure with an approved surgical occlusion device 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Neither percutaneous closure nor purse-string closure was permitted. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was recommended to confirm successful closure. If the initial closure had failed, additional maneuvers were performed immediately to rectify the failure. If a participant had a thrombus identified in the appendage, the left atrium was opened to remove the thrombus before occlusion.\n\n【23】Participants were followed up by telephone or in person (primarily by telephone) by local trial personnel at 30 days and then every 6 months to a common trial end date (the date of the final visit was January 28, 2021). Physicians who oversaw antithrombotic therapy were unaware of trial-group assignments. Participants were expected to receive guideline-directed stroke prevention and other usual care. Trial personnel collected data on anticoagulation use and, if a participant was not receiving oral anticoagulation during follow-up, on the specific reasons for not doing so. Every 6 months, the participants were questioned with the use of a validated stroke questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> to determine if symptoms indicating a possible stroke had occurred. If such symptoms were reported, source documentation was obtained. Trial centers reported strokes or systemic emboli with specialized report forms. An adjudication committee consisting of physicians trained in the protocol definitions reviewed all strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and systemic emboli in a blinded manner; all strokes and transient ischemic attacks were reviewed by stroke neurologists.\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome was the first occurrence of ischemic stroke (including transient ischemic attack with positive neuroimaging 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> ) or noncerebral systemic embolism during follow-up. Strokes of undetermined cause were included as ischemic strokes in the primary analysis. Secondary outcomes included any stroke or noncerebral systemic embolism; ischemic stroke, noncerebral systemic embolism, or death from any cause; death from any cause; 30-day mortality; the volume of chest-tube drainage in the first 24 hours after surgery; reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery; hospitalization for heart failure; myocardial infarction; and major bleeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Definitions of trial outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Statistical Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【27】The primary hypothesis was that the risk of stroke or systemic embolism would be lower with surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage added to usual care than with no occlusion added to usual care. Assuming a rate of a primary-outcome event of 2.5% per year in the no-occlusion group and allowing for a rate of crossover of 7% and a rate of loss to follow-up due to nonstroke-related death of 2% per year, we estimated that a sample size of 4700 participants, with a median follow-up of 4 years, would provide the trial 80% power to detect a 25% lower relative risk of a primary-outcome event in the occlusion group than in the no-occlusion group. The estimated rate of a primary-outcome event in the no-occlusion group was based on the assumption that the mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score would be at least 2.3 and that 65% of the participants would continue to receive anticoagulation (a vitamin K antagonist in 45% and a direct oral anticoagulant in 20%) over the follow-up period.\n\n【28】The primary analysis included all the participants who underwent cardiac surgery. All the participants were followed, irrespective of whether they had undergone surgery, as long as they did not withdraw consent. A time-to-event analysis was used to test the primary hypothesis with the use of Kaplan–Meier survival curves and log-rank testing. The treatment effect was estimated as a hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval, which was derived with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model. The proportional-hazards assumption was tested with the use of a graphical method 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the unblinded data and performed two prespecified interim analyses of efficacy when 50% and 75% of expected primary-outcome events had occurred. The trial could be stopped if the between-group difference in the incidence of a primary-outcome event was at least 4 standard deviations at the first interim analysis or at least 3 standard deviations at the second. These boundaries needed to be crossed in two consecutive analyses performed at least 3 months apart. Because these boundaries were extreme, we did not adjust the final significance level. We performed a landmark analysis of the primary outcome beyond 30 days. Additional Cox models were used to evaluate interactions between trial-group assignment and subgroups of interest.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【31】From July 2012 through October 2018, a total of 4811 participants from 105 centers in 27 countries were randomly assigned to undergo (2400 participants) or not undergo (2411 participants) left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication. On January 28, 2021, after the second formal interim analysis of efficacy, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be stopped and the results reported. Final follow-up visits occurred between January 28, 2021, and March 11, 2021. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.8 years, and follow-up was completed by 97.9% of the participants; 50 participants (1.1%) had withdrawn consent and 49 (1.0%) had been lost to follow-up 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n<mark>【32】Table 1. </mark>Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline, Antithrombotic Therapy, and Surgical Treatments. Table 2.  Table 2. Trial Outcomes.\n\n【33】The primary analysis population included 2379 participants in the occlusion group and 2391 in the no-occlusion group. The trial groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The mean age of the participants was 71 years, and 67.5% were men. The mean CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score was 4.2, and approximately half the participants were receiving oral anticoagulation at baseline. The median time from randomization to surgery was 0.6 days in both groups. The mean cross-clamp time was 86 minutes in the occlusion group and 82 minutes in the no-occlusion group, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes and 113 minutes, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The median chest-tube output was 520 ml in the occlusion group and 500 ml in the no-occlusion group. Reexploration for bleeding within the first 48 hours after surgery occurred in 94 participants (4.0%) in the occlusion group and in 95 (4.0%) in the no-occlusion group. The 30-day mortality was 3.7% in the occlusion group and 4.0% in the no-occlusion group.\n\n【34】At hospital discharge, 83.4% of the participants in the occlusion group and 81.0% of those in the no-occlusion group were receiving oral anticoagulation, and the corresponding values were 79.6% and 78.9% at the 1-year visit and 75.3% and 78.2% at the 3-year visit. More information regarding the use of vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants during follow-up is provided in Table S1.\n\n【35】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n<mark>【36】Figure 1. </mark> Figure 1. Cumulative Incidence of Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【37】The participants in the occlusion group underwent left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication, and those in the no-occlusion did not undergo left atrial appendage occlusion at the time of cardiac surgery; all participants were expected to receive usual care. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.\n\n【38】The validity of the proportional-hazards assumption was assessed with the use of a log–log plot 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. Ischemic stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 114 participants (4.8%) in the occlusion group and in 168 (7.0%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.53 to 0.85; P=0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 1 )</u>. During the first 30 days after surgery, a primary-outcome event occurred in 53 participants (2.2%) in the occlusion group and in 65 (2.7%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18). After 30 days, a primary-outcome event occurred in 61 participants (2.7%) in the occlusion group and in 103 (4.6%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80).\n\n【39】Secondary and Safety Outcomes\n-----------------------------\n\n【40】Ischemic stroke occurred in 109 participants (4.6%) in the occlusion group and in 164 (6.9%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84). Death occurred in 538 participants in the occlusion group (22.6%) and in 537 (22.5%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.13). The cause of death was attributed to stroke in 1.3% of the trial participants 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Hospitalization for heart failure (either prolongation of index hospitalization or new hospitalization) occurred in 183 participants (7.7%) in the occlusion group and in 162 (6.8%) in the no-occlusion group (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.40). The incidence of major bleeding or myocardial infarction was similar in the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】Additional Analyses\n-------------------\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analysis of the Effect of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion or No Occlusion on Stroke or Systemic Arterial Embolism.\n\n【43】The sizes of the squares are proportional to the precision of the estimates. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible. Atrial fibrillation or flutter is based on the rhythm at baseline electrocardiography, and the comparator is any other rhythm. Scores on the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scale reflect the risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation; scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater risk. TIA denotes transient ischemic attack.\n\n【44】The effect of left atrial appendage occlusion on the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism was consistent across subgroups 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The results of the primary-outcome analysis were also consistent with those of the per-protocol, as-treated, and intention-to-treat analyses and with those of the analysis that considered death as a competing risk 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The intention-to-treat analysis included the participants who did not undergo surgery in addition to those in the primary analysis population.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In LAAOS III, among participants with atrial fibrillation and risk factors for stroke, the risk of the composite outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic thromboembolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during cardiac surgery than without it. On the basis of the Kaplan–Meier estimates, the number of participants — with characteristics similar to those enrolled in the current trial — needed to undergo concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion during cardiac surgery to prevent one stroke over the period of 5 years was 37 (95% CI, 22 to 111). Several methods were used to perform concomitant occlusion during cardiac surgery, most of which incurred minimal additional cost and were performed without perioperative complications. No significant increase in the risk of heart failure or major bleeding was observed with the procedure.\n\n【47】The left atrial appendage is a source of atrial natriuretic peptide, and it has been hypothesized that removal of the appendage might impair renal clearance of salt and water, thereby increasing the risk of heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> A recent nonrandomized study has supported this hypothesis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our trial, we did not observe an increase in hospitalization for heart failure, either early after surgery or during long-term follow-up.\n\n【48】Anticoagulation is the mainstay of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> because it is highly effective. Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke by two thirds, and direct oral anticoagulants are even more effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Although anticoagulation is limited by the increased risk of bleeding, guidelines conclude that the risk–benefit analysis strongly favors lifetime use of oral anticoagulation in the majority of higher-risk patients. Despite these well-established benefits, anticoagulation is limited by problems that include incorrect dosing, temporary interruptions for medical reasons, nonadherence to the prescribed therapy, and, for vitamin K antagonists, poor control of the international normalized ratio. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage reduces the risk of stroke by means of a different mechanism from that of anticoagulants, and its effects appear to be additive to those of oral anticoagulation. These additive effects are at least partly due to the continuous and permanent protection against embolic stroke provided by the procedure, which addresses some of the limitations of long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【49】We observed a high rate of stroke in the first 30 days after surgery as compared with the rest of follow-up. This finding is consistent with observations in other studies examining the risk of stroke among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Analyses of the primary outcome in our trial suggested a larger difference between the trial groups after 30 days than during the first 30 days (with hazard ratios of 0.82 \\[95% CI, 0.57 to 1.18\\] during the first 30 days after surgery and 0.58 \\[95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80\\] after 30 days). Early after surgery, some strokes are probably related to the surgery itself (e.g., aortic and intracardiac manipulation), factors against which occlusion is not likely to be effective. After the perioperative period, a greater proportion of strokes are caused by cardiac thromboembolism related to atrial fibrillation, for which occlusion is effective.\n\n【50】LAAOS III did not compare left atrial appendage occlusion with anticoagulation, and it would be incorrect to conclude that occlusion at the time of surgery should be considered as a replacement for anticoagulation. Whereas anticoagulation reduces the risk of stroke by approximately two thirds, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> in LAAOS III, concomitant occlusion reduced the risk of stroke by approximately one third. A factor that offsets the possibly smaller reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke with left atrial appendage occlusion is the anticoagulant-related risk of hemorrhagic stroke, a risk that is not present in patients who undergo surgical occlusion and do not receive oral anticoagulants. Without a trial that directly compares oral anticoagulation with left atrial appendage occlusion, it remains uncertain whether occlusion can replace anticoagulation. Our trial therefore does not support concomitant surgical occlusion as a replacement for oral anticoagulation.\n\n【51】The results of LAAOS III have important implications for the use of nonpharmacologic therapies to prevent embolic stroke. In our trial, surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage provided additional protection against stroke when added to anticoagulation. Percutaneous endovascular occlusion devices may also be effective as a complement to anticoagulation rather than as a replacement, but this would require testing. There are notable differences between surgical occlusion of the left atrial appendage and occlusion performed with a percutaneous endovascular device. Surgical occlusion is an extravascular procedure, whereas occlusion with an endovascular device may increase the risk of thrombus formation and embolism.\n\n【52】Limitations of our trial include the lack of information about the relative efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion as compared with oral anticoagulation. Furthermore, the findings from LAAOS III apply primarily to surgical occlusion of the appendage performed as a concomitant procedure and not to stand-alone surgical or endovascular occlusion. We cannot discern from our results whether all surgical closure methods are comparable, and we did not examine whether occlusion was sustained over follow-up.\n\n【53】This trial showed that among patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone cardiac surgery, most of whom continued to receive ongoing antithrombotic therapy, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism was lower with concomitant left atrial appendage occlusion performed during the surgery than without it.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network , Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute through the Population Health Research Institute , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada , the Request for Applications Program–Research Strategic Initiatives of Hamilton Health Sciences , the Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally , and McMaster University Surgical Associates .</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Whitlock reports receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche, grant support and honoraria from Boehringer Ingelheim, and consulting fees from AtriCure and PhaseBio; Dr. Belley-Cote, receiving grant support from Bayer and Roche; Dr. Healey, receiving grant support and lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Sharma, receiving grant support and consulting fees from Bayer, grant support and fees for trial leadership from Bristol-Myers Squibb, and fees for trial leadership from Portola; Dr. Budera, receiving consulting fees from AtriCure; Dr. Devereaux, receiving grant support form Abbott Diagnostics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Roche Diagnostics, and Siemens and donated products from Philips Healthcare; Dr. Boening, receiving grant support and advisory board fees from Somahlution, advisory board fees from Nordic Pharma, grant support and honoraria from Zoll, honoraria from Abiomed, and consulting fees from B.

Atrial switches utilize atrial-level prosthetic or pericardial baffles to shunt pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve to the right (systemic) ventricle and, vice versa, to shunt systemic venous return across the mitral valve to the left (sub-pulmonary) ventricle. Baffle leaks and discrete obstructions are well described short and long term complications of atrial switch procedures and they are often amenable to percutaneous catheter directed interventions. This phenomenon is one that any provider caring for adult patients with congenital heart disease should be familiar with. Non-arteriolar pulmonary hypertension with very large V waves seen in cardiac catheterization is the most important clue to diagnosis. Initial medical therapy is supportive, but we would advise extreme caution with pulmonary vasodilators as they may precipitate significant pulmonary edema in these patients.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser in patients with refractory angina and left ventricular free-wall ischemia that was not amenable to direct coronary revascularization.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In a prospective, controlled, multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 91 patients to undergo transmyocardial revascularization and 101 patients to receive continued medical treatment. The severity of angina (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society \\[CCS\\] classification), quality of life, and cardiac perfusion (as assessed by thallium-201 scanning) were evaluated at base line and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】At 12 months, angina had improved by at least two CCS classes in 72 percent of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, as compared with 13 percent of the patients assigned to medical treatment who continued medical treatment (P<0.001). Patients in the transmyocardial-revascularization group also had a significantly improved quality of life as compared with the medical-treatment group. Myocardial perfusion improved by 20 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and worsened by 27 percent in the medical-treatment group (P=0.002). In the first year of follow-up, 2 percent of patients assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization were hospitalized because of unstable angina, as compared with 69 percent of patients assigned to medical treatment (P<0.001). The perioperative mortality rate associated with transmyocardial revascularization was 3 percent. The rate of survival at 12 months was 85 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 79 percent in the medical-treatment group (P=0.50).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In patients with angina refractory to medical treatment and coronary artery disease that precluded coronary-artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, transmyocardial revascularization improved cardiac perfusion and clinical status over a 12-month period.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】In the 1950s, Goldman and associates 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and Massimo and Boffi 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> proposed that natural or artificial conduits could be implanted in the subendocardium to direct left ventricular blood through the coronary sinusoids and into ischemic areas of the myocardium. In 1968, after extensive experiments in animals, Sen and colleagues 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> described transmyocardial revascularization through transmural channels created with a 16-gauge intravenous cannula. In 1981, Mirhoseini and Cayton 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> used a laser to create transmyocardial channels in animals; five years later, Okada and colleagues 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> did the same in humans. Investigators have continued to test transmyocardial revascularization in both animals 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-9 </a></sup></u> and humans. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In a nonrandomized, longitudinal trial undertaken to establish the safety, efficacy, and value of transmyocardial revascularization performed with a laser in 201 patients at eight U.S. centers, angina was relieved and cardiac perfusion improved in 75 percent of the patients over a 12-month period. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to examine further the safety and efficacy of transmyocardial revascularization in patients with refractory angina and documented left ventricular free-wall ischemia that was not amenable to direct coronary revascularization and to compare this treatment with maximal medical therapy.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】Between July 1995 and September 1997, 12 U.S. centers participated in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment. By means of randomization at a central institution, patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to undergo transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser (the Heart Laser System, PLC Medical Systems, Franklin, Mass.) or to receive continued medical treatment. Patients were selected by the attending cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, or surgeon after a review of clinical symptoms, recent angiograms, and perfusion scans.\n\n【16】To be enrolled in the trial, patients were required to meet the following criteria: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III or IV angina that was refractory to medical treatment, reversible ischemia of the left ventricular free wall, and coronary disease that was not amenable to coronary-artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Patients whose coronary disease was severe and diffuse or who did not have a target vessel or conduit suitable for grafting were considered to have disease not amenable to the latter two procedures. Patients were excluded if the left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 20 percent or if they had a concurrent major illness.\n\n【17】Crossover from medical treatment to transmyocardial revascularization was allowed if a patient had unstable angina that necessitated intravenous antianginal therapy for 48 hours or more in an intensive care unit. After crossover, patients were followed for an additional 12 months, regardless of how long they had been in the group assigned to medical treatment. These patients were considered part of the medical-treatment group until crossover, after which they were followed separately.\n\n【18】Clinical Evaluation\n-------------------\n\n【19】The patients' clinical status was evaluated with respect to CCS angina class, use of cardioactive medications, and responses on quality-of-life questionnaires. Angina was classified at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months according to CCS guidelines. To eliminate potential bias, angina was also classified in a blinded manner by an independent evaluator. Success at follow-up was defined as an angina class at least two classes below that at base line.\n\n【20】To study fully the effects of transmyocardial revascularization in comparison with medical treatment, both intention-to-treat and “on-treatment” analyses of angina were conducted. The intention-to-treat analysis, which included patients who remained in the medical-treatment group as well as patients who were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization as part of the medical-treatment group, provided a conservative estimate of the effect of transmyocardial revascularization, preventing overly optimistic conclusions. The on-treatment analysis, which did not include patients who were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization, was considered the best way to evaluate the results from a clinical perspective. Thus, patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization were compared first with all the patients assigned to medical treatment and then separately with those assigned to medical treatment and not crossed over.\n\n【21】Quality of life was assessed in all patients at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months during follow-up. At these times, each patient completed two questionnaires: the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Single-Photon-Emission Computed Tomography\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The extent and reversibility of myocardial ischemia at rest and during exercise were assessed in each patient at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients underwent thallium-201 single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) with pharmacologic stress testing (with dipyridamole at a dose of 0.56 mg per kilogram of body weight, to a maximum of 6 mg) and four-hour redistribution–reinjection imaging. All the images were processed according to a standard protocol by a single technician at Cedars–Sinai Medical Center. Every image was then analyzed by an experienced nuclear cardiologist who was unaware of the patient's identity, treatment assignment, and scan date.\n\n【24】Each image was divided into three cross sections (apical, midventricular, and basal) parallel to the atrioventricular groove. Each of these cross sections was then divided into eight segments, which were individually analyzed to assess perfusion status. Each segment was examined for the presence of normal tissue, a fixed defect (scar), a reversible defect (ischemic or hibernating myocardium), or both fixed and reversible defects. The sum of the number of segments in each perfusion category is expressed as a percentage of all 24 segments and used to characterize the perfusion of the left side of the heart. Perfusion results at 3, 6, and 12 months were compared with the scores at base line for each patient.\n\n【25】Transmyocardial Revascularization\n---------------------------------\n\n【26】The technique of transmyocardial revascularization has been described in detail elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Transmural channels approximately 1 mm in diameter were created with a single pulse of the carbon dioxide laser (peak power, 850 W) through the left ventricle. Approximately one channel was created per square centimeter of myocardial surface. Transmural penetration by the laser was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses were performed with a two-sided standard t-test, paired t-test, or analysis of variance for normally distributed continuous variables; with a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or the Kruskal–Wallis test for variables not normally distributed; with a two-sided chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for discrete variables; and with the Kaplan–Meier test or a log-rank test for survival free of cardiac events. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【29】To determine whether specific outcomes, such as treatment success or mortality, could be predicted on the basis of the patient's characteristics at base line, multivariate logistic-regression analyses were conducted with stepwise regression (SAS software, version 6.12, SAS, Cary, N.C.).\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Characteristics of the Study Population\n---------------------------------------\n\n【32】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Overview of the Outcomes of Patients Assigned to Undergo Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), Those Assigned to Receive Medical Treatment Alone, and Those Crossed over from Medical Treatment to TMR.\n\n【33】Numbers in parentheses are numbers of patients. “Procedure” refers to any additional revascularization procedure, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary-artery bypass grafting.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Randomization.\n\n【34】Ninety-one patients were randomly assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization, and 101 patients were assigned to receive medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The groups were balanced at base line with respect to sex, age, cardiac status, medical history, and cardiac risk factors 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Approximately 60 percent of the patients in each group were considered to be at high risk for a poor outcome as determined by the established scoring system of the Cleveland Clinic for surgical revascularization. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> All the patients in both groups had severe coronary disease with lesions in all three major vessels.\n\n【35】Results of Transmyocardial Revascularization\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】During surgery, a mean (±SD) of 36±13 channels were created, 30±8 of which were confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography to be transmural. Epicardial sutures were needed for hemostasis in 1 percent of the patients. There were no intraoperative deaths. The median stay in the intensive care unit for the patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization was two days, for a median hospital stay of seven days.\n\n【37】Clinical Status\n---------------\n\n【38】Two patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization and four assigned to medical treatment were lost to follow-up. Two of the four patients in the medical-treatment group had been crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization; thus, the six patients were evenly distributed among the three groups analyzed 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> and their exclusion did not modify the results, regardless of the outcome.\n\n【39】### _Angina Class_\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Relief of Angina According to Treatment Group.\n\n【41】Results are shown for both intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses. The intention-to-treat analysis included all patients assigned to the medical-treatment group, including those crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization (TMR). Relief was defined as an improvement in angina by at least two Canadian Cardiovascular Society classes from base line. The T bars indicate standard deviations. Asterisks indicate P<0.001 for the comparison with the transmyocardial-revascularization group.\n\n【42】With success at follow-up defined as a reduction of at least two angina classes as compared with base line, transmyocardial revascularization was significantly more successful in both analyses 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. At three months, 67 percent of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, 20 percent of those assigned to medical treatment (including those crossed over), and 6 percent of those assigned to medical treatment and not crossed over had a clinically successful result (P<0.001 for the comparison between the transmyocardial-revascularization group and each medical-treatment group) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. At 6 months, the success rates were 67 percent, 27 percent, and 6 percent, respectively, and at 12 months, the success rates were 72 percent, 43 percent, and 13 percent, respectively (P<0.001 for both sets of comparisons).\n\n【43】A blinded, independent assessment of angina was conducted in addition to the on-site evaluations. For 80 percent of the patients, the result of the independent assessment was within one CCS class of the result of the on-site assessment, indicating consistency in the evaluations. When the on-site and independent evaluations were compared, no significant differences were found (P=0.20).\n\n【44】### _Cardioactive Medications_\n\n【45】Changes in the use of cardioactive medications (nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers) from base line to follow-up were analyzed for their potential influence on outcomes with respect to angina. The clinical success of transmyocardial revascularization was not due to changes in medication; the use of medications decreased or remained unchanged in 83 percent of the patients in whom transmyocardial revascularization was successful. Conversely, the use of medications increased or remained unchanged in 86 percent of the patients assigned to medical treatment.\n\n【46】### _Quality of Life_\n\n【47】According to the responses on the SF-36 questionnaire, patients in the transmyocardial-revascularization group had a greater improvement in their quality of life (38 percent improvement) than patients in the medical-treatment group (6 percent improvement) as compared with base line at three months (P<0.001). This difference was also significant at 6 and 12 months (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). For each of 15 components of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, transmyocardial revascularization was associated with a significantly better result than medical treatment.\n\n【48】Spect Scans\n-----------\n\n【49】The rates of compliance with the protocol and the proportion of scans that were usable during follow-up were similar in the two groups (81 percent and 72 percent, respectively, in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 79 percent and 69 percent, respectively, in the medical-treatment group). The mean number of segments with reversible perfusion defects at enrollment was 7.1±3.7 per patient in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 6.8±3.3 in the medical-treatment group (P=0.60). At enrollment, the mean number of segments that were judged to have fixed defects was 9.0±3.6 in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 9.0±3.3 in the medical-treatment group (P=0.96).\n\n【50】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Change in Left-Sided Myocardial Perfusion during Follow-up, According to Treatment Assignment.\n\n【51】The percent change in myocardial perfusion differed significantly between the groups at each time point (P=0.001 at 3 months, P=0.02 at 6 months, and P=0.002 at 12 months). The percentage change in myocardial perfusion is calculated as the number of defects at base line minus the number of defects at follow-up, divided by the number of defects at base line. Numbers shown represent results from patients with usable data. TMR denotes transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【52】Medications were not stopped before the performance of SPECT imaging. Use of medications was balanced between the groups at each time point. Figure 3 shows the percent change in left-sided myocardial perfusion at 3, 6, and 12 months. In the group assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, reversible ischemia decreased by an average of 1.5 segments per patient at 3 months, 0.8 segment at 6 months, and 1.4 segments at 12 months. In contrast, in the group assigned to medical treatment, reversible ischemia increased by an average of 0.8, 0.8, and 1.3 segments, respectively (P=0.001 for the comparison between groups at 3 months, P=0.02 for the comparison at 6 months, and P=0.002 for the comparison at 12 months). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any of these time points in the number of fixed defects per patient.\n\n【53】Morbidity\n---------\n\n【54】During the first 30 days after transmyocardial revascularization, 6 patients (7 percent) had acute myocardial infarction, 10 (11 percent) had congestive heart failure, 7 (8 percent) had ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and 1 (1 percent) had unstable angina. Sixty-two patients had no complications, 18 had one, 7 had two, 1 had three, 1 had four, and 2 had five. The only complication resulting specifically from the surgical procedure was an accidental laser-induced injury of the mitral apparatus, which was repaired, in one patient.\n\n【55】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Event-free Survival According to Treatment Group.\n\n【56】Cardiac events were defined as acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or class IV angina. TMR denotes transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【57】During the 12-month follow-up period, the rate of hospital admission due to unstable angina was 2 percent among patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization and 69 percent among patients assigned to medical treatment (P<0.001). Rates of admission to the intensive care unit during the 12-month period were 0.02 admission per patient in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 1.37 admissions per patient in the medical-treatment group. There was no significant difference in the rate of freedom from acute myocardial infarction between patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization (87 percent) and those assigned to medical treatment who did not cross over (80 percent, P=0.24), but the rate of freedom from unstable angina was significantly higher after transmyocardial revascularization (84 percent, as compared with 25 percent after medical treatment only; P<0.001). The proportion of patients who did not die and who were free of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and class IV angina was also significantly higher in the transmyocardial-revascularization group (66 percent, as compared with 11 percent in the medical-treatment group; P<0.001). Event-free survival is shown in Figure 4 .\n\n【58】Mortality\n---------\n\n【59】Table 2.  Table 2. Causes of Death According to Treatment Group.\n\n【60】There were no intraoperative deaths among the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization; the 12-month survival rate was 85 percent. In comparison, the 12-month survival rate was 79 percent among the 41 medically treated patients who were not crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization (P=0.50). Of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, 3 (3 percent) died perioperatively, and 10 (11 percent) died from cardiac causes during follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【61】The sole predictor of perioperative mortality was the occurrence of unstable angina. The time between an occurrence of unstable angina and surgery was significantly related to the risk of perioperative death (P<0.001): the risk increased by a factor of 22.9 when the time between angina and surgery decreased to less than 2 weeks (1 to 7 days: 8 of 30 patients died \\[27 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 43 percent\\]; 8 to 14 days: 3 of 19 died \\[16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 32 percent\\]; ≥15 days: 1 of 102 died \\[1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 3 percent\\]) (P<0.001). A low left ventricular ejection fraction was a significant predictor of overall mortality in the transmyocardial-revascularization group (P=0.02). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction during the study was significantly associated with overall mortality in both groups (transmyocardial revascularization, P= 0.05; medical treatment, P=0.03). The treatment-group assignment was not predictive of mortality, confirming the similarity of overall mortality in the two groups.\n\n【62】Crossover Group\n---------------\n\n【63】Of the 101 patients assigned to medical treatment 60 (59 percent) were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization a mean of 107±89 days after randomization. Because of their unstable angina, these patients were considered to be at high risk for a poor outcome (Cleveland Clinic risk score, 9.3±3.6, as compared with a score of 5.8±2.9 at enrollment for all patients assigned to medical treatment, where a score of ≥5 indicates a high risk; P=0.02). During the first 30 days after surgery, 3 of the 60 patients (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction, 2 (3 percent) had unstable angina, 3 (5 percent) had arrhythmias, and 3 (5 percent) had congestive heart failure. One patient sustained laser-induced damage to the mitral apparatus during surgery. Twenty-three of the patients who were crossed over underwent the 12-month follow-up assessment of angina; 16 of these 23 patients (70 percent) had CCS class I or II angina, 3 (13 percent) had class III, and 4 (17 percent) had class IV.\n\n【64】Discussion\n----------\n\n【65】Before this study was conducted, the potential benefits of transmyocardial revascularization performed with a carbon dioxide laser had been observed in most of the 2500 patients who had undergone this treatment. A nonrandomized study of these patients showed significant improvement in symptoms and perfusion after the laser treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Whether this improvement would have occurred without transmyocardial revascularization was unknown. This question prompted the current randomized investigation.\n\n【66】In this study, the proportion of patients who had relief from angina was greater in the group assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization (72 percent) than in the patients in the group assigned to receive maximal medical therapy who did not cross over to transmyocardial revascularization (13 percent). This significant decrease in the patients' CCS class was confirmed by a blinded, independent assessment and with use of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Moreover, patients who were assigned to medical treatment had a rate of hospital admission for unstable angina of 69 percent, as compared with only 2 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group. Among patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization, relief of acute and chronic angina resulted in an improved quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire, and reduced use of antianginal medications.\n\n【67】In addition, myocardial perfusion improved after transmyocardial revascularization and worsened with medical treatment alone. The price of the benefits of transmyocardial revascularization was a 3 percent rate of perioperative mortality. If the procedure was deferred for two weeks, this rate decreased to 1 percent, making the mortality associated with transmyocardial revascularization less than that associated with coronary-artery bypass grafting. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Overall survival at 12 months was similar in the two groups (transmyocardial revascularization, 85 percent; medical treatment, 79 percent; P=0.50).\n\n【68】This study did not directly address the mechanisms underlying the benefits of transmyocardial revascularization; however, several inferences can be made. There may be a short-lived placebo effect. In a nonrandomized trial, long-term follow-up of patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization showed no change in the improvement in symptoms after 3 years (average CCS class, 3.8±0.4 at base line, 1.4±1.2 at 12 months, and 1.5±1.2 at 36 months). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The conversion of ischemic myocardi-um to infarcted myocardium may also improve anginal symptoms. In our study, however, the extent of fixed defects in perfusion over the 12-month period was similar in the two groups, and there was no significant increase in fixed defects after transmyocardial revascularization as compared with medical treatment. Denervation is another possible mechanism of the benefit. If this were the explanation, however, one would expect to see an increase in myocardial infarction, sudden death, and heart failure with transmyocardial revascularization — none of which increased in the patients assigned to this treatment.\n\n【69】Improved perfusion and relief of symptoms after transmyocardial revascularization could result from patent channels created by the laser or from laser-induced angiogenesis. Isolated anatomical evidence of patent channels has been reported. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,17 </a></sup></u> In addition, real-time, high-resolution contrast echocardiography has shown patent laser channels perfusing a 1.5-cm 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> section of myocardium with each systole. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> In our study, perfusion improved over a period of 12 months, indicating that the laser may increase perfusion by stimulating angiogenesis.\n\n【70】Although we assume that transmyocardial revascularization directly enhances myocardial perfusion, providing relief of angina, we cannot establish a direct correlation. Changes in clinical symptoms and changes on perfusion scans reflect two related but distinct phenomena, and in our study the degree of symptomatic improvement was not necessarily matched by the degree of improvement in the results on scanning. Symptoms and perfusion improved in most of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization but not in those assigned to medical treatment who did not cross over to transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【71】The option for crossover from the medical-treatment group to the transmyocardial-revascularization group was the greatest limitation of this study. Crossover was allowed as an incentive for patients assigned to maximal medical therapy to remain in the study if medical therapy failed. The attrition rate in this group was considerable because the condition of these patients did not improve substantially and because, by definition, they had unstable angina that required intravenous medication. Despite the limitation inherent in the crossover design, the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization showed improvement at three and six months as compared with their base-line values and as compared with values in their medically treated counterparts. In addition, although lifestyle changes can be limiting factors in clinical trials, there were no significant differences in lifestyle or medication use that might have influenced the outcomes.\n\n【72】In a recent report on a randomized study at a single center, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Schofield et al. concluded that transmyocardial revascularization should not be recommended because it did not significantly increase exercise capacity or 12-minute walking distance at 12 months. However, the patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization did have significantly decreased angina (as indicated by the CCS class), increased functional capacity, less need for antianginal medications, and fewer hospital admissions as compared with medically treated patients. With respect to exercise capacity and walking times, comparisons were made between the groups at each follow-up period, not between base line and follow-up within each group. The authors reported similar decreases in reversible defects in the two groups. However, they did not consider the effect of changes in fixed defects.\n\n【73】With regard to fixed defects, there was no significant change from base line to 12 months in the transmyocardial-revascularization group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> The medically treated group, however, had a significant increase in fixed defects from base line (38 segments \\[8 percent\\]) to 12 months (68 segments \\[17 percent\\]); in other words, reversible defects decreased when fixed defects increased, as ischemic areas became scarred. In addition, follow-up data on perfusion were pooled, and comparisons were again made between the groups rather than between base line and follow-up.\n\n【74】In general, the study by Schofield et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> is not closely comparable with our multicenter trial. Patients in our trial were much sicker (70 to 80 percent had CCS class IV angina at base line, as compared with 27 percent in the study by Schofield et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> ), and we did not exclude patients with unstable angina, whereas Schofield et al. did. If patients with unstable angina are excluded, the perioperative mortality rate in our study falls to 1 percent, which is less than the 5 percent reported in the other series. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【75】In summary, we conducted this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine the effect of transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser on symptoms and cardiac perfusion in patients with end-stage coronary disease. We found that transmyocardial revascularization significantly alleviated angina and improved cardiac perfusion in patients with severe angina that was refractory to conventional medical therapy or revascularization procedures.\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Philip T.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser in patients with refractory angina and left ventricular free-wall ischemia that was not amenable to direct coronary revascularization.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In a prospective, controlled, multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 91 patients to undergo transmyocardial revascularization and 101 patients to receive continued medical treatment. The severity of angina (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society \\[CCS\\] classification), quality of life, and cardiac perfusion (as assessed by thallium-201 scanning) were evaluated at base line and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】At 12 months, angina had improved by at least two CCS classes in 72 percent of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, as compared with 13 percent of the patients assigned to medical treatment who continued medical treatment (P<0.001). Patients in the transmyocardial-revascularization group also had a significantly improved quality of life as compared with the medical-treatment group. Myocardial perfusion improved by 20 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and worsened by 27 percent in the medical-treatment group (P=0.002). In the first year of follow-up, 2 percent of patients assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization were hospitalized because of unstable angina, as compared with 69 percent of patients assigned to medical treatment (P<0.001). The perioperative mortality rate associated with transmyocardial revascularization was 3 percent. The rate of survival at 12 months was 85 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 79 percent in the medical-treatment group (P=0.50).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In patients with angina refractory to medical treatment and coronary artery disease that precluded coronary-artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, transmyocardial revascularization improved cardiac perfusion and clinical status over a 12-month period.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】In the 1950s, Goldman and associates 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and Massimo and Boffi 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> proposed that natural or artificial conduits could be implanted in the subendocardium to direct left ventricular blood through the coronary sinusoids and into ischemic areas of the myocardium. In 1968, after extensive experiments in animals, Sen and colleagues 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> described transmyocardial revascularization through transmural channels created with a 16-gauge intravenous cannula. In 1981, Mirhoseini and Cayton 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> used a laser to create transmyocardial channels in animals; five years later, Okada and colleagues 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> did the same in humans. Investigators have continued to test transmyocardial revascularization in both animals 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-9 </a></sup></u> and humans. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】In a nonrandomized, longitudinal trial undertaken to establish the safety, efficacy, and value of transmyocardial revascularization performed with a laser in 201 patients at eight U.S. centers, angina was relieved and cardiac perfusion improved in 75 percent of the patients over a 12-month period. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> We conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to examine further the safety and efficacy of transmyocardial revascularization in patients with refractory angina and documented left ventricular free-wall ischemia that was not amenable to direct coronary revascularization and to compare this treatment with maximal medical therapy.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】Between July 1995 and September 1997, 12 U.S. centers participated in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment. By means of randomization at a central institution, patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to undergo transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser (the Heart Laser System, PLC Medical Systems, Franklin, Mass.) or to receive continued medical treatment. Patients were selected by the attending cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, or surgeon after a review of clinical symptoms, recent angiograms, and perfusion scans.\n\n【16】To be enrolled in the trial, patients were required to meet the following criteria: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III or IV angina that was refractory to medical treatment, reversible ischemia of the left ventricular free wall, and coronary disease that was not amenable to coronary-artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Patients whose coronary disease was severe and diffuse or who did not have a target vessel or conduit suitable for grafting were considered to have disease not amenable to the latter two procedures. Patients were excluded if the left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 20 percent or if they had a concurrent major illness.\n\n【17】Crossover from medical treatment to transmyocardial revascularization was allowed if a patient had unstable angina that necessitated intravenous antianginal therapy for 48 hours or more in an intensive care unit. After crossover, patients were followed for an additional 12 months, regardless of how long they had been in the group assigned to medical treatment. These patients were considered part of the medical-treatment group until crossover, after which they were followed separately.\n\n【18】Clinical Evaluation\n-------------------\n\n【19】The patients' clinical status was evaluated with respect to CCS angina class, use of cardioactive medications, and responses on quality-of-life questionnaires. Angina was classified at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months according to CCS guidelines. To eliminate potential bias, angina was also classified in a blinded manner by an independent evaluator. Success at follow-up was defined as an angina class at least two classes below that at base line.\n\n【20】To study fully the effects of transmyocardial revascularization in comparison with medical treatment, both intention-to-treat and “on-treatment” analyses of angina were conducted. The intention-to-treat analysis, which included patients who remained in the medical-treatment group as well as patients who were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization as part of the medical-treatment group, provided a conservative estimate of the effect of transmyocardial revascularization, preventing overly optimistic conclusions. The on-treatment analysis, which did not include patients who were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization, was considered the best way to evaluate the results from a clinical perspective. Thus, patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization were compared first with all the patients assigned to medical treatment and then separately with those assigned to medical treatment and not crossed over.\n\n【21】Quality of life was assessed in all patients at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months during follow-up. At these times, each patient completed two questionnaires: the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Single-Photon-Emission Computed Tomography\n------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The extent and reversibility of myocardial ischemia at rest and during exercise were assessed in each patient at enrollment and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients underwent thallium-201 single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) with pharmacologic stress testing (with dipyridamole at a dose of 0.56 mg per kilogram of body weight, to a maximum of 6 mg) and four-hour redistribution–reinjection imaging. All the images were processed according to a standard protocol by a single technician at Cedars–Sinai Medical Center. Every image was then analyzed by an experienced nuclear cardiologist who was unaware of the patient's identity, treatment assignment, and scan date.\n\n【24】Each image was divided into three cross sections (apical, midventricular, and basal) parallel to the atrioventricular groove. Each of these cross sections was then divided into eight segments, which were individually analyzed to assess perfusion status. Each segment was examined for the presence of normal tissue, a fixed defect (scar), a reversible defect (ischemic or hibernating myocardium), or both fixed and reversible defects. The sum of the number of segments in each perfusion category is expressed as a percentage of all 24 segments and used to characterize the perfusion of the left side of the heart. Perfusion results at 3, 6, and 12 months were compared with the scores at base line for each patient.\n\n【25】Transmyocardial Revascularization\n---------------------------------\n\n【26】The technique of transmyocardial revascularization has been described in detail elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Transmural channels approximately 1 mm in diameter were created with a single pulse of the carbon dioxide laser (peak power, 850 W) through the left ventricle. Approximately one channel was created per square centimeter of myocardial surface. Transmural penetration by the laser was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Analyses were performed with a two-sided standard t-test, paired t-test, or analysis of variance for normally distributed continuous variables; with a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or the Kruskal–Wallis test for variables not normally distributed; with a two-sided chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for discrete variables; and with the Kaplan–Meier test or a log-rank test for survival free of cardiac events. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【29】To determine whether specific outcomes, such as treatment success or mortality, could be predicted on the basis of the patient's characteristics at base line, multivariate logistic-regression analyses were conducted with stepwise regression (SAS software, version 6.12, SAS, Cary, N.C.).\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Characteristics of the Study Population\n---------------------------------------\n\n【32】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Overview of the Outcomes of Patients Assigned to Undergo Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR), Those Assigned to Receive Medical Treatment Alone, and Those Crossed over from Medical Treatment to TMR.\n\n【33】Numbers in parentheses are numbers of patients. “Procedure” refers to any additional revascularization procedure, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary-artery bypass grafting.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Randomization.\n\n【34】Ninety-one patients were randomly assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization, and 101 patients were assigned to receive medical therapy 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The groups were balanced at base line with respect to sex, age, cardiac status, medical history, and cardiac risk factors 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Approximately 60 percent of the patients in each group were considered to be at high risk for a poor outcome as determined by the established scoring system of the Cleveland Clinic for surgical revascularization. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> All the patients in both groups had severe coronary disease with lesions in all three major vessels.\n\n【35】Results of Transmyocardial Revascularization\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【36】During surgery, a mean (±SD) of 36±13 channels were created, 30±8 of which were confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography to be transmural. Epicardial sutures were needed for hemostasis in 1 percent of the patients. There were no intraoperative deaths. The median stay in the intensive care unit for the patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization was two days, for a median hospital stay of seven days.\n\n【37】Clinical Status\n---------------\n\n【38】Two patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization and four assigned to medical treatment were lost to follow-up. Two of the four patients in the medical-treatment group had been crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization; thus, the six patients were evenly distributed among the three groups analyzed 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> and their exclusion did not modify the results, regardless of the outcome.\n\n【39】### _Angina Class_\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Relief of Angina According to Treatment Group.\n\n【41】Results are shown for both intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses. The intention-to-treat analysis included all patients assigned to the medical-treatment group, including those crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization (TMR). Relief was defined as an improvement in angina by at least two Canadian Cardiovascular Society classes from base line. The T bars indicate standard deviations. Asterisks indicate P<0.001 for the comparison with the transmyocardial-revascularization group.\n\n【42】With success at follow-up defined as a reduction of at least two angina classes as compared with base line, transmyocardial revascularization was significantly more successful in both analyses 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. At three months, 67 percent of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, 20 percent of those assigned to medical treatment (including those crossed over), and 6 percent of those assigned to medical treatment and not crossed over had a clinically successful result (P<0.001 for the comparison between the transmyocardial-revascularization group and each medical-treatment group) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. At 6 months, the success rates were 67 percent, 27 percent, and 6 percent, respectively, and at 12 months, the success rates were 72 percent, 43 percent, and 13 percent, respectively (P<0.001 for both sets of comparisons).\n\n【43】A blinded, independent assessment of angina was conducted in addition to the on-site evaluations. For 80 percent of the patients, the result of the independent assessment was within one CCS class of the result of the on-site assessment, indicating consistency in the evaluations. When the on-site and independent evaluations were compared, no significant differences were found (P=0.20).\n\n【44】### _Cardioactive Medications_\n\n【45】Changes in the use of cardioactive medications (nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers) from base line to follow-up were analyzed for their potential influence on outcomes with respect to angina. The clinical success of transmyocardial revascularization was not due to changes in medication; the use of medications decreased or remained unchanged in 83 percent of the patients in whom transmyocardial revascularization was successful. Conversely, the use of medications increased or remained unchanged in 86 percent of the patients assigned to medical treatment.\n\n【46】### _Quality of Life_\n\n【47】According to the responses on the SF-36 questionnaire, patients in the transmyocardial-revascularization group had a greater improvement in their quality of life (38 percent improvement) than patients in the medical-treatment group (6 percent improvement) as compared with base line at three months (P<0.001). This difference was also significant at 6 and 12 months (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). For each of 15 components of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, transmyocardial revascularization was associated with a significantly better result than medical treatment.\n\n【48】Spect Scans\n-----------\n\n【49】The rates of compliance with the protocol and the proportion of scans that were usable during follow-up were similar in the two groups (81 percent and 72 percent, respectively, in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 79 percent and 69 percent, respectively, in the medical-treatment group). The mean number of segments with reversible perfusion defects at enrollment was 7.1±3.7 per patient in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 6.8±3.3 in the medical-treatment group (P=0.60). At enrollment, the mean number of segments that were judged to have fixed defects was 9.0±3.6 in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 9.0±3.3 in the medical-treatment group (P=0.96).\n\n【50】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Change in Left-Sided Myocardial Perfusion during Follow-up, According to Treatment Assignment.\n\n【51】The percent change in myocardial perfusion differed significantly between the groups at each time point (P=0.001 at 3 months, P=0.02 at 6 months, and P=0.002 at 12 months). The percentage change in myocardial perfusion is calculated as the number of defects at base line minus the number of defects at follow-up, divided by the number of defects at base line. Numbers shown represent results from patients with usable data. TMR denotes transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【52】Medications were not stopped before the performance of SPECT imaging. Use of medications was balanced between the groups at each time point. Figure 3 shows the percent change in left-sided myocardial perfusion at 3, 6, and 12 months. In the group assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, reversible ischemia decreased by an average of 1.5 segments per patient at 3 months, 0.8 segment at 6 months, and 1.4 segments at 12 months. In contrast, in the group assigned to medical treatment, reversible ischemia increased by an average of 0.8, 0.8, and 1.3 segments, respectively (P=0.001 for the comparison between groups at 3 months, P=0.02 for the comparison at 6 months, and P=0.002 for the comparison at 12 months). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups at any of these time points in the number of fixed defects per patient.\n\n【53】Morbidity\n---------\n\n【54】During the first 30 days after transmyocardial revascularization, 6 patients (7 percent) had acute myocardial infarction, 10 (11 percent) had congestive heart failure, 7 (8 percent) had ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, and 1 (1 percent) had unstable angina. Sixty-two patients had no complications, 18 had one, 7 had two, 1 had three, 1 had four, and 2 had five. The only complication resulting specifically from the surgical procedure was an accidental laser-induced injury of the mitral apparatus, which was repaired, in one patient.\n\n【55】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Event-free Survival According to Treatment Group.\n\n【56】Cardiac events were defined as acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or class IV angina. TMR denotes transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【57】During the 12-month follow-up period, the rate of hospital admission due to unstable angina was 2 percent among patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization and 69 percent among patients assigned to medical treatment (P<0.001). Rates of admission to the intensive care unit during the 12-month period were 0.02 admission per patient in the transmyocardial-revascularization group and 1.37 admissions per patient in the medical-treatment group. There was no significant difference in the rate of freedom from acute myocardial infarction between patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization (87 percent) and those assigned to medical treatment who did not cross over (80 percent, P=0.24), but the rate of freedom from unstable angina was significantly higher after transmyocardial revascularization (84 percent, as compared with 25 percent after medical treatment only; P<0.001). The proportion of patients who did not die and who were free of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and class IV angina was also significantly higher in the transmyocardial-revascularization group (66 percent, as compared with 11 percent in the medical-treatment group; P<0.001). Event-free survival is shown in Figure 4 .\n\n【58】Mortality\n---------\n\n【59】Table 2.  Table 2. Causes of Death According to Treatment Group.\n\n【60】There were no intraoperative deaths among the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization; the 12-month survival rate was 85 percent. In comparison, the 12-month survival rate was 79 percent among the 41 medically treated patients who were not crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization (P=0.50). Of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization, 3 (3 percent) died perioperatively, and 10 (11 percent) died from cardiac causes during follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【61】The sole predictor of perioperative mortality was the occurrence of unstable angina. The time between an occurrence of unstable angina and surgery was significantly related to the risk of perioperative death (P<0.001): the risk increased by a factor of 22.9 when the time between angina and surgery decreased to less than 2 weeks (1 to 7 days: 8 of 30 patients died \\[27 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 43 percent\\]; 8 to 14 days: 3 of 19 died \\[16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 32 percent\\]; ≥15 days: 1 of 102 died \\[1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 3 percent\\]) (P<0.001). A low left ventricular ejection fraction was a significant predictor of overall mortality in the transmyocardial-revascularization group (P=0.02). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction during the study was significantly associated with overall mortality in both groups (transmyocardial revascularization, P= 0.05; medical treatment, P=0.03). The treatment-group assignment was not predictive of mortality, confirming the similarity of overall mortality in the two groups.\n\n【62】Crossover Group\n---------------\n\n【63】Of the 101 patients assigned to medical treatment 60 (59 percent) were crossed over to transmyocardial revascularization a mean of 107±89 days after randomization. Because of their unstable angina, these patients were considered to be at high risk for a poor outcome (Cleveland Clinic risk score, 9.3±3.6, as compared with a score of 5.8±2.9 at enrollment for all patients assigned to medical treatment, where a score of ≥5 indicates a high risk; P=0.02). During the first 30 days after surgery, 3 of the 60 patients (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction, 2 (3 percent) had unstable angina, 3 (5 percent) had arrhythmias, and 3 (5 percent) had congestive heart failure. One patient sustained laser-induced damage to the mitral apparatus during surgery. Twenty-three of the patients who were crossed over underwent the 12-month follow-up assessment of angina; 16 of these 23 patients (70 percent) had CCS class I or II angina, 3 (13 percent) had class III, and 4 (17 percent) had class IV.\n\n【64】Discussion\n----------\n\n【65】Before this study was conducted, the potential benefits of transmyocardial revascularization performed with a carbon dioxide laser had been observed in most of the 2500 patients who had undergone this treatment. A nonrandomized study of these patients showed significant improvement in symptoms and perfusion after the laser treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Whether this improvement would have occurred without transmyocardial revascularization was unknown. This question prompted the current randomized investigation.\n\n【66】In this study, the proportion of patients who had relief from angina was greater in the group assigned to undergo transmyocardial revascularization (72 percent) than in the patients in the group assigned to receive maximal medical therapy who did not cross over to transmyocardial revascularization (13 percent). This significant decrease in the patients' CCS class was confirmed by a blinded, independent assessment and with use of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. Moreover, patients who were assigned to medical treatment had a rate of hospital admission for unstable angina of 69 percent, as compared with only 2 percent in the transmyocardial-revascularization group. Among patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization, relief of acute and chronic angina resulted in an improved quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire, and reduced use of antianginal medications.\n\n【67】In addition, myocardial perfusion improved after transmyocardial revascularization and worsened with medical treatment alone. The price of the benefits of transmyocardial revascularization was a 3 percent rate of perioperative mortality. If the procedure was deferred for two weeks, this rate decreased to 1 percent, making the mortality associated with transmyocardial revascularization less than that associated with coronary-artery bypass grafting. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Overall survival at 12 months was similar in the two groups (transmyocardial revascularization, 85 percent; medical treatment, 79 percent; P=0.50).\n\n【68】This study did not directly address the mechanisms underlying the benefits of transmyocardial revascularization; however, several inferences can be made. There may be a short-lived placebo effect. In a nonrandomized trial, long-term follow-up of patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization showed no change in the improvement in symptoms after 3 years (average CCS class, 3.8±0.4 at base line, 1.4±1.2 at 12 months, and 1.5±1.2 at 36 months). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The conversion of ischemic myocardi-um to infarcted myocardium may also improve anginal symptoms. In our study, however, the extent of fixed defects in perfusion over the 12-month period was similar in the two groups, and there was no significant increase in fixed defects after transmyocardial revascularization as compared with medical treatment. Denervation is another possible mechanism of the benefit. If this were the explanation, however, one would expect to see an increase in myocardial infarction, sudden death, and heart failure with transmyocardial revascularization — none of which increased in the patients assigned to this treatment.\n\n【69】Improved perfusion and relief of symptoms after transmyocardial revascularization could result from patent channels created by the laser or from laser-induced angiogenesis. Isolated anatomical evidence of patent channels has been reported. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16,17 </a></sup></u> In addition, real-time, high-resolution contrast echocardiography has shown patent laser channels perfusing a 1.5-cm 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> section of myocardium with each systole. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> In our study, perfusion improved over a period of 12 months, indicating that the laser may increase perfusion by stimulating angiogenesis.\n\n【70】Although we assume that transmyocardial revascularization directly enhances myocardial perfusion, providing relief of angina, we cannot establish a direct correlation. Changes in clinical symptoms and changes on perfusion scans reflect two related but distinct phenomena, and in our study the degree of symptomatic improvement was not necessarily matched by the degree of improvement in the results on scanning. Symptoms and perfusion improved in most of the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization but not in those assigned to medical treatment who did not cross over to transmyocardial revascularization.\n\n【71】The option for crossover from the medical-treatment group to the transmyocardial-revascularization group was the greatest limitation of this study. Crossover was allowed as an incentive for patients assigned to maximal medical therapy to remain in the study if medical therapy failed. The attrition rate in this group was considerable because the condition of these patients did not improve substantially and because, by definition, they had unstable angina that required intravenous medication. Despite the limitation inherent in the crossover design, the patients assigned to transmyocardial revascularization showed improvement at three and six months as compared with their base-line values and as compared with values in their medically treated counterparts. In addition, although lifestyle changes can be limiting factors in clinical trials, there were no significant differences in lifestyle or medication use that might have influenced the outcomes.\n\n【72】In a recent report on a randomized study at a single center, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Schofield et al. concluded that transmyocardial revascularization should not be recommended because it did not significantly increase exercise capacity or 12-minute walking distance at 12 months. However, the patients who underwent transmyocardial revascularization did have significantly decreased angina (as indicated by the CCS class), increased functional capacity, less need for antianginal medications, and fewer hospital admissions as compared with medically treated patients. With respect to exercise capacity and walking times, comparisons were made between the groups at each follow-up period, not between base line and follow-up within each group. The authors reported similar decreases in reversible defects in the two groups. However, they did not consider the effect of changes in fixed defects.\n\n【73】With regard to fixed defects, there was no significant change from base line to 12 months in the transmyocardial-revascularization group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> The medically treated group, however, had a significant increase in fixed defects from base line (38 segments \\[8 percent\\]) to 12 months (68 segments \\[17 percent\\]); in other words, reversible defects decreased when fixed defects increased, as ischemic areas became scarred. In addition, follow-up data on perfusion were pooled, and comparisons were again made between the groups rather than between base line and follow-up.\n\n【74】In general, the study by Schofield et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> is not closely comparable with our multicenter trial. Patients in our trial were much sicker (70 to 80 percent had CCS class IV angina at base line, as compared with 27 percent in the study by Schofield et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> ), and we did not exclude patients with unstable angina, whereas Schofield et al. did. If patients with unstable angina are excluded, the perioperative mortality rate in our study falls to 1 percent, which is less than the 5 percent reported in the other series. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【75】In summary, we conducted this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine the effect of transmyocardial revascularization with a carbon dioxide laser on symptoms and cardiac perfusion in patients with end-stage coronary disease. We found that transmyocardial revascularization significantly alleviated angina and improved cardiac perfusion in patients with severe angina that was refractory to conventional medical therapy or revascularization procedures.\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Philip T.

Our sources include 20 polls, 8 of which were conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) through cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, and the National Public Health Information Coalition. We examined the extent to which people adopted specific behaviors during three periods: the early months of the pandemic, when no vaccine was available; at the time of the initial, delayed release of vaccine to high-priority groups; and after the vaccine was widely available. We also examined the reasons why many Americans did not get vaccinated and reviewed the public's view of the government's response to the pandemic. In instances in which multiple polling questions were relevant, we present a range of findings.\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Behavioral Response to 2009 H1N1 Influenza during the Early Months of the Pandemic.\n\n【5】Early in the pandemic, when no vaccine was available, a majority of Americans were quick to adopt two central public health recommendations (see Table 1 ). In the pandemic's first weeks, almost two thirds of Americans (59 to 67%) said that they or someone in their family had begun to wash their hands or clean them with sanitizer more frequently, and a majority (55%) had made preparations to stay at home if they or a family member got sick. It was also recommended that people avoid exposure to others with influenza-like symptoms, and 35 to 38% said they had done that (HSPH, April, May, and June 2009).\n\n【6】Measures for reducing interactions with other people were not recommended as routine practice. Nonetheless, polls suggest that 16 to 25% of Americans had avoided “places where many people are gathered, like sporting events, malls, or public transportation,” and 20% had “reduced contact with people outside \\[their\\] household as much as possible.” Fewer had adopted related measures. For example, 4 to 8% said they or family members had worn a face mask, and 1 to 3% got a prescription for or purchased antiviral drugs (HSPH, April, May, and June 2009).\n\n【7】Between July, when discussions about vaccine availability increased, and October, when a limited amount of vaccine became available, the public was divided over whether they would get vaccinated. Roughly half (46 to 57%) of the public said they expected to receive the vaccine (AP, July, September, and October 2009; Fox, September 2009; HSPH, August–September and September 2009; CBS, October 2009); a higher percentage of parents — 59 to 70% — said they expected to get their children vaccinated (CBS, August and October 2009; HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【8】In making their decision, some people appeared to think there was a trade-off between accepting the perceived risk associated with the illness and accepting any perceived risk associated with the vaccine. Sixty percent of adults who initially said they did not intend to get the vaccine for themselves and parents who initially said they did not intend to get the vaccine for their children also said that they would change their mind if “there were people in \\[their\\] community who were sick or dying from influenza A (H1N1)” (HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【9】Table 2.  Table 2. Major Reasons That Respondents Said They Would Not or Might Not Get the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Vaccine.\n\n【10】There were two major reasons why people said they would not or might not get the H1N1 vaccine, one of which was concern about its safety. Among adults overall, this concern was present but not dominant: most (87%) believed the H1N1 influenza vaccine was “very safe” or “somewhat safe.” However, only 33% believed it was “very safe,” as compared with 57% who said the same of the seasonal influenza vaccine (HSPH, September 2009). Among adults who said they would not or might not get the H1N1 vaccine, concerns about getting H1N1 influenza, another serious illness, or other side effects from it were top “major reasons” for their decision (cited by 21%, 20%, and 30%, respectively) (see Table 2 ). Parents who said they would not or might not have their children vaccinated were even more concerned about safety: 33% cited concern about exposure to another serious illness from the vaccine. Furthermore, a higher percentage of these parents than of adults overall indicated that they did not trust public health officials to provide correct information about the vaccine's safety (31% vs. 19%; HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【11】The other major reason for avoiding the H1N1 vaccine was the belief that it was not needed. Among adults overall, 47 to 50% said they were not concerned that they or their family members would get sick with H1N1 in the next 12 months (HSPH, August–September and September 2009). Among adults who said they would not or might not get the vaccine, the second and third most commonly reported reasons were a belief that they were not at risk for getting a serious case of H1N1 infection (28%) and the idea that if they did acquire H1N1, they could get medication to treat it (26%). A similar fraction (27%) of parents who said they would not or might not have their child vaccinated said that they did not think their child was at risk for getting a serious case (HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【12】During October, a limited amount of H1N1 influenza vaccine became available and was generally earmarked for high-priority groups, as defined by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> By early November, 17% of adults had tried to get the vaccine for themselves, but 7 in 10 (70%) were unable to get it, so only 5 to 6% had been vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009; Gallup and AP, November 2009). Among high-priority adults, one in five (21%) tried to get the vaccine, but two thirds (66%) of them were unable to get it. Thus, only 7% of high-priority adults were actually vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009). Children, who were also prioritized, had higher vaccination rates than adults. Roughly 4 in 10 parents (41%) tried to get the vaccine for their children, and two thirds (66%) were unable to do so, meaning that 14 to 17% of parents had their children vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009; Gallup and AP, November 2009). Among people who tried and failed to get the vaccine, more than half (55%) said they were frustrated, but 91% said they would try again (HSPH, October–November 2009).\n\n【13】The vaccine was released more widely in mid-December, at the same time that concern about getting sick with H1N1 declined: the proportion of people who were concerned about getting sick had dropped from the peak of between 51 and 59% in October and November (AP, October 2009; Marist, October 2009; AP, November 2009) to 40% by mid-December (HSPH, December 2009). At that time, 14% of adults had received the vaccine. Seventeen percent and 21% had received it by early and mid-January, respectively, in a poll in which adults were defined as 19 years of age or older 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> (HSPH, January 2010). In mid-January, an additional 16% said they intended to get it “by the end of February 2010.” Substantially fewer adults had received the vaccine by mid-January than had expressed interest in receiving it when asked during the period from July through October.\n\n【14】A substantially greater proportion of parents had gotten the vaccine for their children than did adults for themselves: 35% of parents had had one or more of their children vaccinated by mid-December, and 40% had done so by mid-January. In addition, 13% of parents said they intended to have children vaccinated “by the end of February 2010” (HSPH, December 2009 and January 2010). In total, 29% of those 6 months to 19 years of age had received the vaccine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】During the December–January period, a belief that the vaccine was not safe or that it was not needed continued to be a major factor in the decisions of adults who said they were not going to or might not get the vaccine. Parents who said they were not going to or might not get the vaccine for their children were even more likely than the parallel group of adults to cite safety concerns as a reason (56% vs. 35%; HSPH, January 2010).\n\n【16】By December, a quarter (24%) of adults had talked to a doctor or other health care professional about getting the H1N1 vaccine for themselves, and of those, 53% said the practitioner had recommended getting the vaccine, 17% said that the practitioner had recommended against it, and 30% said that the practitioner had made no recommendation either way. More than a third (37%) of parents talked to a doctor or other health care professional about getting the H1N1 vaccine for their child, and of those, two thirds (64%) said that the practitioner had recommended getting the vaccine, 10% said that the practitioner had recommended against it, and 25% said that the practitioner had made no recommendation (HSPH, December 2009).\n\n【17】Throughout the H1N1 pandemic, more than half the U.S. population appeared to have a positive impression of the government's response, although a sizable minority did not. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, 54% believed the response of the federal government was appropriate, whereas 39% believed the government had overreacted (CNN, May 2009). Nine months later, in January 2010, 59% believed that public health officials did an excellent or good job in their overall response to the pandemic, whereas 39% believed they did a fair or poor job (HSPH, January 2010).\n\n【18】The public expressed two particular concerns about the government's response. First, some people were displeased with the vaccine shortage, and while the shortage existed, a majority of respondents (54%) said the federal government was doing a poor or very poor job of providing the country with adequate vaccine supplies (Gallup). Second, the public was divided about public health officials' efforts to make sure the H1N1 vaccine was safe early in the distribution process, even though two thirds (63%) of the public said in January that “public health officials had done the right amount to make sure the H1N1 flu vaccine is safe” (HSPH, January 2009). For example, in November, adults were nearly evenly divided on whether medical testing of the H1N1 influenza vaccine had moved too quickly to ensure that it was safe: 45% said it was done as quickly as possible while still making sure the vaccine was safe, whereas 40% said it was done too quickly so that people could not be sure it was safe (Fox, November 2009).\n\n【19】Our review of these data suggests that in the event of a future influenza pandemic, a substantial proportion of the public may not take a newly developed vaccine because they may believe that the illness does not pose a serious health threat, because they (especially parents) may be concerned about the safety of the available vaccine, or both. More work may need to be done to understand the basis of these beliefs and to address them in the case of a serious influenza outbreak.\n\n【20】Polls during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic also suggest that public health communication efforts related to other personal influenza-prevention behaviors were effective in reaching a large swath of the public. Building on these efforts, as well as developing a vaccine strategy, may be useful during response planning and during an outbreak.\n\n【21】Polls on Public Response to H1N1\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】Associated Press–GfK Roper (AP) polls ( July 16–20, 2009 . opens in new tab ; September 3–8, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 1–5, 2009 . opens in new tab ; November 5–9, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【23】CBS News polls ( August 27–31, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 5–8, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【24】CNN–Opinion Research poll ( May 14–17, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【25】Fox News–Opinion Dynamics polls ( September 15–16, 2009 . opens in new tab ; November 17–18, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【26】Gallup–USA Today poll ( November 6–8, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【27】Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) polls ( April 29, 2009 . opens in new tab ; May 5–6, 2009 . opens in new tab ; June 22–28, 2009 . opens in new tab ; August 28–September 9, 2009 . opens in new tab ; September 14–20, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 30–November 1, 2009 . opens in new tab ; December 16–17, 2009 . opens in new tab ; January 20–24, 2010 . opens in new tab )\n\n【28】Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll ( October 7–12, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【29】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【32】参考删除-1:<u>This article (10.1056/NEJMp1005102) was published on May 19, 2010, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【33】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【34】参考删除-1:<u>From the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston (G.K.S., R.J.B., M.M.B.); the John F.

We also examined the reasons why many Americans did not get vaccinated and reviewed the public's view of the government's response to the pandemic. In instances in which multiple polling questions were relevant, we present a range of findings.\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Behavioral Response to 2009 H1N1 Influenza during the Early Months of the Pandemic.\n\n【5】Early in the pandemic, when no vaccine was available, a majority of Americans were quick to adopt two central public health recommendations (see Table 1 ). In the pandemic's first weeks, almost two thirds of Americans (59 to 67%) said that they or someone in their family had begun to wash their hands or clean them with sanitizer more frequently, and a majority (55%) had made preparations to stay at home if they or a family member got sick. It was also recommended that people avoid exposure to others with influenza-like symptoms, and 35 to 38% said they had done that (HSPH, April, May, and June 2009).\n\n【6】Measures for reducing interactions with other people were not recommended as routine practice. Nonetheless, polls suggest that 16 to 25% of Americans had avoided “places where many people are gathered, like sporting events, malls, or public transportation,” and 20% had “reduced contact with people outside \\[their\\] household as much as possible.” Fewer had adopted related measures. For example, 4 to 8% said they or family members had worn a face mask, and 1 to 3% got a prescription for or purchased antiviral drugs (HSPH, April, May, and June 2009).\n\n【7】Between July, when discussions about vaccine availability increased, and October, when a limited amount of vaccine became available, the public was divided over whether they would get vaccinated. Roughly half (46 to 57%) of the public said they expected to receive the vaccine (AP, July, September, and October 2009; Fox, September 2009; HSPH, August–September and September 2009; CBS, October 2009); a higher percentage of parents — 59 to 70% — said they expected to get their children vaccinated (CBS, August and October 2009; HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【8】In making their decision, some people appeared to think there was a trade-off between accepting the perceived risk associated with the illness and accepting any perceived risk associated with the vaccine. Sixty percent of adults who initially said they did not intend to get the vaccine for themselves and parents who initially said they did not intend to get the vaccine for their children also said that they would change their mind if “there were people in \\[their\\] community who were sick or dying from influenza A (H1N1)” (HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【9】Table 2.  Table 2. Major Reasons That Respondents Said They Would Not or Might Not Get the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Vaccine.\n\n【10】There were two major reasons why people said they would not or might not get the H1N1 vaccine, one of which was concern about its safety. Among adults overall, this concern was present but not dominant: most (87%) believed the H1N1 influenza vaccine was “very safe” or “somewhat safe.” However, only 33% believed it was “very safe,” as compared with 57% who said the same of the seasonal influenza vaccine (HSPH, September 2009). Among adults who said they would not or might not get the H1N1 vaccine, concerns about getting H1N1 influenza, another serious illness, or other side effects from it were top “major reasons” for their decision (cited by 21%, 20%, and 30%, respectively) (see Table 2 ). Parents who said they would not or might not have their children vaccinated were even more concerned about safety: 33% cited concern about exposure to another serious illness from the vaccine. Furthermore, a higher percentage of these parents than of adults overall indicated that they did not trust public health officials to provide correct information about the vaccine's safety (31% vs. 19%; HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【11】The other major reason for avoiding the H1N1 vaccine was the belief that it was not needed. Among adults overall, 47 to 50% said they were not concerned that they or their family members would get sick with H1N1 in the next 12 months (HSPH, August–September and September 2009). Among adults who said they would not or might not get the vaccine, the second and third most commonly reported reasons were a belief that they were not at risk for getting a serious case of H1N1 infection (28%) and the idea that if they did acquire H1N1, they could get medication to treat it (26%). A similar fraction (27%) of parents who said they would not or might not have their child vaccinated said that they did not think their child was at risk for getting a serious case (HSPH, September 2009).\n\n【12】During October, a limited amount of H1N1 influenza vaccine became available and was generally earmarked for high-priority groups, as defined by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> By early November, 17% of adults had tried to get the vaccine for themselves, but 7 in 10 (70%) were unable to get it, so only 5 to 6% had been vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009; Gallup and AP, November 2009). Among high-priority adults, one in five (21%) tried to get the vaccine, but two thirds (66%) of them were unable to get it. Thus, only 7% of high-priority adults were actually vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009). Children, who were also prioritized, had higher vaccination rates than adults. Roughly 4 in 10 parents (41%) tried to get the vaccine for their children, and two thirds (66%) were unable to do so, meaning that 14 to 17% of parents had their children vaccinated (HSPH, October–November 2009; Gallup and AP, November 2009). Among people who tried and failed to get the vaccine, more than half (55%) said they were frustrated, but 91% said they would try again (HSPH, October–November 2009).\n\n【13】The vaccine was released more widely in mid-December, at the same time that concern about getting sick with H1N1 declined: the proportion of people who were concerned about getting sick had dropped from the peak of between 51 and 59% in October and November (AP, October 2009; Marist, October 2009; AP, November 2009) to 40% by mid-December (HSPH, December 2009). At that time, 14% of adults had received the vaccine. Seventeen percent and 21% had received it by early and mid-January, respectively, in a poll in which adults were defined as 19 years of age or older 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> (HSPH, January 2010). In mid-January, an additional 16% said they intended to get it “by the end of February 2010.” Substantially fewer adults had received the vaccine by mid-January than had expressed interest in receiving it when asked during the period from July through October.\n\n【14】A substantially greater proportion of parents had gotten the vaccine for their children than did adults for themselves: 35% of parents had had one or more of their children vaccinated by mid-December, and 40% had done so by mid-January. In addition, 13% of parents said they intended to have children vaccinated “by the end of February 2010” (HSPH, December 2009 and January 2010). In total, 29% of those 6 months to 19 years of age had received the vaccine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】During the December–January period, a belief that the vaccine was not safe or that it was not needed continued to be a major factor in the decisions of adults who said they were not going to or might not get the vaccine. Parents who said they were not going to or might not get the vaccine for their children were even more likely than the parallel group of adults to cite safety concerns as a reason (56% vs. 35%; HSPH, January 2010).\n\n【16】By December, a quarter (24%) of adults had talked to a doctor or other health care professional about getting the H1N1 vaccine for themselves, and of those, 53% said the practitioner had recommended getting the vaccine, 17% said that the practitioner had recommended against it, and 30% said that the practitioner had made no recommendation either way. More than a third (37%) of parents talked to a doctor or other health care professional about getting the H1N1 vaccine for their child, and of those, two thirds (64%) said that the practitioner had recommended getting the vaccine, 10% said that the practitioner had recommended against it, and 25% said that the practitioner had made no recommendation (HSPH, December 2009).\n\n【17】Throughout the H1N1 pandemic, more than half the U.S. population appeared to have a positive impression of the government's response, although a sizable minority did not. For example, in the early days of the pandemic, 54% believed the response of the federal government was appropriate, whereas 39% believed the government had overreacted (CNN, May 2009). Nine months later, in January 2010, 59% believed that public health officials did an excellent or good job in their overall response to the pandemic, whereas 39% believed they did a fair or poor job (HSPH, January 2010).\n\n【18】The public expressed two particular concerns about the government's response. First, some people were displeased with the vaccine shortage, and while the shortage existed, a majority of respondents (54%) said the federal government was doing a poor or very poor job of providing the country with adequate vaccine supplies (Gallup). Second, the public was divided about public health officials' efforts to make sure the H1N1 vaccine was safe early in the distribution process, even though two thirds (63%) of the public said in January that “public health officials had done the right amount to make sure the H1N1 flu vaccine is safe” (HSPH, January 2009). For example, in November, adults were nearly evenly divided on whether medical testing of the H1N1 influenza vaccine had moved too quickly to ensure that it was safe: 45% said it was done as quickly as possible while still making sure the vaccine was safe, whereas 40% said it was done too quickly so that people could not be sure it was safe (Fox, November 2009).\n\n【19】Our review of these data suggests that in the event of a future influenza pandemic, a substantial proportion of the public may not take a newly developed vaccine because they may believe that the illness does not pose a serious health threat, because they (especially parents) may be concerned about the safety of the available vaccine, or both. More work may need to be done to understand the basis of these beliefs and to address them in the case of a serious influenza outbreak.\n\n【20】Polls during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic also suggest that public health communication efforts related to other personal influenza-prevention behaviors were effective in reaching a large swath of the public. Building on these efforts, as well as developing a vaccine strategy, may be useful during response planning and during an outbreak.\n\n【21】Polls on Public Response to H1N1\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】Associated Press–GfK Roper (AP) polls ( July 16–20, 2009 . opens in new tab ; September 3–8, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 1–5, 2009 . opens in new tab ; November 5–9, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【23】CBS News polls ( August 27–31, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 5–8, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【24】CNN–Opinion Research poll ( May 14–17, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【25】Fox News–Opinion Dynamics polls ( September 15–16, 2009 . opens in new tab ; November 17–18, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【26】Gallup–USA Today poll ( November 6–8, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【27】Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) polls ( April 29, 2009 . opens in new tab ; May 5–6, 2009 . opens in new tab ; June 22–28, 2009 . opens in new tab ; August 28–September 9, 2009 . opens in new tab ; September 14–20, 2009 . opens in new tab ; October 30–November 1, 2009 . opens in new tab ; December 16–17, 2009 . opens in new tab ; January 20–24, 2010 . opens in new tab )\n\n【28】Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll ( October 7–12, 2009 . opens in new tab )\n\n【29】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【32】参考删除-1:<u>This article (10.1056/NEJMp1005102) was published on May 19, 2010, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【33】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【34】参考删除-1:<u>From the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston (G.K.S., R.J.B., M.M.B.); the John F.

A rabbit antithymocyte polyclonal antibody or basiliximab, an interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody, is most commonly used for induction.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In this prospective, randomized, international study, we compared short courses of antithymocyte globulin and basiliximab in patients at high risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function who received a renal transplant from a deceased donor. Patients taking cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone were randomly assigned to receive either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight daily, 141 patients) during transplantation (day 0) and on days 1 through 4 or basiliximab (20 mg, 137 patients) on days 0 and 4. The primary end point was a composite of acute rejection, delayed graft function, graft loss, and death.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】At 12 months, the incidence of the composite end point was similar in the two groups (P=0.34). The antithymocyte globulin group, as compared with the basiliximab group, had lower incidences of acute rejection (15.6% vs. 25.5%, P=0.02) and of acute rejection that required treatment with antibody (1.4% vs. 8.0%, P=0.005). The antithymocyte globulin group and the basiliximab group had similar incidences of graft loss (9.2% and 10.2%, respectively), delayed graft function (40.4% and 44.5%), and death (4.3% and 4.4%). Though the incidences of all adverse events, serious adverse events, and cancers were also similar between the two groups, patients receiving antithymocyte globulin had a greater incidence of infection (85.8% vs. 75.2%, P=0.03) but a lower incidence of cytomegalovirus disease (7.8% vs. 17.5%, P=0.02).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients at high risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function who received a renal transplant from a deceased donor, induction therapy consisting of a 5-day course of antithymocyte globulin, as compared with basiliximab, reduced the incidence and severity of acute rejection but not the incidence of delayed graft function. Patient and graft survival were similar in the two groups. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00235300 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Two events occurring early in the post-transplantation period, acute rejection and delayed graft function, negatively affect graft survival. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> Patients with delayed graft function have an increased risk of acute rejection, and graft survival is superior in patients who do not have delayed graft function or acute rejection as compared with those who have either or both. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-7 </a></sup></u> The up-regulation of immunogenic molecules during brain death and during the subsequent procurement of organs predisposes allografts from deceased donors to acute rejection and delayed function. Induction therapy is specific therapy given at the time of transplantation to lower the incidence of acute rejection or to prevent or treat delayed graft function. Currently, almost 70% of kidney-transplant recipients receive induction therapy with either rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme), a lymphocyte-depleting polyclonal antibody that targets multiple immunologic epitopes, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> or basiliximab (Simulect, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) or daclizumab (Zenapax, Roche Pharmaceuticals), non–lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibodies that target the interleukin-2 receptor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Historically, rabbit antithymocyte globulin has been administered intravenously daily for 7 to 14 days after transplantation. Initiating this treatment during transplantation is generally associated with a lower incidence of delayed graft function and a trend toward a lower incidence of acute rejection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> Short courses and prolonged courses appear to have similar efficacy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Basiliximab, the most commonly used interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> is administered both intraoperatively and on postoperative day 4. We compared the safety and efficacy of basiliximab and antithymocyte globulin (each administered intraoperatively and over the next 4 days) in patients with a high risk of acute rejection or delayed graft function who received a renal allograft from a deceased donor.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】This prospective, randomized, international study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of rabbit antithymocyte globulin and of basiliximab for induction therapy in patients who were at high risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function and who received a renal transplant from a deceased donor. The design, data collection, and analysis were performed by a sponsor, Genzyme, which holds the primary data. All the authors reviewed the data, vouch for the veracity and completeness of the data and data analyses, and wrote the manuscript.\n\n【16】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Treatment Assignment, Follow-up, and Analysis.\n\n【17】The study was approved by the institutional review board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients were randomly assigned to receive either antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab before transplantation, according to 1:1 variable-block randomization at each investigative center. The treatment assignments were randomized at an independent center. Patients were followed for 12 months or until they were withdrawn from the study or were lost to follow-up 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【18】Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n--------------------------------\n\n【19】Table 1.  Table 1. Eligibility Criteria According to Allograft Cold-Ischemia Time.\n\n【20】Only adult candidates for renal transplants from deceased donors were considered for enrollment. Eligibility was determined according to the duration of cold ischemia and other donor and recipient risk factors 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. One or more of these factors, which put the recipient at high risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function, were required for eligibility.\n\n【21】Patients were excluded if they had been receiving immunosuppressive therapy before transplantation; had received an investigational medication within the past 30 days; had a known contraindication to the administration of antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab; were suspected or known to have an infection or were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); or had had cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) within the previous 2 years. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and women of childbearing potential who were not using condoms or oral contraceptives were excluded.\n\n【22】Induction Therapy\n-----------------\n\n【23】Patients in the antithymocyte globulin group were given acetaminophen and diphenhydramine before receiving antithymocyte globulin (1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight given intravenously), which was reconstituted according to the package insert. Treatment with antithymocyte globulin was initiated intraoperatively, before graft reperfusion. Subsequent doses were given daily through day 4, for a total dose of 7.5 mg per kilogram. The dose was decreased by 50% in patients with platelet counts of less than 80,000 per cubic millimeter or an absolute neutrophil count of less than 3000 per cubic millimeter. If the platelet count was less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter or the absolute neutrophil count was less than 1500 per cubic millimeter, then antithymocyte globulin was withheld. Basiliximab (20 mg) was administered intravenously according to the instructions of the manufacturer, which called for a first infusion before graft reperfusion, followed by a second infusion on day 4. Neither premedication nor dose adjustments were recommended by the manufacturer. According to the protocol, either antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab could be discontinued or interrupted if the patient refused to take it or if a serious adverse event that was severe and related to infusion occurred.\n\n【24】Maintenance Therapy\n-------------------\n\n【25】Both groups received maintenance immunosuppressive therapy involving cyclosporine (modified), mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The first dose of cyclosporine (6 to 8 mg per kilogram given orally, divided into two doses) was initiated in each patient when any of the following events took place: urinary output reached or exceeded 1.5 liters per day for 2 consecutive days; the serum creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter) or less on 2 consecutive days; or the serum creatinine level decreased to less than 50% of the pretransplantation level. If treatment with cyclosporine had not been initiated before day 4, the drug was begun then, since it was prespecified that the cyclosporine level in each patient had to reach the therapeutic range (defined according to local institutional standards) by day 10.\n\n【26】Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (1.0 g given orally twice a day) was initiated before transplantation and was continued postoperatively once the patient could tolerate oral medications. The dose was adjusted by the investigators at their discretion, and the dose was reduced or the drug withheld if the absolute neutrophil count was less than 3500 per cubic millimeter.\n\n【27】Methylprednisolone (7 mg per kilogram given intravenously) was administered before the initial intraoperative dose of antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab. A standard corticosteroid taper was used to reduce the dose of prednisone or its equivalent to 5 mg by 6 months 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u>. The taper schedule and corticosteroid dose were adjusted at the discretion of the investigator if biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred.\n\n【28】Concomitant Therapy\n-------------------\n\n【29】Patients who received basiliximab were not permitted to receive rabbit antithymocyte globulin, except for the treatment of biopsy-proven acute rejection. Primary immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, azathioprine, sirolimus, or other agents was prohibited. However, a switch to other immunosuppressive therapy was permitted after a documented episode of rejection. Patients with severe gastrointestinal intolerance to mycophenolate mofetil could be given azathioprine instead.\n\n【30】Prophylaxis against Infection\n-----------------------------\n\n【31】Patients who were seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) before transplantation and patients who received an organ from a donor who was seropositive for CMV received ganciclovir (orally or intravenously) for at least 14 days, beginning on day 1, followed by maintenance therapy with oral ganciclovir through day 90. Each investigator determined the dose on the basis of standard criteria. Antifungal and antibacterial medications were administered on the basis of the standards at each center.\n\n【32】Efficacy End Points\n-------------------\n\n【33】The primary efficacy end point was a composite of the first occurrence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, delayed graft function, graft loss, or death; the incidence of each of these end points was also studied. All episodes of acute rejection were confirmed by biopsy, with histologic characteristics described according to the Banff criteria with the use of microscopy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Delayed graft function was defined as the need for dialysis within the first week after transplantation. Slow graft function was defined as a serum creatinine level exceeding 3.0 mg per deciliter on day 5 that did not require treatment with dialysis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【34】Clinical Assessment\n-------------------\n\n【35】Demographic and baseline data included the age, sex, and race or ethnic group of the donor and recipient, the weight and height of the recipient, the cold-ischemia time, the panel-reactive antibody value before transplantation and at its peak, the CMV serostatus of the donor, and the presence or absence of a heartbeat in the donor. Laboratory data — including hemoglobin level, white-cell and platelet counts, cyclosporine trough level, and serum creatinine level — were measured at baseline, days 0 through 5, day 14, and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count of less than 80,000 per cubic millimeter; leukopenia was defined as a white-cell count of less than 2500 per cubic millimeter. Safety data included all adverse events and serious adverse events. Frequencies of infection, cancer, and CMV disease were also calculated.\n\n【36】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【37】We calculated that 240 patients would have to be enrolled for the study to have a statistical power of 80% to detect a significant difference between the two groups, with the use of a two-sided test and a significance level of 5%, given an incidence of the primary end point of 27.0% with antithymocyte globulin and 45.3% with basiliximab. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> The study design included an interim assessment and the subsequent readjustment of enrollment to 340 patients, because the interim differences between the two groups (particularly with regard to delayed graft function) were smaller than expected. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> The data and safety monitoring committee recommended the discontinuation of the study after 278 patients had been enrolled. This decision was made because of the statistical improbability of showing a change in the primary end point if more patients were enrolled.\n\n【38】All analyses were performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages, and continuous variables as means with standard deviations. Categorical data were compared with the use of Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables with the use of the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test or the t-test. The incidences of graft rejection, graft loss, and death were calculated with the use of survival-analysis techniques. All tests were two-tailed, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【41】Table 2.  Table 2. Baseline Characteristics of Recipients and Donors and Transplantation Characteristics.\n\n【42】Eleven European centers enrolled 95 patients and 17 U.S. centers enrolled 183 patients between May 2, 2000, and March 6, 2002. Of these 278 patients, 141 were randomly assigned to receive antithymocyte globulin and 137 were randomly assigned to receive basiliximab. The baseline and demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The mean (±SD) numbers of risk factors for acute rejection or delayed graft function were similar among recipients in the antithymocyte globulin group and those in the basiliximab group (0.6±0.75 and 0.6±0.79, respectively; P=0.96), as well as among donors (1.4±0.78 and 1.4±0.71, respectively; P=0.83). The mean duration of the hospital stay did not differ significantly between the antithymocyte globulin group and the basiliximab group (13.2±8.3 and 12.6±7.9 days, respectively; P=0.38); the mean duration was 9.7±5.5 days in the United States and 19.1±8.9 days in Europe (P<0.001).\n\n【43】Induction and Maintenance Therapies\n-----------------------------------\n\n【44】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Mean White-Cell Counts (Panel A) and Platelet Counts (Panel B) in the Two Groups during 12 Months of Follow-up.\n\n【45】Mean counts of both white cells and platelets were lower in the antithymocyte globulin group during induction therapy (days 0 through 4) but were similar in the two groups as of day 14.\n\n【46】Basiliximab was initiated intraoperatively in 96.7% of all patients who were assigned to receive it, and 96.4% received the intended two doses. The average total dose of basiliximab was 39.3±3.8 mg per patient (0.54±0.13 mg per kilogram). Rabbit antithymocyte globulin was initiated before reperfusion in 87.9% of all patients assigned to receive it, and 68.8% received the intended five doses. One patient (0.7%) received six doses, and another (0.7%) received seven doses. At least four doses were administered in 87.2% of patients. The major reasons for stopping or reducing the antithymocyte globulin dose were leukopenia (in 45.2% of patients), thrombocytopenia (11.9% of patients), or both (14.3% of patients). These conditions resolved by day 14, on average 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The incidences of acute rejection, infection, and cancer did not differ significantly according to whether patients received full or reduced doses of antithymocyte globulin. The average total dose of antithymocyte globulin was 474.2±147.5 mg (6.5±1.5 mg per kilogram), and the minimum and maximum doses were 1.3 mg per kilogram and 9.8 mg per kilogram, respectively. Graft loss less than 24 hours after transplantation was the reason that 3.6% of patients did not receive the second dose.\n\n【47】The use of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in the two groups was generally similar. However, at 12 months, more patients in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group were receiving mycophenolate mofetil (20.2% vs. 10.3%, P=0.05).\n\n【48】Efficacy End Points\n-------------------\n\n【49】Table 3.  Table 3. Efficacy End Points 12 Months after Transplantation.\n\n【50】At 12 months, the incidence of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the antithymocyte globulin group (50.4%) and the basiliximab group (56.2%, P=0.34) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. There were fewer patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group (15.6% vs. 25.5%, P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The incidence of acute rejection tended to be lower among blacks and nonblacks receiving antithymocyte globulin than among those receiving basiliximab. The incidence did not differ significantly between blacks and nonblacks in both groups combined (P=0.14). The incidence also did not differ significantly between patients (in both groups combined) in the United States and those in Europe (P=0.28). There were no episodes of rejection with a Banff grade of III (a severe episode of rejection consisting of marked arteritis involving the intima or transmural arteritis with fibrinoid deposits and necrosis of the medial smooth muscle cells). Severe rejection, as indicated by the need for antibody treatment, was less frequent among patients receiving antithymocyte globulin than among those receiving basiliximab (1.4% vs. 8.0%, P=0.005).\n\n【51】The incidence of delayed graft function was similar in the antithymocyte globulin group (40.4%) and the basiliximab group (44.5%, P=0.54), as was the incidence of slow graft function (23.4% and 26.3%, respectively; P=0.49). The mean number of hemodialysis treatments was similar in the antithymocyte globulin group and the basiliximab group (3.2±3.0 and 3.1±2.9, respectively; P=0.62). The incidence of graft loss was also similar among patients receiving antithymocyte globulin (9.2%) and those receiving basiliximab (10.2%), as were the incidences of death (4.3% and 4.4%, respectively) and the causes of graft loss and death.\n\n【52】Safety\n------\n\n【53】Table 4.  Table 4. Frequency of Adverse Events at 12 Months.\n\n【54】The two agents were associated with a similar overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Immediately after transplantation, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were more common among patients who received antithymocyte globulin than among those who received basiliximab (P<0.001). By day 14, there were no significant differences noted 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【55】Overall, the incidence of infection was higher in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group (85.8% vs. 75.2%, P=0.03). This difference appeared to be attributable to a greater frequency of urinary tract infections in the antithymocyte globulin group (39.0%, vs. 27.0% in the basiliximab group; P=0.04) and non-CMV viral infections (21.3% vs. 11.7%, P=0.04). The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group (7.8% vs. 17.5%, P=0.02). Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered according to each center's protocol, and it was used in fewer patients receiving antithymocyte globulin than patients receiving basiliximab (18.9% vs. 30.9%, P=0.03).\n\n【56】There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of cancer, including post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, though there were five cases of cancer in the antithymocyte globulin group and only one in the basiliximab group 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. All cancers appear to have been successfully treated, and none were fatal during follow-up.\n\n【57】Hemoglobin levels between the groups did not differ significantly at any point during the study. At 12 months, the mean, median, and range of the serum creatinine levels were 2.0±1.45, 1.7, and 0.7 to 12.0 mg per deciliter (177±128, 150, and 62 to 1061 mmol per liter), respectively, in the antithymocyte globulin group and 1.8±0.75, 1.7, and 0.8 to 6.6 mg per deciliter (159±66, 150, and 71 to 583 mmol per liter), respectively, in the basiliximab group. These measures did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.51).\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】In our trial, immunoprophylaxis with antithymocyte globulin, as compared with basiliximab, did not reduce the incidence of delayed graft function among patients at high risk for delayed graft function or acute rejection who received a renal transplant from a deceased donor. It is possible that the injury associated with prolonged cold ischemia and an advanced age of the donor or recipient were too great to prevent delayed graft function. A possible alternative explanation is the finding that the use of an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist such as basiliximab is associated with a trend toward a lower incidence of delayed graft function than that with placebo. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】We found that the incidence and severity of acute rejection were lower in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection among patients who received basiliximab was more than 1.5 times that among those who received antithymocyte globulin, and the severity of rejection was also greater, since the need for antibody treatment was more than 6 times that in the antithymocyte globulin group. These results were achieved even though the dose and duration of antithymocyte globulin therapy were lower than those in previous reports.\n\n【61】The incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups, but the types of events differed. The higher initial incidence of leukopenia in the antithymocyte globulin group was anticipated. The white-cell counts in our trial did not distinguish between lymphopenia, which is essential to the efficacy of antithymocyte globulin, and leukopenia, which potentially compromises resistance to infection. Absolute neutrophil counts might have been more useful than white-cell counts in comparing the safety of the two induction agents, because neutrophil counts more accurately predict the risk of infection related to leukopenia. Most centers now reduce the dose of antithymocyte globulin by one half for patients with an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1200 per cubic millimeter and withhold the dose if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 800 per cubic millimeter.\n\n【62】Urinary tract infections were more common among patients in the antithymocyte globulin group than among those in the basiliximab group. Antibiotic prophylaxis was used less frequently in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group. The study design stipulated the use of prophylaxis against CMV disease for the first 3 months. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group, which may have been due to the greater incidence of rejection episodes, and a greater need for antibody therapy to treat rejection, in the basiliximab group. There were more cases of cancer in the antithymocyte globulin group, but not significantly more.\n\n【63】A small French, multicenter study compared rabbit antithymocyte globulin and basiliximab in patients at low risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function (50 patients per group). 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> Rabbit antithymocyte globulin was not administered intraoperatively in that study, but there was a trend toward a lower incidence of delayed graft function in the antithymocyte globulin group (6%) than in the basiliximab group (14%), though no significant differences were seen in the incidence of acute rejection. In that study, 94% of patients receiving rabbit antithymocyte globulin did not receive cyclosporine until after day 6, whereas all patients receiving basiliximab started receiving cyclosporine on day 0 or day 1, which may constitute a selection bias. No antiviral prophylaxis was used, but the incidences of clinical CMV disease in the antithymocyte globulin group (12%) and the basiliximab group (6%) did not differ significantly.\n\n【64】A French study at three centers compared rabbit antithymocyte globulin (in 53 patients) and basiliximab (in 52 patients); all the patients were at low risk for acute rejection and delayed graft function and were undergoing a standard maintenance regimen of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> In that study, rabbit antithymocyte globulin was not used intraoperatively. There was no significant difference between the antithymocyte globulin group and the basiliximab group in the incidence of delayed graft function (30.2% and 28.8%, respectively) or acute rejection (9.4% and 9.6%, respectively). No specific prophylaxis against CMV disease was used. Cytomegalovirus infection was more common in the rabbit antithymocyte globulin group than in the basiliximab group (41.5% vs. 21.2% of patients).\n\n【65】Our study has certain limitations. It was not a blinded trial; the identity of the induction agent could be deduced from the lymphopenia that occurs with rabbit antithymocyte globulin. However, the treatment assignments were randomized at an independent center. We do not believe that the lack of blinding influenced the study, since the end points were objective and did not involve subjective interpretation.\n\n【66】In conclusion, our study, which was relatively large, compared induction therapy with rabbit antithymocyte polyclonal antibody and induction therapy with basiliximab, an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, in patients at high risk for acute rejection or delayed graft function who received a renal transplant from a deceased donor. Intraoperative use of antithymocyte globulin did not lower the incidence of delayed graft function in this high-risk population but did reduce the incidence and severity of acute rejection.\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by SangStat Medical Corporation and Genzyme.</u>\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Brennan reports having received grant support, consulting fees, and lecture fees from Genzyme, Novartis, Astellas, Pfizer, Roche, and Wyeth.

Nevertheless, however complex and important a study may be, the consent process must be clear enough to enable informed decision making.\n\n【3】The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (45CFR46.116) includes the following requirements for informed consent: “A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research\\. a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures which are experimental”; “a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject”; and “a disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject.”\n\n【4】The SUPPORT study itself was complicated. However, the question of whether the consent forms were adequate is not; they failed in each of the elements described above. Although the consent forms varied in content among the institutions at which the study was conducted, none specifically mentioned death as a possible risk of the oxygen interventions in the study. The forms also lacked adequate descriptions of alternative courses of treatment and of the use of modified oximeters to experimentally control and mask babies' oxygen-saturation levels 删除7:<u>( www.citizen.org/documents/support-study-consent-form.pdf . opens in new tab )</u>. The oxygen interventions in the study differed from usual clinical care, and that information should have been included in the consent forms.\n\n【5】About half the forms indicated that because all the treatments proposed in the study were “standard of care,” there was no expected or predictable increase in risk. Yet the potential risks and benefits of being in the study could not be said to be the same as the potential risks and benefits of receiving care outside the study, in settings in which infants were not randomly assigned and held to oxygen levels at either end of a wide range of oxygen-saturation levels generally considered to be safe. Nor could the risks and benefits be said to be the same in the two groups of the study. Of course, the outcomes were not known ahead of time, but a potential differential in the risks that were being tracked (death, retinopathy of prematurity, and neurologic impairment) was reasonably foreseeable, since determining differential risk was the very purpose of the study.\n\n【6】Given the seriously deficient nature of the consent documents, the determination of the OHRP on March 7, 2013, was justified and did not overreach.\n\n【7】参考删除-2:<u>Ruth Macklin, Ph.D.  \nEpidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY  \nruth.  macklin@einstein.  yu.  edu</u>\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Lois Shepherd, J.D.  \nCenter for Biomedical Ethics and Humanities, School of Medicine, and School of Law, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA</u>\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Alice Dreger, Ph.D.  \nMedical Humanities and Bioethics Program, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Adrienne Asch, Ph.D.  \nCenter for Ethics, Yeshiva University, New York, NY</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Francoise Baylis, Ph.D.  \nFaculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>Howard Brody, M.D., Ph.D.  \nInstitute for the Medical Humanities, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX</u>\n\n【13】参考删除-2:<u>Larry R.

We describe 20 patients from the Rocky Mountain region who had group A streptococcal infections from 1986 to 1988 that were remarkable for the severity of local tissue destruction and life-threatening systemic toxicity.\n\n【2】Among the 20 patients (median age, 36), necrotizing fasciitis with or without myositis was the most common soft-tissue infection (55 percent). Nineteen patients (95 percent) had shock, 16 (80 percent) had renal impairment, and 11 (55 percent) had acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mortality rate was 30 percent. All patients but 1 had positive tissue cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes; 12 had positive blood cultures. Most of the patients had no underlying disease; 2 used intravenous drugs. Strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from 10 patients were not of a single M or T type; however, 8 of the 10 strains produced pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin A, a classic erythrogenic toxin), which has rarely been observed in recent years.\n\n【3】From our study of this cluster of severe streptococcal infections with a toxic shock-like syndrome, we conclude that in our region, more virulent group A streptococci have reappeared that produce the pyrogenic toxin A associated with scarlet fever. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1989; 321:1–7.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/12 17:20:41", "endTime": "2024/08/12 17:20:45", "cost": 3.875}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-11 18:26:21", "update_time": "2024-08-12 01:20:46", "grab_time": "2024-08-12 01:20:38"}

One month later, another 5000 athletes and additional staff will attend the Paralympics. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Tokyo 2020 playbooks, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> which are intended to protect both participants and the people of Japan from SARS-CoV-2 infection, Olympic athletes are instructed to supply their own face coverings, are encouraged (but not required) to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and will undergo testing at unspecified intervals after they arrive in Japan.\n\n【3】When the IOC postponed the Tokyo Olympics in March 2020, Japan had 865 active cases of Covid-19 against a global backdrop of 385,000 active cases. It was assumed that the pandemic would be controlled in 2021 or that vaccination would be widespread by then. Fourteen months later, Japan is in a state of emergency, with 70,000 active cases. Globally, there are 19 million active cases. Variants of concern, which may be more transmissible and more virulent than the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, are circulating widely. Vaccines are available in some countries, but less than 5% of Japan’s population is vaccinated, the lowest rate among all Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries.\n\n【4】Pfizer and BioNTech have offered to donate vaccines for all Olympic athletes, but this offer does not ensure that all athletes will receive vaccines before the Olympics, since vaccine authorization and availability are lacking in more than 100 countries. Moreover, some athletes may choose not to be vaccinated because of worries about the effects of vaccination on their performance or ethical concerns about being prioritized ahead of health care workers and vulnerable people. Although several countries have vaccinated their athletes, adolescents between 15 and 17 years of age cannot be vaccinated in most countries, and children younger than 15 can be vaccinated in even fewer countries. As a result, few teenage athletes, including gymnasts, swimmers, and divers as young as 12, will be vaccinated. In the absence of regular testing, participants may become infected during the Olympics and pose a risk when they return home to more than 200 countries.\n\n【5】We believe the IOC’s determination to proceed with the Olympic Games is not informed by the best scientific evidence. The playbooks maintain that athletes participate at their own risk, while failing both to distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes and to recognize the limitations of measures such as temperature screenings and face coverings. Similarly, the IOC has not heeded lessons from other large sporting events. Many U.S.-based professional leagues, including the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association, and the Women’s National Basketball Association, conducted successful seasons, but their protocols were rigorous and informed by an understanding of airborne transmission, asymptomatic spread, and the definition of close contacts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Preventive measures, adapted amid continuous expert review, included single hotel rooms for athletes, at least daily testing, and wearable technology for monitoring contacts, supported by rigorous contact tracing. Despite increasingly rigorous protocols, outbreaks of Covid-19 have caused multiple game cancellations. The World Men’s Handball Championship, held in Egypt in January 2021, showed the limits of housing even two people together when roommates were both forced out of games after one tested positive. In February, the Australian Open was challenged by hotel-driven exposures and two local outbreaks. In early May, the Indian Premier League cricket tournament was suspended in its third week.\n\n【6】The IOC’s playbooks 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> are not built on scientifically rigorous risk assessment, and they fail to consider the ways in which exposure occurs, the factors that contribute to exposure, and which participants may be at highest risk. To be sure, most athletes are at low risk for serious health outcomes associated with Covid-19, but some Paralympic athletes could be in a higher-risk category. In addition, we believe the playbooks do not adequately protect the thousands of people — including trainers, volunteers, officials, and transport and hotel employees — whose work ensures the success of such a large event.\n\n【7】The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have both recognized the important role of infectious-particle inhalation in person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> When planning any event, the first task should involve identifying the people most at risk of being exposed and the jobs, activities, and locations for which exposure will be the highest. When it comes to aerosol inhalation, the most important features of exposure are the concentration of infectious particles in the air and the length of time spent in contact with those particles. Concentration of particles depends on the number of infected people, the type of activity (i.e., the degree to which it generates aerosols), the amount of time that infected people spend in a particular space, and the degree of ventilation. Over long periods, physical distancing plays a less-relevant role in enclosed spaces, as particles become distributed throughout the space.\n\n【8】We believe that the IOC’s playbooks should classify events as low, moderate, or high risk depending on the activity and the venue and should address differences among these categories. For example, outdoor events for which competitors are naturally spaced out, such as sailing, archery, and equestrian events, may be considered low risk. Other outdoor sports for which close contact is unavoidable, such as rugby, hockey (field hockey), and football (soccer), could be considered moderate risk. Sports that are held in indoor venues and require close contact, such as boxing and wrestling, are probably high risk. Any sport that takes place indoors — even if athletes compete individually, as they do in gymnastics — will pose a greater risk than outdoor events. Protocols for keeping athletes and everyone else involved safe could vary on the basis of these risk levels.\n\n【9】The playbooks could also address differences among venues, including noncompetition spaces. Smaller, enclosed spaces where many athletes congregate, including stadiums, buses, and cafeterias, are higher-risk settings than outdoor areas. Hotels are likely to be high-risk areas, in light of close contact in shared rooms (three athletes per room will be standard), dining spaces, and other common areas and inadequate ventilation systems that were designed before the pandemic.\n\n【10】Because people with Covid-19 can be infectious 48 hours before they develop symptoms (and may not develop symptoms at all), routine temperature and symptom screening will not be effective for identifying presymptomatic or asymptomatic people. Polymerase-chain-reaction testing, at least once (if not twice) per day, is best practice, as the NFL experience shows. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The IOC plans to provide every athlete with a smartphone that has mandatory contact-tracing and health-reporting apps. Contact-tracing apps are often ineffective, however, and very few Olympic athletes will compete carrying a mobile phone. Evidence suggests that wearable devices with proximity sensors are more effective than such apps.\n\n【11】 Comparison of Best Practices to Protect Public and Athlete Health with the IOC’s Current Plan.\n\n【12】We recommend that the WHO immediately convene an emergency committee that includes experts in occupational safety and health, building and ventilation engineering, and infectious-disease epidemiology, as well as athlete representatives, to consider these factors and advise on a risk-management approach for the Tokyo Olympics (see table ). There is precedent for such an approach: the WHO convened an emergency committee to provide guidance ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil during the Zika virus Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】A global health security strategy relies on understanding the interconnectedness among countries. If our experience facing Covid-19 represents a moment of truth, it also provides an unrivaled opportunity for the realization of human values and collective human interests — the world’s new contract — and for preparing to defeat future threats. With less than 2 months until the Olympic torch is lit, canceling the Games may be the safest option. But the Olympic Games are one of the few events that could connect us at a time of global disconnect. The Olympic spirit is unparalleled in its power to inspire and mobilize. We rally around the torch because we recognize the value of the things that connect us over the value of the things that separate us. For us to connect safely, we believe urgent action is needed for these Olympic Games to proceed.\n\n【14】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on May 25, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York (A.S.); the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (L.M.B., M.T.O.) and the Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health (M.T.O.), University of Minnesota, Minneapolis; and the Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco (R.J.H.).</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 144KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d \\-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment remains uncertain, but identification of prognostic markers may help guide effective management. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.)</u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nClinical Features of VITT  \n_02:19_\n\n【13】As of June 6, 2021, approximately 175 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and 3.8 million deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been reported worldwide. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Programs providing unprecedented rapid clinical development of vaccines have been established. A number of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved, and many persons in the world have been vaccinated. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> One of the most widely administered vaccines is ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca), which uses a nonreplicating chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver the spike antigen to the recipient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Rollout of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine started in the United Kingdom on January 4, 2021. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was first administered to older adults and then to younger age groups; by June 6, approximately 16 million first doses had been administered to persons 50 years of age or older and 8 million had been administered to those younger than 50 years of age. The latter population mainly comprised healthcare and social workers and vulnerable persons.\n\n【14】In March 2021, concerns developed regarding an increased risk of thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia among persons who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. By the end of the month, groups from Norway, Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom reported on persons admitted to the hospital 5 to 24 days after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. These patients had thrombosis at unusual sites, thrombocytopenia, disproportionately elevated d \\-dimer levels, and reduced fibrinogen levels. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> Most of these patients were previously fit, healthy young persons.\n\n【15】This reported syndrome has been given various names, but we have used the term vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) to acknowledge its pathogenic similarities with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), even though VITT occurs in the absence of heparin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The clinical and laboratory resemblances to HIT are supported by the finding in the patients’ serum of high-titer antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) that activate platelets. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> Because of this unusual and severe thrombotic syndrome and the likely importance of the early population rollout of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, we convened an expert hematology panel to evaluate patients as they presented, discuss treatment, and develop consensus management guidance based on observations of patients and extrapolation of knowledge of other forms of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Here, we describe the first 220 cases of definite or probable VITT reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Study Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Patient information was gained from the daily meetings of the expert hematology panel, which began on March 22, 2021. The wider hematology community was alerted to the existence of the expert hematology panel by the British Society for Haematology and was encouraged to report suspected cases of VITT. A total of 182 consultant hematologists presented cases from 96 National Health Service trusts. An anonymized electronic reporting form, developed with Public Health England, was completed for each patient by the local attending team. This form captured the presenting features, thrombosis site, laboratory measures, initial treatment, and outcome. All cases were simultaneously reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Cases that were retrospectively identified as having occurred before recognition of VITT in mid-March were also included.\n\n【19】The study was designed by the core group of the expert hematology panel. The article was written by the first author with input from the core group of the expert hematology panel, and all the authors contributed to the editing of the manuscript. The cases described here were reported up to June 6, 2021.\n\n【20】Case Definition\n---------------\n\n【21】Table 1.  Table 1. Case Definition Criteria for Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT), According to an Expert Hematology Panel.\n\n【22】Cases of VITT were defined according to five criteria as follows: the onset of symptoms 5 to 30 days after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the presence of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000 per cubic millimeter), a d \\-dimer level greater than 4000 fibrinogen-equivalent units (FEUs), and the presence of antibodies to PF4 detected by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Persons who met all five criteria were considered to have definite VITT. Persons who did not meet all five criteria were judged to have probable, possible, or unlikely VITT according to the classification shown in Table 1 . The absence of a criterion could have been a true absence or the test may not have been carried out (e.g., anti-PF4 antibodies may have been measured before VITT was recognized as a syndrome).\n\n【23】Confirmation of the type of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 received and whether it was the first or second dose was obtained from primary care practitioners or public health bodies. All cases of suspected VITT were independently categorized by two expert hematology panel members; if there was discrepancy, the case was scored by a third expert hematology panel member and final categorization was made by consensus. Our analysis involved patients who were classified as having definite or probable VITT.\n\n【24】Laboratory Tests\n----------------\n\n【25】Standard tests that were performed in local laboratories included the platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial-thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level measured by the Clauss method, and d \\-dimer levels. Normal ranges for coagulation tests were determined at the local laboratories or with the thresholds used by the manufacturers of the reagents. Results for d \\-dimer levels are reported in FEUs; the normal level is less than 500 FEU (equivalent to <250 ng per milliliter). Many laboratories do not quantitate d \\-dimer levels above 20,000 FEU; therefore, 20,000 FEU was recorded when the result was above this level.\n\n【26】In 17 specialist laboratories in the United Kingdom, anti-PF4 antibodies were detected by a HIT ELISA method with the use of Lifecodes PF4 (Immucor), Asserachrom HPIA (Stago), Zymutest HIA (Hyphen BioMed), or Aeskulisa (Aesku Diagnostics) monospecific (IgG) or polyspecific (IgG, IgA, IgM) assays. The positive thresholds were based on the manufacturers’ optical density thresholds or on locally derived normal ranges. Chemiluminescence assays with high sensitivity for HIT were found to be unreliable in detecting anti-PF4 antibodies in patients with VITT; therefore, the results of these assays were not used in this analysis.\n\n【27】Radiologic Imaging\n------------------\n\n【28】Radiologic imaging was performed at the discretion of the local clinical teams. For patients who presented with headaches, computed tomographic imaging or magnetic resonance venography was recommended.\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The outcome variables studied were the number of days from vaccination to presentation; the site of thrombosis, including arterial thrombosis and thrombosis at multiple sites; intracranial hemorrhage; adrenal thrombosis, hemorrhage, or both; and death. Variables measured against these outcomes were sex, days since vaccination, platelet count, fibrinogen level, d \\-dimer level, the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【31】Variables are described as numbers and percentages or as medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between the variables and mortality. All numerical variables, except age and d \\-dimer level, were log-transformed for analysis to remove positive skewness. We used chained equations to impute missing values in the predictor variables with multiple imputation. Ten data sets were created with the use of an imputation model that included all the predictor variables and the outcome. Because of the small sample size, only variables with a univariate P value of less than 0.20 were entered into this model. A backward elimination algorithm was then applied with the use of a P value of less than 0.05.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Patient Identification\n----------------------\n\n【34】Of 294 patients who were evaluated, 31 had been identified retrospectively once VITT had been recognized as a syndrome. A total of 57 patients were classified as being unlikely to have VITT because of three missing data points, unmet criteria, or both (50 patients) or because an alternative cause of the patient’s symptoms was likely (7 patients). The alternative causes were chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation from abdominal aortic aneurysm (in 3 patients) and metastatic cancer (in 4 patients). Of the remaining 237 patients who were considered to have suspected VITT, 17 were classified as having possible VITT; 50 were classified as having probable VITT because one of the criteria was not met (in most cases because of missing data) 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>; and 170 were classified as having definite VITT. All the patients who were classified as having definite or probable VITT presented after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【35】By the end of the study, approximately 16 million first doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had been administered to persons 50 years of age or older, and 8 million first doses had been administered to persons younger than 50 years of age. Thus, the approximate incidence of VITT was at least 1:100,000 among patients 50 years of age or older and at least 1:50,000 among patients in the younger group (<50 years of age). 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【36】Baseline Characteristics of the Patients\n----------------------------------------\n\n【37】Table 2. Table 2. Baseline Clinicopathological Features of the Patients with VITT. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Baseline Distribution of Variables in Patients with Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT).\n\n【38】Shown are the variables in patients with VITT, including those who did not survive.\n\n【39】The baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the 220 patients with definite or probable VITT are shown in Table 2 . A total of 97% presented at 5 to 30 days after vaccination; the 3% of patients who presented between 30 and 48 days had isolated venous thromboembolism (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). The age at presentation ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a median of 48 years (interquartile range, 38 to 56). A total of 56% of the patients were younger than 50 years of age, and 85% were younger than 60 years of age. There were slightly more women (54%) than men. The median time from vaccination to presentation was 14 days (interquartile range, 10 to 16). Data on the patients’ age, days since vaccination, and baseline platelet count and fibrinogen and d \\-dimer levels are shown in Figure 1 .\n\n【40】Medical History\n---------------\n\n【41】Information about medical history was available for 165 of the 220 patients; 68 of these patients (41%) had no previous medical diagnoses. Of the 97 patients (59%) reported to have a past or current medical illness, no diagnoses or use of medications occurred at a frequency that would be unexpected in the general population. Conditions that were specifically examined were autoimmune disease, previous venous thromboembolism, prothrombotic disorders (including thrombophilia and antiphospholipid syndrome), cancer, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Arterial risk factors and the use of hormonal preparations and anticoagulants were also assessed 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. None of the patients had been exposed to heparin in the 3 months preceding their presentation with VITT, and 104 of the patients were not receiving any medication. In the 7 patients who were receiving oral anticoagulation therapy when they presented with VITT, the median d \\-dimer level was not significantly lower than that documented in the patients with definite VITT (23,850 FEU) or those with probable VITT (20,000 FEU).\n\n【42】Thrombocytopenia\n----------------\n\n【43】The median baseline platelet count was 47,000 per cubic millimeter (range, 6,000 to 344,000). Eleven of the 220 patients (5%) presented with a normal platelet count (median, 175,000 per cubic millimeter; range, 153,000 to 344,000). All had positive anti-PF4 antibodies; in 9 of these patients, the platelet count subsequently decreased below the lower limit of the normal range (i.e., <150,000 per cubic millimeter). In 2 patients (<1%) the only available platelet counts were those measured at presentation; in 1 patient who presented with middle cerebral artery infarct, the platelet count was 153,000 per cubic millimeter, and in a patient with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the platelet count was 173,000 per cubic millimeter. Among 217 patients for whom data on platelet counts were available, the baseline platelet count was less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter at presentation in 56 patients (26%) and the nadir platelet count was less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter in 73 patients (34%).\n\n【44】In 6 patients, thrombocytopenia and all other criteria were met but thrombosis was not documented. Although these patients were classified as having probable, rather than definite, VITT, it is likely that the lack of thrombosis reflected the early recognition and treatment of VITT.\n\n【45】Anti-PF4 Antibodies\n-------------------\n\n【46】Anti-PF4 antibodies were present in 198 of 220 patients (90.0%) with definite or probable VITT. ELISA was not performed in 16 of 220 patients (7.3%) because they died before anti-PF4 antibody testing or had VITT that was diagnosed retrospectively before the recognition of involvement of anti-PF4 antibodies. The result was negative in 6 patients (2.7%). These patients met all other criteria for the diagnosis of VITT, including profound coagulation activation, and they received treatment for VITT. Optical densities were not correlated with disease severity (thrombosis at presentation or death) because different ELISA methods were used.\n\n【47】Thrombosis and Thromboembolism\n------------------------------\n\n【48】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Sites of Disease in 220 Patients with Definite or Probable VITT.\n\n【49】Sites of disease (thrombosis or bleeding) that are not shown include the bowel and the pelvic, retinal, ophthalmic, and internal jugular veins.\n\n【50】The most common thrombotic site at presentation was the cerebral veins; this was at least one site of thrombosis in 110 of the 220 patients (50%) with definite or probable VITT. In 40 of these patients (36%), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was complicated by secondary intracranial hemorrhage; in 2 patients, intracranial hemorrhage was reported in association with a cerebrovascular accident. Intracranial hemorrhage was more common in patients with lower platelet counts (median, 34,000 per cubic millimeter) than in those with higher platelet counts (median, 50,000 per cubic millimeter). The deep veins of the legs and the pulmonary arteries were the second most common sites and were affected in 82 of the 220 patients (37%) (40 cases of deep-vein thrombosis and 63 cases of pulmonary embolism; 21 patients had both). A total of 41 patients (19%) had splanchnic-vein thrombosis; this thrombosis most often affected the portal circulation (30 cases of portal-vein thrombosis and 22 cases of other splanchnic-vein thrombosis; 11 patients had both). Forty-seven patients (21%) had one or more arterial thrombotic events; aortic thrombosis or ischemic limb was seen in 26 patients (12%) and cardiac or cerebral arterial events were seen in 26 patients (12%), with 9 myocardial infarctions and 17 cerebrovascular accidents. In 64 of the 220 patients (29%) with definite or probable VITT, two or more vascular beds were involved 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The number of events according to disease site is shown in Figure 2 . Thirty-one patients had isolated venous thromboembolism (all included pulmonary embolism except in 1 patient who had extensive superficial and deep-vein thromboses). No significant differences were noted among patients who presented with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, those who presented with isolated venous thrombolism, and those who presented with arterial thrombosis with respect to age, platelet count (median and range), d \\-dimer level, fibrinogen level, or days since vaccination 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【51】Treatment\n---------\n\n【52】The forms of treatment used in patients classified as having definite or probable VITT are shown in Table S6. Intravenous immune globulin was used in 72% of the patients (at all platelet count levels) at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight administered on day 1 of admission. In 11% of the patients, a second dose for ongoing or relapsed disease was administered.\n\n【53】A total of 17 patients with severe disease involving cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombosis at multiple sites, or both underwent plasma exchange; this therapy was associated with 90% survival. Both patients who underwent plasma exchange and died had extensive intracranial hemorrhage at presentation. Octaplas (Octapharma) solvent detergent plasma was used; no allergic reactions, bleeding, hemodynamic compromise, or other complications were seen.\n\n【54】Systemic glucocorticoids were used in 26% of the patients and in 50% of those with a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter. Preparations included intravenous methylprednisolone, oral or intravenous dexamethasone, and oral prednisolone. Patients with a baseline platelet count of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter were three times more likely to receive a platelet transfusion, typically in preparation for neurosurgery or for anticoagulation. In 15% of the patients with extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with or without secondary intracranial hemorrhage, neurosurgery or thrombectomy was performed by interventional radiologists.\n\n【55】Anticoagulation was administered in 91% of the patients; non–heparin-based anticoagulation, including argatroban, fondaparinux, apixaban, and dabigatran, was used in 68%. Heparin was administered at some point during admission in 50 patients (23%). Its use was universal in the patients who presented before mid-March and received a diagnosis retrospectively, and it was administered to other patients before the diagnosis was considered and the anticoagulant was switched. Mortality among these patients was 20%, as compared with 16% among those receiving non–heparin-based anticoagulants.\n\n【56】Death\n-----\n\n【57】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical and Laboratory Features with Respect to Outcomes in Patients with VITT.\n\n【58】At the time of the data analysis, 170 of 220 patients with definite or probable VITT were alive and 49 had died (22%). Outcome survival data were unavailable for 1 patient. Clinical and laboratory features with respect to patient outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Table S5. In these 220 patients, the odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.2) among those with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 FEU in the baseline d \\-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed incidence of death was 73% among patients with both a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and an intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】Against the backdrop of a successful vaccination program in the United Kingdom, VITT has emerged as a rare but devastating complication. We have found that it often affects young, otherwise healthy vaccine recipients and that it is associated with a high mortality. Our study involving the first 220 patients with VITT reported in the United Kingdom shows that the condition usually manifests 5 to 30 days after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, as was also noted in a study performed in Scotland. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our cohort, 85% of the patients were younger than 60 years of age, despite the predominance of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in older adults.\n\n【61】The incidence of VITT among persons younger than 50 years of age was 1:50,000, consistent with reports from other countries. However, the incidence could have been higher, because the patients probably presented before the condition was recognized, other cases may not have been reported to us, and some cases may have been misclassified. Data are lacking on the numbers of persons vaccinated per age decade among those younger than 50 years of age, and therefore we cannot determine age-specific incidences. No sex preponderance was noted, and no medical condition was seen at a frequency higher than would be expected for the background population, even though the vaccination program in the United Kingdom prioritized persons with underlying medical conditions.\n\n【62】The extensive nature of the thrombotic events was remarkable, and they often simultaneously involved multiple vascular beds and both the venous and arterial circulations. Although cerebral venous thromboses dominated the clinical presentation, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, portal- and splanchnic-vein thrombosis, and arterial events affecting the peripheral vasculature and the myocardial and cerebral arteries were also common. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis often involved many of the venous sinuses 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>, with thrombi extending into the venules. Outflow obstruction with increased venous pressure in patients with thrombocytopenia was probably the dominant explanation for secondary hemorrhage. In some patients, craniectomy or interventional radiology for thrombectomy to improve cerebral venous drainage was warranted.\n\n【63】Laboratory evidence of more severe coagulation activation with lower platelet counts, a low fibrinogen level, and higher d \\-dimer levels were all associated with worse outcomes. The risk of death was particularly high among patients who presented with a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Our overall case–fatality rate was 23%, which compares favorably with descriptions of earlier, smaller cohorts with a case–fatality rate of 50%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u>\n\n【64】No therapeutic pathways have shown efficacy for the treatment of VITT. The rationale for the use of intravenous immune globulin is based on preventing antigen–antibody complexes from activating platelets through the Fcγ II receptor; this rationale is extrapolated from approaches to spontaneous HIT. A comparison of the efficacy of anticoagulants was not possible in our series because of the small numbers of patients and nonrandom assignment; however, heparin did not appear to be harmful in patients who received it.\n\n【65】The analysis of our cohort has led us to tailor our therapeutic approach to the various clinical phenotypes. For example, the high mortality among patients with intracranial hemorrhage and a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter has led us to use plasma exchange in those with these low platelet counts and extensive thrombosis or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 删除2:<u>(Fig. S4)</u>. Survival after plasma exchange was 90%, considerably better than would be predicted given the baseline characteristics.\n\n【66】The constellation of clinical and laboratory features in VITT appears to stem from the production of anti-PF4 antibodies in response to vaccine components, although it remains unclear which components are involved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> We used the HIT ELISA to detect the anti-PF4 antibodies after previously finding that although these assays are positive in most cases of VITT, the rapid non-ELISA tests are often negative. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, 6 patients with probable VITT tested negative for anti-PF4 antibodies. Our recommendation is to repeat testing with an alternative ELISA method, 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> but it is unclear whether these patients have antibodies to an epitope that is not recognized by the currently available assays. A study involving Norwegian health care workers detected anti-PF4 antibodies in 6 of 492 patients (1.2%) after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; all had normal platelet counts, but studies are lacking to determine whether this is a risk factor for VITT. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【67】A potential weakness of our study is case-ascertainment bias. VITT is a new syndrome, and without a full understanding of the pathophysiology, including why certain vascular beds are more susceptible, and with the real incidence of PF4 antibodies after vaccination in the healthy population unknown, cases may be included that are not true VITT or else they may be missed if they do not meet immediate criteria such as platelet count on admission. Furthermore, since recognition of VITT occurred only in mid-March, when the vaccine rollout reached the younger age groups, it is possible that before this time, older patients with thrombosis, sudden death, or both may have had VITT and may have been missed.\n\n【68】We have defined the clinical and laboratory phenotypes of VITT in a large cohort of patients in the United Kingdom. We did not find any individual risk factors for VITT, but we found increased mortality among patients who presented with severe thrombocytopenia, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, intracranial hemorrhage, laboratory markers of severe coagulation activation, or all these variables. In our cohort, the cases of VITT were associated only with the first ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, and VITT primarily affected patients younger than 60 years of age. Multiple-site thromboses and arterial events were common. Along with anticoagulation, intravenous immune globulin has been the mainstay of therapy; anecdotally, patients with more severe disease may have benefitted from plasma exchange.\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</u>\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on August 11, 2021, and updated on August 12, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>We thank all our clinical, laboratory, and public health colleagues, in particular the many clinical hematologists who have attended our daily meetings, presented cases, and persevered with data collection; Public Health England, especially Dr. Mary Ramsay; the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency; and Thrombosis UK, whose staff provided psychological support and help to patients.</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford (S.P., A.R.), the Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Cardiometabolic Programme–National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals–Biomedical Research Centre (M.S., B.C.), the Thrombosis and Haemophilia Centre, Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London (B.J.H.), and the Department of Statistical Science, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (G.A.), London, the Department of Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham (W.L.), the Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow (C.B.), and the Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield, Sheffield (M.M.) — all in the United Kingdom.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Pavord at the Department of Haematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, United Kingdom, or at sue.pavord@ouh.nhs.uk .</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Research Summary | PDF | 145KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supplementary Appendix | PDF | 2382KB |\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 362KB |\n| Data Sharing Statement | PDF | 69KB |</u>\n\n【80】参考删除-1:<u>References _(15)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【81】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Data are lacking on the clinical features of and the prognostic criteria for this disorder.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】We conducted a prospective cohort study involving patients with suspected VITT who presented to hospitals in the United Kingdom between March 22 and June 6, 2021. Data were collected with the use of an anonymized electronic form, and cases were identified as definite or probable VITT according to prespecified criteria. Baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the patients, risk factors, treatment, and markers of poor prognosis were determined.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】Among 294 patients who were evaluated, we identified 170 definite and 50 probable cases of VITT. All the patients had received the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and presented 5 to 48 days (median, 14) after vaccination. The age range was 18 to 79 years (median, 48), with no sex preponderance and no identifiable medical risk factors. Overall mortality was 22%. The odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.4 to 5.2) among patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 fibrinogen-equivalent units in the baseline d \\-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed mortality was 73% among patients with platelet counts below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】The high mortality associated with VITT was highest among patients with a low platelet count and intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment remains uncertain, but identification of prognostic markers may help guide effective management. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.)</u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nClinical Features of VITT  \n_02:19_\n\n【13】As of June 6, 2021, approximately 175 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and 3.8 million deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have been reported worldwide. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Programs providing unprecedented rapid clinical development of vaccines have been established. A number of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved, and many persons in the world have been vaccinated. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> One of the most widely administered vaccines is ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca), which uses a nonreplicating chimpanzee adenovirus to deliver the spike antigen to the recipient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Rollout of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine started in the United Kingdom on January 4, 2021. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> The vaccine was first administered to older adults and then to younger age groups; by June 6, approximately 16 million first doses had been administered to persons 50 years of age or older and 8 million had been administered to those younger than 50 years of age. The latter population mainly comprised healthcare and social workers and vulnerable persons.\n\n【14】In March 2021, concerns developed regarding an increased risk of thrombosis associated with thrombocytopenia among persons who had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. By the end of the month, groups from Norway, Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom reported on persons admitted to the hospital 5 to 24 days after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. These patients had thrombosis at unusual sites, thrombocytopenia, disproportionately elevated d \\-dimer levels, and reduced fibrinogen levels. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> Most of these patients were previously fit, healthy young persons.\n\n【15】This reported syndrome has been given various names, but we have used the term vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) to acknowledge its pathogenic similarities with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), even though VITT occurs in the absence of heparin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The clinical and laboratory resemblances to HIT are supported by the finding in the patients’ serum of high-titer antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4) that activate platelets. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8 </a></sup></u> Because of this unusual and severe thrombotic syndrome and the likely importance of the early population rollout of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, we convened an expert hematology panel to evaluate patients as they presented, discuss treatment, and develop consensus management guidance based on observations of patients and extrapolation of knowledge of other forms of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Here, we describe the first 220 cases of definite or probable VITT reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Study Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Patient information was gained from the daily meetings of the expert hematology panel, which began on March 22, 2021. The wider hematology community was alerted to the existence of the expert hematology panel by the British Society for Haematology and was encouraged to report suspected cases of VITT. A total of 182 consultant hematologists presented cases from 96 National Health Service trusts. An anonymized electronic reporting form, developed with Public Health England, was completed for each patient by the local attending team. This form captured the presenting features, thrombosis site, laboratory measures, initial treatment, and outcome. All cases were simultaneously reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Cases that were retrospectively identified as having occurred before recognition of VITT in mid-March were also included.\n\n【19】The study was designed by the core group of the expert hematology panel. The article was written by the first author with input from the core group of the expert hematology panel, and all the authors contributed to the editing of the manuscript. The cases described here were reported up to June 6, 2021.\n\n【20】Case Definition\n---------------\n\n【21】Table 1.  Table 1. Case Definition Criteria for Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT), According to an Expert Hematology Panel.\n\n【22】Cases of VITT were defined according to five criteria as follows: the onset of symptoms 5 to 30 days after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the presence of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000 per cubic millimeter), a d \\-dimer level greater than 4000 fibrinogen-equivalent units (FEUs), and the presence of antibodies to PF4 detected by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Persons who met all five criteria were considered to have definite VITT. Persons who did not meet all five criteria were judged to have probable, possible, or unlikely VITT according to the classification shown in Table 1 . The absence of a criterion could have been a true absence or the test may not have been carried out (e.g., anti-PF4 antibodies may have been measured before VITT was recognized as a syndrome).\n\n【23】Confirmation of the type of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 received and whether it was the first or second dose was obtained from primary care practitioners or public health bodies. All cases of suspected VITT were independently categorized by two expert hematology panel members; if there was discrepancy, the case was scored by a third expert hematology panel member and final categorization was made by consensus. Our analysis involved patients who were classified as having definite or probable VITT.\n\n【24】Laboratory Tests\n----------------\n\n【25】Standard tests that were performed in local laboratories included the platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial-thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level measured by the Clauss method, and d \\-dimer levels. Normal ranges for coagulation tests were determined at the local laboratories or with the thresholds used by the manufacturers of the reagents. Results for d \\-dimer levels are reported in FEUs; the normal level is less than 500 FEU (equivalent to <250 ng per milliliter). Many laboratories do not quantitate d \\-dimer levels above 20,000 FEU; therefore, 20,000 FEU was recorded when the result was above this level.\n\n【26】In 17 specialist laboratories in the United Kingdom, anti-PF4 antibodies were detected by a HIT ELISA method with the use of Lifecodes PF4 (Immucor), Asserachrom HPIA (Stago), Zymutest HIA (Hyphen BioMed), or Aeskulisa (Aesku Diagnostics) monospecific (IgG) or polyspecific (IgG, IgA, IgM) assays. The positive thresholds were based on the manufacturers’ optical density thresholds or on locally derived normal ranges. Chemiluminescence assays with high sensitivity for HIT were found to be unreliable in detecting anti-PF4 antibodies in patients with VITT; therefore, the results of these assays were not used in this analysis.\n\n【27】Radiologic Imaging\n------------------\n\n【28】Radiologic imaging was performed at the discretion of the local clinical teams. For patients who presented with headaches, computed tomographic imaging or magnetic resonance venography was recommended.\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The outcome variables studied were the number of days from vaccination to presentation; the site of thrombosis, including arterial thrombosis and thrombosis at multiple sites; intracranial hemorrhage; adrenal thrombosis, hemorrhage, or both; and death. Variables measured against these outcomes were sex, days since vaccination, platelet count, fibrinogen level, d \\-dimer level, the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【31】Variables are described as numbers and percentages or as medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between the variables and mortality. All numerical variables, except age and d \\-dimer level, were log-transformed for analysis to remove positive skewness. We used chained equations to impute missing values in the predictor variables with multiple imputation. Ten data sets were created with the use of an imputation model that included all the predictor variables and the outcome. Because of the small sample size, only variables with a univariate P value of less than 0.20 were entered into this model. A backward elimination algorithm was then applied with the use of a P value of less than 0.05.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Patient Identification\n----------------------\n\n【34】Of 294 patients who were evaluated, 31 had been identified retrospectively once VITT had been recognized as a syndrome. A total of 57 patients were classified as being unlikely to have VITT because of three missing data points, unmet criteria, or both (50 patients) or because an alternative cause of the patient’s symptoms was likely (7 patients). The alternative causes were chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation from abdominal aortic aneurysm (in 3 patients) and metastatic cancer (in 4 patients). Of the remaining 237 patients who were considered to have suspected VITT, 17 were classified as having possible VITT; 50 were classified as having probable VITT because one of the criteria was not met (in most cases because of missing data) 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u></u>; and 170 were classified as having definite VITT. All the patients who were classified as having definite or probable VITT presented after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【35】By the end of the study, approximately 16 million first doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had been administered to persons 50 years of age or older, and 8 million first doses had been administered to persons younger than 50 years of age. Thus, the approximate incidence of VITT was at least 1:100,000 among patients 50 years of age or older and at least 1:50,000 among patients in the younger group (<50 years of age). 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【36】Baseline Characteristics of the Patients\n----------------------------------------\n\n【37】Table 2. Table 2. Baseline Clinicopathological Features of the Patients with VITT. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Baseline Distribution of Variables in Patients with Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis (VITT).\n\n【38】Shown are the variables in patients with VITT, including those who did not survive.\n\n【39】The baseline characteristics and clinicopathological features of the 220 patients with definite or probable VITT are shown in Table 2 . A total of 97% presented at 5 to 30 days after vaccination; the 3% of patients who presented between 30 and 48 days had isolated venous thromboembolism (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). The age at presentation ranged from 18 to 79 years, with a median of 48 years (interquartile range, 38 to 56). A total of 56% of the patients were younger than 50 years of age, and 85% were younger than 60 years of age. There were slightly more women (54%) than men. The median time from vaccination to presentation was 14 days (interquartile range, 10 to 16). Data on the patients’ age, days since vaccination, and baseline platelet count and fibrinogen and d \\-dimer levels are shown in Figure 1 .\n\n【40】Medical History\n---------------\n\n【41】Information about medical history was available for 165 of the 220 patients; 68 of these patients (41%) had no previous medical diagnoses. Of the 97 patients (59%) reported to have a past or current medical illness, no diagnoses or use of medications occurred at a frequency that would be unexpected in the general population. Conditions that were specifically examined were autoimmune disease, previous venous thromboembolism, prothrombotic disorders (including thrombophilia and antiphospholipid syndrome), cancer, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Arterial risk factors and the use of hormonal preparations and anticoagulants were also assessed 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. None of the patients had been exposed to heparin in the 3 months preceding their presentation with VITT, and 104 of the patients were not receiving any medication. In the 7 patients who were receiving oral anticoagulation therapy when they presented with VITT, the median d \\-dimer level was not significantly lower than that documented in the patients with definite VITT (23,850 FEU) or those with probable VITT (20,000 FEU).\n\n【42】Thrombocytopenia\n----------------\n\n【43】The median baseline platelet count was 47,000 per cubic millimeter (range, 6,000 to 344,000). Eleven of the 220 patients (5%) presented with a normal platelet count (median, 175,000 per cubic millimeter; range, 153,000 to 344,000). All had positive anti-PF4 antibodies; in 9 of these patients, the platelet count subsequently decreased below the lower limit of the normal range (i.e., <150,000 per cubic millimeter). In 2 patients (<1%) the only available platelet counts were those measured at presentation; in 1 patient who presented with middle cerebral artery infarct, the platelet count was 153,000 per cubic millimeter, and in a patient with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the platelet count was 173,000 per cubic millimeter. Among 217 patients for whom data on platelet counts were available, the baseline platelet count was less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter at presentation in 56 patients (26%) and the nadir platelet count was less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter in 73 patients (34%).\n\n【44】In 6 patients, thrombocytopenia and all other criteria were met but thrombosis was not documented. Although these patients were classified as having probable, rather than definite, VITT, it is likely that the lack of thrombosis reflected the early recognition and treatment of VITT.\n\n【45】Anti-PF4 Antibodies\n-------------------\n\n【46】Anti-PF4 antibodies were present in 198 of 220 patients (90.0%) with definite or probable VITT. ELISA was not performed in 16 of 220 patients (7.3%) because they died before anti-PF4 antibody testing or had VITT that was diagnosed retrospectively before the recognition of involvement of anti-PF4 antibodies. The result was negative in 6 patients (2.7%). These patients met all other criteria for the diagnosis of VITT, including profound coagulation activation, and they received treatment for VITT. Optical densities were not correlated with disease severity (thrombosis at presentation or death) because different ELISA methods were used.\n\n【47】Thrombosis and Thromboembolism\n------------------------------\n\n【48】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Sites of Disease in 220 Patients with Definite or Probable VITT.\n\n【49】Sites of disease (thrombosis or bleeding) that are not shown include the bowel and the pelvic, retinal, ophthalmic, and internal jugular veins.\n\n【50】The most common thrombotic site at presentation was the cerebral veins; this was at least one site of thrombosis in 110 of the 220 patients (50%) with definite or probable VITT. In 40 of these patients (36%), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was complicated by secondary intracranial hemorrhage; in 2 patients, intracranial hemorrhage was reported in association with a cerebrovascular accident. Intracranial hemorrhage was more common in patients with lower platelet counts (median, 34,000 per cubic millimeter) than in those with higher platelet counts (median, 50,000 per cubic millimeter). The deep veins of the legs and the pulmonary arteries were the second most common sites and were affected in 82 of the 220 patients (37%) (40 cases of deep-vein thrombosis and 63 cases of pulmonary embolism; 21 patients had both). A total of 41 patients (19%) had splanchnic-vein thrombosis; this thrombosis most often affected the portal circulation (30 cases of portal-vein thrombosis and 22 cases of other splanchnic-vein thrombosis; 11 patients had both). Forty-seven patients (21%) had one or more arterial thrombotic events; aortic thrombosis or ischemic limb was seen in 26 patients (12%) and cardiac or cerebral arterial events were seen in 26 patients (12%), with 9 myocardial infarctions and 17 cerebrovascular accidents. In 64 of the 220 patients (29%) with definite or probable VITT, two or more vascular beds were involved 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The number of events according to disease site is shown in Figure 2 . Thirty-one patients had isolated venous thromboembolism (all included pulmonary embolism except in 1 patient who had extensive superficial and deep-vein thromboses). No significant differences were noted among patients who presented with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, those who presented with isolated venous thrombolism, and those who presented with arterial thrombosis with respect to age, platelet count (median and range), d \\-dimer level, fibrinogen level, or days since vaccination 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【51】Treatment\n---------\n\n【52】The forms of treatment used in patients classified as having definite or probable VITT are shown in Table S6. Intravenous immune globulin was used in 72% of the patients (at all platelet count levels) at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight administered on day 1 of admission. In 11% of the patients, a second dose for ongoing or relapsed disease was administered.\n\n【53】A total of 17 patients with severe disease involving cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombosis at multiple sites, or both underwent plasma exchange; this therapy was associated with 90% survival. Both patients who underwent plasma exchange and died had extensive intracranial hemorrhage at presentation. Octaplas (Octapharma) solvent detergent plasma was used; no allergic reactions, bleeding, hemodynamic compromise, or other complications were seen.\n\n【54】Systemic glucocorticoids were used in 26% of the patients and in 50% of those with a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter. Preparations included intravenous methylprednisolone, oral or intravenous dexamethasone, and oral prednisolone. Patients with a baseline platelet count of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter were three times more likely to receive a platelet transfusion, typically in preparation for neurosurgery or for anticoagulation. In 15% of the patients with extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with or without secondary intracranial hemorrhage, neurosurgery or thrombectomy was performed by interventional radiologists.\n\n【55】Anticoagulation was administered in 91% of the patients; non–heparin-based anticoagulation, including argatroban, fondaparinux, apixaban, and dabigatran, was used in 68%. Heparin was administered at some point during admission in 50 patients (23%). Its use was universal in the patients who presented before mid-March and received a diagnosis retrospectively, and it was administered to other patients before the diagnosis was considered and the anticoagulant was switched. Mortality among these patients was 20%, as compared with 16% among those receiving non–heparin-based anticoagulants.\n\n【56】Death\n-----\n\n【57】Table 3.  Table 3. Clinical and Laboratory Features with Respect to Outcomes in Patients with VITT.\n\n【58】At the time of the data analysis, 170 of 220 patients with definite or probable VITT were alive and 49 had died (22%). Outcome survival data were unavailable for 1 patient. Clinical and laboratory features with respect to patient outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Table S5. In these 220 patients, the odds of death increased by a factor of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.2) among those with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.3) for every 50% decrease in the baseline platelet count, by a factor of 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for every increase of 10,000 FEU in the baseline d \\-dimer level, and by a factor of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5) for every 50% decrease in the baseline fibrinogen level. Multivariate analysis identified the baseline platelet count and the presence of intracranial hemorrhage as being independently associated with death; the observed incidence of death was 73% among patients with both a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter and an intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】Against the backdrop of a successful vaccination program in the United Kingdom, VITT has emerged as a rare but devastating complication. We have found that it often affects young, otherwise healthy vaccine recipients and that it is associated with a high mortality. Our study involving the first 220 patients with VITT reported in the United Kingdom shows that the condition usually manifests 5 to 30 days after the first vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, as was also noted in a study performed in Scotland. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In our cohort, 85% of the patients were younger than 60 years of age, despite the predominance of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in older adults.\n\n【61】The incidence of VITT among persons younger than 50 years of age was 1:50,000, consistent with reports from other countries. However, the incidence could have been higher, because the patients probably presented before the condition was recognized, other cases may not have been reported to us, and some cases may have been misclassified. Data are lacking on the numbers of persons vaccinated per age decade among those younger than 50 years of age, and therefore we cannot determine age-specific incidences. No sex preponderance was noted, and no medical condition was seen at a frequency higher than would be expected for the background population, even though the vaccination program in the United Kingdom prioritized persons with underlying medical conditions.\n\n【62】The extensive nature of the thrombotic events was remarkable, and they often simultaneously involved multiple vascular beds and both the venous and arterial circulations. Although cerebral venous thromboses dominated the clinical presentation, deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, portal- and splanchnic-vein thrombosis, and arterial events affecting the peripheral vasculature and the myocardial and cerebral arteries were also common. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis often involved many of the venous sinuses 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>, with thrombi extending into the venules. Outflow obstruction with increased venous pressure in patients with thrombocytopenia was probably the dominant explanation for secondary hemorrhage. In some patients, craniectomy or interventional radiology for thrombectomy to improve cerebral venous drainage was warranted.\n\n【63】Laboratory evidence of more severe coagulation activation with lower platelet counts, a low fibrinogen level, and higher d \\-dimer levels were all associated with worse outcomes. The risk of death was particularly high among patients who presented with a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Our overall case–fatality rate was 23%, which compares favorably with descriptions of earlier, smaller cohorts with a case–fatality rate of 50%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u>\n\n【64】No therapeutic pathways have shown efficacy for the treatment of VITT. The rationale for the use of intravenous immune globulin is based on preventing antigen–antibody complexes from activating platelets through the Fcγ II receptor; this rationale is extrapolated from approaches to spontaneous HIT. A comparison of the efficacy of anticoagulants was not possible in our series because of the small numbers of patients and nonrandom assignment; however, heparin did not appear to be harmful in patients who received it.\n\n【65】The analysis of our cohort has led us to tailor our therapeutic approach to the various clinical phenotypes. For example, the high mortality among patients with intracranial hemorrhage and a platelet count below 30,000 per cubic millimeter has led us to use plasma exchange in those with these low platelet counts and extensive thrombosis or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 删除2:<u>(Fig. S4)</u>. Survival after plasma exchange was 90%, considerably better than would be predicted given the baseline characteristics.\n\n【66】The constellation of clinical and laboratory features in VITT appears to stem from the production of anti-PF4 antibodies in response to vaccine components, although it remains unclear which components are involved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> We used the HIT ELISA to detect the anti-PF4 antibodies after previously finding that although these assays are positive in most cases of VITT, the rapid non-ELISA tests are often negative. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> However, 6 patients with probable VITT tested negative for anti-PF4 antibodies. Our recommendation is to repeat testing with an alternative ELISA method, 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> but it is unclear whether these patients have antibodies to an epitope that is not recognized by the currently available assays. A study involving Norwegian health care workers detected anti-PF4 antibodies in 6 of 492 patients (1.2%) after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; all had normal platelet counts, but studies are lacking to determine whether this is a risk factor for VITT. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【67】A potential weakness of our study is case-ascertainment bias. VITT is a new syndrome, and without a full understanding of the pathophysiology, including why certain vascular beds are more susceptible, and with the real incidence of PF4 antibodies after vaccination in the healthy population unknown, cases may be included that are not true VITT or else they may be missed if they do not meet immediate criteria such as platelet count on admission. Furthermore, since recognition of VITT occurred only in mid-March, when the vaccine rollout reached the younger age groups, it is possible that before this time, older patients with thrombosis, sudden death, or both may have had VITT and may have been missed.\n\n【68】We have defined the clinical and laboratory phenotypes of VITT in a large cohort of patients in the United Kingdom. We did not find any individual risk factors for VITT, but we found increased mortality among patients who presented with severe thrombocytopenia, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, intracranial hemorrhage, laboratory markers of severe coagulation activation, or all these variables. In our cohort, the cases of VITT were associated only with the first ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, and VITT primarily affected patients younger than 60 years of age. Multiple-site thromboses and arterial events were common. Along with anticoagulation, intravenous immune globulin has been the mainstay of therapy; anecdotally, patients with more severe disease may have benefitted from plasma exchange.\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</u>\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on August 11, 2021, and updated on August 12, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>We thank all our clinical, laboratory, and public health colleagues, in particular the many clinical hematologists who have attended our daily meetings, presented cases, and persevered with data collection; Public Health England, especially Dr. Mary Ramsay; the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency; and Thrombosis UK, whose staff provided psychological support and help to patients.</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford (S.P., A.R.), the Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Cardiometabolic Programme–National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals–Biomedical Research Centre (M.S., B.C.), the Thrombosis and Haemophilia Centre, Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London (B.J.H.), and the Department of Statistical Science, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (G.A.), London, the Department of Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham (W.L.), the Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow (C.B.), and the Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield, Sheffield (M.M.) — all in the United Kingdom.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Pavord at the Department of Haematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headley Way, Headington, Oxford OX3 9DU, United Kingdom, or at sue.pavord@ouh.nhs.uk .</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Research Summary | PDF | 145KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supplementary Appendix | PDF | 2382KB |\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 362KB |\n| Data Sharing Statement | PDF | 69KB |</u>\n\n【80】参考删除-1:<u>References _(15)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【81】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

In February 1976, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a cluster of cases of severe influenza-like illness among Army recruits at Fort Dix, New Jersey. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> A swine influenza A strain that resembled the 1918 pandemic influenza strain was identified, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> and a vaccination program was subsequently initiated for the entire U.S. population. After more than 40 million persons were vaccinated, a small excess risk of Guillain–Barré syndrome was noted, with an attributable risk of approximately 1 case per 100,000 doses administered. Given these concerns and because the pandemic did not materialize, the vaccination program was halted in December 1976 so that the issue could be explored further. This experience shed light on the need for real-time vaccine safety surveillance and the importance of context in decision making during a pandemic.\n\n【3】In a study now reported in the _Journal_ by Barda et al., the investigators simultaneously evaluated the risk of adverse events among persons (≥16 years of age) who had received the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) and the risk of the same events after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> The authors used data from the largest integrated payer–provider health care organization in Israel, in conjunction with data on SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction tests and data on coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine administration from the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\n【4】This use of multiple data sets highlights the importance of investment in digital capabilities and meaningful integration across systems in order to provide real-time answers to key public health questions. The design of rigorous postauthorization vaccine safety studies during the Covid-19 pandemic has been a challenge because the pandemic itself has caused changes in health care utilization, the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has occurred in phases because of initial supply limitations, and there have been disparities in access to vaccines. Barda et al. broadly addressed many of these challenges by emulating a trial that matched eligible vaccinees to unvaccinated controls according to sociodemographic characteristics, the number of preexisting chronic health conditions, previous health care utilization, and pregnancy status.\n\n【5】In the vaccination analysis, the study included 42 days of follow-up (i.e., 21 days after the first dose and 21 days after the second dose). This analysis accounted for seasonal and secular trends by matching on the day of vaccination, rather than relying on historical risk estimates that may not have been comparable in the pandemic setting. In the SARS-CoV-2 analysis, a similar approach was used to match persons with a newly diagnosed infection to uninfected persons.\n\n【6】Although the risk estimates in the vaccination and the SARS-CoV-2 analyses were not directly comparable because of differences in the populations (i.e., events were evaluated per 100,000 vaccinated persons and per 100,000 infected persons, respectively), these risks were placed in context. The most salient example is myocarditis, which has received much attention recently given the preponderance of reported cases after vaccination among adolescents and young adults and the incidence of myocarditis observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-6 </a></sup></u> In the population-based cohort in the study conducted by Barda and colleagues, the risk ratios for myocarditis were 3.24 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.55 to 12.44) after vaccination and 18.28 (95% CI, 3.95 to 25.12) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with risk differences of 2.7 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.6) and 11.0 events per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 5.6 to 15.8), respectively. What is even more compelling about these data is the substantial protective effect of vaccines with respect to adverse events such as acute kidney injury, intracranial hemorrhage, and anemia, probably because infection was prevented. Furthermore, the persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be at substantially higher risk for arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia than those who received the BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n【7】National discussions about benefit–risk balance often focus on the benefits of preventing symptomatic disease, hospitalization, or death due to Covid-19 and the risks of serious adverse events after vaccination. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> As specific adverse events such as myocarditis are highlighted, however, the lack of corresponding specificity about benefits can hamper efforts to communicate effectively with patients. Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines may be associated with myocarditis, but they can also prevent cases of myocarditis, acute kidney injury, arrhythmia, and thromboembolic disease. The key to comparing these risks depends on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to an individual person, and that risk can vary according to place and over time. Given the current state of the global pandemic, however, the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be inevitable.\n\n【8】One major limitation of this study is the lack of risk estimates according to age group and sex. For example, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome occurs predominantly in young adult women who have received adenoviral vector vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, whereas myocarditis predominantly occurs in male teens and young men who have received mRNA vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,9,10 </a></sup></u> Age- and sex-stratified comparisons that reflect local epidemiologic factors might support public understanding of different approaches to vaccine use in different countries, such as Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Other limitations of the study include the paucity of data regarding younger teens and children, the conservative assumption that vaccines have no effect on transmission, and the absence of medical record review to validate computable phenotypes (i.e., algorithms used to identify a cohort on the basis of patient records).\n\n【9】As new knowledge of the safety and benefits of vaccines continues to evolve, studies like this one may help to support decision making about the use of Covid-19 vaccines. The benefit–risk balance should be reassessed, refined, and communicated as the disease burden changes, new variants and safety signals emerge, and vaccine effectiveness begins to wane. Context matters, which means that we as a country need to be ready for continual learning and change.\n\n【10】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-1:<u>This editorial was published on August 25, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【13】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【14】参考删除-1:<u>From Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 70KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>References _(10)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

However, data from randomized trials are limited.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned very preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants to daily milk increments of 30 ml per kilogram of body weight (faster increment) or 18 ml per kilogram (slower increment) until reaching full feeding volumes. The primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included components of the primary outcome, confirmed or suspected late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and cerebral palsy.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among 2804 infants who underwent randomization, the primary outcome could be assessed in 1224 (87.4%) assigned to the faster increment and 1246 (88.7%) assigned to the slower increment. Survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months occurred in 802 of 1224 infants (65.5%) assigned to the faster increment and 848 of 1246 (68.1%) assigned to the slower increment (adjusted risk ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.92 to 1.01; P=0.16). Late-onset sepsis occurred in 414 of 1389 infants (29.8%) in the faster-increment group and 434 of 1397 (31.1%) in the slower-increment group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.07). Necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 70 of 1394 infants (5.0%) in the faster-increment group and 78 of 1399 (5.6%) in the slower-increment group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】There was no significant difference in survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months in very preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants with a strategy of advancing milk feeding volumes in daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research; SIFT Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN76463425 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 VISUAL ABSTRACT  \nMilk-Feeding Rates in Preterm Infants\n\n【12】Infants who are very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation) or who have a very low birth weight (<1500 g) are fed increasing volumes of milk per day until they reach full enteral feeding volumes. The approach to increasing the feeding volume per day is uncertain because of competing concerns. Observational studies have shown a higher risk of necrotizing enterocolitis 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> with rapid advancement of feeding volumes but are subject to bias; one was an uncontrolled study before and after the introduction of a slowly progressive tube-feeding schedule, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and two were small case–control studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Slower advances in feeding volume might, however, increase the risk of late-onset sepsis from longer exposure to parenteral feeding, as shown in a meta-analysis that also revealed no increase in necrotizing enterocolitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> These conditions are both major causes of death and illness, including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Existing trial data are insufficient to determine whether advancing enteral feeding volumes slowly (typically by <24 ml per kilogram of body weight per day) as compared with more quickly (by 30 to 40 ml per kilogram per day) affects outcomes of very preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,9-16 </a></sup></u> The Speed of Increasing Milk Feeds Trial (SIFT) therefore compared faster (30 ml per kilogram) with slower (18 ml per kilogram) daily increments in milk feeding volumes.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design and Procedures\n---------------------------\n\n【16】The trial was a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial that followed a published protocol 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> <sup><a>17 </a></sup> also available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial was approved by the East Midlands National Research Ethics Committee and the National Maternity Hospital Ethics Committee in Dublin and overseen by independent steering and data and safety monitoring committees.\n\n【17】Trial Participants\n------------------\n\n【18】After written informed consent was obtained from parents, infants receiving less than 30 ml of milk per kilogram per day at randomization were eligible to participate if they were born before 32 weeks of gestation, had a birth weight of less than 1500 g, or both. Infants who had a known severe congenital anomaly or no realistic chance of survival or who were unlikely to be traceable for follow-up were ineligible.\n\n【19】Enrollment and Treatment\n------------------------\n\n【20】Table 1.  Table 1. Infant and Maternal Characteristics at Trial Entry.\n\n【21】When clinicians were ready to start advancing feeding volumes, infants were randomly assigned to receive daily increments in feeding volume of 30 ml per kilogram (faster increment) or 18 ml per kilogram (slower increment). Computerized randomization was performed through a secure website hosted by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit, University of Oxford. A minimization algorithm balanced prognostic factors: hospital, multiple birth, gestational age range 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>, and whether the birth weight was below the 10th percentile for gestational age. Infants from multiple births were assigned to the same treatment. All other aspects of feeding and care followed routine clinical practice in the individual units, including the capacity to stop or alter the rate of increase in feeding volume if clinically indicated. Data were collected at trial entry, including whether the infant had absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical arterial blood flow identified on any antenatal ultrasonographic scan.\n\n【22】Primary and Secondary Outcomes\n------------------------------\n\n【23】The primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months of age, corrected for gestational age at birth. Moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability was defined as any of the following: moderate or severe visual impairment (reduced vision uncorrected with aids, blindness in one eye with good vision in the contralateral eye, or blindness or light perception only), moderate or severe hearing impairment (hearing loss corrected with aids, some hearing loss uncorrected by aids, or deafness), moderate or severe gross motor impairment (inability to walk or sit independently), or moderate or severe cognitive impairment as assessed with the use of the Parent Report of Children’s Abilities–Revised (PARCA-R) or clinical data if PARCA-R scores were missing. Total PARCA-R scores of less than 44 (range, 0 to 158, with lower scores indicating greater impairment) were used to identify children with moderate or severe developmental impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】Secondary outcomes included death, death before discharge home, microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset sepsis from trial entry to discharge home, Bell’s stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis (stages range from 1 to 3, with higher stages indicating greater severity of disease) from trial entry to discharge home, time taken to reach full milk feeding volumes (150 ml per kilogram per day for 3 consecutive days), growth (change in weight and head circumference z score for gestational age) from birth to discharge home, duration of parenteral feeding, duration of time in intensive care, duration of hospital stay to discharge home, diagnosis of cerebral palsy by a doctor or other health professional, moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months (corrected for gestational age), and the individual components of the definition of moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability.\n\n【25】Classifications of moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis were confirmed by an end-point review committee whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments; the committee used standard definitions if outcomes were ambiguous or data were missing 删除7:<u>(see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org)</u>. All data-collection forms were assessed independently by pairs of clinicians who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Owing to rounding of the feeding rate to the nearest 0.5 ml per kilogram or small changes in daily weight in the clinical setting, some infants receiving “full enteral feeding volumes” received only 145 to 149 ml per kilogram per day. We therefore considered an infant to be receiving full enteral feeding volumes if at least 145 ml per kilogram per day was administered for 3 consecutive days. Cases that did not meet these criteria were reviewed by the end-point review committee to determine whether a sustained level of feeding below this had been achieved. Examples of this included feeds being stopped during transfer or a procedure and use of higher-calorie formula.\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】We estimated that 80% of infants would survive to 2 years and that 11% of survivors would have moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> We anticipated that the primary outcome would occur in 71% of the comparator (slower-increment) group. With a total sample size of 2500 and allowance for a questionnaire response rate of 80%, there would be 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the incidence of the primary outcome between the trial groups with a two-sided significance level of 5%. Similarly, enrollment of 2500 infants would provide the trial with 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 5.4 percentage points (from 25.0% in the comparator group) in the incidence of late-onset sepsis 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> and an absolute difference of 3.5 percentage points (from 6.0% in the comparator group) in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell’s stage 2 or 3). 删除3:<u><sup><a>21-23</a></sup></u>\n\n【28】Subsequently, an inflation factor of 1.12 was applied to the sample size to allow for multiple births, since infants from a multiple birth received the same treatment and we anticipated correlated outcomes. This adjustment assumed the percentage of multiple births to be 25% and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.9 for the primary outcome at 24 months, corrected for gestational age. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> The total target sample size was therefore increased to 2800.\n\n【29】Demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were summarized with counts and percentages for categorical variables, means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, and medians and interquartile or simple ranges for other continuous variables. Outcomes were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis with the use of the slower-increment group as the comparator.\n\n【30】Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary outcome at 24 months (corrected for gestational age) and for the discharge outcomes of late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. We used 99% confidence intervals for all other dichotomous outcomes, to take account of the number of hypothesis tests performed, without full adjustment for multiple testing. For normally distributed continuous outcomes, the mean difference and 99% confidence interval are presented; for skewed continuous variables, the median difference and 99% confidence interval are presented. Adjusted risk ratios were estimated with the use of log-binomial regression, or log-Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator if the binomial model failed to converge. Linear regression was used for normally distributed continuous variables, and quantile regression was used for skewed continuous variables. The primary inference was based on the analysis with adjustment for the minimization factors at randomization. Center was fitted as a random effect, and the other minimization factors were fitted as fixed effects. A unique identifier for each mother was nested within center to take account of the additional level of clustering due to multiple births and siblings. This method facilitates the calculation of robust standard errors to allow for the lack of independence in trial-group assignments and the potential correlation in outcome.\n\n【31】The consistency of the effects of advancing milk feeding volumes on the incidence of the primary outcome, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis across specific subgroups was assessed with the use of the statistical test of interaction. Prespecified subgroup analyses included week of gestation at birth, birth weight (<10th percentile for gestational age vs. ≥10th percentile), and type of milk received during the hospital stay (breast milk only vs. formula only vs. both breast milk and formula). Post hoc analysis assessed the effect of the increments on late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants with absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical flow on antenatal Doppler ultrasonography. Other deviations from the protocol include the use of quantile regression instead of Cox regression to analyze the time to full feeding volumes (because the Cox proportional-hazards assumption was not satisfied) and mixed-effect log-binomial or log-Poisson models instead of generalized estimating equations (owing to the ease and flexibility of these methods, which were not in common use when the trial was conceived). We performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of missing data at 24 months on the primary outcome, by considering different scenarios that departed from the assumption that data were missing completely at random.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Participants\n------------\n\n【34】Figure 1. Figure 1. Randomization, Intervention, and Analysis. Table 2.  Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes at 24 Months of Age, Corrected for Gestational Age.\n\n【35】A total of 2804 infants were recruited between June 8, 2013, and June 30, 2015, from 55 hospitals. Infant and maternal characteristics were similar in the two trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Table S3A through S3C in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. All infants received the assigned intervention, but 69 discontinued the intervention, 66 owing to clinician or parental preference and 3 owing to transfer to a nonparticipating hospital 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. For 11 infants, parental consent was withdrawn, and their data were not available for analysis. The remainder were included in modified intention-to-treat analyses. Outcome data at discharge home were not available for 8 infants; their data were included in the analyses, except when knowledge of discharge or the date of discharge was required. A total of 68 infants in the faster-increment group and 77 in the slower-increment group died before 24 months, corrected for gestational age 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Assessment of the primary outcome at 24 months, corrected for gestational age, was possible in 1224 infants (87.4%) in the faster-increment group and 1246 (88.7%) in the slower-increment group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【36】Primary and Secondary Outcomes at 24 Months of Age, Corrected for Prematurity\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】At 24 months (corrected for gestational age), death had occurred in 68 of 1224 infants (5.6%) in the faster-increment group and in 77 of 1246 (6.2%) in the slower-increment group, and moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability had occurred in 354 infants in the faster-increment group and in 321 in the slower-increment group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There was no significant difference between infants receiving a faster daily increment (30 ml per kilogram) and those receiving a slower daily increment (18 ml per kilogram) regarding the primary outcome of survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months, corrected for gestational age 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There were also no significant differences between the faster-increment group and the slower-increment group regarding the individual components of the composite outcome. The results were similar in sensitivity analyses of missing data that used different approaches to impute missing data 删除2:<u>(Table S5B)</u>.\n\n【38】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【39】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcomes at Discharge to Home.\n\n【40】The faster-increment group reached full milk feeding volumes at a median of 7 days, as compared with 10 days in the slower-increment group (adjusted median difference, −2.7 days; 99% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −3.1 to −2.4); the duration of parenteral nutrition from trial entry to discharge home was 9 days and 11 days, respectively (adjusted median difference, −2.2 days; 99% CI, −2.7 to −1.6) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. There was no evidence of significant between-group differences regarding confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset sepsis, Bell’s stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis, death during hospitalization, weight and head circumference standard-deviation scores at discharge, duration of time in intensive care, and duration of hospital stay from trial entry 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【41】After adjustment for minimization factors, moderate or severe motor impairment occurred in 7.5% of the infants in the faster-increment group and 5.0% of those in the slower-increment group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.48; 99% CI, 1.02 to 2.14) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There was no evidence of significant between-group differences for the other three components of the disability definition.\n\n【42】Subgroup Analyses\n-----------------\n\n【43】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses for the Primary Outcome.\n\n【44】The primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months of age, corrected for gestational age. P values for interaction were adjusted for minimization factors — collaborating hospital, single or multiple birth, gestational age at birth, and whether the birth weight was below the 10th percentile for gestational age — when technically possible. P values and confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects.\n\n【45】There was weak evidence of statistical interaction between the type of milk (breast milk only, formula only, or both breast milk and formula) and feeding increment with respect to survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months, corrected for gestational age (P=0.045). For infants fed with formula only, survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability was seen in 12 of 30 infants (40%) in the faster-increment group, as compared with 28 of 40 (70%) in the slower-increment group 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 and Table S5C)</u>. There was no evidence of differential treatment effects for any other prespecified subgroup from trial entry until discharge or at 24 months, corrected for gestational age 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 and Figs. S2 and S3)</u>. Post hoc analysis did not show an interaction between antenatal absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical flow and faster or slower feeding increments 删除2:<u>(Tables S1 and S2)</u>.\n\n【46】Serious Adverse Events\n----------------------\n\n【47】Four serious adverse events that were not prespecified as outcomes were reported. One infant in each group had an intracardiac thrombus, with one of these extending into the superior vena cava and causing renal failure and death (faster-increment group). One infant (in the faster-increment group) had conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which resolved, and one infant (in the slower-increment group) became dehydrated briefly with extravasation from a central venous catheter.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】In this large, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial involving infants with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks or a birth weight of less than 1500 g, advancing milk feeding volumes at daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram did not affect survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months, corrected for gestational age. The speed of increment in feeding volumes also did not affect the risks of late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, or death during hospitalization.\n\n【50】Secondary-outcome analysis suggested that the number of days to reach full milk feeding volumes and the number of days of parenteral nutrition were lower with faster increments than with slower increments. Although these feeding outcomes seem to favor faster increments, the risk of moderate or severe motor impairment was unexpectedly higher in the faster-increment group than in the slower-increment group. This observation is unexplained, and there were not more cases of late-onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis in the faster-increment group. It is possible that it is a chance finding, since it was one of multiple secondary outcomes assessed, but biologically plausible explanations include increased cardiorespiratory events from pressure on the diaphragm or inability to absorb enteral nutrition.\n\n【51】The trial was pragmatic, and, apart from daily increments in milk volume, clinician preference and unit guidelines determined other care. The primary outcome could be assessed in 87.4% of the infants in the faster-increment group and in 88.7% of those in the slower-increment group at 24 months, corrected for gestational age. Similar results were obtained from sensitivity analyses with imputation of missing data.\n\n【52】As compared with previous trials, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-16 </a></sup></u> the present trial included larger numbers of high-risk infants, including 1020 extremely low-birth-weight infants (<1000 g), 994 extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks of gestation), and 435 infants with absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical flow on antenatal Doppler studies. Subgroup analyses of higher-risk infants were reassuring, because there was no suggestion of worse outcomes with faster increments than with slower increments. Infants were a median of 4 days old at commencement of the intervention, and therefore the trial does not inform the relative safety of these feeding volume increments in the first few days after birth. Further study would be needed to address enteral feeding in these infants, other speeds of advancing feeding volumes, and different milks. Infants born at extremely early gestational ages or with an extremely low birth weight may react differently than other infants to the speed of increasing feeding volumes. We did not find appreciable differences in outcome according to these variables, but our trial included relatively small numbers of infants in these categories, and further research may be warranted in these groups.\n\n【53】Observational data have suggested a reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among very preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants fed breast milk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> Most participating infants in SIFT were fed, at least partially, with breast milk. Only 2.8% of the infants who were followed to 24 months were fed formula alone, with similar numbers in the two groups. With respect to these formula-only infants, the finding of a poorer outcome in the faster-increment group than in the slower-increment group probably represents a chance finding, given the small numbers of infants, substantial loss to follow-up, and multiple comparisons performed without adjustment for multiple testing. The risk–benefit balance of enteral-feeding strategies may differ between human milk–fed infants and formula-fed infants.\n\n【54】The trial was unblinded, because it was considered impractical for caregivers and parents to be unaware of the trial-group assignments. This is unlikely to have influenced the ascertainment of the most important outcomes, which were reviewed by end-point review committees whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Although it is possible that knowledge of the trial-group assignments could alter clinician practice (e.g., preferentially stopping feeds given at faster rather than slower increments in cases of suspected necrotizing enterocolitis), this is unlikely to have substantively affected the results.\n\n【55】In conclusion, the speed of advancing enteral feeding volumes — daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram — did not have a significant effect on the primary outcome of survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability, nor did it affect the risks of late-onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis in very preterm or very-low-birth-weight infants.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>This article presents independent research commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).
