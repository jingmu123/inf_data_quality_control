The prevention intervention included home-based HIV testing delivered by community workers, who also supported linkage to HIV care and ART adherence. The primary outcome, HIV incidence between months 12 and 36, was measured in a population cohort of approximately 2000 randomly sampled adults (18 to 44 years of age) per community. Viral suppression (<400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter) was assessed in all HIV-positive participants at 24 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The population cohort included 48,301 participants. Baseline HIV prevalence was 21% or 22% in each group. Between months 12 and 36, a total of 553 new HIV infections were observed during 39,702 person-years (1.4 per 100 person-years; women, 1.7; men, 0.8). The adjusted rate ratio for group A as compared with group C was 0.93 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.74 to 1.18; P=0.51) and for group B as compared with group C was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P=0.006). The percentage of HIV-positive participants with viral suppression at 24 months was 71.9% in group A, 67.5% in group B, and 60.2% in group C. The estimated percentage of HIV-positive adults in the community who were receiving ART at 36 months was 81% in group A and 80% in group B.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】A combination prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines resulted in a 30% lower incidence of HIV infection than standard care. The lack of effect with universal ART was unanticipated and not consistent with the data on viral suppression. In this trial setting, universal testing and treatment reduced the population-level incidence of HIV infection.

Four community-randomized trials in sub-Saharan Africa addressed these questions: two (Treatment as Prevention \\[TasP\\] and Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health \\[SEARCH\\]) showed no effect on HIV incidence; a third (Ya Tsie) showed a 30% lower incidence of HIV infection in the intervention group than in the standard-care group, but the difference was not significant. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-18 </a></sup></u> Here we report the primary results of the fourth trial, HPTN 071 (PopART). We also describe the uptake of the combination prevention intervention used in the trial and its effect on viral suppression.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【17】The trial was designed by members of the HPTN 071 (PopART) Study Team with input from the sponsor (the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), other funders, and government and nongovernmental partners in Zambia and South Africa, listed in the acknowledgments at the end of the article. The data were collected by staff of Zambart and the Desmond Tutu Tuberculosis Center in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the HPTN Statistical and Data Management Center. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial design has been described previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and is summarized below.\n\n【18】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【19】The trial was conducted from 2013 through 2018, in 21 urban or periurban communities in Zambia and Western Cape Province, South Africa (total population, approximately 1 million; mean, approximately 50,000 per community). Each community was the catchment population of a government clinic. Communities were grouped in seven triplets matched on the basis of geographic location and estimated HIV prevalence. Communities in each triplet were randomly assigned to three trial groups in simultaneous public ceremonies. Restricted randomization was used to ensure balance across the trial groups with respect to population size, baseline ART coverage (the percentage of HIV-positive persons who were receiving ART), and HIV prevalence. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【20】Randomization and locations of the trial communities are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. Group A communities received a combination prevention intervention (described below) with universal ART. Group B communities received a combination prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines. Group C communities did not receive a combination prevention intervention but received standard care at government clinics, including HIV testing and ART offered according to local guidelines.\n\n【21】Intervention\n------------\n\n【22】The combination prevention intervention (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ) was delivered to group A and B communities. Specially trained community health workers (community HIV-care providers) delivered services at annual household visits (see the Supplementary Appendix ). The community health workers worked in pairs, with each pair responsible for approximately 500 households. Data that were collected by the community health workers were used primarily to support service delivery but also to evaluate intervention coverage.\n\n【23】At each visit, the community health workers offered HIV counseling and rapid testing, and they provided support for linkage to care and ART adherence for HIV-positive clients. They referred uncircumcised HIV-negative men for voluntary medical male circumcision and referred HIV-positive pregnant women for antenatal care, including prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The community health workers also screened clients for symptoms of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections, with referral for diagnosis and treatment, and promoted and provided condoms.\n\n【24】In all 21 communities, HIV care and ART were provided at local government clinics. In group A, these clinics offered ART irrespective of CD4 cell count throughout the trial, with written consent for patients initiating ART outside local guidelines until universal ART became standard. In groups B and C, the clinics provided ART initially at a CD4 threshold of 350 cells per microliter, which increased to 500 cells per microliter in 2014. Universal ART was offered from April 2016 onward (in Zambia) and October 2016 onward (in South Africa) (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【25】Outcome Evaluation\n------------------\n\n【26】The effect of the intervention on population-level HIV incidence was measured in a population cohort 删除4:<u>(enrolled from December 2013 to March 2015)</u> that included one randomly selected adult 18 to 44 years of age from a random sample of households in each community (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Participants were surveyed at baseline and after 12, 24, and 36 months. Because the original enrollment target (2500 adults per community) was not reached at baseline, additional participants were enrolled at 12 months and in groups A and C only at 24 months, excluding households sampled previously.\n\n【27】At each visit, participants were interviewed by a field research assistant (separate from the community health workers) using a structured questionnaire that included the collection of demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral data as well as data related to HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. After the interview, blood was collected by a research nurse, who also offered HIV rapid testing to all participants.\n\n【28】The predefined primary outcome was HIV incidence between 12 and 36 months, comparing group A with group C and comparing group B with group C. This approach provided 1 year to fully establish the trial intervention before measurement of trial outcomes. Because the group A and group B interventions were equivalent during most of the primary analysis period, we also report a post hoc analysis of groups A and B combined as compared with group C. Other outcomes that are reported here include viral suppression (<400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter) and the estimated coverage of HIV testing and ART on the basis of data from groups A and B that were collected by the community health workers.\n\n【29】Laboratory Methods\n------------------\n\n【30】Laboratory-based HIV testing was performed for all participants at all visits. Central laboratories in South Africa and Zambia performed a single fourth-generation HIV test. The HPTN Laboratory Center (Baltimore) performed additional testing to determine HIV status (see the Supplementary Appendix ). If seroconversion was confirmed, testing was performed to determine whether the participant had acute infection at the previous visit. HIV viral-load testing was performed at the HPTN Laboratory Center for selected samples: all HIV-positive participants at 24 months and a random subgroup of approximately 75 HIV-positive participants per community at 0, 12, and 36 months. HIV viral-load testing was performed with the RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular), with a level of less than 400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter as the threshold of quantification.\n\n【31】Ethical Considerations\n----------------------\n\n【32】All participants in the population cohort provided written informed consent before enrollment. Community members who were visited by the community health workers provided verbal consent for participation in the intervention and data collection. In group A, clinic patients provided written informed consent when ART was initiated outside of prevailing local guidelines 删除4:<u>(from 2013 to 2016)</u>. Ethical approval for the trial was granted by ethics committees at the LSHTM, University of Zambia, and Stellenbosch University.\n\n【33】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【34】Sample-size calculations were informed by initial projections of intervention effect based on mathematical modeling, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> which suggested that HIV incidence might be lower by up to 60% in group A and up to 25% in group B than in group C. Under the assumption of an HIV incidence in group C of 1.0 to 1.5 per 100 person-years, a between-community coefficient of variation within matched triplets of 0.15 to 0.20, a total of 2500 participants per community with 85% HIV-negative status at baseline, and 25% loss to follow-up over a period of 3 years, the power of the trial would exceed 75% or 85% for effects of 35% or 40%, respectively.\n\n【35】Analysis methods are described in detail in the statistical analysis plan (available with the protocol ), which was completed before data unblinding, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and in the Supplementary Appendix . In brief, HIV incidence was measured among participants who were HIV-negative at enrollment; HIV infection was assumed to occur at the midpoint between the last HIV-negative sample and the first HIV-positive sample, or at a visit in which acute infection was identified. When the time of infection was unclear because of missed visits, it was estimated by means of imputation (see the Supplementary Appendix , including Table S2). For the primary outcome, statistical inference used a two-stage approach recommended for cluster-randomized trials with fewer than 15 clusters per group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> In groups A and B, data that were collected by the community health workers were used to estimate the percentage of HIV-positive community members who knew their HIV status and were receiving ART, according to methods and assumptions described in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Enrollment and Follow-up\n------------------------\n\n【38】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of the Population Cohort.\n\n【39】The trial included 21 communities that were matched in seven sets of 3 communities each; the 3 communities in each triplet were randomly assigned to group A (combination prevention intervention with universal antiretroviral therapy \\[ART\\]), group B (combination prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines), or group C (standard care). The purpose of the population cohort was to enroll and follow a representative sample of residents to assess the effect of the combination prevention intervention on the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and on viral suppression. Participants in the population cohort were enrolled from randomly selected households in the community, with one member 18 to 44 years of age selected at random for eligibility assessment. A total of 38,474 participants were enrolled at the start of the trial. Additional participants were enrolled at 12 months in communities with fewer than 2000 participants at the start of the trial; additional participants were enrolled in groups A and C at 24 months to preserve power for this comparison. (Values for participant enrollment in each triplet are for the entire trial.) The status of participants at each survey year (12, 24, and 36 months) is reported. Participants who missed yearly follow-up visits were eligible to complete subsequent annual surveys, whereas participants who discontinued the trial were not.\n\n【40】The enrollment and follow-up of the population cohort are shown in Figure 1 . A total of 38,474 adults were enrolled at baseline, with 5014 additional enrollments at 12 months and 4813 at 24 months (total enrolled, 48,301).\n\n【41】At 12 months and again at 24 months, 13% of the participants discontinued the trial, most because of confirmed permanent relocation out of the trial community 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>, and their data were censored from further observation; approximately 75% of the remaining participants completed each visit. The final survey at 36 months reached 72% of eligible participants, with similar retention across the trial groups (73%, 73%, and 71% in groups A, B, and C, respectively).\n\n【42】Baseline Comparisons\n--------------------\n\n【43】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Population Cohort at Baseline.\n\n【44】More women (71%) than men (29%) were enrolled, with 40% of the participants younger than 25 years of age 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics were similar across the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Approximately 17% of the men reported having undergone medical circumcision.\n\n【45】The baseline HIV prevalence was 22% (women, 26%; men, 12%), and the baseline herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) prevalence was 46% (women, 54%; men, 24%). The prevalence of both infections was similar across the trial groups (HIV, 21% in group A, 21% in group B, and 22% in group C; HSV-2, 46% in group A, 46% in group B, and 45% in group C). Reported ART coverage was highest in group B (33% in group A, 41% in group B, and 35% in group C), but the percentage of HIV-positive participants who had viral suppression at baseline was similar across the trial groups (56% in group A, 57% in group B, and 54% in group C).\n\n【46】Effect of the Intervention on HIV Incidence\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Table 2. Table 2. Effect of the Combination Prevention Intervention on HIV Incidence and HIV Viral Suppression. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Estimates of HIV Incidence and Log Ratio Residuals for the Seven Triplets (Three Communities Each).\n\n【48】The plots show estimates of HIV incidence (plotted per 100 person-years) (Panel A) and log ratio residuals (ratio of observed to expected HIV infections, with adjustment for age, sex, and baseline HIV prevalence) (Panel B) for group A as compared with group C and for group B as compared with group C. Data are shown for the trial period included in the primary outcome analysis (between months 12 and 36). Colored lines represent each of the seven triplets (numbered 1 to 7). For HIV incidence, the size of the colored dot at the end of each line represents the number of events contributing to the incidence estimate for each community.\n\n【49】Estimated effects of the intervention on HIV incidence are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 . Between 12 and 36 months (primary outcome), 553 incident HIV infections were observed during 39,702 person-years (overall incidence, 1.4 per 100 person-years; women, 1.7 per 100 person-years; men, 0.8 per 100 person-years). The incidence in group C (geometric mean across communities) was 1.6 per 100 person-years 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The incidence in group A was 1.5 per 100 person-years; the adjusted rate ratio as compared with group C was 0.93 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.74 to 1.18; P=0.51). The incidence in group B was 1.1 per 100 person-years; the adjusted rate ratio as compared with group C was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P=0.006). HIV incidence was lower in group B than in group C in all seven matched triplets, whereas the incidence was lower in group A than in group C in four triplets 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. A permutation test based on the restricted randomization scheme showed even stronger evidence of an effect in group B as compared with group C (P=0.001), but not in group A as compared with group C (P=0.48). The findings were similar when the analysis was restricted to participants enrolled at baseline 删除2:<u>(Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】In group B as compared with group C, subgroup analyses according to sex 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> and age and sex 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u> showed a greater effect on HIV incidence in men (adjusted rate ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.12) than in women (adjusted rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97), although this difference in effect could have occurred by chance (P=0.40 for interaction). There was also evidence of a greater effect in older participants (adjusted rate ratio in participants ≥25 years of age, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.76) than in younger participants (adjusted rate ratio in participants 18 to 24 years of age, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.20; P=0.04 for interaction). HIV incidence and estimated effects for individual years of follow-up and for the entire trial period (0 to 36 months) are shown in Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix . HIV incidence decreased in group C by 12% (95% CI, 0 to 23) per year (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix ). HIV incidence was approximately 20% lower in groups A and B combined than in group C (adjusted rate ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99).\n\n【51】Effect of the Intervention on Viral Suppression\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【52】The percentage of HIV-positive participants at 24 months who met our case definition of viral suppression was 71.9% in group A, 67.5% in group B, and 60.2% in group C 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The adjusted prevalence ratio for viral suppression in group A as compared with group C was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.36; P=0.07), and the ratio in group B as compared with group C was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.27; P=0.30). In groups A and B, the prevalence of viral suppression at 24 months was higher among women than among men and higher among participants 25 years of age or older than among those 18 to 24 years of age 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The prevalence of viral suppression in groups A and B increased from approximately 55% at baseline to approximately 75% at 36 months and was 86 to 91% among participants in groups A and B who reported ART use (Tables S9 and S10 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【53】Coverage of the Intervention\n----------------------------\n\n【54】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Estimated ART Coverage at the End of the Trial, According to Age, Sex, and Trial Group.\n\n【55】The plot shows estimated ART coverage among the total population 15 years of age or older in group A and B communities at the end of the trial, according to sex, age group, and trial group. (Estimates are based on data collected by community health workers.) The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 target for ART coverage (81%) is shown in red. The estimated number of HIV-positive men who were resident in the community at the time that community health workers first visited their household during the third (and last) annual round of the intervention, and remained resident in the trial community at the end of the trial, was 8388 in group A and 8948 in group B, and the estimated number of women in this category was 15,936 in group A and 17,586 in group B. The estimated number of HIV-positive men receiving ART was 6286 in group A and 6378 in group B, and the estimated number of HIV-positive women receiving ART was 13,600 in group A and 14,481 in group B.\n\n【56】On the basis of data collected by the community health workers, the estimated percentage of all HIV-positive adults in the community who were receiving ART at the end of the trial was 81% in group A and 80% in group B 删除2:<u>(Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Figure 3 shows estimated ART coverage according to age and sex, with the results indicating similar coverage in groups A and B, lower coverage among men than among women, and lower coverage among younger participants than among older participants. ART coverage was also similar in groups A and B in most triplets (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【57】Discussion\n----------\n\n【58】This trial provides evidence that a combination prevention intervention including universal testing and treatment can reduce HIV incidence at a population level. HIV incidence was lower by 30% in group B than in the standard-care control group; surprisingly, there was no evidence of such an effect in group A.\n\n【59】A universal testing and treatment strategy is hypothesized to reduce HIV transmission by increasing the percentage of HIV-positive community members who know their HIV status, the percentage of those persons who are receiving ART, and the percentage of those receiving ART who have viral suppression. Data from this trial indicate that the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets (with testing and treatment leading to 73% viral suppression) were achieved by the end of the 3-year intervention in both group A and B communities (approximately 75% viral suppression). Higher levels of viral suppression were observed among HIV-positive population-cohort participants in group A and B communities at 24 months than at baseline (approximately 70% vs. approximately 55%).\n\n【60】There are several possible explanations for the lack of an effect on HIV incidence when the combination prevention intervention was added to universal ART (group A). First, written informed consent, required for initiation of ART outside local guidelines from the start of the trial until 2016, may have inadvertently discouraged ART initiation, although this is not supported by data showing similar ART coverage and viral suppression in groups A and B. Second, wide-scale ART delivery in group A may have led to sexual disinhibition or de-emphasis of primary prevention, offsetting the observed increase in viral suppression. Data on participant-reported risk behaviors do not support this hypothesis; further analyses are planned once data on HSV-2 seroconversion (a proxy for sexual risk behavior) become available. Third, although the three trial groups appeared well matched at baseline, there may have been unrecognized differences across communities in sociodemographic or other factors, such as mobility and migration resulting in exposure to HIV-positive partners from other communities. Although these urban communities had high mobility, analysis of available data does not suggest any appreciable differences in migration across the trial groups. Further analyses of qualitative and quantitative data from the trial communities, and data from an ongoing phylogenetic study, may shed light on the unexpected result in group A.\n\n【61】In the absence of alternative explanations and given that the interventions in groups A and B were identical for most of the primary analysis period, it is possible that the difference in observed effects was due to chance. This possibility underlay our decision to carry out a post hoc analysis combining groups A and B, which showed a 20% lower HIV incidence than in group C.\n\n【62】Strengths of the trial included the large sample size, enrollment of a randomly sampled cohort to measure HIV incidence and viral suppression at the community level, delivery of ART through routine services at government clinics, extensive process data used to refine delivery of the intervention, and strong community engagement. Although our trial communities were not chosen to be representative of Zambia or South Africa as a whole, conduct of the trial in large urban communities with high mobility should increase the generalizability of the findings to other urban areas of southern Africa with widespread HIV epidemics.\n\n【63】One limitation is that data on uptake of interventions among HIV-positive participants in the population cohort may be subject to a Hawthorne effect, because participants had regular contact with research staff offering HIV testing and providing referral to care. This Hawthorne effect would probably be greatest in group C, in which participants did not have access to the services provided by the community health workers for testing and referral. Thus, for uptake estimates, we relied mainly on intervention data, which were available only for group A and B communities. In addition, men were underrepresented in the population cohort, and a substantial number of participants moved out of the community during follow-up, so their data were censored from further observation. Thus, we cannot rule out selection bias, although there was no evidence that these factors differed between trial groups.\n\n【64】The results of the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial are consistent with programmatic and survey data 删除3:<u><sup><a>24-27 </a></sup></u> and should be considered alongside those of the other three trials that measured the effect of universal testing and treatment on HIV incidence in Africa, all of which were smaller and undertaken in largely rural communities. The TasP trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> showed no effect on HIV incidence, which may have reflected the similar HIV testing services provided in the intervention and control groups, with low levels of ART coverage in both groups. The SEARCH trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> also showed no effect on HIV incidence, which may have reflected intensive baseline community-based HIV testing in both the intervention and control groups. The Ya Tsie trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> showed a 30% lower incidence in the intervention group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant.\n\n【65】Our finding of a 20 to 30% reduction in HIV incidence at a population level was measured against a background of decreasing incidence in communities providing standard care, possibly attributable to gradually increasing coverage of ART in the general population. This indicates that combination prevention including universal testing and treatment can make a substantial contribution to HIV epidemic control. It is notable that the effects seen in our trial, the Ya Tsie trial, and others 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> were achieved by delivering intensive household-based HIV-testing services; this may have played a more important role than changes in ART guidelines. The universal “test” component of a “test and treat” strategy is vital, as is continued attention to primary HIV prevention interventions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29,30 </a></sup></u> Results from planned cost-effectiveness and modeling studies will provide information on the cost-effectiveness (value for money) and longer-term effect of such strategies, which will help to inform policy and practice. Data on ART coverage from the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial, like data from other studies, draw special attention to the challenges in achieving ART coverage targets in young people, men, and communities with high mobility. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31-33 </a></sup></u> If HIV transmission is concentrated in these subgroups, the effect of universal testing and treatment on HIV transmission may be compromised. Special efforts will be needed to address these coverage gaps to realize the full potential of universal testing and treatment for HIV epidemic control.\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under Cooperative Agreements UM1-AI068619, UM1-AI068617, and UM1-AI068613, with funding from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ; the NIAID, the National Institute on Drug Abuse , and the National Institute of Mental Health , all part of the National Institutes of Health; funding (MR/R010161/1, to Dr. Hayes, Ms. Floyd, and Drs.

The benefit of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke and other embolic complications of atrial fibrillation has been clearly established; whether any antiarrhythmic therapy has a comparable effect is not known. The supposition that restoring sinus rhythm by cardioversion reduces the risk of stroke is logical but untested. Moreover, several trials of quinidine therapy to maintain sinus rhythm after successful cardioversion have shown that atrial fibrillation was present one year later in 50 percent of quinidine-treated patients and 75 percent of placebo-treated patients <sup><a>* </a></sup> ; thus, if warfarin is discontinued after cardioversion, it will need to be restarted in more than half the patients within one year. Elective discontinuation of warfarin therapy a few weeks after successful cardioversion is most appropriate for patients whose risk of stroke would be low even if they remained in atrial fibrillation, such as young patients with no other clinical heart disease and no risk factors for stroke.

On November 26, 2021, the World Health Organization designated omicron as a variant of concern. The omicron variant was found to have at least 33 mutations (29 amino acid substitutions, 1 insertion of three amino acids, and 3 small deletions) in its spike (S) protein, as compared with early SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in Wuhan, China. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Notably, 15 of the 29 substitutions were in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, which is the primary target for monoclonal antibody–based therapy. This finding suggests that the monoclonal antibodies that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be less effective against the omicron variant.\n\n【3】Accordingly, we examined the neutralizing ability of FDA-approved and investigational therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (individually and in combination) against omicron and other variants of concern. Using a live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT), we assessed the neutralizing activities of monoclonal antibodies against hCoV-19/Japan/NC928-2N/2021 (omicron; NC928), which was isolated from a traveler who arrived in Japan from Namibia; SARS-CoV-2/UT-NC002-1T/Human/2020/Tokyo (NC002), an early SARS-CoV-2 strain from February 2020; SARS-CoV-2/UT-HP127-1Nf/Human/2021/Tokyo (alpha; HP127); hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP01542/2021 (beta; HP01542); hCoV-19/Japan/TY7-503/2021 (gamma; TY7-503); and hCoV-19/USA/WI-UW-5250/2021 (delta; UW5250). Whole-genome sequencing analysis of the NC928 omicron virus stock revealed that the variant had the 15 substitutions that are characteristic of omicron in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, as compared with the Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 reference strain 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org)</u>.\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Efficacy of Monoclonal Antibodies and Antiviral Drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Variants In Vitro.\n\n【5】We validated the reactivity of all seven monoclonal antibodies by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coated with recombinant S protein derived from the early Wuhan reference strain, as well as from representative alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants. The results were consistent with published data 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. These monoclonal antibodies neutralized the early strain (NC002) and the alpha (HP127) and delta (UW5250) variants with a low FRNT <sub>50 </sub> value (1.34 to 150.38 ng per milliliter), except for LY-CoV555 (marketed as bamlanivimab), which showed markedly higher FRNT <sub>50 </sub> values against the delta variant than against the early strain and the alpha variant 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. This result was consistent with a previous study that showed an almost complete loss of activity for bamlanivimab against the delta variant, whereas LY-CoV016 (marketed as etesevimab), REGN10987 (marketed as imdevimab), and REGN10933 (marketed as casirivimab) inhibited this variant. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Etesevimab did not neutralize the omicron (NC928), beta (HP01542), or gamma (TY7-503) variants even at the highest FRNT <sub>50 </sub> value (>50,000 ng per milliliter) that was tested. Bamlanivimab showed reduced neutralizing activity against the beta and gamma variants and did not neutralize omicron. Imdevimab had high neutralizing activity against the beta and gamma variants but lost activity against omicron. Casirivimab neutralized beta, gamma, and omicron with a high FRNT <sub>50 </sub> value (187.69 to 14,110.70 ng per milliliter); however, the FRNT <sub>50 </sub> value for omicron was higher by a factor of 18.6 than that for beta and higher by a factor of 75.2 than that for gamma. COV2-2196 (marketed as tixagevimab), COV2-2130 (marketed as cilgavimab), and S309 (precursor of drug marketed as sotrovimab) also retained neutralizing activity against beta, gamma, and omicron; however, the FRNT <sub>50 </sub> values of these monoclonal antibodies were higher by a factor of 3.7 to 198.2 for omicron than for beta or gamma.\n\n【6】All the combinations of monoclonal antibodies that were tested (i.e., etesevimab plus bamlanivimab, imdevimab plus casirivimab, and tixagevimab plus cilgavimab) neutralized the early strain and the alpha and delta variants. The combination of etesevimab plus bamlanivimab showed remarkably reduced neutralizing activity against gamma and lost neutralizing activity against omicron and beta. The imdevimab–casirivimab combination retained activity against beta and gamma but lost inhibitory capability against omicron. The tixagevimab–cilgavimab combination inhibited beta, gamma, and omicron; however, the FRNT <sub>50 </sub> values of this combination were higher by a factor of 24.8 to 142.9 for omicron than for beta or gamma, respectively.\n\n【7】The omicron variant has mutations in both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which are targets for antiviral drugs such as RdRp inhibitors (remdesivir and molnupiravir) and the main protease inhibitor PF-07304814, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> which arouses concern regarding the decreased effectiveness of these drugs against omicron. Thus, we tested three different antiviral compounds (i.e., remdesivir, molnupiravir, and PF-07304814) for their efficacy against omicron. The in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC <sub>50 </sub> ) values of each compound were determined against NC928, NC002, HP127, HP01542, TY7-503, and UW5250. The susceptibilities of omicron to the three compounds were similar to those of the early strain (i.e., IC <sub>50 </sub> values for remdesivir, molnupiravir, and PF-07304814 that differed by factors of 1.2, 0.8, and 0.7, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. These results suggest that all three of these compounds may show efficacy for treating patients infected with the omicron variant.\n\n【8】The potential limitations of our study include the lack of clinical data on the efficacy of these monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients infected with omicron. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these antiviral therapies are indeed effective against infection with the omicron variant. Collectively, our findings show that therapeutic options may be available to combat the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2; however, some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may not be effective against this variant.\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Emi Takashita, Ph.D.  \nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Noriko Kinoshita, M.D.  \nNational Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Seiya Yamayoshi, D.V.M., Ph.D.  \nYuko Sakai-Tagawa, Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>Seiichiro Fujisaki, Ph.D.  \nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【13】参考删除-2:<u>Mutsumi Ito, D.V.M.  \nKiyoko Iwatsuki-Horimoto, D.V.M., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【14】参考删除-2:<u>Shiho Chiba, Ph.D.  \nPeter Halfmann, Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, WI</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-2:<u>Hiroyuki Nagai, M.D.  \nMakoto Saito, M.D., D.Phil.  \nEisuke Adachi, M.D., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-2:<u>David Sullivan, M.D.  \nAndrew Pekosz, Ph.D.  \nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-2:<u>Shinji Watanabe, D.V.M., Ph.D.  \nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-2:<u>Kenji Maeda, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNational Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-2:<u>Masaki Imai, D.V.M., Ph.D.  \nHiroshi Yotsuyanagi, M.D., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-2:<u>Hiroaki Mitsuya, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNorio Ohmagari, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNational Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-2:<u>Makoto Takeda, M.D., Ph.D.  \nHideki Hasegawa, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNational Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-2:<u>Yoshihiro Kawaoka, D.V.M., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan  \nyoshihiro.kawaoka@wisc.edu</u>\n\n【23】参考删除-2:<u>Supported by grants from the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis (HHSN272201400008C, to Dr. Kawaoka) and from the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis and Transmission (75N93021C00014, to Dr. Kawaoka), funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , and by a Research Program on Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases (JP20fk0108412 and JP21fk0108615, to Dr. Kawaoka; JP21fk0108104, to Dr. Watanabe), a Project Promoting Support for Drug Discovery (JP20nk0101632, to Dr. Kawaoka), the Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (JP21wm0125002, to Dr. Kawaoka) from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, a Grant-in-Aid for Emerging and Reemerging Infectious Diseases from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Japan (20HA2007, to Dr. Hasegawa), and by the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense, in collaboration with the Defense Health Agency (contract number W911QY2090012, to Dr. Sullivan).</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-2:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【25】参考删除-2:<u>This letter was published on January 26, 2022, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【26】参考删除-2:<u>Drs.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of tepotinib, a highly selective MET inhibitor, in this patient population.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In this open-label, phase 2 study, we administered tepotinib (at a dose of 500 mg) once daily in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a confirmed _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation. The primary end point was the objective response by independent review among patients who had undergone at least 9 months of follow-up. The response was also analyzed according to whether the presence of a _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation was detected on liquid biopsy or tissue biopsy.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】As of January 1, 2020, a total of 152 patients had received tepotinib, and 99 patients had been followed for at least 9 months. The response rate by independent review was 46% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 36 to 57), with a median duration of response of 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.2 to could not be estimated) in the combined-biopsy group. The response rate was 48% (95% CI, 36 to 61) among 66 patients in the liquid-biopsy group and 50% (95% CI, 37 to 63) among 60 patients in the tissue-biopsy group; 27 patients had positive results according to both methods. The investigator-assessed response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 66) and was similar regardless of the previous therapy received for advanced or metastatic disease. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were considered by investigators to be related to tepotinib therapy were reported in 28% of the patients, including peripheral edema in 7%. Adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of tepotinib in 11% of the patients. A molecular response, as measured in circulating free DNA, was observed in 67% of the patients with matched liquid-biopsy samples at baseline and during treatment.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among patients with advanced NSCLC with a confirmed _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation, the use of tepotinib was associated with a partial response in approximately half the patients. Peripheral edema was the main toxic effect of grade 3 or higher. (Funded by Merck \\[Darmstadt, Germany\\]; VISION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02864992 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The _MET_ proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, and binding to its ligand (hepatocyte growth factor \\[HGF\\]) induces downstream signaling through the RAS–RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Aberrant MET signaling drives tumor growth through increased cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. MET dysregulation through splice-site alterations that cause a loss of transcription of exon 14 in _MET_ can result from point mutations, insertions or deletions, or large-scale whole-exon deletions. These alterations spatially disrupt distinct splicing sites at the acceptor or donor site flanking _MET_ exon 14. As a result of _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations, the MET juxtamembrane domain, which contains a binding site for Y1003 CBL (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), is deleted; this leads to impaired MET ubiquitination, decreased MET turnover, and increased signaling. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Such _MET_ alterations are primary oncogenic drivers that occur in 3 to 4% of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-5 </a></sup></u> and can be detected in liquid-biopsy or tissue-biopsy samples. These tumors typically do not contain other known oncogenic drivers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Unlike patients with other oncogene-driven forms of NSCLC (e.g., ALK, EGFR, and ROS1), patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations are typically 70 years of age or older. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Many tyrosine kinase inhibitors compete with ATP to block the phosphotransferase activity of their targets. Several ATP-competitive, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting MET are being evaluated for the treatment of patients with NSCLC who have _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations. These drugs include nonselective type 1a inhibitors (e.g., crizotinib) and selective type 1b inhibitors (e.g., tepotinib, savolitinib, and capmatinib). 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> Tepotinib is a once-daily, highly selective oral MET inhibitor 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> that has shown promising clinical activity in patients with MET-driven tumors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-14 </a></sup></u> We conducted the multicohort, open-label, phase 2 VISION study to evaluate the efficacy and side-effect profile of tepotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with _MET_ alterations. Here, we report the results in patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Study Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【16】The ongoing VISION study is being conducted at more than 130 sites in 11 countries. Patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations were enrolled in cohort A and those with _MET_ \\-amplified disease (but without _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations) in cohort B; cohort C is currently enrolling patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations for confirmatory analysis of the results in cohort A (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The study aims to assess the antitumor activity and side-effect profile of 500 mg of tepotinib given orally once daily until disease progression, consent withdrawal, or adverse events leading to discontinuation. In this article, we report the results for cohort A, which has completed recruitment. All the patients provided written informed consent for participation in the study.\n\n【17】The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council on Harmonisation, local laws, and applicable regulatory requirements. The study was designed and funded by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and representatives of the sponsor were responsible for the collection and analysis of the data. The first author had full access to the data, and all the authors were involved in the data analysis and manuscript preparation and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the adherence of the study to the protocol , which is available at NEJM.org. Editorial support, including cowriting of the first draft of the manuscript with the first author, was provided by a medical writer employed by Syneos Health with funding from the sponsor.\n\n【18】Patients\n--------\n\n【19】Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations. All the patients had measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, and a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale (which ranges from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability). In addition, all the patients had negative results on local testing for the presence of _EGFR_ mutations or _ALK_ rearrangements. Prospective testing of _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations was performed centrally on circulating free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from plasma (liquid biopsy) with the use of next-generation sequencing panel Guardant360 (which includes 73 genes) or by evaluating RNA obtained from fresh or archival (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tumor-biopsy tissue with the use of the Oncomine Focus Assay (which includes 52 genes); dual testing by the two biopsy methods was not a requirement for enrollment. 删除2:<u>(Details regarding testing are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .)</u> Japanese patients could be enrolled on the basis of the criteria of LC-SCRUM (Lung Cancer Genomic Screening Project for Individualized Medicine). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Patients could have received up to two courses of previous treatment for advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with brain metastases whose condition was neurologically stable and whose glucocorticoid dose was being tapered were eligible to participate, as were patients with untreated asymptomatic brain metastases measuring 1 cm or less in the longest diameter. Additional details regarding the enrollment criteria, including permitted concomitant medications, are provided in the protocol .\n\n【20】Study End Points and Assessments\n--------------------------------\n\n【21】The primary end point was a confirmed objective response (defined as a complete or partial response) as determined according to RECIST, version 1.1, on the basis of an assessment by an independent review committee. Secondary end points were the investigator-assessed objective response, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. To assess patient-reported outcomes, we used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer Modules 13 and 30 (EORTC QLQ-LC13 and EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire consisting of five multiple-item functional subscales, three multiple-item symptom scales, a subscale of global health status and quality of life, and six single-item symptom scales assessing other cancer-related symptoms. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a 13-item lung cancer–specific supplement to the EORTC QLQ-C30. On the two EORTC scales, responses to all items are converted to a scale of 0 to 100 with a standard scoring algorithm. On the functionality scales and scales for global health status and quality of life, higher scores indicate a better level of functioning and quality of life. On the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, scores on the visual-analogue health scale range from 0 to 100 and scores on the descriptive health index range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. Adverse events were assessed with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.\n\n【22】Blood samples for exploratory biomarker cfDNA analyses were obtained at baseline, at weeks 6 and 12, and at the end of treatment and were tested with the use of next-generation sequencing panel Guardant360. We defined a molecular cfDNA response to tepotinib as either a complete response (100% depletion of _MET_ exon 14 alterations in cfDNA, indicating no detection of the _MET_ exon 14 variant) or a deep response (>75% but <100% depletion). 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【24】No statistical comparisons were conducted; data were analyzed in a descriptive manner. According to the protocol, the primary efficacy analysis was conducted when the target enrollment population of at least 60 patients in both the liquid-biopsy and tissue-biopsy subgroups had undergone at least 9 months of follow-up (efficacy population). Three analysis groups were defined to independently assess findings in the liquid-biopsy group, the tissue-biopsy group, and the combined group (either biopsy method). In each primary-analysis group, the trial aimed to show an objective response rate of 40 to 50% and a lower limit of the corresponding two-sided exact Clopper–Pearson 95% confidence interval of at least 20% across all lines of therapy. We used Kaplan–Meier methods to analyze the duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The safety population included all the patients who had enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of tepotinib. Patients could be evaluated for an objective response if they had undergone at least two post-baseline assessments or had discontinued participation for any reason. The data cutoff for the analyses reported here was January 1, 2020.\n\n【25】Results\n-------\n\n【26】Patients\n--------\n\n【27】From September 13, 2016, through January 1, 2020, a total of 6708 patients were prescreened for _MET_ alterations; 169 patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations were subsequently screened for inclusion (Fig. S2). Of these patients, 152 were treated with tepotinib (safety population), and 99 had at least 9 months of follow-up (efficacy population; combined-biopsy group). The liquid-biopsy group included 66 patients, and the tissue-biopsy group included 60 patients; 27 patients had positive results according to both methods.\n\n【28】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline (Efficacy Population).\n\n【29】The median age of the patients in the efficacy population was 74 years; 46% of the patients had a history of smoking, and almost all (97%) had metastatic disease at study entry 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. (Data for the safety population are provided in Table S1.) The characteristics of the patients were similar among the three biopsy groups. Overall, only 3 patients had tumors with sarcomatoid features on histologic analysis, a characteristic that has been associated with the presence of _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Of the 99 patients, 56 had undergone previous treatment (including immunotherapy in 26); their response to previous therapy is shown in Table S2. The median duration of tepotinib treatment was 6.9 months (range, <0.1 to 36.7). The median follow-up in the efficacy population was 17.4 months; the median follow-up in the safety population was 11.8 months (range, 0.3 to 37.1).\n\n【30】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【31】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Response Rate and Change from Baseline in Tumor Burden.\n\n【32】At the top of the graph, the objective response rate among the 99 patients in the efficacy population (combined-biopsy group) is shown, according to whether the _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation was detected by liquid biopsy or tissue biopsy; 27 patients had positive results according to both methods. The waterfall plot shows the change in the sum of the longest diameters of lesions from baseline to the best post-baseline assessment by independent reviewers. Data for 2 patients are not shown, since baseline or on-treatment measurements were not available. Four patients who had a decrease of more than 30% in the sum of target lesions on independent review were classified as having progressive disease as the best response because of the growth of new lesions. These 4 patients all had a partial response to therapy, according to investigator assessment. At the time of data cutoff, treatment was ongoing in 2 of the 4 patients (17.3 months and 11.8 months); another patient discontinued treatment after 16.2 months because of an adverse event, and 1 patient discontinued treatment for other reasons after 5.4 months and no additional imaging was performed. The gold and purple boxes show whether the _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutation was detected by tissue biopsy or liquid biopsy, and the boxes below show the number of previous lines of therapy that each patient received. The best overall response as assessed by investigators is shown at the bottom of the figure.\n\n【33】Among the 99 patients in the efficacy population, the objective response rate was 46% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 36 to 57), according to independent review. All the responses were partial; no patients had a complete response. The response rate was consistent in the two biopsy groups: 48% (95% CI, 36 to 61) in the liquid-biopsy group and 50% (95% CI, 37 to 63) in the tissue-biopsy group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and Table S3)</u>. The response rates were similar regardless of baseline characteristics and the number of lines of previous therapies (Fig. S3).\n\n【34】The response rate according to investigator assessment was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 66) in the efficacy population. The investigators found that 2 patients had a complete response and 53 patients had a partial response; the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 43 to 68) in the liquid-biopsy group and 62% (95% CI, 48 to 74) in the tissue-biopsy group. Tumor shrinkage was observed in most patients: 89% by independent review 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> and 88% as assessed by investigators (Fig. S4A). Responses were rapid, with onset usually within 6 weeks after the initiation of treatment (Fig. S4B and S4C). Results were similar among the 146 patients who were enrolled in the study but may have had less than 9 months of follow-up 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【35】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Progression-free Survival, According to Biopsy Group.\n\n【36】Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression-free survival among patients who underwent liquid biopsy or tissue biopsy; 27 patients underwent both biopsy methods. The duration of progression-free survival was defined as the time from the first administration of tepotinib to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease or death from any cause within 84 days after the last tumor assessment, whichever occurred first. Of the 60 events in the combined group, 36 events were progressive disease and 24 events were death.\n\n【37】The median duration of response by independent review was 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.2 to could not be estimated) in the combined-biopsy group, 9.9 months (95% CI, 7.2 to could not be estimated) in the liquid-biopsy group, and 15.7 months (95% CI, 9.7 to could not be estimated) in the tissue-biopsy group (Fig. S5). The results according to investigator assessment were similar. The median duration of progression-free survival by independent review was 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.7 to 11.0) in the combined-biopsy group, 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 11.0) in the liquid-biopsy group, and 11.0 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 17.1) in the tissue-biopsy group 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>, with similar results according to investigator assessment (Fig. S6). At the time of data cutoff, 27 of 77 patients (35%) who had discontinued tepotinib received subsequent treatment 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>. The median duration of overall survival was 17.1 months (95% CI, 12.0 to 26.8) according to data that were not mature (Fig. S7).\n\n【38】Among the 11 patients with brain metastases (all of which were nontarget tumors \\[i.e., did not qualify to be defined as target lesions according to RECIST\\]), the response rate by independent review was 55% (95% CI, 23 to 83), with a median duration of response of 9.5 months (95% CI, 6.6 to could not be estimated). Among these patients, the median duration of progression-free survival was 10.9 months (95% CI, 8.0 to could not be estimated).\n\n【39】Completion rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and EQ-5D-5L were more than 88% up to week 12. Mean changes from baseline in cough, as part of the EORTC QLQ-LC13 symptom score, exceeded the predefined minimally important difference (10 points), which indicated a reduction in symptoms; symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain showed stability 删除2:<u>(Fig S8A)</u>. Scores for global functioning showed stability in the patients’ reported quality of life over time on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale (Fig. S8B) and the EQ-5D-5L (data not shown).\n\n【40】Safety\n------\n\n【41】Table 2.  Table 2. Adverse Events (Safety Population).\n\n【42】Among the 152 patients in the safety population, adverse events of any cause were reported in 98% during treatment 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. Adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to tepotinib were reported in 89% of the patients. Such events were of grade 3 or higher in 28% of the patients, including grade 3 in 25% and grade 4 in 2% 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The most common of these adverse events of grade 3 or higher was peripheral edema (in 7%). Increased levels of amylase and lipase were common but were mild to moderate in severity; such increases were asymptomatic and not accompanied by symptoms of pancreatitis. For the most common adverse events of any grade, the median time until onset ranged from 3 to 11 weeks after the initiation of tepotinib; for events of grade 3 or higher, the interval was 10 to 27 weeks.\n\n【43】Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to tepotinib were reported in 15% of the patients 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. Treatment-related adverse events led to a dose reduction in 33% of the patients and to permanent discontinuation in 11%; such reductions or discontinuations were related mainly to peripheral edema, pleural effusion, or dyspnea 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>. Peripheral edema was the most common treatment-related adverse event and led to a dose reduction in 16% of the patients and a dose interruption in 18%; permanent discontinuation was uncommon (5%). A total of 21 patients had adverse events leading to death while they were receiving tepotinib; one death of a 79-year-old patient with respiratory failure and dyspnea, secondary to interstitial lung disease, was considered by investigators to be related to tepotinib.\n\n【44】Biomarker Findings in the Liquid-Biopsy Group\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Baseline Molecular Profiles and Response to Treatment in Patients with Biomarker Profiles Assessed in Liquid-Biopsy Samples.\n\n【46】Shown are the results of molecular profiling of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in liquid-biopsy samples obtained from 62 patients at baseline. Sequence variants and copy-number variations were assessed with the use of the Guardant360 assay, version 2.10. In ad hoc exploratory analysis, the objective response rate by independent review was 47% in patients with either wild-type or mutated _TP53_ . There was a trend toward better progression-free survival in patients with wild-type _TP53_ . SNV denotes single-nucleotide variant.\n\n【47】The baseline results of cfDNA molecular profiling of liquid-biopsy samples were available for 62 patients 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. _MET_ exon 14 mutations were diverse; most involved the splice acceptor site (68%), followed by the splice donor site (31%); 1 patient had a whole-exon deletion. Fifty percent of the mutations were indels, and 50% were point mutations. No association was noted between the location or type of the _MET_ exon 14 alteration and outcome. _TP53_ mutations were identified in 48% of the patients. Other concomitant alterations were mutations in _NF1_ and amplifications in _EGFR_ (10% of patients with each mutation). Concomitant _MET_ amplification was detected in 5 patients (8%), 4 of whom had a reduction in tumor size of more than 60%. According to independent review, no response was seen in patients with activating point mutations in _PI3KCA_ (3%), _KRAS_ (2%), and _NRAS_ (2%) or with inactivating mutations in _PTEN_ (3%) at baseline.\n\n【48】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Best Response to Treatment and Molecular Response in Patients with Matched Baseline and On-Treatment Liquid-Biopsy Samples.\n\n【49】Matched baseline and on-treatment biomarker profiles from liquid-biopsy samples were available for 51 patients. Of these patients, 17 had a best molecular clearance of less than 75% of cfDNA. The clinical response as determined by independent review was a partial response in 2 patients, stable disease in 4 patients, and progressive disease in 6 patients; 5 patients could not be evaluated. Four patients had a molecular cfDNA response but were classified as having progressive disease by independent review. Of these patients, 2 had growth in new lesions: 1 had no other baseline alterations, and the other had a co-occurring _NF1_ mutation. The other 2 patients had new lesions at progression: 1 had co-occurring amplifications in _EGFR_ and a _GNAS_ mutation, and the other had a _TP53_ mutation. Shown at the bottom of the figure are the detected _MET_ alterations at baseline and during treatment and the type of alteration that led to the _MET_ exon 14 skipping. Numbers for _MET_ exon 14 skipping represent the mutant allele frequencies, and numbers for _MET_ amplification indicate plasma copy numbers. At the time of data cutoff, biomarker analyses from samples obtained at the time of disease progression were immature, with data available for only a few patients; however, one patient had a _MET_ Y1230H mutation detected at the time of progression.\n\n【50】Matched baseline and on-treatment biomarker profiles from liquid-biopsy samples were available for 51 patients. Of these patients, 34 (67%) had a molecular cfDNA response. Of the 34 patients, 27 patients had a complete molecular cfDNA response and 7 had a deep molecular cfDNA response 删除2:<u>( Figure 4 )</u>. Among the patients with a molecular cfDNA response, 24 (71%) had a radiographic response according to independent review. Six patients had stable disease, resulting in a disease control rate of 88% (30 of 34 patients). Four patients who had a decrease in the cfDNA level did not have a corresponding clinical response. In 10 patients, an increase from baseline in the frequency of the variant causing _MET_ exon 14 skipping was observed; 1 of these patients (10%) had a response.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】In the VISION trial, we found that tepotinib had durable antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations, as detected on next-generation sequencing in samples obtained by either tissue or liquid biopsy. The response rate was 46 to 50% by independent review and 56 to 62% by investigator assessment. The onset of response was mostly within 6 weeks after the initiation of therapy, with a median duration of response as long as 15.7 months in one biopsy group. Outcomes were similar in the two biopsy categories.\n\n【53】These results compare favorably with results from other studies of investigational MET inhibitors involving patients with NSCLC who had _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations. In the PROFILE 1001 trial of crizotinib involving 65 patients, the response rate as assessed by investigators was 32% (95% CI, 21 to 45), with a median duration of progression-free survival of 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.1). 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the GEOMETRY mono-1 phase 2 trial of capmatinib, the response rate by independent review was 41% (95% CI, 29 to 53), with a median duration of progression-free survival of 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 7.0) among 69 patients with pretreated disease; among 28 patients who had not received previous treatment, the response rate was 68% (95% CI, 48 to 84), with a median duration of progression-free survival of 9.7 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.9) and activity seen in patients with brain metastases. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Confirmatory phase 2 data for capmatinib in the first-line setting are pending.\n\n【54】Outcomes with currently available therapies are typically poor in patients with NSCLC with _MET_ mutations associated with exon 14 skipping, who are generally older (median age, 74 years) than patients who have more common and treatable molecular alterations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19-21 </a></sup></u> In patients lacking driver mutations, first-line immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy has emerged as a new standard of care. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22-25 </a></sup></u> The relative paucity of data from elderly patients in these studies warrants judicious use of these regimens in this population. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> With regard to the interaction between _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations and the efficacy of immunotherapy, retrospective data suggest that the clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibition is attenuated in this molecular subgroup (response rate, 16 to 17%), regardless of the expression of programmed death ligand 1. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】In our trial, the patients’ quality of life was maintained during receipt of tepotinib; symptoms of dyspnea were stable, whereas cough symptoms were reduced. The adverse-event profile reported here was similar to those in previous studies of tepotinib, with a low frequency of treatment discontinuation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Peripheral edema, the most commonly reported adverse event, has also been observed with other agents targeting the MET or HGF pathway and may be managed with limb elevation, compression stockings, reduction of dietary salt intake, and possibly the use of diuretics. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29,30 </a></sup></u> Proactive monitoring for peripheral edema is recommended and can be managed with temporary discontinuation of tepotinib or dose reduction.\n\n【56】The convenience of using liquid biopsy as a diagnostic tool also allowed us to obtain longitudinal on-treatment biomarker data, which showed a high concordance between the molecular cfDNA response and clinical response on the basis of RECIST tumor measurement. The clinical progression of cancers in 4 patients who had decreased levels of cfDNA during treatment is unexplained. Although the use of the molecular cfDNA response is not yet part of standard practice in the management of solid tumors, as it is in some hematologic cancers, correlations between changes in the cfDNA level and tumor response have been reported in several cancer types, including lung cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Baseline cfDNA analysis provided valuable insight into the mutational profiles of patients with _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations. In agreement with the results of previous studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3,31 </a></sup></u> we found that the patients in our study had very few co-occurring oncogenic drivers. Our data suggest that potential mechanisms of primary resistance to tepotinib may involve the RAS–RAF and PI3K–AKT pathways, which have previously been associated with resistance to MET inhibitors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,31-33 </a></sup></u> As for acquired resistance mechanisms to tepotinib, a thorough examination of this question will need to wait until additional disease progression events occur and associated biomarker data become available. Acquired resistance mechanisms that have been reported with other MET inhibitors include amplification and mutations in KRAS and other RAS–MAPK pathway components. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31,34,35 </a></sup></u> Secondary _MET_ mutations (e.g., Y1230X), as reported here in one patient, have also been identified as acquired resistance mechanisms in both in vitro models 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> and clinical case reports. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37-40</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】In conclusion, the VISION study showed that the selective MET inhibitor tepotinib had durable clinical activity in patients with NSCLC with _MET_ mutations associated with exon 14 skipping. Results from this study have led to regulatory approval of tepotinib and its companion diagnostic assay for the detection of _MET_ alterations (ArcherMET CDx) in March 2020 in Japan. These findings validate _MET_ exon 14 skipping mutations as bona fide therapeutic targets and underscore the importance of routine testing for these _MET_ alterations by means of liquid or tissue biopsy.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Paik reports receiving advisory board fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Celgene, EMD Serono, Calithera, AstraZeneca, AbbVie, and Lilly Oncology and fees for serving on a data and safety monitoring committee from Takeda;

The appropriate dose of linezolid and duration of treatment with this agent to minimize toxic effects while maintaining efficacy against highly drug-resistant tuberculosis are unclear.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】We enrolled participants with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (i.e., resistant to rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and an aminoglycoside), pre-XDR tuberculosis (i.e., resistant to rifampin and to either a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside), or rifampin-resistant tuberculosis that was not responsive to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects. We randomly assigned the participants to receive bedaquiline for 26 weeks (200 mg daily for 8 weeks, then 100 mg daily for 18 weeks), pretomanid (200 mg daily for 26 weeks), and daily linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks or 600 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks. The primary end point in the modified intention-to-treat population was the incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure or disease relapse (clinical or bacteriologic) at 26 weeks after completion of treatment. Safety was also evaluated.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 181 participants were enrolled, 88% of whom had XDR or pre-XDR tuberculosis. Among participants who received bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks or 600 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks, 93%, 89%, 91%, and 84%, respectively, had a favorable outcome; peripheral neuropathy occurred in 38%, 24%, 24%, and 13%, respectively; myelosuppression occurred in 22%, 15%, 2%, and 7%, respectively; and the linezolid dose was modified (i.e., interrupted, reduced, or discontinued) in 51%, 30%, 13%, and 13%, respectively. Optic neuropathy developed in 4 participants (9%) who had received linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks; all the cases resolved. Six of the seven unfavorable microbiologic outcomes through 78 weeks of follow-up occurred in participants assigned to the 9-week linezolid groups.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】A total of 84 to 93% of the participants across all four bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid treatment groups had a favorable outcome. The overall risk–benefit ratio favored the group that received the three-drug regimen with linezolid at a dose of 600 mg for 26 weeks, with a lower incidence of adverse events reported and fewer linezolid dose modifications.

Bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline, inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase and is licensed for use in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Pretomanid is a nitroimidazooxazine with activity against replicating and dormant mycobacteria through inhibition of mycolic acid biosynthesis and nitric oxide release, respectively. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> Linezolid is a repurposed oxazolidinone that inhibits mycobacterial protein synthesis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> but its prolonged use is associated with peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】In the Nix-TB study, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> 90% of the patients with highly drug-resistant tuberculosis who received bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid for 26 weeks had a favorable outcome. However, the use of linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg daily was associated with a high incidence of adverse events. Here, we present the results of the ZeNix trial, which was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of different doses of linezolid in the bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid regimen for highly drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【18】ZeNix was a partially blind, randomized trial that enrolled participants with pulmonary extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, pre-XDR tuberculosis, or rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. Participants with XDR tuberculosis had resistance to rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and an aminoglycoside. Pre-XDR tuberculosis was defined as resistance to rifampin plus resistance to either a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside. Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis was defined as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ that was resistant to rifampin (with or without resistance to isoniazid) and did not respond to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects 6 months or more before enrollment.\n\n【19】All the participants received treatment for 26 weeks, with the option to extend treatment to 39 weeks if ongoing active disease was suspected between weeks 16 and 26. The full trial protocol is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【20】Trial Participants\n------------------\n\n【21】Participants were recruited from four trial sites in South Africa, one in the country of Georgia, one in Moldova, and five in Russia. The participants were 14 years of age or older (≥18 years of age in Russia and Moldova) and had had a documented positive sputum culture or molecular test for _M. tuberculosis_ within 3 months before screening.\n\n【22】Participants were excluded if they had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a CD4+ cell count of less than 100 per cubic millimeter; a risk of arrhythmia; an alanine aminotransferase level and an aspartate aminotransferase level higher than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range; or peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or higher at baseline. Participants were excluded if they had previously received any of the three trial drugs or delamanid for 2 weeks or more before enrollment. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Section S5. All the participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【23】Enrollment and Interventions\n----------------------------\n\n【24】The participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, to one of the four linezolid regimens (either 1200 mg or 600 mg daily for either 26 weeks or 9 weeks) by trial site staff using an online portal. Randomization was stratified according to HIV status and classification of drug resistance.\n\n【25】In addition to linezolid, all participants received 26 weeks of bedaquiline (200 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed by 100 mg daily for 18 weeks) and pretomanid (200 mg daily for 26 weeks). The dose of linezolid could be reduced in a stepwise manner (1200 mg, 600 mg, 300 mg, or 0 mg) in response to adverse events. The participants, site staff, and trial team were unaware of the assigned duration and dose of linezolid treatment (see Section 4 in the protocol); matched placebo was provided for blinding. Adherence was monitored by direct observation if the participant was in the hospital or by checking medication cards and bottles for unused tablets at site visits.\n\n【26】Scheduled visits occurred weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 2 weeks until week 20, and then every 3 weeks until the end of treatment. The participants were followed for a minimum of 78 weeks after the completion of treatment, with scheduled visits in the follow-up period.\n\n【27】Microbiologic Assessments\n-------------------------\n\n【28】At the screening visit, two sputum samples were obtained for smear microscopy, molecular testing for rifampin resistance (with the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF \\[Cepheid\\] or GenoType MTBDRplus assay \\[Hain Lifescience\\]), and culture in liquid medium in a Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system (Becton Dickinson). Samples for culture in the MGIT system were then obtained weekly for 4 weeks and at weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 26, and at each follow-up visit after the completion of treatment.\n\n【29】_M. tuberculosis_ isolates from baseline cultures and the first positive culture on or after week 16 in participants who did not have a response to treatment were sent to a central laboratory for the determination of the MGIT minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid; for MGIT drug-susceptibility testing for first-line drugs (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin), kanamycin, and moxifloxacin; and for whole-genome sequencing. _M. tuberculosis_ isolates from participants with recurrence of tuberculosis were analyzed with the use of whole-genome sequencing 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> to distinguish between relapse and reinfection. For all drugs except pretomanid, the critical concentrations recommended by the World Health Organization were used to define resistance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> _M. tuberculosis_ isolates with a pretomanid MIC of greater than 2 mg per liter were considered to be resistant. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The laboratory manual, which includes full details of the microbiologic procedures, is provided in Section S15 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【30】Safety\n------\n\n【31】Adverse events were recorded at every trial visit, and laboratory safety tests were performed weekly for the first 8 weeks and at scheduled visits during treatment. Electrocardiographic monitoring, examinations to assess color vision and visual acuity, and specific assessments for peripheral neuropathy with the use of a Brief Peripheral Neuropathy rating scale were also performed at scheduled intervals (Section S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【32】Outcome Measures and End Points\n-------------------------------\n\n【33】The primary end point was the incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure or disease relapse (clinical or bacteriologic) at 26 weeks after completion of treatment. In participants with bacteriologic treatment failure, negative culture status was not attained or maintained during treatment. Clinical treatment failure was defined as one of the following: a change from the protocol-specified tuberculosis treatment as a result of a lack of clinical efficacy, retreatment for tuberculosis, or tuberculosis-related death by 26 weeks after completion of treatment. Culture conversion was defined as at least two consecutive culture-negative samples obtained at least 7 days apart. In participants with relapse, negative culture conversion status was not maintained during follow-up, and a positive culture of an _M. tuberculosis_ strain was confirmed as being genetically identical to that at baseline. Participants were considered to have a favorable outcome if they continued to have negative culture status during treatment to the end of follow-up and if they had not already been classified as having had an unfavorable outcome.\n\n【34】Secondary end points included bacteriologic or clinical treatment failure and relapse at 78 weeks after the end of treatment. Other secondary end points were the time to sputum culture conversion and the percentages of participants with culture conversion at specified time points.\n\n【35】Safety evaluations included adverse events, laboratory measurements, and death from any cause. Adverse events that occurred or worsened during the treatment period were defined as events that occurred between the start of treatment and 14 days after the end of treatment. The severity of adverse events was categorized according to grade, as defined by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases system, 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> and site investigators provided an assessment of relatedness to trial medications. All the participants who received at least one dose of a trial drug were included in the safety analysis.\n\n【36】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【37】﻿An independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety and efficacy data throughout the trial. National and local ethics committees approved the trial. The TB Alliance, the trial sponsor, was responsible for the design and conduct of the trial. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【38】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【39】The primary efficacy analysis was conducted with the results of the MGIT culture. We hypothesized that the incidence of cure at 26 weeks after the end of therapy would be greater than 50% in each of the treatment groups. The incidence was estimated from the binomial proportion for participants with success criteria based on the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval being greater than 50%. The trial did not have a control group.\n\n【40】We determined that a sample of 45 participants per group would provide the trial with more than 90% power to show that the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval was greater than 50%, using a two-sided 5% significance level (and assuming a true cure rate of 80%). Intention-to-treat, modified intention-to-treat, and per-protocol analyses for each group were conducted (Section S6). The intention-to-treat population was defined as all participants who underwent randomization, with the exception of those who were excluded after the randomization period either because of protocol violations that occurred before randomization (and were detected after randomization) or because they did not have drug-resistant tuberculosis that was confirmed on the basis of a sputum sample obtained within 3 months before screening; the modified intention-to-treat population as the participants in the intention-to-treat population, with the exception of those who were lost to follow-up after successful treatment or who died from a cause that was adjudicated to be unrelated to tuberculosis; and the per-protocol population as the participants in the modified intention-to-treat population, with the exception of those who were excluded for additional protocol-related reasons.\n\n【41】The primary comparison against the target 50% efficacy was for the bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid regimen with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks, with the group that received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks and the group that received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks being tested only if 1200 mg for 26 weeks was successful. The group that received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks would be tested only if the dose of 600 mg for 26 weeks was successful. A Bonferroni adjustment was made for the comparison of the group that received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks with the group that received 600 mg for 26 weeks simultaneously, and 97.5% confidence intervals were reported for these groups. No formal statistical pairwise comparisons between groups were performed.\n\n【42】Results\n-------\n\n【43】Participants\n------------\n\n【44】Figure 1. Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-up. Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Participants Who Underwent Randomization.\n\n【45】A total of 248 participants were screened and 181 participants underwent randomization between November 7, 2017, and December 3, 2019 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The characteristics of potential participants who were excluded during screening are provided in Table S4. The baseline characteristics of all 181 participants who underwent randomization are shown in Table 1 ; 122 participants (67%) were male, 115 (64%) were White, and 145 (80%) were HIV-negative. Information on the representativeness of the trial participants is provided in Table S4. In the safety population, a mean of 99.8% of the participants adhered to the trial-drug regimen 删除2:<u>(Table S1)</u>.\n\n【46】Of all 181 participants who underwent randomization, 75 (41.4%) had XDR tuberculosis, 85 (47.0%) had pre-XDR tuberculosis, and 21 (11.6%) had rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. All the participants with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis had resistance to isoniazid, so they were classified as having multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A total of 11 of 143 participants for whom at least one positive culture between screening and week 4 was analyzed had baseline isolates that were resistant to at least one trial drug.\n\n【47】Primary End-Point Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n【48】Table 2.  Table 2. Primary End-Point Efficacy Analysis.\n\n【49】Table 2 shows the results of the primary efficacy analysis in the modified intention-to-treat and intention-to-treat populations, and Table S5 shows the outcomes in the per-protocol population. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 41 of 44 participants (93%) in the group that received bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks were classified as having a favorable outcome, as were 40 of 45 participants (89%) in the group that received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks, 41 of 45 participants (91%) in the group that received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, and 37 of 44 participants (84%) in the group that received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. Treatment failure or bacteriologic relapse (confirmed by whole-genome sequencing) accounted for 5 of 19 unfavorable outcomes at 26 weeks of follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【50】Nine participants had baseline phenotypic bedaquiline resistance (two with additional linezolid resistance and one with pretomanid resistance), of whom six (including all three with dual resistance) had a favorable outcome. The three participants with unfavorable outcomes had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. Two additional participants had baseline pretomanid monoresistant isolates and favorable outcomes.\n\n【51】Secondary End-Point Analysis\n----------------------------\n\n【52】In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, favorable outcomes were reported at 78 weeks of follow-up in 40 of 43 participants (93%) who had received bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks, in 39 of 44 (89%) who had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks, in 40 of 45 (89%) who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, and in 35 of 44 (80%) who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. Three participants had unfavorable outcomes at 78 weeks of follow-up, of whom 2 had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks and had bacteriologic relapse (confirmed by whole-genome sequencing) and 1 had baseline bedaquiline and linezolid resistance. In addition, 1 participant who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks was treated again for tuberculosis after 39 weeks of follow-up with no positive cultures. Secondary end-point data in the per-protocol analysis and intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the data in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (Tables S10 through S12).\n\n【53】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Time to an Unfavorable Outcome and Time to a Linezolid Dose Modification.\n\n【54】Panel A shows the time to an unfavorable outcome in the modified intention-to-treat population (i.e., the participants in the intention-to-treat population, with the exception of those who were lost to follow-up after successful treatment or who died from a cause that was adjudicated to be unrelated to tuberculosis). The intention-to-treat population was defined as all participants who underwent randomization, with the exception of those who were excluded after the randomization period either because of protocol violations that occurred before randomization (and were detected after randomization) or because they did not have drug-resistant tuberculosis that was confirmed on the basis of a sputum sample obtained within 3 months before screening. There were no exclusions from the intention-to-treat population. An unfavorable outcome was defined as treatment failure or disease relapse (clinical or bacteriologic) at 26 weeks after completion of treatment. In participants with bacteriologic failure, a negative culture status for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ was not attained or maintained during treatment. In those with relapse, negative culture conversion status was not maintained during follow-up, and a positive culture of an _M. tuberculosis_ strain was confirmed as being genetically identical to that at baseline. Clinical treatment failure was defined as a change from the protocol-specified tuberculosis treatment as a result of a lack of clinical efficacy, retreatment for tuberculosis, or tuberculosis-related death. Panel B shows the time to a linezolid dose modification (i.e., the first of interruption, reduction, or discontinuation) in the intention-to-treat population through the last dose of linezolid. The vertical lines represent the time of the last active linezolid dose.\n\n【55】Figure 2A shows Kaplan–Meier curves for the time to an unfavorable outcome. The median times to culture conversion were the following: 4 weeks (interquartile range, 2 to 8) in the groups that had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks or 9 weeks; 6 weeks (interquartile range, 3 to 8) in the group that had received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks; and 6 weeks (interquartile range, 3 to 10) in the group that had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. One participant who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks had a treatment extension because of culture-positive sputum between weeks 16 and 26.\n\n【56】Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses\n---------------------------------\n\n【57】In the planned subgroup analyses (Section S12), age, sex, and HIV status did not influence outcomes. The subgroups of participants with a baseline time to positivity above the median and no lung cavities had slightly more favorable outcomes. The results of a sensitivity analysis that excluded participants with negative cultures at baseline were similar to those in the primary efficacy analysis (Tables S13 and S14).\n\n【58】Safety Analysis\n---------------\n\n【59】Table 3.  Table 3. Safety Analysis.\n\n【60】Safety data are provided in Table 3 . At least one adverse event that occurred or worsened during treatment was reported by 156 of 181 participants (86.2%), and serious adverse events that occurred or worsened during treatment were reported by 11 of 181 participants (6.1%). The linezolid dose was modified (interrupted, reduced, or discontinued) in 23 of 45 participants (51%) in the group that had received bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks and in 14 of 46 (30%) who had received the same dose of linezolid for 9 weeks; in each group that had received 600 mg of linezolid (26 weeks and 9 weeks), 6 of 45 participants (13%) had linezolid dose modifications. Figure 2B shows the time to a first linezolid dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation. Alterations in the dose were most commonly related to myelosuppression and neuropathy (Tables S23 through S25 and Section S13). One participant in the group that had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks died from a methadone overdose.\n\n【61】Peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or lower was reported in 17 of 45 participants (38%) in the group that had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, in 11 of 46 (24%) in the group that had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks, in 11 of 45 (24%) in the group that had received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, and in 6 of 45 (13%) in the group that had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. In all the treatment groups, peripheral neuropathy was reported by a higher percentage of South African participants than of those in Georgia, Moldova, or Russia (Tables S27 and S28). Four participants, all of whom had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, had optic neuropathy that resolved.\n\n【62】Laboratory-confirmed myelosuppression was reported in 10 of 45 participants (22%) in the group that had received bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks, in 7 of 46 (15%) who had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks, in 1 of 45 (2%) who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, and in 3 of 45 (7%) who had received 600 mg of linezolid for 9 weeks. Across the treatment groups, 47 of 181 participants (26%) had one or more liver-related adverse events, with similar numbers in each group. One participant in each group, except the group that had received 1200 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks, reported one or more serious liver-related adverse events.\n\n【63】Discussion\n----------\n\n【64】In this randomized trial of four 26-week regimens for highly drug-resistant tuberculosis consisting of daily bedaquiline and pretomanid with different doses and durations of linezolid treatment, the efficacy in all four treatment groups at the primary end point ranged from 84 to 93%. These results are similar to those in the Nix-TB study, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> and most of the unfavorable outcomes (in 14 of 19 participants) were not related to bacteriologic failure. At 78 weeks of follow-up, two additional relapses had occurred in the group that had received linezolid at a dose of 600 mg for 9 weeks, but no additional relapses had occurred in the other three treatment groups.\n\n【65】Differences were more apparent in linezolid-associated safety measures than in efficacy measures across the treatment groups, with different incidences of peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, and linezolid dose modifications. The 600-mg dose of linezolid was associated with fewer linezolid dose modifications, no cases of optic neuropathy, and fewer episodes of peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression. Unlike the 1200-mg linezolid dose, which had a less favorable safety profile in the 26-week group than in the 9-week group, there was less of a difference between the two 600-mg linezolid groups (26 weeks and 9 weeks). Hematologic toxic effects were uncommon in the two 600-mg linezolid groups. Although peripheral neuropathy that occurred or worsened during treatment occurred more frequently in the group that received linezolid at a dose of 600 mg for 26 weeks, both the 9-week group and the 26-week group had the same incidence (13%) of linezolid dose modifications.\n\n【66】The favorable side-effect profile of the 600-mg dose of linezolid and the lower incidence of bacteriologic failure in the group that received linezolid at a dose of 600 mg for 26 weeks (1 of 45 participants) than in the group that received the same dose of linezolid for 9 weeks (4 of 45 participants) suggest that the 600-mg, 26-week regimen had the most favorable risk–benefit profile among the four regimens studied. This regimen had efficacy that was similar to that previously observed in the Nix-TB study but fewer toxic effects. The more favorable risk–benefit ratio of this 26-week, three-drug, all-oral regimen is a welcome finding for the treatment of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis, which typically involves more drugs and longer treatment.\n\n【67】_M. tuberculosis_ is adept at developing resistance if it is treated with an insufficient number of drugs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,16 </a></sup></u> In this trial, 11 of 143 participants for whom at least one positive culture between screening and week 4 was analyzed had baseline isolates that were resistant to at least one trial drug. Although most of these 11 participants had a favorable outcome, the 3 participants with an unfavorable microbiologic outcome all had received linezolid for 9 weeks, which suggests that participants who receive linezolid for a shorter duration may be more vulnerable to treatment failure. These findings also serve to highlight the need for drug-susceptibility testing and for the continued improvement of treatment regimens. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u>\n\n【68】Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most commonly observed side effects of linezolid. Risk factors for the development of neuropathy include the duration and dose of linezolid treatment, coexisting conditions, nutritional status, the use of concurrent medications, and possibly genetic factors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-21 </a></sup></u> The higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy reported among South African participants than among those in Georgia, Moldova, or Russia was notable, but no explanatory factors could be identified, including HIV status, and this finding warrants further research.\n\n【69】This trial has several limitations. First, the trial size limits the precision of any estimate of treatment effect. Second, the lack of a standard-care control group means there is no clear comparator against which the observed efficacy can be assessed. In that regard, it is reassuring that the observed efficacy is consistent with that in the Nix-TB study.\n\n【70】This randomized, dose-blind trial of alternative linezolid regimens in bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid treatment showed favorable cure rates of the bedaquiline–pretomanid–linezolid regimen among participants with highly drug-resistant tuberculosis, inclusive of XDR, pre-XDR, and rifampin-resistant tuberculosis that had not responded to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects. In addition, lower linezolid doses resulted in fewer toxic effects than the 1200-mg, 26-week regimen. A 600-mg, 26-week regimen of linezolid appeared to have the most favorable risk–benefit profile among the regimens studied.\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the TB Alliance with funding from the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number, OPP1129600); the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany through KfW (a state-owned development bank that handles the grants to product development partnerships, such as the TB Alliance, for the German government); Irish Aid ; the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs ; the U.K. Department of Health ; the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office ; the U.S. Agency for International Development ; and a grant (MC\\_UU\\_00004/04 Respiratory Infections, to Dr. Crook) from the U.K. Research and Innovation Medical Research Council.</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>This article was last updated on December 15, 2022, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【75】参考删除-1:<u>A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【76】参考删除-1:<u>We thank all the trial participants; the nursing and laboratory staff; colleagues at Janssen Pharmaceuticals; all those who advised, volunteered, or otherwise supported community engagement around the clinical trial sites; and the members of the data and safety monitoring committee for their oversight.</u>\n\n【77】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【78】参考删除-1:<u>From the Clinical HIV Research Unit (F.C., P.H.) and Klerksdorp–Tshepong Hospital Complex, Department of Internal Medicine (E.V.), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, the Clinical HIV Research Unit, King DinuZulu Hospital, Durban (N.N.), and ﻿the TB Alliance, Pretoria (M.O.) — all in South Africa; the Central TB Research Institute of the Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations Moscow (T.R.B.), Moscow City Research and Practice Tuberculosis Treatment Center (S.B.), and National Medical Research Center of Phthisiopulmonology and Infectious Diseases (A.S.), Moscow, Ural Research Institute of Phthisiopulmonology, Yekaterinburg (S.S.), and St. Petersburg Research Institute of Phthisiopulmonology, St. Petersburg (P.Y.) — all in Russia; the National Center for Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Tbilisi, Georgia (L.M.); the Chiril Draganiuc Institute of Phthisiopneumology, Chisinau, Moldova (E.T.); the TB Alliance, New York (D.E., E.S., E.E., M.L., A.H., J.T., S.F., C.M.M., M.S.); and the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London (G.H.W., A.M.C., S.M.F., C.D.T.) and the University College London Centre for Clinical Microbiology (A.B., R.H., T.D.M.), University College London, London.</u>\n\n【79】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Tweed can be contacted at c.tweed@ucl.ac.uk or at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, 90 High Holborn, 2nd Fl., London WC1V 6LJ, United Kingdom.</u>\n\n【80】参考删除-1:<u>A list of the ZeNix Trial Team members is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【81】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Research Summary | PDF | 524KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Protocol | PDF | 6108KB |\n| Supplementary Appendix | PDF | 8455KB |\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 451KB |\n| Data Sharing Statement | PDF | 71KB |</u>\n\n【83】参考删除-1:<u>References _(21)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【84】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

James Shultz and Krista Nottage on climate-change–driven storms and their disproportionate effects on marginalized populations. (25:29) Download\n\n【4】Climate change has been linked to changes in Atlantic hurricane behavior, making storms more destructive to the built environment and vital infrastructure, more harmful to the physical and mental health of island-based and coastal populations, and more deadly in their aftermath. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> These escalating effects on population health represent a double environmental injustice: socioeconomically disadvantaged and marginalized populations sustain disproportionate harm and loss, with more hazardous storms exacerbating the inequity; and while the populations most vulnerable to Atlantic hurricanes, especially those in small-island states, contribute virtually nothing to climate change, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> they are among those most exposed to risks that are worsened by the carbon emissions from higher-income countries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】Anthropogenic climate change amplifies storm hazards through such intermediaries as anomalously warm ocean and air temperatures, rising ocean heat content, and increasing atmospheric moisture capacity, compounded by a rise in sea levels. Atlantic hurricanes have become stronger, wetter, and slower-moving over the past few decades, with likely contributions from human actions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】Widespread Destruction in Marsh Harbour, Abaco Islands, Bahamas, after Hurricane Dorian.\n\n【7】Hurricane Dorian’s catastrophic trajectory across the northwest Bahamas dramatically highlighted these trends. Dorian intensified at an unprecedented rate just before reaching the Bahamas and slammed into Great Abaco Island with sustained winds of 185 mph, tying the record for the greatest Atlantic-hurricane wind speed at landfall. It produced deluges of rain and dragged a two-story-high storm surge onshore, submerging entire neighborhoods. And its forward motion stalled as it moved onto Grand Bahama Island, where residents were battered by the strongest eye-wall winds for 40 hours, resulting in one of the most prolonged known population exposures to extreme hurricane hazards. Yet despite its distinguishing features, Hurricane Dorian fits into a discernible pattern of increasingly harmful Atlantic storms. Dorian was the fifth Category 5 Atlantic hurricane to make landfall over four consecutive seasons, preceded by Matthew (2016), Irma (2017), Maria (2017), and Michael (2018).\n\n【8】Destruction of Buildings and Trees in Central Abaco.\n\n【9】All hurricanes have public health effects. In addition to living through the storm hazards during impact, affected populations face health consequences arising from widespread power outages, water contamination, inoperative sanitation systems, and acute food insecurity in the aftermath. Storm-affected citizens grapple with the severe structural damage that leaves many homes uninhabitable and triggers population displacement. Survivors are often left to swelter in health-compromising heat and humidity and are vulnerable to vectorborne diseases. Health services are disrupted for many people with acute or chronic medical conditions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Patients with special medical needs, including those who are immunosuppressed, recovering from surgery or undergoing rehabilitation, or dependent on electronic devices or life-sustaining therapies, may face real threats to survival. School closures, damage to worksites, unemployment, and financial losses challenge the resilience of storm-ravaged communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【10】Mental health consequences are among the most salient, and they are a focus of the current recovery initiatives in the Bahamas. Survivors who were directly exposed to extreme storm hazards during Dorian’s impact are at elevated risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,4 </a></sup></u> Those who sustained massive losses may develop major depression or anxiety disorders. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【11】Climate-change–driven hurricanes tend to inflict two types of environmental injustice. One is that socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial or ethnic minority populations experience disproportionate harm, loss, and life changes. The increased severity of climate-change–related storms portends a worsening impact on marginalized people that can exacerbate preexisting health gaps and social inequities. As Dorian moved over the northwest Bahamas, for instance, the most severe destruction affected thousands dwelling in shantytowns on Great Abaco Island. Many of those affected were undocumented migrants. Similarly, after Hurricane Harvey, flooding around Houston was worst in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods with higher proportions of black and Latino residents. And after Hurricane Maria, many rural, disadvantaged Puerto Rican municipalities struggled without electricity for as long as a year. The death toll rose steadily into the thousands, as frail, elderly, and chronically ill people died preventable deaths. Disparities in health, as measured by multiple indicators, were magnified. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】At a more fundamental level of environmental injustice, the contribution of island-based populations to global carbon emissions is negligible. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Collectively, the Caribbean’s 44 million residents generate just 0.4% of total global emissions, and the Bahamas’ share is well below 0.01%. The countries designated by the United Nations as small-island states face climate-change–associated hurricane risks that are not of their own making. Rather, high-income countries that produce fossil fuels and expend massive amounts of energy generate most of the emissions that elevate hurricane risks for small-island populations.\n\n【13】Dorian’s devastation of the northwest Bahamas is the latest installment in a series of Atlantic storm impacts on the 29 United Nations–designated Caribbean small-island states. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew ransacked Haiti’s breadbasket, destroying staple crops. In 2017, Hurricane Irma brought Category 4 or 5 winds to eight small-island states and tropical storm winds to six more. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Hurricane Maria affected 16 island states, bringing major hurricane winds to 5 of them, including Dominica and Puerto Rico. All told, 22 of 29 Caribbean small-island states were affected by at least one 2017 storm. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】These states are geographically vulnerable because they’re in warm Atlantic Ocean latitudes where hurricanes form and flourish. Most residents of these islands are unable to evacuate in order to avoid traumatizing exposure to hurricanes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,4 </a></sup></u> In the aftermath of a hurricane, recovery support must be physically transported to geographically isolated populations of storm survivors who may be spread across multiple islands. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】The ferocity of cyclonic activity may have additive effects: the vulnerable are disproportionately affected, while the capacity of small-island states is decimated. Cars, trucks, and supplies intended to provide relief are destroyed. Relief workers, security officers, disaster coordinators, and health team members themselves become victims. Often the most climate-resilient structures end up being repurposed as shelters, which renders them unavailable to serve their usual functions. These multiplicative effects further magnify social injustice. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Ultimately, this whole dynamic contributes to widening health gaps. We believe that recognition of this reality compels action on several fronts.\n\n【17】First, communities need to prepare strategically for the onslaught of stronger storms by revising building codes and redesigning neighborhoods to redress existing socioeconomic inequities in affordable, safe housing. Also critical is making infrastructure more resilient, with a particular focus on electrical power systems. Cuba, for instance, completely redesigned its electrical system, creating a decentralized microgrid architecture that facilitated islandwide restoration of power less than 3 weeks after Irma’s impact in 2017.\n\n【18】Second, the health care system will have to be undergirded to withstand stronger hurricanes in order to maintain access to lifesaving services and operability of life-sustaining treatments. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Fortification of hospital facilities, auxiliary electrical power, and workforce protection for health care staff are priorities. Lessons learned from U.S. health care systems can be applied in island states. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】Third, enhancing warning systems, upgrading the structural integrity of hurricane shelters, and ensuring citizen compliance with evacuation protocols are lifesaving actions. Special attention must be paid to making these resources equitably available to marginalized populations.\n\n【20】Fourth, citizen engagement in disaster preparedness and response is generally lacking, although Cuba is an exception. Personal and family disaster planning and participation in community emergency-response teams, with opportunities for active practice, has been a vision in the United States — and a well-rehearsed reality in Cuba. Family preparedness is especially crucial for households with members who have special medical needs. The building of citizen cohesion and social connectedness is one of the hallmarks of community resilience that pays dividends in disaster situations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Fifth, health professionals can help increase collaborations among climate scientists, population health scientists, and clinicians to better plan the health response to hurricane-affected communities. In particular, health professionals have an important voice and can use it to advance the public conversation about climate change and resulting disasters. Both individually and collectively, health professionals can advocate for policies that constrain carbon emissions and seek alternative energy sources that diminish population health risks.\n\n【22】Sea levels will not recede, average global temperatures will not decline, and hurricane hazards will not moderate. We need to prepare now for future Dorian-like scenarios in a manner that redresses environmental injustice.\n\n【23】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【25】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on December 11, 2019, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【26】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【27】参考删除-1:<u>From the Center for Disaster and Extreme Event Preparedness, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami (J.M.S.); the Ministry of Health, Government of the Bahamas, Nassau (D.E.S.); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information, Center for Weather and Climate, Madison, WI (J.P.K.); and the Office of the Dean, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston (S.G.).</u>\n\n【28】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 180KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

She had been given a diagnosis of possible multiple sclerosis in September and at that time received 3000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone over 3 days, without effect. Her medical history was notable for psoriasis, for which she had been taking 420 mg of Psorinovo per day since 2007, supplemented by 1000 mg of calcium ascorbate per day and EPA-1000 fish oil capsules (EPA denotes the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid).\n\n【4】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Axial MRIs of the Brain Showing Manifestations and Progression of PML and Signs of IRIS.\n\n【5】The initial MRI (Panel A) shows a lesion in the left frontal white matter resulting from progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) (arrow). On follow-up 2 and 3 months later (Panels B and C, respectively), the progression of PML could be seen in the diffuse infiltration of the adjacent white matter (short arrows). The thalamus, putamen (Panels B and C, long arrows), and cortical gray matter (Panel B, arrowheads) were also affected. On follow-up at 3 months, enhancing lesions were detected on T <sub>1 </sub> \\-weighted MRI (Panel D, long arrows), suggestive of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n\n【6】Sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> showed small, deep white-matter lesions and one large progressive lesion, which was suggestive of progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML), as described in a study of imaging findings in relation to PML resulting from treatment with monoclonal antibodies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Hematologic studies revealed lymphopenia, with a count of 200 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter 删除4:<u>(normal range, 600 to 2900)</u>. We realized in retrospect that the lymphopenia had developed after the initiation of treatment with Psorinovo (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The patient was seronegative for HIV, but a semiquantitative, real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay of a specimen of the cerebrospinal fluid was positive for the JC virus.\n\n【7】We made a diagnosis of PML, stopped treatment with Psorinovo on November 7, and then started treatment for PML with mefloquine and mirtazapine.\n\n【8】Initially, the hemiparesis remained progressive, even though the lymphopenia began to abate 删除2:<u>(Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. On December 7, we noticed signs of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) on MRI, with indications becoming more evident on December 13 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. We initiated treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone. Her clinical condition stabilized in early January 2013, and we observed the first signs of recovery on January 31.\n\n【9】We believe that treatment with Psorinovo contributed to the development of PML in our patient. First, lymphopenia developed during treatment with Psorinovo and is a well known side effect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Second, our patient had used no immunosuppressive medication before the onset of PML, and she was seronegative for HIV. Finally, the occurrence of IRIS after the discontinuation of Psorinovo argues in favor of a causal link.\n\n【10】We think this case report is of special relevance since preparations of fumaric acid esters, including dimethyl fumarate, are emerging drugs that may have a broader range of therapeutic indications in the near future. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5</a></sup></u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Bob W. van Oosten, M.D., Ph.D.  \nJoep Killestein, M.D., Ph.D.  \nFrederik Barkhof, M.D., Ph.D.  \nChris H.

Similar to cervical cancer, anal cancer is preceded by high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Treatment for cervical HSIL reduces progression to cervical cancer; however, data from prospective studies of treatment for anal HSIL to prevent anal cancer are lacking.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】We conducted a phase 3 trial at 25 U.S. sites. Persons living with HIV who were 35 years of age or older and who had biopsy-proven anal HSIL were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either HSIL treatment or active monitoring without treatment. Treatment included office-based ablative procedures, ablation or excision under anesthesia, or the administration of topical fluorouracil or imiquimod. The primary outcome was progression to anal cancer in a time-to-event analysis. Participants in the treatment group were treated until HSIL was completely resolved. All the participants underwent high-resolution anoscopy at least every 6 months; biopsy was also performed for suspected ongoing HSIL in the treatment group, annually in the active-monitoring group, or any time there was concern for cancer.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】Of 4459 participants who underwent randomization, 4446 (99.7%) were included in the analysis of the time to progression to cancer. With a median follow-up of 25.8 months, 9 cases were diagnosed in the treatment group (173 per 100,000 person-years; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 90 to 332) and 21 cases in the active-monitoring group (402 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 262 to 616). The rate of progression to anal cancer was lower in the treatment group than in the active-monitoring group by 57% (95% CI, 6 to 80; P=0.03 by log-rank test).\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】Among participants with biopsy-proven anal HSIL, the risk of anal cancer was significantly lower with treatment for anal HSIL than with active monitoring.

In a meta-analysis, the risk of progression from anal HSIL to cancer was estimated to be 265 per 100,000 person-years 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> among men who have sex with men and are living with HIV. However, reported risk estimates in some cohorts of persons living with HIV or transplant recipients 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-14 </a></sup></u> are even higher, and Danish data show a 5-year incidence of progression to cancer of 14.1% among persons living with HIV with anal intraepithelial neoplasia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Efforts to prevent anal cancer in at-risk groups have been modeled after programs for the secondary prevention of cervical cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> These efforts consist of anal HSIL screening with the use of cytologic analysis, identification of HSIL through high-resolution anoscopy in those who are screen-positive, and HSIL removal through ablation, surgical excision, or other treatments. The prevention of anal cancer is desirable because anal cancer is associated with poor survival when detected at late stages, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> and treatment of cancers at all stages with standard chemoradiation therapy is associated with acute and chronic adverse effects.\n\n【17】Current recommendations for anal HSIL screening and treatment are based on expert opinion and lack rigorous evidence-based support. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> Formal inclusion of anal-cancer prevention programs in standard-of-care guidelines has awaited direct evidence that treatment for anal HSIL reduces the risk of progression to anal cancer. The purpose of the Anal Cancer–HSIL Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) trial was to determine whether treating anal HSIL is effective and safe in reducing progression to anal cancer among persons living with HIV as compared with active monitoring of HSIL without treatment.\n\n【18】Methods\n-------\n\n【19】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【20】This phase 3 randomized, controlled trial was performed at 25 sites in the United States. The trial was approved by the institutional review boards at all the participating clinical sites, and an independent data safety and monitoring board was appointed by the National Cancer Institute to monitor the trial. The authors performed the statistical analysis and wrote the first draft of the manuscript. The final submitted manuscript incorporated changes recommended by the coauthors and was reviewed and approved by all the authors, who vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for adherence of the trial to the protocol. No one who is not an author contributed to the manuscript. No commercial support was provided for trial planning and execution. Additional details of the trial design have been published previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and are also provided in the Supplementary Appendix and protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【22】Persons living with HIV who were 35 years of age or older were invited for anal HSIL screening. After written informed consent was provided, an anal swab was collected for liquid-based anal cytologic analysis. A complete physical examination and high-resolution anoscopy were performed. Lesions suspicious for HSIL or cancer were biopsied according to published standards 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> by clinicians certified for competence in high-resolution anoscopy (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【23】Participants were eligible for the trial if HSIL (AIN3 or p16-positive AIN2) 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> had been diagnosed in at least one anal-canal or perianal biopsy sample by a local pathology laboratory. Those with a history of anal cancer or anal cancer detected at screening were ineligible and were referred for therapy as appropriate. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the trial protocol.\n\n【24】Randomization, Stratification, and Masking\n------------------------------------------\n\n【25】Eligible participants returned within 12 weeks for randomization, at which time blood samples were collected for the measurement of plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 levels. High-resolution anoscopy was repeated to confirm the presence of HSIL. Randomization was stratified according to trial site, the nadir CD4 count (≤200 vs. >200 cells per cubic millimeter), and lesion size at randomization (≤50% vs. >50% of the anal canal or perianal region). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment group or the active-monitoring group with the use of a permuted random block design.\n\n【26】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【27】Participants who were assigned to the treatment group underwent immediate treatment with the aim of eradicating all HSIL. Clinicians selected the method of treatment from a list of protocol-defined options, in accordance with clinician and participant preference, using method-specific algorithms (Fig. S2A and S2B). These treatments included ablative procedures (infrared coagulation, electrocautery, and laser), ablation or excision under anesthesia, and topical treatments (imiquimod and fluorouracil). Participants in the treatment group returned for repeat high-resolution anoscopy in accordance with the treatment protocol and at least every 6 months after randomization after all HSIL had been fully treated. Lesions suspicious for HSIL were biopsied at any visit, and any recurrence was treated. Participants in the active-monitoring group underwent high-resolution anoscopy every 6 months after randomization. Visible lesions were biopsied annually to confirm ongoing HSIL and the absence of cancer. Participants in either group with lesions arousing concern for imminent progression to cancer could be seen every 3 months. Lesions suspicious for cancer could be biopsied at any time. Participants who received a diagnosis of biopsy-proven cancer were immediately removed from the trial and referred for appropriate therapy.\n\n【28】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【29】The primary outcome was progression to anal cancer in a time-to-event analysis. A secondary outcome was the safety of treatments for anal HSIL.\n\n【30】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【31】Sample-size estimates were based on a log-rank test to compare the time to progression to anal cancer between the treatment group and the active-monitoring group under the following assumptions: rates of progression to cancer in both groups were constant over time, with a 3-year accrual period and 5 years of follow-up, a 5% annual dropout rate in both groups, and a 7% annual nonadherence rate in the active-monitoring group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25 </a></sup></u> Participants in the active-monitoring group who received treatment for HSIL after randomization were classified as having been nonadherent to the trial protocol. Participants in either group who withdrew informed consent or who died during the trial were defined as having dropped out. Data were censored at the time of nonadhererence or dropout. The trial had a power of 90% to detect a difference between a rate of progression to cancer of 50 per 100,000 person-years in the treatment group and a rate of 200 per 100,000 person-years in the active-monitoring group (75% lower rate in the treatment group) at a two-sided 0.05 significance level; this required 2529 participants per group for a total of 5058 participants to detect 31 anal cancers.\n\n【32】Two interim analyses of the primary outcome were conducted after 50% and 75% of the projected cancer cases had been observed to assess the futility of detecting a significant between-group difference and to evaluate efficacy before full enrollment had been completed. A final analysis was performed when 100% of the projected cases had been observed. The Lan and DeMets spending function was used to specify the O’Brien–Fleming boundaries on the basis of a two-sided log-rank test (alpha level, 0.05). 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> At the final test, an overall two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 90% power were maintained.\n\n【33】The primary analysis population was the intention-to-treat population, which included all the eligible participants who had undergone randomization. Poisson regression models were used to compare the two groups with respect to dropout rates and serious adverse events. For each participant, the time until cancer detection was defined as the time from randomization to diagnosis of anal cancer, with data collection censored at the date of the last follow-up or time of nonadherence. A confirmatory analysis was performed without censoring data for the participants in the active-monitoring group at the time of nonadherence. The log-rank test was used to compare the treatment group and the active-monitoring group with respect to the time to detection of anal cancer. The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to assess the association of lesion size and nadir CD4 count with the time to cancer detection. Poisson rates and 95% confidence intervals were used to describe cancer risk.\n\n【34】The AdvantageEDC electronic data-capture system, which had been developed and was maintained by the Emmes Company, was used to collect trial data. Sample-size estimates were generated with the use of PASS software. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4.\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Participants\n------------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, and Follow-Up.\n\n【38】Of the six participants in the treatment group who discontinued the intervention for “other reason,” two received a diagnosis of anal cancer but were ineligible for analysis and were discontinued from the trial because they were determined to have had anal cancer before randomization, three relocated to a nontrial site, and one received immunomodulatory agents after a kidney transplantation. Of the two participants in the active-monitoring group who discontinued the intervention for “other reason,” both relocated to a nontrial site. A total of 25 of 2219 participants (1.1%) in the active-monitoring group were considered to be nonadherent because they had received treatment for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions at some time after randomization.Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline.\n\n【39】From September 24, 2014, to August 5, 2021, a total of 10,723 participants underwent screening 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and S3)</u>. Biopsy-confirmed HSIL was diagnosed in 4257 of 7729 men (55.1%), in 860 of 1822 women (47.2%), and in 188 of 280 transgender persons (67.1%) on the basis of complete results from cytologic and histologic analyses and high-resolution anoscopy. A total of 17 participants (0.2%) received a diagnosis of anal cancer. The primary reason for screening failure was the absence of biopsy-proven HSIL 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Table 1 and Table S1 show the demographic characteristics of the participants who underwent randomization according to trial group. A total of 4459 participants underwent randomization, 2237 to the treatment group and 2222 to the active-monitoring group. A total of 4446 participants had at least one follow-up visit after randomization and were included in the analysis. Overall, the characteristics of the participants were well balanced between the two groups and were similar to those of the overall U.S. population of persons living with HIV, with some small differences 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>.\n\n【40】Central pathological review of screening biopsies from 4257 participants who had received a diagnosis of HSIL from the local pathology laboratory confirmed HSIL in 4113 participants (96.6%); participants without confirmed HSIL remained in the trial and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 4446 participants followed after randomization, 4151 (93.4%) remained in the trial at the time of trial closure. Reasons for trial discontinuation are shown in Figure 1 .\n\n【41】Interventions and Follow-up\n---------------------------\n\n【42】In the treatment group, the initial treatment was office-based electrocautery ablation (primarily hyfrecation) in 1862 of 2227 participants (83.6%), infrared coagulation in 107 (4.8%), ablation or excision under anesthesia in 52 (2.3%), topical fluorouracil in 100 (4.5%), and topical imiquimod in 12 (0.5%). More than one method of treatment was used initially in 46 participants (2.1%), and 48 participants (2.2%) were not treated initially. Over the course of the trial, 1921 participants (86.3%) were treated with one therapeutic method, 233 (10.5%) with two methods, 33 (1.5%) with three methods, and 1 (<0.1%) with four methods.\n\n【43】The data and safety monitoring board was notified when 32 cases of anal cancer had been observed; on data cleaning, 2 cases were determined to be ineligible 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. In consultation with the data and safety monitoring board, we proceeded with the analysis with 30 cases. Participants in the treatment group and the active monitoring group contributed a median of 25.3 and 27.2 months of follow-up, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>; the overall median follow-up time was 25.8 months. The cumulative dropout rates were 2.8 per 100 person-years in the treatment group and 2.2 per 100 person-years in the active-monitoring group. The cumulative nonadherence rate in the active-monitoring group was 0.5 per 100 person-years.\n\n【44】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【45】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Curve of the Time to Progression to Anal Cancer.\n\n【46】The inset shows the data on an expanded y axis. The shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【47】A total of 9 participants in the treatment group received a diagnosis of invasive anal cancer, as did 21 participants in the active-monitoring group. All cases were confirmed on central pathological review. The observed rate of progression to cancer in the treatment group was 173 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 90 to 332) of follow-up, as compared with 402 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 262 to 616) in the active-monitoring group. The rate was lower in the treatment group than in the active-monitoring group by 57% (95% CI, 6 to 80; P=0.03 by log-rank test). The cumulative incidence of progression to anal cancer at 48 months was 0.9% in the treatment group and 1.8% in the active-monitoring groups. Kaplan–Meier curves of the time to cancer detection in both groups are shown in Figure 2 .\n\n【48】A total of 25 participants in the active-monitoring group were nonadherent, and the median time to nonadherence was 9.0 months (interquartile range, 1.8 to 17.9). An analysis in which these participants’ time to cancer detection was not censored at the time of nonadherence confirmed the findings that treatment reduced anal cancer (P=0.03 by log-rank test).\n\n【49】The characteristics of the participants in whom cancer developed are shown in Table S4. A total of 8 of 9 participants (89%) who had progression to cancer in the treatment group were treated with electrocautery and 1 of 9 (11%) was treated with infrared coagulation. The proportional-hazards model showed that the time to progression to anal cancer was associated with lesion size (hazard ratio, 5.26; 95% CI, 2.54 to 10.87) but not with nadir CD4 count (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 4.23). The rate of progression to anal cancer was 1047 per 100,000 person-years among participants with a lesion size of more than 50% of the anal canal or perianal region and 185 per 100,000 person-years among those with a lesion size of 50% or less of the anal canal or perianal region.\n\n【50】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【51】Table 2.  Table 2. Adverse Events.\n\n【52】Seven serious adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to a trial intervention were reported in the treatment group, and one such event was reported in the active-monitoring group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Death occurred in 55 participants in the treatment group and 48 participants in the active-monitoring group. No deaths were determined by the investigators to be related to trial interventions. The causes of death are shown in Table S5.\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】Anal cancer is among the limited types of cancers that are potentially preventable through treatment of known cancer precursors. Treating cervical HSIL is effective in reducing progression to cervical cancer, although data from randomized clinical trials are lacking. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study showed a 67% reduction in colon cancer over a period of 24 years with polypectomy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> In this trial, we found that participants who had undergone treatment for anal HSIL had a rate of progression to anal cancer that was nearly 60% lower than those who had undergone active monitoring and not received treatment. The trial was not designed to compare the efficacy of different methods of treatment of HSIL; however, most participants were treated with electrocautery (primarily hyfrecation), an office-based procedure that is quick and generally has an acceptable adverse-event profile.\n\n【55】The rate of progression to cancer among the participants in the active-monitoring group, at 402 per 100,000 person-years, was higher than expected on the basis of published estimates from cancer–HIV registry matches, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> even after accounting for all the trial participants having HSIL. This finding may in part reflect early cancer detection in our trial; in the absence of screening, anal cancer is usually diagnosed after the development of symptoms. Consistent with this finding, the percentage of stage I or II cancers that were diagnosed in the active-monitoring group was higher than that reported in national data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This result may also partially reflect the higher proportion of smokers and participants reporting male-to-male sexual contact than in the overall U.S. population of persons living with HIV.\n\n【56】Not all anal cancers were prevented through HSIL treatment. Similarly, treatment of cervical HSIL or colon polyps does not completely eliminate the risk of progression to cervical cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>28-31 </a></sup></u> or colon cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> respectively. In the cervix, larger lesion size and positive margins are associated with an increased risk of recurrent HSIL after treatment, particularly among women living with HIV, 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> and progression to cervical cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> Similarly, a larger lesion size was associated with an increased risk of progression to anal cancer in our trial. Treatment of anal HSIL is particularly challenging in persons living with HIV owing to a large lesion burden and number as reflected by high rates of HSIL recurrence or metachronous disease with currently available methods of treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>34-36 </a></sup></u> The high rate of anal cancer in the treatment group highlights the need for more effective HSIL treatment approaches and for close follow-up after HSIL treatment. Smoking was common in our population and is a modifiable risk factor for anal cancer.\n\n【57】Strengths of the trial include a large, multicenter, diverse population of participants with characteristics that were similar to those of the overall U.S. population of persons living with HIV. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> Trial procedures were performed by clinicians who were well trained in high-resolution anoscopy with pretrial qualification and ongoing quality assurance. Central pathological review was performed on almost all biopsy samples with positive results for HSIL during screening and all cases of anal cancer during the trial. The treatment approaches in the trial were guided by high-resolution anoscopy and selected to replicate those currently used in the community, maximizing generalizability. We had high trial retention with low nonadherence and dropout rates. A limitation of the trial is that our results may not be replicated if high-resolution anoscopy and treatment are performed by clinicians with less training and clinical support.\n\n【58】The high rate of progression from HSIL to cancer among persons living with HIV in our trial highlights the need for strong prevention efforts. HPV vaccination effectively prevents the initial acquisition of anal HPV 删除3:<u><sup><a>38 </a></sup></u> and the development of anal HSIL in young persons living with HIV. 删除3:<u><sup><a>39 </a></sup></u> However, secondary prevention programs including treatment of anal HSIL are urgently needed for those already exposed to anal HPV. Additional research is needed to improve screening algorithms to identify anal HSIL. High-resolution anoscopy is not a feasible screening tool given its cost and limited availability, and both anal cytologic analysis and anal HPV testing have limitations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>40 </a></sup></u> Expansion of diagnostic and therapeutic training programs in the use of high-resolution anoscopy is also needed.\n\n【59】Our data show that treatment of anal HSIL, primarily with office-based electrocautery, significantly reduced the risk of progression to anal cancer among persons living with HIV who were 35 years of age or older. Such treatment was associated with a low incidence of serious adverse events. Our data provide support for the use of screening and treatment for anal HSIL as the standard of care for persons living with HIV who are 35 years of age or older. Additional considerations should include assessment of the effect on quality of life and other risk–benefit measures. Our data may also be relevant for other groups at increased risk for anal cancer.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the National Cancer Institute (award number 2 UM1 CA121947).

No objective marker for symptomatic procainamide-induced lupus has been described. However, IgG antibodies to the histone complex H2A–H2B have previously been reported in this disorder, and it has been suggested that antiguanosine antibodies may be a marker for major manifestations of procainamide-induced lupus.\n\n【2】We therefore tested for these antibodies in 20 symptomatic and 31 asymptomatic patients treated with procainamide. Most of the symptomatic patients had multiple manifestations of drug-induced lupus; resolution of symptoms after the discontinuation of procainamide was required for inclusion in the symptomatic group. All 20 symptomatic patients had elevated IgG antibodies to H2A–H2B, in contrast to only 2 asymptomatic patients (P<0.001). This activity was absent in patients not treated with procainamide and in patients with lupus induced by hydralazine or quinidine. IgG antiguanosine was elevated as compared with normal controls in 13 of 20 symptomatic and 19 of 31 asymptomatic patients — a finding that did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.\n\n【3】We conclude that IgG antibodies to H2A–H2B are a sensitive and specific marker for procainamide-induced lupus. The striking correlation between antibodies to H2A–H2B and symptomatic disease suggests a possible association between this antibody and the underlying pathogenic events. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1988; 318:1431–6.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Hong Kong was the hardest-hit area during the worldwide epidemic of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, with the highest incidence rate (1755 cases in a population of 6.7 million) and a high case fatality rate of 17 percent (299 deaths). 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In fact, the infection in Hong Kong was believed to be the source of the spread of the disease to many other countries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> A series of case clusters that occurred during the epidemic in Hong Kong 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-6 </a></sup></u> suggested that environmental factors might have been involved in the spread of the virus.\n\n【12】The large community outbreak in the Amoy Gardens housing complex affected more than 300 residents of this private housing estate. The index patient infected with the SARS virus visited unit 7 on a middle floor of building E on March 14 and again on March 19 and used the toilet; the patient had diarrhea. Subsequent cases of SARS (categorized according to apartment unit) were located in clusters in four buildings and at certain floor levels. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Previously available reports have not provided a satisfactory explanation of the features of the outbreak in the Amoy Gardens housing complex. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】We analyzed the available data with reference to the spatial distribution of the cases in this outbreak and used models based on airflow dynamics to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of the SARS virus.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Epidemiologic Analysis\n----------------------\n\n【16】We studied data with regard to the date of onset of symptoms and the location of the residences of the persons with SARS virus infection in the initial phase of the outbreak (most of these were probably secondary cases). Residences were characterized according to building (A through S, for a total of 19 buildings), floor (4th to 36th), and apartment unit (apartment unit 1 to apartment unit 8, with eight units on each floor). We then determined the distribution of cases according to date of onset and location of residence.\n\n【17】We used the probability of infection for each apartment unit (not each resident) as the dependent variable and applied the logistic-regression model to explore the association between location (i.e., apartment unit and floor in each building) and the probability of infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Because each unit had two bedrooms and all units were roughly equal in size, we assumed that each unit housed four persons, which was the largest number of infected persons in any one unit in the data. The observed probability of infection for an individual apartment unit could therefore be 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1. Because the airflow dynamics involved in the spread of the SARS virus in building E (the suspected location of the source of infection) were obviously different from the dynamics in the other buildings, the analyses for building E were performed separately from the analyses for the other buildings.\n\n【18】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Distribution of Cases of SARS Infection in Buildings A to G in the Amoy Gardens Housing Estate.\n\n【19】The prevailing wind (red arrows) during the period of possible exposure was northeasterly, or roughly perpendicular to the exterior walls of apartment units Dc and Da in building E. The distance between buildings E and B is 60 m. The direction from which the wind blew shifted from nearly north to east and even southeast. The red dot in building E indicates the unit that the index patient visited. The directional indicator for the units at the lower right-hand corner indicates the direction each unit faced. In the directional code (Ab, Ad, Ba, Bc, Cb, Cd, Da, Dc) used to designate an apartment unit, uppercase letters denote front-facing windows and lowercase letters side-facing windows.\n\n【20】The floors of the buildings were grouped into three categories according to height (lower, middle, and upper) so as to provide sufficient numbers for analysis. The criteria for the cutoff points were chosen to minimize the deviance in the logistic-regression models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Unit numbers (1 to 8) were recoded to reflect the directions of the bedroom windows (front facing) and living room windows (side facing) in every apartment unit 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. In the resultant eight directional codes (Ab, Ad, Ba, Bc, Cb, Cd, Da, Dc, where A is southeast, B southwest, C northwest, and D northeast) that were used in place of the eight unit numbers, uppercase letters indicate the front-facing window direction and lowercase letters indicate the side-facing window direction. The lower floors and apartment unit Cb were used as reference categories in the regression analyses. To examine the possibility of contamination of the analysis by tertiary cases, we repeated the analyses after excluding late-onset cases and used different cutoff dates, beginning with March 26. The fitted models were compared with the use of the maximum rescaled R 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> and C statistics. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-13</a></sup></u>\n\n【21】Computational Fluid-Dynamics Analysis and Multizone Modeling\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】A detailed site plan, floor plans, and the layout of the drainage system in the Amoy Gardens complex were obtained from the Buildings Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Hourly meteorologic data for the area of Amoy Gardens during March were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory.\n\n【23】Analysis with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allowed us to make a reasonably accurate prediction of the detailed airflow pattern in the air shafts (reentrant areas) and around the buildings in the housing complex. Similar airflow models have been used for the study of foot-and-mouth disease 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> and the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak of 1979. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> In the application of such a modeling tool, turbulence models, numerical methods, and the user's experience can introduce substantial errors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Hence, proper evaluation of the results is essential. Two software packages were used for CFD, Fluent (Fluent) and Airpak (Fluent). Fluent is a three-dimensional, general-purpose CFD software package for modeling fluid flows. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> We used the basic-renormalization-group (RNG) turbulence model and the Reynolds stress model in Fluent to model the effects of turbulence on airflow and the dispersion of pollutants. The virus-laden water droplets generated from the apartment unit that the index patient visited 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> were found to evaporate rapidly (after a few seconds in air) when we modeled the virus-laden plume in the air shaft. For most of the simulations, we approximated the droplet nuclei as passive scalars, and the deposition effect was therefore neglected. Airpak is a three-dimensional CFD software package that was developed for modeling airflow in and around buildings. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> We used the RNG turbulence model in Airpak to carry out CFD simulations of both the plume flow in the air shaft and the aerosol spread between buildings.\n\n【24】Multizone methods 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> allowed us to calculate the hourly rates of airflow between the apartment units — also called zones for this calculation — and the concentrations of virus-laden aerosols in each unit in building E. These zones were connected by flow paths, such as windows, doors, gaps around closed windows and doors, and elevator lobbies, to form a flow network. For closed windows and doors, the effective leakage area was calculated on the basis of data from Orme et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Flow rates through doorways and windows (closed and open) were assumed to be dependent on differences in air pressure. Differences in air temperature and winds, as well as the exhaust from fans, could introduce driving pressures. We used the software program MIX, which was developed by Li et al., 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> to model the airflows between apartment units in building E, on the assumption that the contamination started from a source inside the air shaft between units 7 and 8.\n\n【25】Results\n-------\n\n【26】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Epidemic Curves for All Buildings and for Buildings B, C, D, and E.\n\n【27】Adequate data for our analysis of the spread of the SARS virus in Amoy Gardens were available for the first 187 confirmed cases (involving persons in 142 apartment units) of a total of 321 cases 删除4:<u>(up to April 15, 2003)</u> that were investigated by the Department of Health 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> and that accounted for approximately 70 percent of all cases that occurred on or before April 1. The dates of onset of the first symptoms are shown in Figure 2 . The epidemic started on March 21, 2003, and in the majority of cases among residents in all buildings, the onset of symptoms occurred during three days, March 24 to 26, with the peak (mode) on March 24. The shape of the epidemic curve was consistent with an outbreak with a common source. Data with reference to building E alone produced a pattern very similar to that of the epidemic curve for all buildings, and the peak on March 24 was obvious. As shown in Figure 2 , in building D, the epidemic started on March 22 and also peaked on March 24; in building C, it started on March 24 and peaked on March 26; and in building B, the first cases occurred on March 23, and there was no clear peak.\n\n【28】The floors in the buildings were categorized by level as lower (floors 4 to 13), middle (floors 14 to 23), or upper (floors 24 to 36). All but 5 patients with SARS (97 percent) lived in the seven buildings (A to G) that form a ring 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>, and more than half the cases (99) occurred in building E. In buildings A, F, and G, there were fewer than 10 cases each, and hence those buildings were excluded from further regression analyses. In buildings B, C, and D, there were 20 to 25 cases each, and those buildings were included in the stratified analyses.\n\n【29】Table 1.  Table 1. Location as a Risk Factor for Infection with the SARS Virus among Residents of Housing Units in Amoy Gardens.\n\n【30】The fit was very similar in the different models in which various cutoff dates were used for building E. The maximum rescaled R 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> (the proportion of variation explained by the model) ranged from 0.23 to 0.24, and the C statistic was between 0.80 and 0.82. The results of the logistic-regression models without cutoff dates are shown in Table 1 . For building E, apartment units (not persons) on the middle and upper floors had higher probabilities of infection than did units on lower floors, with an odds ratio of 5.15 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 10.3; P<0.001) for the middle floors and 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 6.2; P<0.01) for the upper floors. The risk of infection was highest (odds ratio, 14.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.5 to 38.4) for units that faced direction Ab (unit 8 on each floor), and it was also significantly elevated in apartment units that faced direction Ad (unit 7) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The units that faced directions Da (unit 6) and Dc (unit 5) appeared to have a slightly lower risk of infection than the other units. Results of the test for heterogeneity were statistically significant (P<0.001) for both floor level and direction.\n\n【31】For buildings B, C, and D, the variation among the three categories of floor level was statistically significant (P=0.01), but the variation among the eight directions was of only borderline significance (P=0.06). For middle-level floors and for directions Ad, Ba, and Da there was a significantly higher risk of infection than on the lower floors and in direction Cb, respectively. In the analyses stratified according to building, only the model for building C showed significant heterogeneity among floor levels and directions. The odds ratios for the middle-level floors (16.3) and for apartment units coded Da (9.9) were statistically significant, whereas those for the upper-level floors (7.2) and for units coded Ad (6.4) were of borderline significance. Location (floor level and direction) was not statistically significant for buildings B and D. However, in building B, all apartment units with windows that faced direction D (either at the front or the side) — that is, the direction from which the wind blew from building E — had high odds ratios, between 3.0 and 5.2; in building D, two directions the windows faced were of borderline significance — namely, Ab (odds ratio, 6.3) and Ba (odds ratio, 6.3). We repeated the modeling assuming five or six residents in each unit and obtained similar results (data not shown).\n\n【32】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Model of the Movement of the Virus-Laden Plume.\n\n【33】According to our computational fluid-dynamics modeling, the buoyant plume (blue) rose from the air shaft between two housing units in building E (yellow) and was carried by a northeasterly wind toward the middle-level floors in buildings C and D. The L-shape structure (Panels A and B) was a nearby construction site that blocked the wind flowing toward lower-level floors in buildings E, C, and D. The wake flow of the construction site created a region of negative air pressure in the space between buildings E, C, and D (Panel B) that caused the plume to bend downward, toward buildings C and D.\n\n【34】Figure 3 shows CFD modeling for the vertical movement of contaminated air in the air shaft between unit 7 (Ad) and unit 8 (Ab) in building E and the three-dimensional spread of the viral plume to buildings B, C, and D. Moist, warm air flowed from the bathroom of the index unit (unit 7 in building E, with windows facing direction Ad) and established a plume in the air shaft that spread the airborne virus upward. The predicted decay in the concentration of the contaminated aerosols in the plume was 25 percent at the top of the air shaft where a northeasterly wind was blowing at the velocity of 2 m per second. On reaching the top of the building, the contaminated air was carried by this northeasterly wind toward other buildings. A substantial amount of the contaminated air passed between buildings C and D at the height of the middle-level floors.\n\n【35】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Predicted, Time-Averaged, “Normalized” Concentration of Virus-Laden Aerosols in Apartment Units 1 to 8 in Building E.\n\n【36】The direction of the prevailing airflow (arrows) was modeled through the front door of each unit. For the directional codes for the apartment units, see the legend to Figure 1. B denotes bedroom, D dining area, K kitchen, L living room, and T toilet (bathroom). C denotes normalized calculated concentration of virus-laden aerosols.\n\n【37】The analysis performed with multizone methods showed that horizontal airflows between apartment units in building E, from unit 7 (Ad) and unit 8 (Ab) toward units 1 to 6, were driven mainly by wind pressure and by exhaust fans in the bathrooms or kitchens in units 1 to 6 删除2:<u>( Figure 4 )</u>. The “normalized” concentration of the hypothetical infectious aerosols was highest in units 7 and 8 (the referent) and lowest in units 5 and 6.\n\n【38】Discussion\n----------\n\n【39】Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the spread of the SARS virus in the Amoy Gardens outbreak. The investigation by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region suggested that the index patient infected a small group of residents in building E and that the infection subsequently spread to the other residents in that building through the sewage-disposal system, person-to-person contact, and the use of communal facilities such as elevators and staircases. These infected residents subsequently transmitted the disease to others both within and outside building E through person-to-person contact and by contaminating the environment.\n\n【40】An investigative team from the World Health Organization (WHO) found that traps in the floor drains in many of the housing units seemed not to have been filled with water for long periods; the seals in the traps thus dried out, and as a result, a connection was opened to the vertical soil stack (drainage pipe). 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> The investigative team suggested that an exhaust fan that was running behind a closed door in the bathroom could have drawn fine droplets or aerosols from the soil stack into the bathroom through the unsealed floor drain and thereby contaminated the bathroom. The exhaust fan could have transported contaminated droplets or aerosols from the bathroom into the air shaft. These contaminated droplets or aerosols could have been carried upward by the natural air current and could have entered other apartment units, even units several floors away from the source of infection, if the virus-laden aerosols had reached an open window. The WHO report did not provide an explanation for the spread of the infection from building E to the other buildings.\n\n【41】We concur with the WHO hypothesis regarding the source of infection and the mechanism of the initial spread of the virus-contaminated aerosols. With the use of a mock-up of the drainage system in experimental studies at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the University of Hong Kong, we found that huge numbers of aerosols were generated by the hydraulic action in vertical soil stacks when toilets were flushed. The drainage pipes for various units within a single building were not directly connected, and the drainage pipes for all the buildings were not connected until they met underground. Hence, the spread of infection through the sewage system, which was suggested in the government's report, could explain only cases that developed in unit 7 of building E but not cases that developed in other units in that building and in other buildings.\n\n【42】Cases of infection began to occur in buildings B, C, and D only one to three days after the first cases occurred in building E. In the majority of the cases in buildings C and D, the first symptoms appeared within a period of three days (March 24 to 26), coinciding with the peak of the epidemic in building E. This finding suggested that these cases were more likely to have developed from exposure to a common source than from person-to-person contact, as was suggested in the government report. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Riley et al. showed that the persons who became ill in the outbreak were likely to have been infected during a very short period (±1 day) around March 19, 2003. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Our analysis also showed that the peak exposure would have occurred on approximately March 19 and 20, if a modal incubation period of about four to five days was assumed. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23</a></sup></u>\n\n【43】Members of the management and security staff of Amoy Gardens, who worked on the ground floor in each building 24 hours a day and would probably have had frequent person-to-person contact with the residents, were not affected by the virus. Likewise, there were no cases reported among staff members in the large shopping center in the Amoy Gardens estate. The spatial distribution of the affected apartment units (in which there were cases of infection) could not be explained by random person-to-person contact. We believe that such contact probably occurred in the latter part of the epidemic and that the number of cases and therefore the number of units affected by this means was likely to have been small.\n\n【44】Ng put forward the theory that roof rats were both amplifiers and distributors of the SARS-associated coronavirus, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> but this theory is not supported by the epidemiologic distribution of cases; the middle-level floors were affected more than the upper floors, and certain units were affected more than others in the same building. Roof rats are by nature territorial, and they therefore could not be responsible for the rapid and efficient spread of the infection from a single building, building E, to other buildings. The main flaw in this hypothesis is that it does not explain the steep decline in the epidemic curve after the peak, because there was no sudden disappearance of roof rats or massive deaths among them.\n\n【45】The epidemic curve supports the hypothesis of a common source of the outbreak in Amoy Gardens, and the spatial distribution of the cases conformed to the hypothesis that virus-laden aerosols spread from a single source (the index apartment unit), as shown in our model made with the use of airflow-dynamics data. The delay of one to three days in the onset of the epidemic in buildings B, C, and D might be explained by a lower effective viral load in the aerosols as the plume became progressively diluted. A delay in the onset of symptoms was also observed among cases in the apartment units of building E that did not border the index air shaft. With regard to cases with an onset of symptoms within the first three days of the outbreak, all except one occurred in unit 7 (Ad) and unit 8 (Ab), which lined the air shaft nearest the index unit. The predominant direction of the wind blowing from unit 7 toward unit 8 could explain why residents in unit 8 on the various floors were more affected than those in unit 7.\n\n【46】The dilution of the viral load as the plume traveled upward might explain why residents on the middle floors were more affected than those on the upper floors. In apartment unit 5 (Dc) and unit 6 (Da) there were fewer cases of infection, because these units were upwind of the index air shaft and therefore received the lowest normalized viral concentrations. The unit directions (i.e., the directions the front and side windows faced) and floor levels that were associated with higher risk in buildings C and D corresponded well to the results of the airflow modeling, which showed the contaminated plume passing through the space between buildings C and D at middle-level floors. For building B, apartment units that faced building E appeared to have a higher risk of infection.\n\n【47】The extremely high concentrations of the SARS-associated coronavirus found in the feces and urine of the index patient, coupled with the aerosolization due to hydraulic action inside the drainage pipes (vertical soil stacks), most likely generated huge numbers of virus-laden aerosols. The concentration of the aerosols decayed as the plume traveled away from the source, and the decay corresponded to lower attack rates (and, possibly, to a longer incubation period) in other apartment units of building E and in other buildings. The concentration of virus in respiratory secretions was found to be much lower than the concentrations in urine and stool, and this difference might explain the need for close contact with the index cases in some nosocomial outbreaks of SARS. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【48】In summary, our epidemiologic analysis, experimental studies, and airflow simulations support the probability of an airborne spread of the SARS virus in the outbreak in Amoy Gardens. Virus-laden aerosols generated in the vertical soil stack of unit 7 in building E returned to the bathroom through the dried-up seals of the floor-drain traps and then entered the air shaft, probably by means of suction created by an exhaust fan. The aerosols moved upward owing to the buoyancy of the warm, humid air within the air shaft and could enter apartment units that bordered the air shaft on the upper floors because of the negative pressure created by the exhaust fans or the action of wind flows around the building. The horizontal spread of infection to other units in building E was by movement of the air between apartment units. After the plume reached the top of the air shaft in building E, the virus was spread to some units at certain heights in buildings B, C, and D by the action of a predominant northeasterly wind.\n\n【49】Our hypothesis adequately explains the temporal and spatial distribution of cases of SARS. This hypothesis remains to be confirmed by further analytic epidemiologic, environmental, and experimental studies and should have important public health implications for the prevention and control of SARS, should the disease recur.\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by the Hong Kong University SARS Research Fund 2003.</u>\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Community and Family Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong (I.T.S.Y., T.W.W., W.T., T.H.); and the Departments of Mechanical Engineering (Y.L., A.T.C., D.Y.C.L.) and Civil Engineering (J.H.W.L.), University of Hong Kong — both in Hong Kong, China.</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Yu at the Department of Community and Family Medicine, 4th Fl., School of Public Health, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong, China, or at iyu@cuhk.edu.hk .</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>References _(24)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Tafenoquine is a single-dose 8-aminoquinoline that has recently been registered for the radical cure of _P. vivax_ .\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】This multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Ethiopia, Peru, Brazil, Cambodia, Thailand, and the Philippines. We enrolled 522 patients with microscopically confirmed _P. vivax_ infection (>100 to <100,000 parasites per microliter) and normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity (with normal activity defined as ≥70% of the median value determined at each trial site among 36 healthy male volunteers who were otherwise not involved in the trial). All patients received a 3-day course of chloroquine 删除4:<u>(total dose of 1500 mg)</u>. In addition, patients were assigned to receive a single 300-mg dose of tafenoquine on day 1 or 2 (260 patients), placebo (133 patients), or a 15-mg dose of primaquine once daily for 14 days (129 patients). The primary outcome was the Kaplan–Meier estimated percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months, defined as _P. vivax_ clearance without recurrent parasitemia.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the intention-to-treat population, the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months was 62.4% in the tafenoquine group (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 54.9 to 69.0), 27.7% in the placebo group (95% CI, 19.6 to 36.6), and 69.6% in the primaquine group (95% CI, 60.2 to 77.1). The hazard ratio for the risk of recurrence was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.40) with tafenoquine as compared with placebo (P<0.001) and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.39) with primaquine as compared with placebo (P<0.001). Tafenoquine was associated with asymptomatic declines in hemoglobin levels, which resolved without intervention.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Single-dose tafenoquine resulted in a significantly lower risk of _P. vivax_ recurrence than placebo in patients with phenotypically normal G6PD activity.

Phase 3 data are reported here; phase 2b data were reported previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> To confirm assay sensitivity, we also assessed chloroquine plus primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). A meta-analysis of the individual-level patient data in DETECTIVE phase 3 and another phase 3 trial (the Global Assessment of Tafenoquine Hemolytic Risk \\[GATHER\\]) compared the efficacy of tafenoquine with that of primaquine in preventing recurrence of _P. vivax_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【18】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, and Trial Populations.\n\n【19】The intention-to-treat population included all patients who underwent randomization and had microscopically confirmed _Plasmodium vivax_ parasitemia at baseline. The per-protocol population was a subgroup of patients from the intention-to-treat population who had no major protocol violations. The safety population included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. Patients in the intention-to-treat and safety populations may have had more than one reason for exclusion. G6PD denotes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and QTcF the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula.\n\n【20】We conducted this multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial from April 2014 through November 2016 at eight centers in six countries 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and relevant regulatory requirements. Ethics approval was obtained from the ethics committee or institutional review board at each site. All participants or their parents or guardians provided written informed consent. Assent was obtained from participants who were younger than 18 years of age. The protocol , including eight amendments, is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The sponsors of the trial (GlaxoSmithKline and Medicines for Malaria Venture) contributed to the development of the protocol. GlaxoSmithKline managed the conduct of the trial, collected and managed the data, monitored the trial staff, conducted the statistical analysis, and provided all the drugs used in the trial. Medicines for Malaria Venture contributed to the design of the trial and to the analysis of the data. The first draft of the manuscript was prepared by a medical writer paid by GlaxoSmithKline. All authors, including those who were employees of GlaxoSmithKline, contributed to subsequent drafts, approved the final version of the manuscript, and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The sponsors and the authors agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the data during the review process.\n\n【21】Participants\n------------\n\n【22】Eligible participants were 16 years of age or older (≥18 years of age if in Ethiopia) and had microscopically confirmed _P. vivax_ infection (>100 to <100,000 asexual parasites per microliter) and a corrected QT interval according to Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) of less than 450 msec. Eligible female participants had negative pregnancy tests, were not lactating, and used approved contraception. Exclusion criteria were mixed plasmodium species or severe malaria, severe vomiting, a hemoglobin level of less than 7 g per deciliter, an alanine aminotransferase level more than 2 times the upper limit of the normal range, clinically significant concurrent illness, use of an antimalarial drug within the previous 30 days or use of an investigational drug within the previous 30 days or within five half-lives (whichever was longer), use of concomitant drugs that could affect trial results, previous participation in or treatment within the trial, and a history of allergies or contraindications to tafenoquine, primaquine, or chloroquine. Patients with G6PD deficiency were also excluded. Each trial site established a median value for normal G6PD activity among 36 healthy male volunteers who otherwise were not involved in the trial. Patients with G6PD activity that was less than 70% of this median, as determined on the basis of a quantitative spectrophotometric phenotype assay (Trinity Biotech), were considered to have G6PD deficiency and were excluded. Participants with a history of ocular disease or corneal or retinal abnormalities were excluded from ophthalmic evaluation.\n\n【23】Randomization and Trial Regimen\n-------------------------------\n\n【24】The trial drugs included chloroquine phosphate (300-mg tablets \\[West Ward Pharmaceuticals\\] and 150-mg tablets \\[Alliance Pharmaceuticals\\]), tafenoquine (150-mg tablets \\[GlaxoSmithKline\\]), and primaquine phosphate (15-mg encapsulated tablets \\[Sanofi\\]) (dosages are given for the free-base form). All drugs and placebo were administered orally with food and were provided without cost to all participants.\n\n【25】With the use of a computer-generated randomization schedule provided by GlaxoSmithKline, on day 1 eligible participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1:1 ratio, to receive tafenoquine, primaquine, or placebo. Patients in the tafenoquine group received 300 mg of tafenoquine in a single dose on day 1 or day 2, and patients in the primaquine group received 15 mg of primaquine once daily for 14 days (administration was directly observed on days 1 to 3). Tafenoquine-matched and primaquine-matched placebos were administered to maintain masking. All patients also received open-label chloroquine at a dose of 600 mg on day 1 and day 2 and 300 mg on day 3; administration of chloroquine was directly observed. Patients and trial staff were unaware of the group assignments.\n\n【26】Procedures\n----------\n\n【27】Patients remained in the clinic from day 1 to day 3 or until parasite clearance, and trial visits were scheduled on days 5, 8, 11, and 15 during the treatment period, with follow-up on days 22, 29, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. Insecticide-treated bed nets were provided to all patients. Patients were instructed to return to the clinic if they had symptoms of malaria; if parasitemia was found, they were given rescue therapy according to local guidelines. A list of criteria for discontinuation of therapy is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【28】Baseline demographic data and a medical history were obtained at screening, and a physical examination was performed. Thick and thin blood smears were prepared for identification of parasites, and parasites were enumerated with the use of established methods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Blood samples for parasitologic assessment were obtained at screening and twice daily (every 6 to 12 hours) from day 1 until day 3 or until parasite clearance was confirmed; smears were examined on all subsequent follow-up visits and after recurrence of parasitemia or withdrawal from the trial. Dried blood spots were collected on filter paper at screening and at the time of recurrence for polymerase-chain-reaction genotyping, with homology or heterology assessed with the use of published markers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> At screening and on days 60 and 120, two measurements of G6PD enzyme levels were obtained according to the instructions of the manufacturer of the assay, and the results were averaged. G6PD genotyping was performed at a central laboratory for all female participants and for male participants with a hemoglobin decline of 3 g or more per deciliter, with the use of standard methods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> A qualitative point-of-care test (CareStart, AccessBio) to determine G6PD activity was also performed at screening but was not used to determine eligibility. Whole-blood specimens were collected from all patients and were placed in EDTA tubes for genotype analysis of cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6). 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25</a></sup></u>\n\n【29】Safety was assessed at all visits, at the time of recurrence of parasitemia, and at withdrawal from the trial. Twelve-lead electrocardiography was performed at screening; 12 hours after the first dose of tafenoquine, primaquine, or placebo; and on day 29. Analyses of hematologic and clinical chemistry values and urinalysis were performed at screening, on day 3, at follow-up visits until day 120, and at the time of recurrence of parasitemia or withdrawal from the trial. Methemoglobin levels were determined with the use of pulse oximetry at screening; on days 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 60, and 120; and at the time of recurrence of parasitemia or withdrawal from the trial. Ophthalmic assessments were performed at one site (Manaus, Brazil) at screening, on days 29 and 90, on day 180 if results were previously abnormal, and at withdrawal from the trial. Data on health outcomes and pharmacokinetic measures were recorded (findings are not reported here).\n\n【30】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【31】The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months (termed “recurrence-free efficacy” in the protocol and Supplementary Appendix ). Freedom from recurrence was defined as microscopically confirmed clearance of the initial _P. vivax_ infection without recurrent _P. vivax_ parasitemia and without the receipt of other antimalarial treatment during follow-up plus a negative blood smear at the 6-month assessment. Secondary efficacy outcomes were freedom from recurrence at 4 months, the time to recurrence, the time to parasite clearance (aparasitemia maintained for 6 to 12 hours), and the time to fever clearance (apyrexia maintained for 48 hours). Additional outcomes were the time to _P. vivax_ gametocyte clearance (the time from the first dose until consecutive gametocyte-negative slides), _P. vivax_ recurrence before day 33, the incidence of _P. falciparum_ malaria, and the incidence of genetically homologous or heterologous _P. vivax_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> The effect of the CYP2D6 genotype on the primary outcome was evaluated with the use of the Activity Score system, which determines a metabolic activity phenotype on the basis of the genotype (a score of 0 indicates poor CYP2D6 metabolic activity, a score of 0.5 or 1 intermediate activity, and a score ≥1.5 extensive activity). 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> Safety outcomes were the nature and frequency of adverse events (classified according to the _Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities_ , version 19.1), hematologic and clinical chemistry values outside the normal range, and abnormal electrocardiograms.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】Assuming that 60% of patients in the placebo group and 90% in the tafenoquine group would be free from recurrence, we calculated that at least 90 participants would need to be enrolled in these two groups to provide the trial with more than 90% power to detect a difference between the groups. For the expanded safety database, the planned sample size was 500. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\n【34】No multiplicity adjustments were performed. The primary analysis compared the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months in the tafenoquine group with that in the placebo group in the intention-to-treat population. Hazard ratios for the risk of recurrence of parasitemia with tafenoquine as compared with placebo and with primaquine as compared with placebo, with 95% confidence intervals and P values, were determined with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model fitted with region and group assignment as covariates. The primary analysis was repeated for the primary outcome at 4 months, in the per-protocol population, and in a comparison of primaquine with placebo. A categorical analysis of the primary outcome in which patients with missing data were considered to have had recurrence of _P. vivax_ was conducted with the use of logistic regression, with region and group assignment as covariates.\n\n【35】The time to recurrence of _P. vivax_ malaria and clearance times for parasites, fever, and gametocytes were estimated with the use of Kaplan–Meier methods. Logistic regression was used to investigate the effect of CYP2D6 metabolism on the primary outcome in each group, after adjustment for region. Safety outcomes were summarized descriptively.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Patients\n--------\n\n【38】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics in the Intention-to-Treat and Safety Populations.\n\n【39】Of the 683 patients who were screened for eligibility, 5.7% (39 patients) were excluded because they had G6PD enzyme activity that was less than 70% of the site-specific median, according to the quantitative spectrophotometric assay. The G6PD qualitative test (which was performed in 584 patients at screening) reported as “normal” all 12 patients (6 male patients and 6 female patients) who had G6PD enzyme activity that was 30% to less than 70% of the site-specific median and 4 (2 male patients and 2 female patients) of the 25 patients with G6PD enzyme activity that was less than 30% of the site-specific median. The qualitative test was not performed in 2 patients who had G6PD enzyme activity that was less than 30% of the site-specific median. Of the 522 patients who were enrolled, 502 (96.2%) completed the trial 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The baseline characteristics were similar across groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. A total of 96.8% of the patients in the primaquine group (120 of 124 patients) met the prespecified criteria for adherence of at least 12 doses, as assessed by pill count and the detection of carboxyprimaquine in plasma on day 8 or 15. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u>\n\n【40】Recurrence of _P. vivax_ Malaria\n--------------------------------\n\n【41】Five patients were considered to have had recurrence before day 33; three patients withdrew consent and therefore had incomplete day 3 assessments, one patient in the placebo group had recurrence on day 8, and one patient in the tafenoquine group had recurrence on day 19 and therapeutically inadequate plasma levels of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine.\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Analysis of the Recurrence of Parasitemia in Patients with _P. vivax_ .\n\n【43】Patients were assigned to receive tafenoquine (in a single 300-mg dose), placebo, or primaquine (15 mg, administered once daily for 14 days) in addition to a 3-day course of chloroquine 删除4:<u>(total dose of 1500 mg)</u>. Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier analysis of the probability of freedom from recurrence of _P. vivax_ parasitemia over 6 months among patients in the intention-to-treat population. The symbols indicate censored data, and the shaded areas indicate confidence intervals. Data were censored at the last parasite assessment if the patients were lost to follow-up, received a drug with antimalarial activity, or completed the trial before recurrence. Data for patients who had a recurrence before day 33 were censored at the time of recurrence. However, any patient with recurrence was considered to have had recurrence irrespective of censoring before the event. Panel B shows the hazard ratios for the risk of recurrence of parasitemia with tafenoquine as compared with placebo, and Panel C the risk of recurrence with primaquine as compared with placebo, according to region.\n\n【44】In the intention-to-treat population, 32.7% of the patients in the tafenoquine group (85 of 260 patients), 66.2% in the placebo group (88 of 133 patients), and 27.9% in the primaquine group (36 of 129 patients) had recurrence of _P. vivax_ parasitemia at 6 months. The Kaplan–Meier estimates of the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months were 62.4% in the tafenoquine group (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 54.9 to 69.0) and 27.7% in the placebo group (95% CI, 19.6 to 36.6). The hazard ratio for the risk of recurrence with tafenoquine as compared with placebo was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.40; P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. The percentage of patients in the primaquine group who were free from recurrence at 6 months was 69.6% (95% CI, 60.2 to 77.1). The hazard ratio for the risk of recurrence with primaquine as compared with placebo was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.39; P<0.001).\n\n【45】In an analysis in which patients with missing data were considered to have had recurrence, the results were consistent with those of the primary analysis. The percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 6 months was 59.6% (155 of 260 patients) in the tafenoquine group, 26.3% (35 of 133 patients) in the placebo group (odds ratio for recurrence with tafenoquine vs. placebo, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.38; P<0.001), and 64.3% (83 of 129 patients) in the primaquine group (odds ratio for recurrence with primaquine vs. placebo, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.34; P<0.001).\n\n【46】Analyses of the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence in the per-protocol population and at 4 months showed results that were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Findings in the tafenoquine group were similar across geographic regions 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. In the primaquine group, the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence was higher in Asia than in other regions, but the number of patients in Asia was small (26 patients) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>. The proportion of recurrences caused by parasites that were heterologous or homologous to the initial infection was similar in each of the three groups.\n\n【47】In patients with poor CYP2D6 metabolic activity, recurrences occurred in 1 of 3 patients in the tafenoquine group, in 2 of 2 patients in the placebo group, and in 3 of 3 patients in the primaquine group. In the tafenoquine group, there was no significant difference in recurrences between patients with poor or intermediate activity and patients with extensive activity (37.5% \\[21 of 56 patients\\] vs. 36.0% \\[63 of 175 patients\\] had recurrence; odds ratio, 1.05). In the primaquine group, patients who had poor or intermediate activity had significantly more recurrences than patients with extensive activity (38.9% \\[14 of 36 patients\\] vs. 27.5% \\[22 of 80 patients\\] had recurrence; odds ratio, 2.36). A post hoc analysis indicated that body weight had no effect on the risk of recurrence.\n\n【48】Parasite clearance was achieved by day 3 in 88.1% of the patients in the tafenoquine group (229 of 260 patients), in 82.7% in the placebo group (110 of 133 patients), and in 83.7% in the primaquine group (108 of 129 patients). There was no significant difference among groups in clearance times of parasites, fever, or gametocytes. _P. falciparum_ infections were detected in 2.1% of all patients (11 of 522 patients) at follow-up, with no significant difference among groups. Additional information regarding recurrence is provided in Tables S2 through S10 and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【49】Safety\n------\n\n【50】Table 2.  Table 2. Adverse Events in the Safety Population.\n\n【51】Adverse events of any cause were reported in a similar proportion of patients in each group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There was no evidence that tafenoquine exacerbated the known adverse effects of chloroquine. Dizziness and decreased hemoglobin level were more common in the tafenoquine group than in the placebo group. In the tafenoquine group, 97.0% of adverse events (159 of 164 events) were mild to moderate in severity. Of the 260 patients in the tafenoquine group, 7 met the protocol-defined hematologic stopping criteria; of the 133 patients in the placebo group, 3 met the corrected QT stopping criteria. No adverse event led to withdrawal from the trial, and all events resolved without sequelae.\n\n【52】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Mean Hemoglobin Levels in Patients with Normal G6PD Genotype and _P. vivax_ Parasitemia.\n\n【53】The y axis has been shifted upward in Panel B to allow data to be compared more easily. The number at risk indicates the number of patients who could be evaluated at each time point. 𝙸 bars indicate standard errors.\n\n【54】A mild decline from baseline in mean hemoglobin levels was observed in all groups initially, but levels subsequently returned to the normal range 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Results for hematocrit were consistent with the observed changes in hemoglobin levels. Hemoglobin declines of more than 3 g per deciliter or at least 30% of the baseline level were noted in 5.4% of the patients in the tafenoquine group (14 of 260 patients), in 1.5% in the placebo group (2 of 133 patients), and in 1.6% in the primaquine group (2 of 129 patients); all these patients had a normal G6PD genotype. No patients had symptoms of anemia, and hemoglobin levels returned to the normal range without clinical intervention. Two female patients were heterozygous for a variant associated with G6PD deficiency (the _Viangchan_ variant): 1 in the tafenoquine group, who had a G6PD enzyme level of 5.57 IU per gram of hemoglobin, and 1 in the primaquine group, who had a G6PD enzyme level of 5.41 IU per gram of hemoglobin; neither patient had clinically important declines in hemoglobin level (declines of 2.3 g per deciliter and 1.8 g per deciliter).\n\n【55】From baseline through day 29, methemoglobin levels were at least 10% in 1.2% of the patients in the tafenoquine group (3 of 260 patients), in 0% in the placebo group (0 of 133 patients), and in 7.8% in the primaquine group (10 of 129 patients). Maximum methemoglobin levels were 13.0% in the tafenoquine group and 14.7% in the primaquine group. No clinical signs of methemoglobinemia were observed. There were no differences among the groups in other hematologic or laboratory outcomes.\n\n【56】Coadministration of tafenoquine or primaquine with chloroquine did not exacerbate the QTcF prolongation that is known to occur with chloroquine use. Ophthalmic examinations showed that in the tafenoquine group, 1 of 65 patients had unilateral keratopathy, and 2 of 65 had unilateral retinal changes; in the primaquine group, 1 of 30 patients had unilateral retinal hypopigmentation. Postbaseline abnormalities in Humphrey visual fields were noted in 5 of 103 patients (2 of 54 patients in the tafenoquine group, 1 of 24 in the placebo group, and 2 of 25 in the primaquine group). No findings were clinically problematic or suggested an ocular effect of drug treatments. Additional information regarding safety is provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【57】Discussion\n----------\n\n【58】The trial population was composed of persons living in regions in which _P. vivax_ is endemic, which made them vulnerable to reinfection throughout the trial. In this population, the percentage of patients in the tafenoquine group who were free from recurrence at 6 months (62.4%; 95% CI, 54.9 to 69.0) was lower than in DETECTIVE phase 2b (89.2%; 95% CI, 77 to 95) 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> ; the percentage of patients in the primaquine group and in the placebo group who were free from recurrence was also lower in this phase than in phase 2b. This could have resulted from variations in drug efficacy among trial populations, the use of different trial sites, or geotemporal differences in transmission. The larger difference between the percentage of patients who were free from recurrence at 4 months and at 6 months in this phase of the trial than in phase 2b suggests that reinfection rates were higher in phase 3 than in the previous phase. Both phases showed a consistent benefit with 8-aminoquinolines as compared with placebo. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The efficacy and safety findings related to primaquine were consistent with those in other reports. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【59】Chloroquine resistance was confirmed in the case of one early recurrence and has been reported to occur in the geographic regions included the trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28-30 </a></sup></u> A phase 3 trial is assessing tafenoquine plus dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine as the blood schizonticide (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02802501 . opens in new tab ).\n\n【60】The _CYP2D6_ gene has high allelic heterogeneity, with wide variations in enzyme levels and activity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> Tafenoquine is metabolized slowly, with no major metabolites in human plasma or urine. No effect on the efficacy of tafenoquine in preventing recurrence was seen in patients with intermediate CYP2D6 metabolic activity — a finding that is consistent with a previous analysis 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> ; however, more data on persons with poor CYP2D6 metabolic activity are required. In contrast, the CYP2D6 enzyme is necessary to convert primaquine to active metabolites, 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> and evidence is emerging that CYP2D6 metabolism can modify primaquine efficacy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,33,34</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】Reductions in hemoglobin levels were observed in all groups and were probably the result of malaria infection. However, the reductions in hemoglobin level in the tafenoquine group (though mild) were greater than those in the placebo group. These observations are consistent with the reductions of 0.4 to 1.2 g per deciliter observed in a study conducted among healthy volunteers with normal G6PD genotypes who received 300 mg of tafenoquine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Overall, declines in hemoglobin of more than 3 g per deciliter or at least 30% of baseline levels were uncommon and occurred in patients with normal G6PD genotypes; none required clinical intervention. The two female patients who were heterozygous for the _G6PD Viangchan_ variant were treated with 8-aminoquinolines, and neither one had adverse hematologic events.\n\n【62】Patients with G6PD deficiency who are treated with 8-aminoquinolines have a risk of severe hemolysis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> G6PD testing is recommended before administration of the primaquine regimen used in this trial, and it will be required before administration of tafenoquine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> The qualitative test evaluated here failed to identify 16 patients most at risk for hemolysis. If tafenoquine use is expanded, adoption of reliable quantitative point-of-care G6PD tests will be needed; such tests are not currently available but are in development. 删除3:<u><sup><a>36</a></sup></u>\n\n【63】It was a challenge to reach the target recruitment number in this trial, though the trial had sufficient statistical power to assess the primary outcome. A major limitation of the trial was that _P. vivax_ genotyping cannot differentiate among recrudescence, relapse, and reinfection; all may appear homologous or heterologous to the initial infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> Although this trial was conducted in regions where tropical-type _P. vivax_ strains prevail (with relapses occurring 17 to 45 days after the initial infection 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> ), it is possible that not all relapses were observed. Nevertheless, the risk of _P. vivax_ recurrence from any cause was about 70% lower with tafenoquine than with placebo over the 6-month trial period. Given the need to reduce the global burden of _P. vivax_ malaria, GlaxoSmithKline will make tafenoquine available at an affordable price in countries in which malaria is endemic to improve access to those who need it most. 删除3:<u><sup><a>38</a></sup></u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) and Medicines for Malaria Venture .</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Llanos-Cuentas reports receiving grant support and fees from GSK for conducting the tafenoquine clinical program; Dr. Noedl, receiving grant support and fees from GSK for clinical trial site development; Dr. Kleim, Mrs. Rousell, Dr. Hardaker, Ms. Kellam, Dr. Jones, Ms. Mohamed, Ms. Fletcher, Mr. Breton, Dr. Ugwuegbulam, Dr. Green, and Dr. Koh, being employed by and holding stocks and shares in GSK; and Ms. Clover, being employed by GSK.

In poor countries, it is commonplace. In rural sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of families have lost at least one child to a treatable infectious disease. Fortunately, with improvements in immunization coverage and public health in recent years, the death toll from killers such as pneumonia, diarrheal disease, measles, and tetanus has fallen. But deaths from AIDS and malaria have increased. It is estimated that 1 million children die each year from falciparum malaria, yet malaria is both preventable and treatable. The main reason why malaria-related mortality has increased while mortality associated with most other treatable and preventable infections has decreased is the continued deployment of ineffective antimalarial drugs in the face of increasing resistance.\n\n【3】 Fatal Cerebral Malaria.\n\n【4】A thin film of blood obtained from a patient before death shows heavy parasitemia, with parasites mainly at mature stages (Panel A). A microscopic image of a brain specimen obtained from a patient after death shows capillaries and venules packed with erythrocytes infected with schizonts (Panel B).\n\n【5】Courtesy of Kamolrat Silamut.\n\n【6】Chloroquine has been our most important antimalarial drug for the past half-century. At the outset, it was simple to administer, was highly effective when given in a few doses, had few side effects, and was inexpensive (costing approximately 10 cents per treatment). Widespread deployment of both chloroquine and the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was remarkably effective in controlling and, in some places, eradicating malaria early in the global malaria eradication campaign of the 1950s. Chloroquine was widely available in both public and private sectors, and it was used in industrial quantities; hundreds of metric tons were consumed each year.\n\n【7】But because chloroquine binds extensively to tissues and is very slowly eliminated (with a terminal elimination half-life of more than 1 month), a large proportion of the population in areas where malaria was endemic had detectable chloroquine concentrations in their blood at any given time. The selection pressure on malaria parasites was enormous, and resistance duly emerged in _Plasmodium falciparum_ by the end of the 1950s. It arose almost simultaneously in low-transmission areas of South America and Southeast Asia and then spread relentlessly, arriving at the eastern seaboard of Africa in the late 1970s and marching steadily across the continent over the next decade.\n\n【8】Chloroquine gave us 30 to 40 years of benefit. Unfortunately, its successor, sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, often fell to resistance within 5 years of extensive use. But affected countries were reluctant to change their malaria-treatment policies, so as the rates of resistance increased, mortality also rose.\n\n【9】Artemisinin-based combination treatments are now considered the best therapy for falciparum malaria. Such treatments are effective, work rapidly, and have very few adverse effects; they combine unrelated compounds with different molecular targets (and thus different potential mechanisms of resistance), thereby delaying the emergence of resistance. But they are more expensive than single-agent treatments. A cost per treatment of 50 cents to $2.50 (sometimes more in the private sector) may not sound like a lot to pay for saving the life of a child, but it is often unaffordable to the rural poor, who are the most affected by malaria. Since 2005, most countries where malaria is endemic have adopted treatment policies based on these combination therapies, but only a small fraction of the population that needs these drugs actually receives them.\n\n【10】In 1993, Malawi became the first country in Africa to change its national policy on malaria treatment, shifting away from chloroquine therapy. In the subsequent years, while the selection pressure exerted on malaria parasites by chloroquine was lifted in Malawi, the molecular basis of chloroquine resistance was being elucidated. Mutations in _PfCRT,_ a gene in the parasite that encodes a putative transporter, were shown to play a central role in chloroquine resistance. Early studies had suggested that chloroquine-resistant malaria parasites were actually more fit than their chloroquine-sensitive counterparts, even in the absence of selective pressure. Few, therefore, anticipated that chloroquine susceptibility would return if the drug was withdrawn.\n\n【11】But that is exactly what has happened in Malawi. Molecular epidemiologic studies from Malawi and parts of Asia where the use of chloroquine had been largely suspended showed a decline or disappearance of the K76T mutation in _PfCRT_ . In this issue of the _Journal,_ Laufer et al. 删除1:<u>删除4:<u>(pages 1959–1966)</u></u>, who previously conducted such studies in Malawi, report the results of a clinical trial providing conclusive evidence that the disappearance of the K76T mutation has been associated with a return to chloroquine susceptibility.\n\n【12】How good is this news from a public health perspective? Can we now abandon these new, relatively expensive antimalarial agents and return to our old and trusted friend chloroquine? Laufer and her colleagues wisely counsel against doing so. Malawi is surrounded by a sea of chloroquine resistance. If chloroquine were reintroduced alone, resistant parasites would probably return rapidly, imported in people from neighboring areas. But the restored susceptibility is still good news: chloroquine resistance presumably confers a fitness disadvantage, and stable compensatory mutations sufficient to counter this disadvantage apparently have not occurred. Thus, chloroquine could reenter the increasingly promising queue of new candidate antimalarial agents — but it needs to leave before it can come back.\n\n【13】In most of Asia, South America, and the Horn of Africa, chloroquine is still needed for the treatment of vivax malaria. This situation could change, since most malaria infections are treated without any particular species having been diagnosed, and the artemisinin-based combination treatments (with the exception of artesunate–sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine) are reliably effective against all the malarias that affect humans.\n\n【14】In the remainder of Africa, where chloroquine has become ineffective against _P. falciparum,_ the drug should be replaced as soon as possible by effective treatments. The World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination treatments as first-line therapy for falciparum malaria in all areas where it is endemic.\n\n【15】If these new, effective drugs are going to have an effect on malaria, they must be made affordable and available. To be affordable, they must cost 10 cents or less a day in both the public and private sectors, as chloroquine does. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended that an internationally funded scheme be instituted to reduce the cost to both the public and private sectors of obtaining antimalarial drugs whose quality is assured. Antimalarial drugs that are highly effective, have acceptable adverse-effect profiles, and are affordable should win out over ineffective medicines and thwart the burgeoning market in substandard and fake drugs. Richer countries will need to pay for this effort, but there are powerful humanitarian and economic arguments for ensuring ready access to effective antimalarial drugs.\n\n【16】With strong leadership and the singularity of purpose that characterized the successful campaign to eradicate smallpox, malaria can be rolled back. We already have the necessary tools: insecticides, insecticide-treated bed nets, and good drugs. An effective and affordable vaccine would be wonderful, but we do not need to wait for it. It is time to turn the tide on malaria. We can do it now, and it won't cost that much.\n\n【17】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【18】Dr. White is a professor in the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\n【19】Citing Articles _(15)_\n----------------------\n\n【20】Close Citing Articles", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

All the patients had a viral load of more than 1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter. After a 7-day control period in which patients continued to receive their current therapy, a loading dose of 2000 mg of ibalizumab was infused; the viral load was quantified 7 days later. Through week 25 of the study, patients received 800 mg of ibalizumab every 14 days, combined with an individually optimized background regimen including at least one fully active agent. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter from baseline (day 7) to day 14.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 31 patients completed the study. The mean baseline viral load was 4.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter, and the mean CD4 count was 150 per microliter. Of the 40 patients in the intention-to-treat population, 33 (83%) had a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter from baseline (P<0.001 for the comparison with the control period). The mean viral-load decrease was 1.1 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. During the control period, 1 patient, who received the optimized background regimen prematurely, had a decrease in viral load of 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. At week 25, patients who had received ibalizumab plus an optimized background regimen had a mean decrease of 1.6 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter from baseline; 43% of the patients had a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter, and 50% had a viral load of less than 200 copies per milliliter. Among 10 patients who had virologic failure or rebound, in vitro testing identified 9 who had a lower degree of susceptibility to ibalizumab than at baseline. The most common adverse event was diarrhea (in 20% of patients). Four patients died from causes related to underlying illnesses; 1 had a serious adverse event (the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) that was deemed to be related to ibalizumab therapy.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In patients with MDR HIV-1 infection who had advanced disease and limited treatment options, ibalizumab had significant antiviral activity during a 25-week study. Evidence of the emergence of diminished ibalizumab susceptibility was observed in vitro in patients who had virologic failure.

In these studies, ibalizumab (combined with an individually optimized background regimen that included at least one antiretroviral agent that was determined to be active for a given patient) resulted in a significant reduction in viral load and an increase in CD4 T cells, which were maintained through 24 weeks and 48 weeks. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26-28 </a></sup></u> In a phase 2b study of ibalizumab in which investigators compared a dose of 2000 mg every 4 weeks with a dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks, the former dose resulted in more rapid maximal drug exposure, whereas the latter dose provided a more stable drug exposure during a 24-week period and resulted in more patients with an undetectable viral load.\n\n【14】In TMB-301, a 24-week, open-label, single-group, phase 3 study involving patients with MDR HIV-1 infection who had undergone multiple therapies, we administered an initial 2000-mg loading dose of ibalizumab to obtain rapid therapeutic drug exposure, followed by a dose of 800 mg every 14 days to maintain viral suppression. In this study, we assessed the antiretroviral activity, durability of response, and safety of ibalizumab, both as a functional monotherapy and in combination with an optimized background regimen.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Study Design\n------------\n\n【17】From July 2015 through October 2016, we enrolled patients at 30 centers in North America and Taiwan. The study design called for the assessment of the virologic efficacy of ibalizumab at an early time point. The drug regimen was designed on the basis of guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients with MDR HIV-1 infection who had already undergone multiple therapies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29</a></sup></u>\n\n【18】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Trial Design, Enrollment, and Outcomes.\n\n【19】The primary end point (the proportion of patients who had a viral-load decrease of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter from baseline) was measured on day 14 (Panel A). The mean changes from baseline in viral load and in CD4 count (key secondary end points) were measured at week 25. A total of 23 patients were excluded from participating in the study for reasons that included a viral load that was too low, the lack of availability of a sensitive agent to construct an optimized background regimen, and inadequate documentation of resistance (Panel B).\n\n【20】The study was conducted during three time periods 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>. During the control period (days 0 to 6), patients were monitored while they were receiving their current therapy. During the functional monotherapy period (days 7 to 13), the patients received an intravenous bolus of 2000 mg of ibalizumab at baseline (day 7) while they continued to receive their previous therapy. During the maintenance period (day 14 to week 25), patients initiated their optimized background regimen on day 14 and received an intravenous dose of 800 mg of ibalizumab every 14 days, starting on day 21.\n\n【21】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【22】Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years of age) with a viral load of more than 1000 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter during receipt of highly active antiretroviral therapy for at least 8 weeks before screening. Patients were required to have received antiretroviral drugs for at least 6 months before screening, with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in at least three classes. In addition, patients were required to continue their previous regimen before the initiation of an optimized background regimen. The background regimen, which was selected on the basis of the patient’s treatment history and genotypic and phenotypic assessments, had to include at least one fully active antiretroviral drug and could include investigational agents if needed to construct a viable regimen. All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【23】End Points and Assessments\n--------------------------\n\n【24】The primary end point was the proportion of patients who had a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter from baseline to day 14 (7 days after the administration of a loading dose of ibalizumab). Secondary end points were the mean change in viral load on day 14, the proportion of patients who had a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter or at least 1.0 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter at week 25, the proportion who had an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter or less than 200 copies per milliliter at week 25, and the mean changes in viral load and CD4 count at week 25.\n\n【25】Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive measurements after day 14 that showed a reduction from baseline in viral load of less than 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. Viral rebound was defined as an increase of at least 1.0 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter in viral load from the nadir value. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> Virologic breakthrough was defined as two consecutive viral-load measurements of more than 200 copies per milliliter after initial virologic suppression. Exploratory analyses evaluated antiretroviral sensitivity or susceptibility after viral failure or rebound. Details regarding assays for HIV-1 RNA genotype and phenotype, receptor occupancy (i.e., the proportion of CD4 receptors occupied by ibalizumab), CD4-receptor density, serum ibalizumab concentration, and antibodies against ibalizumab are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【26】Study Oversight\n---------------\n\n【27】The trial sponsor (TaiMed Biologics) designed the study and participated in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data and in the writing of the manuscript. Aspects of the protocol, such as the establishment of the primary end point, sample size, and eligibility criteria, were developed in close collaboration with the FDA. The final protocol, all amendments, and written informed-consent documentation were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at each study center. All the authors reviewed and approved the manuscript; the last author made the final decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors had full access to the data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available at NEJM.org). A full description of the study oversight is provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】All the patients who received at least one dose of ibalizumab were included in the safety and efficacy analyses. We performed efficacy analyses at day 14 and week 25 in the intention-to-treat population. According to the FDA-defined Snapshot approach, 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> missing values were imputed as treatment failures, with baseline observations carried forward to replace missing data. We used McNemar’s test to assess the significance of the proportion of patients who had a reduction in viral load. We used paired t-tests to analyze the mean change in viral load and a model of the maximal drug-attributable effect to perform paired measurements of receptor occupancy and the serum level of ibalizumab.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【32】A total of 40 patients received at least one dose of ibalizumab 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. Of these patients, 32 (80%) received all scheduled doses, and 31 (78%) completed all scheduled visits. Of the 9 patients who did not complete the study, 4 died from causes that were not considered by the investigator to be related to ibalizumab treatment (see the Adverse Events subsection) and 1 discontinued treatment because of a serious adverse event (the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome \\[IRIS\\]). Other reasons for discontinuation included withdrawal by a physician, nonadherence to the study-drug regimen, withdrawal of consent, and loss to follow-up.\n\n【33】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the 40 Study Patients at Baseline.\n\n【34】The median age of the patients was 53 years; 15% were female and 55% were white. The median duration of HIV-1 infection was 23 years (range, 2 to 30). Patients had received a median of 10 antiretroviral drugs. At baseline, the mean (±SD) HIV-1 RNA level was 4.5±0.8 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. The mean CD4 count was 150±182 cells per microliter. Most patients (68%) had less than 200 CD4 cells per microliter; 43% had less than 50 per microliter, and 30% had less than 10 per microliter 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【35】In addition to the triple-class resistance that was required for inclusion in the study, 85% of the patients had documented resistance to all the drugs in at least one class, 73% had resistance to all the drugs in at least two classes, 50% had resistance to all the drugs in at least three classes, and 33% had resistance to all the drugs in four classes. Five patients (13%) had documented resistance to all approved antiretroviral agents. A total of 48% of the patients had resistance to all integrase inhibitors. To construct an optimized background regimen with at least one fully susceptible antiretroviral agent, 17 patients (43%) required the addition of an investigational antiretroviral drug (fostemsavir). 删除3:<u><sup><a>30</a></sup></u>\n\n【36】Virologic and CD4 T-Cell Response\n---------------------------------\n\n【37】Table 2.  Table 2. Virologic Response before and after Loading Dose of Ibalizumab and at 25 Weeks in the 40 Study Patients.\n\n【38】In the analysis of the primary efficacy end point performed on day 14, a decrease in viral load of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter occurred in 33 of 40 patients (83%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 67 to 93) during the functional monotherapy period (days 7 to 13), which represented a significant decrease in viral load as compared with the control period (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. During the control period, 1 patient, who had received the optimized background regimen prematurely, had a decrease in viral load of 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. In addition, 24 patients (60%) had a decrease in viral load of at least 1.0 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter during the functional monotherapy period, as compared with no patients during the control period; both mean and median reductions in viral load were 1.1 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. All the patients continued to receive their failing regimen until day 14.\n\n【39】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Virologic and CD4 T-Cell Responses at Week 25.\n\n【40】Shown are values for the HIV-1 viral load and CD4 count in the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population and in subgroups according to the patients’ CD4 count at baseline (<50 cells or ≥50 cells per microliter). Panel A shows the proportion of patients with a viral load of less than 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter or less than 200 copies per milliliter at week 25, with baseline observations carried forward to replace missing data. Panel B shows the mean change in viral load from baseline to week 25 in log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter. Panel C shows the mean change from baseline to week 25 in the CD4 count. In Panels B and C, the T bars indicate standard deviations.\n\n【41】At the end of the maintenance period (week 25), an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter occurred in 17 patients (43%), and a level of less than 200 copies per milliliter occurred in 20 patients (50%); the mean reduction from baseline in the viral load was 1.6 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter, and the median reduction was 1.8 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A and 2B )</u>. Among patients who had less than 50 CD4 cells per microliter at baseline, 7 (18%) had less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter and 10 (24%) had less than 200 copies per milliliter. Conversely, among patients who had a CD4 count of 50 cells or more per microliter at baseline, 24 (61%) had less than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter and 28 (70%) had less than 200 copies per milliliter 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. No clinically meaningful differences in efficacy were identified across subgroups on the basis of age, sex, race, country of residence, or use of an integrase inhibitor or investigational agent (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【42】The mean CD4 count increased from 150 per microliter at baseline (as measured in 40 patients) to 240 per microliter at week 25 (as measured in 27 patients), with a mean increase of 62 per microliter 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>. The increase in the CD4 count was numerically lower in patients who had a baseline CD4 count of less than 50 cells per microliter than in those with a CD4 count of 50 cells or more per microliter (17 and 78 CD4 cells, respectively), but the difference was not significant between subgroups (P=0.44) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>.\n\n【43】Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Features\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【44】The population mean receptor occupancy (the proportion of CD4 receptors that were occupied by ibalizumab) remained at more than 85% throughout the period of study-drug administration. The proportion of patients with at least 85% receptor occupancy was 97% on day 21 and 81% at week 25. Modeling of the maximal drug-attributable effect showed that the EC85 (the drug level required in vitro for 85% receptor occupancy) for the interaction between ibalizumab and CD4 cells was 0.13 μg per milliliter. The mean maximal serum level of ibalizumab, which was observed immediately after ibalizumab loading on day 7, was 567±235 μg per milliliter. The mean serum level of the drug was at least 30 μg per milliliter (thus exceeding the EC85) at all times. The median trough level of the drug was 0.23 μg per milliliter (interquartile range, 0.02 to 12.65) in patients with a body weight of at least 85 kg 删除2:<u>(Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. During the maintenance period, the mean CD4 surface density declined by 10 to 23% from the value at baseline.\n\n【45】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【46】Table 3.  Table 3. Adverse Events in the 40 Study Patients.\n\n【47】During treatment with ibalizumab, at least one adverse event occurred in 32 patients (80%). Most of the adverse events (87%) were mild to moderate in severity, including diarrhea (in 20% of the patients) and nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness (in 13% each) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 11 patients (28%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–defining adverse events occurred in 4 patients (10%). Serious adverse events occurred in 9 patients (23%). Adverse events that resulted in the discontinuation of ibalizumab occurred in 5 patients (13%), including 4 patients (10%) who died during the study. Reasons for death were Kaposi’s sarcoma (in week 24), hepatic failure (in week 22), lymphoma (in week 6), and end-stage AIDS (in week 9), none of which were considered to be related to ibalizumab therapy. Among the patients who died, the baseline CD4 counts were 2, 1, 44, and 3 cells per microliter, respectively. Additional details regarding adverse events are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【48】One serious adverse event, IRIS, was considered to be related to ibalizumab therapy and resulted in discontinuation of the drug. This patient presented with right hemiparesis on day 57 and received a clinical diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with associated IRIS, given the decrease in viral load (from 62,500 copies per milliliter at baseline to undetectable) and the increase in the CD4 count (from 4 cells per microliter at baseline to 16 per microliter) by day 52. Ibalizumab was permanently discontinued in response. At the last follow-up, on day 74, the patient’s condition with respect to PML and IRIS was considered to be stable.\n\n【49】Prespecified adverse events of special interest included rash, hepatotoxicity, cancer, and infusion reactions. Five patients (13%) reported rash: 4 patients reported a single mild or moderate event, and 1 patient reported eight episodes (one of which was severe and was deemed to be related to ibalizumab therapy). No rashes required the discontinuation of treatment or a dose adjustment. There were no reports of hepatotoxicity, ibalizumab-related cancer, infusion-site reaction, or the development of antibodies against ibalizumab.\n\n【50】Virologic Failure\n-----------------\n\n【51】At week 25, 7 patients (18%) had virologic failure; of these patients, 1 also had virologic breakthrough. Three other patients had viral rebound. Resistance testing at the time of virologic failure indicated reduced susceptibility to the optimized background regimen in 3 of 4 patients for whom such tests were available. For the remaining 6 patients with virologic failure or rebound, background-regimen susceptibility could not be fully evaluated because the regimen included an investigational agent.\n\n【52】Among the 10 patients with virologic failure or rebound, 9 showed a lower degree of susceptibility to ibalizumab than at baseline, as measured by maximum percent inhibition. In 8 of the 9 patients, the loss of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the V5 loop of HIV-1 gp120 was the primary genetic change associated with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25,31 </a></sup></u> In the remaining patient, ibalizumab susceptibility was reduced at baseline and was unchanged at the time of virologic failure. A reduced maximum percent inhibition at baseline was not predictive of virologic failure or rebound. Of the 10 patients with virologic failure or rebound, 6 remained in the study through week 25.\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】Although current treatment regimens enable many patients with HIV-1 infection to live with durable viral suppression, highly drug-resistant HIV-1 infection remains an issue for some patients and poses a risk of MDR HIV transmission, including resistance to the integrase inhibitor class. <sup><a>4,5,8,32,33 </a></sup> To construct regimens that are capable of effectively suppressing viral replication, there is a need for new therapies with distinct mechanisms of action and nonoverlapping patterns of resistance. In this study, we found that in patients with MDR HIV-1 infection who have undergone multiple therapies, ibalizumab combined with an optimized background regimen significantly reduced the HIV-1 viral load and increased the CD4 count from baseline.\n\n【55】This registration study was designed to provide open-label ibalizumab to patients with clinically advanced HIV-1 infection who had limited treatment options. In this population, ibalizumab had potent antiviral activity during the functional monotherapy period, with a decrease of at least 0.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter (the primary end point) occurring in 83% of the patients during a 7-day period. Furthermore, in the intention-to-treat analysis, ibalizumab plus the optimized background regimen (including ≥1 additional active agent) significantly reduced the HIV-1 viral load at week 25, with a viral load of less than 50 copies per milliliter reported in 43% of the patients. In parallel, patients had an increase of 62 CD4 cells per microliter, a finding that was consistent with changes associated with other effective antiretroviral combinations in patients who have undergone extensive treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>34-36 </a></sup></u> As expected, patients with a decreased baseline CD4 count had smaller gains in such cells.\n\n【56】On the basis of phase 2 studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> we adopted a loading dose of 2000 mg of ibalizumab, followed by 800 mg every 14 days, starting on day 21, to allow for rapid, sustained ibalizumab exposure. Ibalizumab pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features were consistent with descriptions in previous studies, with the mean CD4-receptor occupancy remaining at more than 85%, a status that was associated with a reduced mean viral load over a 6-month period. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> The trough concentration of ibalizumab decreased at a high body weight, but no reduction in clinical efficacy was evident. Ibalizumab treatment led to modestly reduced surface expression of CD4, which presumably reflected changes in intracellular recycling, a finding that was consistent with the phase 2b results.\n\n【57】Of the 10 patients with virologic failure or rebound, 9 had decreased maximum percent inhibition of ibalizumab at the time of virologic failure, and resistance to agents in the optimized background regimen developed in at least 3 patients. Since a low maximum percent inhibition at baseline was not predictive of treatment efficacy, the reasons for virologic failure or rebound in these patients are unclear. It was unlikely that virologic failure or rebound was caused by inhibitory antibodies, since no patient had detectable antibodies against ibalizumab during the study. In the phase 2b study, low-titer antibodies against ibalizumab developed in 1 patient. Nevertheless, this patient continued to receive ibalizumab and continued to maintain viral suppression.\n\n【58】Diarrhea, the most common adverse event, was mild to moderate in all the patients. There was one ibalizumab-related serious adverse event, IRIS, a condition that is associated with a rapid increase in the CD4 count, with a decrease in viral load, or both. 删除3:<u><sup><a>37,38 </a></sup></u> IRIS is a known concern during the initiation of any potent antiretroviral regimen that is associated with a substantial decline in viral load or increase in the CD4 count. 删除3:<u><sup><a>39 </a></sup></u> Rash occurred in 12.5% of the patients. Most rash events were mild to moderate, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>26-28 </a></sup></u> ; none required the discontinuation of ibalizumab or a dose reduction. The patient who had multiple rash episodes continued to receive ibalizumab and had an undetectable viral load by week 25. There were no infusion-related events. To date, no cancer or infection signals were seen in this or previous studies of ibalizumab. Given the size of current and previous studies, the safety data set is limited, and postapproval safety monitoring is needed.\n\n【59】This study was designed in accordance with FDA guidance to expedite the development of new antiretroviral agents for the treatment of clinically advanced HIV disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> Limitations of the study include its small size, uncontrolled study design (beyond the primary efficacy analysis), and limited time frame for analyzing secondary and safety end points. These constraints reflect the relative scarcity of patients with MDR HIV-1 infection, along with their advanced disease and associated treatment challenges. Given these considerations, ibalizumab has been designated as an orphan drug by the FDA. 删除3:<u><sup><a>40 </a></sup></u> The inclusion of 7 days of current background therapy followed by 7 days of ibalizumab monotherapy before the initiation of an optimized background regimen provided a historical comparator and a short-term assessment of ibalizumab antiviral activity to forestall the risk of viral resistance. Through week 25, we assessed the safety of treatment and the durability of virologic and immunologic responses. Patients in our study who continued to receive therapy could enroll in an extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02707861 . opens in new tab ) to follow the effects of ibalizumab plus an optimized background regimen during a 48-week period. All eligible patients opted to continue in the follow-up study.\n\n【60】In the event of resistance-related treatment failure, HIV treatment guidelines recommend the initiation of new regimens with at least two fully active agents. 删除3:<u><sup><a>41 </a></sup></u> The availability of a CD4-directed postattachment HIV-1 inhibitor with nonoverlapping resistance provides an opportunity to construct a regimen to suppress the viral load and maintain immune status.\n\n【61】In conclusion, in this phase 3 study involving patients with MDR HIV-1 infection, we found that ibalizumab combined with an optimized background regimen had antiviral and immunologic activity. Our findings also showed the feasibility and acceptability of twice-monthly intravenous administration of an antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Presented in part at IDWeek, New Orleans, October 26–30, 2016, and at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Seattle, February 13–16, 2017.</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Orphan Products Clinical Trials Grants Program of the Food and Drug Administration and TaiMed Biologics .</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>We thank the study participants, their families, and all the investigators and study staff members; David Ho, M.D., for a critical reading of the manuscript; and Michelle Po, Ph.D., Louis Barbier, M.Sc., John Ashkenas, Ph.D., and Zvi Cohen, Ph.D., for their writing and editorial assistance with earlier versions of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>From the Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT (B.E.); Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (J.F.) and Quest Clinical Research (S.

Brian Byrd on the recall of products containing angiotensin-receptor blockers and the implications for patient care. (12:19) Download\n\n【4】Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are one of four drug classes recommended for the initial treatment of hypertension. These medications are commonly used not only for hypertension — a condition present in 45.6% of U.S. adults — but also for heart failure and chronic kidney disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> On January 25, 2019, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and Director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Janet Woodcock released a statement updating the public on large-scale voluntary recalls of various products containing ARBs. Two probable carcinogens had been identified in active pharmaceutical ingredients used by some manufacturers of valsartan, irbesartan, and losartan. The impurities arose during manufacture of the ingredients in two factories located in China and India. The same day, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that as many as 2 million patients had probably been exposed to the impurities, _N_ \\-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and _N_ \\-nitroso- _N_ \\-diethylamine (NDEA). Most recently, a third impurity, _N_ \\-nitroso- _N_ \\-methyl-4-aminobutyric acid (NMBA), has been identified in an ARB product, resulting in a new recall. These recalls are of growing concern to patients, clinicians, and organizations delivering primary care or complex, multidisciplinary health care, and they highlight several issues related to the readiness of our health systems to respond to drug recalls, trust between patients and providers, uncertain drug-dose equivalences, and the regulation of drug manufacturing in the global marketplace.\n\n【5】 Recalls of Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers.\n\n【6】The first phase of recalls involved the genotoxic impurity NDMA (in blue), the second involved NDEA (in green), and the most recent involved NMBA (in orange). Company names refer to the manufacturer and are not always the same as the distributor. HCTZ denotes hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n【7】Although not all products containing valsartan, irbesartan, or losartan that are marketed in the United States have been recalled, the scope of the exposure, the scale of the 20 recalls, and their impact on patient care are substantial (see timeline ). FDA officials believe that U.S. patients have been ingesting ARBs containing carcinogenic impurities for approximately 4 years; they estimate that for every 8000 patients taking the highest dose of an affected product for the full 4 years, one new cancer above the background incidence would be expected. More than 61 million prescriptions were written for valsartan, irbesartan, or losartan in the United States in 2016. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In addition to the recall of millions of bottles of pills, at least 1.9 U.S. tons of active pharmaceutical ingredients were recalled by one manufacturer. One third of all FDA drug recalls issued since July 2018 have involved ARB-containing products, and together the recalls have affected one sixth of U.S. ARB manufacturers.\n\n【8】The compounds triggering these recalls are known as genotoxic impurities because they have the potential to damage DNA. The FDA found NDMA in affected valsartan products in concentrations ranging from 300 to 20,000 ng per tablet, and in December 2018, the FDA announced that it had set interim acceptable limits of NDMA (96 ng per day) and NDEA (26.5 ng per day), which they estimate would confer a 1 in 100,000 risk of causing cancer after 70 years of exposure ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm613916.htm . opens in new tab ). FDA officials believe that a change in the process used by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Zhejiang Huahai to manufacture active ingredients resulted in the inclusion of impurities.\n\n【9】Medicinal chemist and _Science Translational Medicine_ blogger Derek Lowe has shed light on the recalls, highlighting that often a few manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients are responsible for supplying all the companies that use them to make pills. These manufacturers will then sometimes sell those pills to other companies for repackaging. Lowe also describes a technical process that may have caused the impurities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Zhejiang Huahai has patented a method of manufacturing tetrazoles, a chemical group present in valsartan, irbesartan, and losartan and common to certain other ARBs and additional drug products. The European Medicines Agency and other experts have identified the reaction of dimethylamine and sodium nitrite under acidic conditions in synthesizing tetrazole groups as a potential source of NDMA. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> The finding of NMBA as an impurity or contaminant in an ARB product is very recent, and the FDA investigation is ongoing.\n\n【10】Although some products containing valsartan, irbesartan, or losartan remain commercially available in the United States, patients and the health care system have paid a steep price beyond the health concerns and anxiety arising from exposure to recalled products. Some unaffected manufacturers have increased valsartan prices twofold, threefold, or even more. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> The lack of selected ARB products has also placed pressure on the supply chain for nonrecalled ARBs.\n\n【11】Though the FDA pinpoints a specific formulation and manufacturer in each recall, the dissemination of, and response to, FDA reports is uneven. Patients and clinicians may hear about recalls through the news media, social media, pharmacies, health care providers, or friends. Moreover, the public may hear about a recall of a “hypertension drug” but not know the specific product and manufacturer. Thus, recalls may trigger unnecessary concern among many people receiving antihypertensive therapy — and may be ignored by people who take ARBs for heart failure or chronic kidney disease. The burden of response has fallen to clinicians, pharmacies, and health care systems, most of which lack the infrastructure or resources to respond promptly to patients’ concerns.\n\n【12】Meanwhile, clinicians switching patients from one ARB to another are faced with the challenge of selecting an equipotent dose using a different formulation or active ingredient, often without adequate data from studies directly comparing drugs within the class. As a result, to avoid hyperkalemia, hypotension, undertreated hypertension, and harmful drug–drug interactions, additional laboratory tests and patient communications or visits have been required to assess safety and efficacy. As recalls have emerged slowly over this 6-month period, some clinicians have switched patients from a drug that was recalled early (valsartan) to one that was recalled later (irbesartan or losartan); the requisite additional switches have further undermined patients’ confidence in their clinician, their health care system, the drug supply chain, or all of the above.\n\n【13】FDA officials have stated that the agency began checking all active ARB ingredients and medicines marketed in the United States for impurities. It is not yet clear whether manufacturers also used a synthesis process that risks introducing genotoxic impurities into products containing olmesartan or candesartan; the chemical structures of these ARBs also contain a tetrazole ring. The task of determining which products might be affected by unsafe tetrazole-synthesis methods is daunting, and the effort will have to be global in scale.\n\n【14】The ARB recalls demonstrate the FDA’s effectiveness in tracking the distribution of products within an increasingly complex supply chain of active pharmaceutical ingredients to their destinations throughout the United States. A larger challenge is inspection of the more than 80% of registered ingredient manufacturers that are located outside the United States. The FDA has taken steps to prepare for the ongoing globalization of drug manufacturing: it now has offices in China, India, Europe, and Latin America, and its Office of Regional and Country Affairs is responsible for additional Asian countries, as well as Canada, Australia, the Middle East, and African countries. In 2015, for the first time, the agency conducted more foreign than domestic inspections.\n\n【15】Nevertheless, the series of ARB recalls is a stress test for the FDA and for the capacity of health systems to respond to problems in the drug supply chain. Health systems would do well to assess their response to the recalls. Often, neither the prescriber nor the patient knows which manufacturer’s product will be available at the pharmacy, so physicians must rely on pharmacies to ensure that they are not distributing a recalled product. Health systems and physicians may therefore have limited insight into the number of their patients who are affected.\n\n【16】The ARB recalls provide an opportunity for the FDA, pharmacies, and health systems to evaluate all aspects of the response, from timely identification of potential impurities, to removal of recalled lots, to helping patients navigate the complexities of prescription changes, to monitoring them for adverse events after these changes are made. We can hope that efforts of the FDA and other regulatory agencies will prevent the need for future recalls, but health systems and care providers should prepare themselves for what will happen if they don’t.\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on March 13, 2019, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>From the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, and the University of Michigan Hypertension Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (J.B.B.); and the Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, and the Stanford Hypertension Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA (G.M.C., V.B.).</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 109KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【25】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

I’m Rachel Gotbaum.\n\n【6】Today, we have the second part of our special series on Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci left the NIH in December after 54 years there. He has worked in seven U.S. administrations, and he’s been a major force in the fight against infectious diseases. We sat down with him to find out what has driven Anthony Fauci all these years. It turns out, it all starts and ends with his patients.\n\n【7】Let’s just go back a little bit. Tell me a little bit about your upbringing and why you decided you were going to be a doctor.\n\n【8】_Anthony Fauci_ : My father was a pharmacist, but back then, you know I was — I’m 82 years old, so I was born in 1940, right before the World War. I went to elementary school in the late ’40s, early ’50s. I went to high school in the ’50s. At that time, the pharmacies were sort of the neighborhood doctor’s office. They were referred to as “Doc,” when you go into a pharmacy. People who either didn’t have a doctor or who couldn’t afford to \\[see a\\] doctor would come in and talk to my father about everything from family problems to psychological issues. So he was kind of like the triage family doc of the neighborhood, and he never worried about making money out of the pharmacy. In fact, we barely were able to keep things together if I hadn’t won scholarships to high school and college and medical school.\n\n【9】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So as a child, and as you grew up, you observed your father at his pharmacy. What did you experience then?\n\n【10】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, I saw what someone who cares about someone, what impact that has on the person. When someone would come in to my father’s drugstore, not to buy an aspirin or to buy a cosmetic, or the other things that are sold in pharmacies, but came in with a problem, and my father would call them into the back of the store, where he was mixing, compounding — a lot of the prescriptions back then in the ’40s and ’50s were compounded by the pharmacist, as opposed to today. He would sit down and have a conversation with the person. It would usually be someone in their family was ill, or they were feeling poorly, or they were seeing a doctor but they had a disease that was progressing.\n\n【11】He would, in a very soft, caring, empathetic way, talk it out with them. And I could see the effect that he had on them because he cared. That, to me, is — when you elevate it a bit to the point where not only do you care, but you actually can do something as a physician — that, to me, just cemented it in me that I wanted to be a doctor.\n\n【12】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Well, let’s talk a little bit about that. Obviously, your career isn’t what you had planned. What did you envision would be your career going into medical school?\n\n【13】_Anthony Fauci_ : Yeah. Oh, I was firm. I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to finish my residency. I wanted to go down to the NIH for 3 years to learn and get my boards in infectious diseases and clinical immunology. I wanted to go back to the New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center, which is now Weill Cornell, and do a chief residency and do what was the standard back then: go from your chief residency into private practice in one of the private practices that are strewn along First Avenue, Second Avenue, Park Avenue in the ’60s and ’70s, which is where the physicians who were the senior attendings on the wards when I was a student, when I was an intern, when I was a resident, when I was chief resident, so I wanted to be like them.\n\n【14】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : You envisioned yourself hanging up your shingle on the East Side?\n\n【15】_Anthony Fauci_ : And works in a teaching capacity as an attending at the New York Hospital. I didn’t mean just sitting in an office and only doing that. I’m talking about being the attending for a month or two of the year, making rounds in the morning, taking care of really sick patients that required hospitalization rather than just a complete office practice.\n\n【16】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : And you went to the NIH, and there was this nascent field of human immunology, and you began to use cancer drugs. Nobody used cancer drugs for noncancer patients then. Let’s talk about what happened for you there, what was that like and who these patients were.\n\n【17】_Anthony Fauci_ : I went down there as an infectious disease fellow, but as part of the training, you were part of the infectious disease consultant for the rest of the institutes, the most important institute of which was the National Cancer Institute, because obviously, they were developing the cancer chemotherapies that were inducing remissions in Hodgkin’s disease and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. So they were really blasting patients with combinations, things that included a drug called cyclophosphamide. We went up there and would do infectious disease consultations, simultaneously putting me in charge of a group of patients that had an inflammatory vasculitides, particularly patients which was then called Wegener’s granulomatosis. What happened is that we had people who had had an aberrant autoinflammatory response. They were being treated with steroids alone, the known anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive drug, and 98% of the patients died. So we were in a very desperate situation.\n\n【18】We got the idea when we were making rounds on the patients in Cancer Institute, because we were called up there in order to do an infectious disease consult because they would get blasted with chemotherapy to kill the cancer. They had the secondary effect, unwanted but inevitable, of wiping out your bone marrow, which put you at a high risk of an opportunistic infection. What it was is that it was all or none with the cancer drug. The idea we had is we don’t want an all-or-none phenomenon. We want to lower the level of immune competence, but we don’t want to lower it so much — when it gets below a certain level, the risk of an opportunistic infection leading to perhaps death is high. So how do you treat someone who has an inflammatory disease, not a cancer, with a cancer drug? You do it with a dose that’s low enough to hopefully suppress the aberrant immune response, but not strong enough to make the white count go below the critical level. Almost miraculously, 93% of the individuals went into complete remission of their disease.\n\n【19】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Can you just explain to the listeners, people thought you were nuts. This was revolutionary, and also people advised you against it.\n\n【20】_Anthony Fauci_ : My response to them was, “What is the mortality rate of the disease? 98%. OK, so if you don’t treat them with something daring and bold, they’re going to die anyway.” And when you’re dealing with a disease that’s inevitably fatal, you have to be bold. You can’t sit back and just business as usual, that you could almost predict is not going to work. So what’s your choice? Try something that might seem eyebrow raising, but in fact, if you do it correctly, almost miraculously, 93%, they were all one after the other going into remission, one after the other after the other. Then everybody went from criticism to, “Oh my God, you’ve done it. You’ve actually induced a formally lethal disease into remission.”\n\n【21】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : You’d been at the NIH for about 13 years when America became aware of a new epidemic, which didn’t have a name at first and then became AIDS. I saw your official report of the epidemic in the CDC’S _Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report_ was published on June 5, 1981. Do you remember what went through your mind when you were learning about this?\n\n【22】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, it took place in two phases, because the first MMWR came out in June. That was five otherwise previously healthy young gay men who presented in Los Angeles with pneumocystis pneumonia. And I saw that, I said, “Boy, this must be a fluke. They probably ingested some drugs, some popper of somewhat to enhance sexual satisfaction, and that maybe suppressed their immune response.” I thought it was going to be a one-off. Then exactly 1 month later, in July of 1981, there was the second MMWR — this time, 26 otherwise previously healthy young, curiously all gay men, not only from Los Angeles but from San Francisco and New York City, who not only had pneumocystis but had Kaposi sarcoma and a number of other opportunistic infections.\n\n【23】When I saw that second MMWR, that changed my life. I said, “Oh my God, this is a brand new disease.” There’re no such thing as brand new diseases, but this is a brand new disease. I made a decision then that, again, even my mentors discouraged me from doing that. Because they’ve said, “Why? You’re on the peak of this incredible trajectory. What are you doing?” I said, “I’m going to turn around and pivot completely the direction of my career and focus entirely on studying this mysterious disease without a name.” That’s when I just laid down one spear and picked up another.\n\n【24】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Let’s talk about that time. The patients you cared for you were unable to save. What was that like for you, and how did it inform your career?\n\n【25】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, it was the darkest period of my professional career. It was the contrast from what I had been doing up to that point. From 1972 until 1981, my career was on a very, very sharp upward trajectory. All of my patients who thought they were going to die, when they got on my protocol, more than 90% of them went into remission. So it was all good news. In other words, you walk into a room, you tell the patient’s mother, their wife, their husband, “Everything is going to be OK, we’ll put them on my protocol. There’s 90% chance they’re going to do fine.” And 90-plus percent of them actually did really very well. Then all of a sudden you go into a cohort of patients where no matter what you did, virtually, with few exceptions, every single one of them died, a very difficult, painful death.\n\n【26】You’d try to treat the opportunistic infections, but it was like putting a bandaid on a hemorrhage because it was whack-a-mole. Their immune system was destroyed by this unknown virus. You would treat them for one opportunistic infection, and then another one would pop up, and then another one, until finally one would kill them. It was one of those things where it is very tough when you care about patients — getting back to what I said a bit ago of what drove me into medicine is not only to care _for_ your patients, but to _care_ for your patients. Generally, when you’re doing something positive, you make rounds, you see the patients get better and better every day. It was totally the opposite with HIV. You’d make rounds on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. By the time you got to Friday, they were much worse on Friday than they were on Monday. They were wasting away because of uncontrollable diarrhea. They had pneumocystis, they had Kaposi sarcoma that completely disfigured them, and really had both a physical and a terrible psychological effect on them, and that’s all you did every single day, one room to the other.\n\n【27】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : I want to talk about how that experience, the patients, and starting to get therapies led to you working closely with the same AIDS activists who were parading around with not so flattering effigies of you on the streets, and surrounding your offices to protest the lack of attention to this deadly virus.\n\n【28】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, the interaction with the activists was really transformational, without a doubt. By transformational, I mean that we were in an era where the biomedical research and regulatory authorities had an approach towards clinical trials and the testing of drugs that were time honored and worked well for a lot of other diseases. But HIV/AIDS was very, very different, because you had a disease that had no therapy and was killing virtually everyone. What the activist community wanted to do was to gain the attention of these so-called highfalutin’ scientists and regulatory people to allow them to have a voice in the design of the clinical trial and the scientific agenda and the push to even get more resources. The scientific community and the regulatory community ran away from them, because they were very provocative, they were very disruptive, they were very iconoclastic. And they were that way because nobody was listening to them.\n\n【29】So the empathy in me really came out and I said to myself, “Instead of running away from these people and rejecting them because of how disruptive they were, even when they’re putting your head on a spike and saying, ‘Fauci, you’re killing us,’ and yada ya, and just stop and listen for a moment to what they were saying.” When you listen to what they were saying, it absolutely made perfect sense. I said to myself, “Holy mackerel, if I were in their shoes, I would be doing exactly what they were doing.” And that opened the dialogue.\n\n【30】So instead of becoming confrontational, we actually sat down and spoke about what it was that they wanted, what kind of a seat at the table did they want? What kind of an influence on the pharmaceutical companies and on the regulatory process would they want? And we didn’t all of a sudden become kumbaya on the first week, or month, or year. It was a gradual process of first complete antagonism and confrontation that led to “Well, let’s at least talk,” to “Hey, you’re making sense,” to “Hey, our goals are about the same. We’re just coming at it from different angles,” to “Let’s cooperate and collaborate,” to “Hey, we kind of like each other.” That’s when we became friends, which now to this day, the very activists that were disrupting the NIH campus and the FDA campus are some of my closest personal friends now, 40 years later.\n\n【31】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : And what happened here, where the patient voice was suddenly involved, suddenly a part of regulatory, of approval, of clinical trials — how did that change the way we do business today?\n\n【32】_Anthony Fauci_ : It added another dimension to it. Remember, there were certain criteria that the FDA, I believe, does a very good job at, of making sure they get interventions in the forms of drugs, and vaccines, and diagnostics to the American public in a way that is based in science but also effective and safe. They do a good job on that. However, what the activist lent to that was an appreciation of the need, given the circumstance of the disease, to have a greater degree of flexibility to access. And that’s where the concept of “compassionate use” came in. Compassionate use became an established paradigm during the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\n【33】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : I want to understand about PEPFAR, the President’s Plan for AIDS Relief, established in 2003. This was a game changer for American health policy. Before PEPFAR, you made your first trips to Africa, where so many people were dying of AIDS, even though in the U.S. we had many years of antiretroviral treatment that enabled most people to live with HIV. Tell us about those visits and what you saw and what happened.\n\n【34】_Anthony Fauci_ : It was an evolution over multiple visits. In 1996, the first reports of the triple combination, which was, the core drug of that was the protease inhibitor, did something that we had not seen before. Namely, it brought the level of virus to below detectable and sustained it at below detectable, leading to what became known as the Lazarus effect. People essentially could lead lives that were approaching normal. It became very clear to me that when I would go to Africa, I would make rounds with my colleagues in places like Uganda, and South Africa, and places like that, and I would make rounds, and I would see wards full of persons with HIV, with the doctors standing around the bedside that gave me a déjà vu. Back then, I was watching all my patients die because we did not have any drugs. Not that we had drugs and we’re not giving it to them — we didn’t have any drugs.\n\n【35】Then fast-forward, 2000, 2001, 2002, I go to Africa, and I’m making rounds on the ward when we have plenty of drugs for the developed world. And those same docs, they’re in the same painful situation I was in the 1980s, where their patients are dying in front of them and they can’t do anything except maybe treat one or two of the opportunistic infections. Over that period of time, it became clear to me that we have to do something. Simultaneously, the president of the United States also felt that way. The president was George W. Bush, and he called me in, together with Tommy Thompson, who was the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. And we went to Africa on a fact-finding mission at the time that a drug that could be given in a single dose to a pregnant woman at the time of labor and to the child right after birth could diminish dramatically the transmission of mother to child of HIV infection.\n\n【36】I went down there and looked around and spoke to a bunch of people and felt that if we could get $500 million, we could probably get enough drug that we could literally stop mother-to-child transmission, which was a big, big problem. I came back in April of 2002 and I presented that to President Bush, and he liked it and he said, “This is a great idea. Let’s go ahead and do it.” I thought that was it, job done, finish, go home back. But that wasn’t finished, because as soon as we finished presenting, as we were getting ready to break up, he grabbed Josh Bolton, who was his deputy chief of staff at the time, and he brought me over, and he said, “Listen, this is a great plan, but I want something much more transforming and accountable. And I want to have it so that it’s beyond just mother-to-child transmission.”\n\n【37】And he said, “because we really do have a moral responsibility that people should not die of a disease that you can treat and prevent only because of where they happen to live.” So with that as the marching order, I went back to my office in Bethesda, Maryland. And we started putting together the plan that I wasn’t sure he was going to accept, because it was going to cost $15 billion over t years to treat 2 million people, prevent 7 million infections, and care for 10 million people. I put the plan in front of the president, and he bought it. He said, “We’re going to announce it at the State of the Union address.” That’s what he did on January 28, 2003, and that’s how we had PEPFAR.\n\n【38】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : The AIDS epidemic marked the beginning of your role, really, in the political world. You advised seven presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, who, by the way, didn’t mention the word HIV or AIDS for much of his presidency. What did you learn about advocacy in working politically to make real changes happen among those that held the most power?\n\n【39】_Anthony Fauci_ : Yeah, the first thing is to stick with the science. You’re a scientist. You’re going to get involved in policy, but don’t get involved in politics. There’s a big difference between policy and politics. Stay out of that realm of politics. If you’re going to be successfully advising seven presidents, and they’re not all going to be Democrats and they’re not all going to be Republicans. You’re going to have to deal with both sides of the aisle at the executive level. I stuck with the science and I stayed out of any ideology. Everything I did, every advice I gave to whether it was Ronald Reagan, or George H.W. Bush, or Clinton, or George W. Bush, or Obama, or Trump, or Biden, or any of the others, it was just give them the advice based on science, knowing full well that when you’re dealing with a moving target like HIV, or a real moving target like Covid, the science is going to direct you to change your opinion, change your recommendation, change your advice according to what the current scientific approach towards a particular disease is showing you with regard to evidence and data.\n\n【40】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : But I guess what I’m wondering, when you went to the White House, if you will, and you’re hearing pushback, bad policy about to happen, people may be about to be hurt by it. How do you square with that, or how did you square with that?\n\n【41】_Anthony Fauci_ : Just like I said, you stick with the science, because it was only in that very unique situation that I was in during one of the administrations that things were said that were not true, and they were not based on science. And I felt that I had a responsibility, for my own personal and professional integrity, to do something that was very uncomfortable. I have an extraordinary amount of respect for the office of the presidency. It’s not fun. It doesn’t feel good to have to get up at a press conference in front of many, many, many millions of people watching it and to essentially contradict the president. Because somebody sitting in the rows in the press asked you a question, you’ve got to give the right answer, even though it’s contradictory to what the president just said. I didn’t like that, but I had to do it, and I had to do it because of my responsibility to the American public. My responsibility is not to a political party and not to a president, it’s to the American public. That, obviously, created an extraordinary amount of enmity, even to the point of hate of me in certain segments in the population.\n\n【42】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : How was the Covid-19 virus different from anything that you had ever dealt with before in your career?\n\n【43】_Anthony Fauci_ : It was truly a global pandemic of a virus that we had never had any experience with. It was a moving target, because never would we have imagined that we would have a burst of a global infection, which everyone thought would peak when the winter was over, it would go away, similar to other outbreaks. That was not the case. It was unprecedented in every respect. We had the evolution of different variants. We’re into our fourth year now of the outbreak, that is completely unprecedented. It wound up killing over a million Americans. We’ve never experienced that before since 1918 with the pandemic flu. There was some good news about all of this, is the incredible rapidity in which we developed a vaccine that was highly effective and safe. Now, we have a virus that requires boosting of the vaccine in order to keep the level of protection against severe disease very high.\n\n【44】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : It’s no secret that this pandemic has fueled a growing war against you personally. Death threats on you and your family, pummeling by lawmakers, including President Trump, hate messaging on social media and beyond, lawsuits. How have you been able to navigate this?\n\n【45】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, you just do it. It is what it is. There’s nothing that you’re going to change. You’re not going to change society. You’ve got to live with it and stick by your principles. Stick by being truthful. Don’t get involved in conspiracy theory. People are going to say crazy things, and they do that every single day. If you focus on that, you get distracted from your job, and that’s not what you want to do, because then the conspiracy theorists win. Do your job, stick with the science, and that’s it.\n\n【46】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : What do you see as the future of the Covid pandemic, in terms of what life will be like and what is needed moving forward?\n\n【47】_Anthony Fauci_ : When you look at what we have in society now, we have enough people that have been infected, enough people that have been vaccinated and boosted that unless we get a big surprise, like a variant that’s way, way, way different than what we’re seeing right now, I think we’re going to gradually enter into a situation where the level of infection is going to get low enough that it won’t be disruptive of the social order. Right now, 500 deaths a day is not that level that I would find acceptable. I think we’ve got to get much lower than that. I don’t think that there’s a chance that we’re going to eradicate it, and I don’t think we’re going to eliminate it. We’re going to have it around. But hopefully, by a combination of vaccination, booster, hybrid immunity, and even treatment of infections of people, that we can lower the threat of this to the point where it doesn’t disrupt us. That’s where I think we’re going to be pretty soon.\n\n【48】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : What do you still hope to accomplish in your career and your life?\n\n【49】_Anthony Fauci_ : I hope to inspire our younger generation to get into science and public health and public service. I’m not proud of, nor do I brag about, the fact that I haven’t taken a vacation in literally decades. That’s not a good thing. That’s not a positive thing. But I really feel that I want to, and I’m ready to be able to take a little bit more time off, particularly spending time with my wife, go on a trip with my wife, and perhaps even with my whole family. The people who are my dear, close friends always advise me and still to this day say, “Don’t overcommit. Now’s not the time to overcommit.” I have to keep sort of hearing that refrain in my mind over and over again when people ask me to do things.\n\n【50】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Right. Because it’s definitely not in your DNA, for sure.\n\n【51】_Anthony Fauci_ : No, I have to fight my own — I have to suppress the gene expression.\n\n【52】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Good luck on that one. I’d like to end by going back to your patients, Dr. Fauci, where all this began from the very first ones at NIH in the late 1960s with autoimmune diseases, to those with HIV, Ebola, Covid. What can researchers, clinicians, policymakers, all of us learn from your years caring for those patients and how that’s fueled all that you’ve done over this extraordinary career of yours — a career that continues to touch so many of our lives? What do you want us all to take away from that work?\n\n【53】_Anthony Fauci_ : Well, there are many career paths that people follow. What I would like people to realize, science is a wonderful discipline. It opens up vistas of understanding and roadways to intervention for things that you never would imagine. That if you keep working at it, you succeed. That what was available for us in the field of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines when I first started compared to what we have right now, is just extraordinary. It’s breathtaking, the advances that have been made. So I like to encourage people, if they have any inclination to go into this field, that it can be extraordinarily gratifying for yourself and contributory to society.\n\n【54】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : That’s Dr. Anthony Fauci, who retired from the NIH after 54 years there, 38 of them running the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n【55】Dr. Fauci, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n【56】_Anthony Fauci_ : My pleasure. It’s good to be with you.\n\n【57】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : This is “Intention to Treat” from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ . Next time, AI in medicine — it’s considered the new frontier. Computer algorithms that help doctors do their job better and improve the health of their patients. But who do these algorithms actually serve?\n\n【58】_Speaker 3_ : Bias in AI is really this dirty secret of health care. We think AI is going to solve our problems, but real-world bias will be replicated in AI and scaled at a level we haven’t seen before. We’re going to end up with not only the same problem of disparities, but widening it.\n\n【59】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : That’s next time on “Intention to Treat” from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ . I’m Rachel Gotbaum.\n\n【60】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【61】Dr. Fauci reports having no potential financial conflicts of interest.\n\n【62】Citing Article _(1)_\n--------------------\n\n【63】Close Citing Articles", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Nonpregnant women with epilepsy were enrolled as controls and had similar follow-up during an 18-month period. The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a higher frequency of seizures that impaired awareness during epoch 1 than during epoch 2. We also compared changes in the doses of antiepileptic drugs that were administered in the two groups during the first 9 months of epoch 1.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We enrolled 351 pregnant women and 109 controls with epilepsy. Among the 299 pregnant women and 93 controls who had a history of seizures that impaired awareness and who had available data for the two epochs, seizure frequency was higher during epoch 1 than during epoch 2 in 70 pregnant women (23%) and in 23 controls (25%) (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.60). During pregnancy, the dose of an antiepileptic drug was changed at least once in 74% of pregnant women and in 31% of controls (odds ratio, 6.36; 95% CI, 3.82 to 10.59).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among women with epilepsy, the percentage who had a higher incidence of seizures during pregnancy than during the postpartum period was similar to that in women who were not pregnant during the corresponding epochs. Changes in doses of antiepileptic drugs occurred more frequently in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women during similar time periods. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; MONEAD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01730170 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The treatment of women with epilepsy during pregnancy requires a balance between maintaining stable control of maternal seizures and the potential adverse effects of some antiepileptic drugs on the developing fetus. Convulsive seizures are dangerous to both the mother and fetus as a result of blunt trauma and hypoxemia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Several studies have reported a higher incidence of maternal death among pregnant women with epilepsy than among other pregnant women, with up to 79% of epilepsy-related deaths attributed to sudden, unexpected death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> Ranges of an increased frequency of seizures during pregnancy have varied from 14 to 62%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-9 </a></sup></u> The practice guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology concluded there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the changes in seizure frequency are related to pregnancy itself, because studies have not included an appropriate nonpregnant comparator group to provide data on the natural course of seizure frequency in both groups of women with epilepsy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】We conducted the Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study to evaluate six goals regarding women with epilepsy during pregnancy and outcomes in their infants. The first of these goals was to determine whether women with epilepsy have a higher frequency of seizures during pregnancy than when they are not pregnant. Here, as part of achieving the first goal, we report the results of a study involving women with epilepsy to determine whether the percentage who had a higher frequency of seizures during pregnancy than they did during the postpartum period was greater than the percentage of nonpregnant women during the same time period. We also compared changes in the dose of antiepileptic drugs among pregnant women and nonpregnant women and assessed the risk factors for an increased seizure frequency during pregnancy.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】This ongoing prospective, observational, parallel-group study is being conducted at 20 epilepsy centers in the United States that have a specialty focus on the treatment of women with epilepsy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Included in the study are pregnant women with epilepsy and a control cohort of nonpregnant women with epilepsy between the ages of 14 and 45 years. Exclusion criteria for the two groups include an expectation that the patient would have a hard-to-measure or substantially altered frequency of seizures (e.g., the presence of progressive cerebral disease, planned surgical intervention for epilepsy, a history of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, or drug or alcohol abuse in the previous year) or features that were expected to alter other primary outcomes of the study (e.g., >20 weeks of gestation in the pregnant group, an intelligence quotient of less than 70, or a change in the dose of an antiepileptic drug that occurred before enrollment during pregnancy or in the 90 days before enrollment in the control group). Additional details regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【16】The study was approved by the institutional review board at each study site. From December 2012 through January 2016, we recruited women by distributing brochures, posting flyers at health centers, sending letters to referring physicians, and distributing business cards during clinical visits. Most of the women in the two study groups were patients of the epilepsy clinics at the study sites. The antiepileptic-drug treatment was determined by each woman’s clinical team throughout the study. All the women provided written informed consent.\n\n【17】Study Evaluations\n-----------------\n\n【18】We conducted study visits for the pregnant women three times during pregnancy, during hospitalization for labor and delivery, and every 3 months through 9 months during the postpartum period (total evaluation period, 18 months). Women in the control group participated in the same number of visits as the pregnant women. Gestational age was calculated on the basis of the estimated due date, and the first study visit could be scheduled up to 20 weeks of gestation to enhance recruitment. Visits during the second and third trimesters were scheduled between 21 and 27 weeks and between 30 and 36 weeks, respectively. When the first visit occurred within the second trimester, the next visit was separated by at least 4 weeks.\n\n【19】The control group was composed of women who had characteristics that were similar to those of the pregnant women with respect to age, educational status, race, seizure type, seizure frequency, seizure-freedom rate, drug category (monotherapy vs. polytherapy), and type of antiepileptic drug received. After 20% of women had been recruited, the members of the study executive team performed a weekly review of the characteristics of the women in the two groups to ensure balance on the basis of these factors. An enrollment restriction was enacted in July 2013 when an imbalance was detected, with closure of enrollment to nonpregnant women in the control group who were receiving antiepileptic-drug polytherapy.\n\n【20】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Study Design.\n\n【21】Among both pregnant and nonpregnant (control) women who were enrolled in the study, the primary outcome was determined by the incidence of seizures that impaired awareness during epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2. Among pregnant women, enrollment (visit 1) occurred at a gestational age of 20 weeks or less. Visits during the second and third trimesters were scheduled between 21 and 27 weeks and between 30 and 36 weeks, respectively. When the first visit occurred within the second trimester, the next visit was separated by at least 4 weeks.\n\n【22】The main comparisons in the study required the definition of two epochs. Among the pregnant women, epoch 1 included pregnancy (enrollment date through delivery) and the peripartum period, which was defined as the 6 weeks after birth (total, 10.5 months). We combined the peripartum period with pregnancy because studies have suggested that the period within the first 6 weeks after birth may be associated with an increased risk of seizures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Epoch 2 included the period from 6 weeks to 9 months after birth (total, 7.5 months). For women in the control group, epoch 1 began at the time of enrollment and extended through the following 10.5 months, and epoch 2 included the following 7.5 months 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【23】At the first study visit, we collected data regarding the demographic characteristics of the women, along with a general medical history and detailed epilepsy history, including the age of onset, seizure type, history of epilepsy risk factors, and previous results on imaging and electroencephalography. Site investigators classified seizures and epilepsy syndromes using the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Members of the epilepsy classification core committee validated the types of seizures and forms of epilepsy in each woman.\n\n【24】The study participants used an electronic-diary smartphone application ( www.irody.com . opens in new tab ) to submit daily information regarding the type and frequency of seizures, the type and dose of medication, and their adherence to the drug regimen. Site coordinators reviewed the electronic-diary entries with the participants at study visits, verified changes in drug type or dose, and entered any missing electronic-diary entries into a seizure log.\n\n【25】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【26】The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a higher frequency of seizures that impaired awareness during epoch 1 than during epoch 2. The percentages of women with this outcome were then compared in the two groups. Although all seizure types were investigated, seizures that impaired awareness were selected as the primary outcome because of their potential for adverse clinical consequences. The frequency of seizures was normalized to a 28-day rate for time periods that were analyzed (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org).\n\n【27】Secondary outcomes were the percentage of women who had an increased frequency of seizures in each trimester and in the peripartum period, the percentage who had an increased frequency of other seizure types, the percentage who had a change in the dose of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy, the within-person change in the 28-day incidence of seizures, and the percentage of women who had seizures or convulsions during epoch 1 among those who were seizure-free or convulsion-free during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment. Among the pregnant women, we also evaluated risk factors for an increased frequency of seizures during epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2. For this evaluation, we selected four risk factors of interest: freedom from seizures during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment, seizure type, medication category (monotherapy vs. polytherapy), and medication category plus drug group (lamotrigine monotherapy, levetiracetam monotherapy, polytherapy with levetiracetam plus lamotrigine, and other monotherapy or polytherapy).\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】We determined that the enrollment of 350 pregnant women and 100 controls would provide a power of more than 85% to detect a between-group difference of 15 to 20 percentage points in the percentage of women who had an increased frequency of seizures (the primary outcome), assuming a frequency of 10 to 20% in the control group and a 15% dropout rate.\n\n【30】We calculated the percentage of women who had an increased frequency of seizures (along with 95% confidence intervals) in epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2 to summarize the results of all outcomes, including the primary outcome. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from logistic-regression models for each seizure type for between-group comparisons. We summarized continuous outcomes such as within-person changes in 28-day frequency of seizures by calculating means and 95% confidence intervals along with medians and ranges as a post hoc secondary outcome. To minimize extreme values in the 28-day frequency of seizures owing to missing electronic-diary records, we considered that data were missing for a particular trimester or analysis time period (i.e., epoch 1) if coordinators were unable to verify at least 30 days of data regarding seizures for a participant within that time period (Fig. S1).\n\n【31】For each seizure type or category (e.g., seizures with impaired awareness), the analysis included only the women who had reported a history of having that seizure type at enrollment. The subgroups of the overall analysis population were selected in this manner to avoid inflating the number of women who reported having no change in the frequency of seizures who would not have been susceptible to a particular type of seizure. Changes in the type or dose of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy are reported in a manner that was similar to the methods used to report changes in seizure outcomes.\n\n【32】Risk factors associated with seizure worsening during epoch 1 were evaluated with the use of logistic-regression models. Unadjusted models were fitted for each prespecified risk factor, and an adjusted model was fitted to include risk factors and covariates that were chosen through a forward selection procedure.\n\n【33】Covariates that were considered in adjusted models included the baseline maternal age, education, race, ethnic group, IQ (as evaluated on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, fourth edition 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> ), a history of a catamenial pattern of seizures, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and lifetime history of depression (as assessed by an instrument for a structured clinical interview for depression). 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Because there was no prespecified plan for adjustment of confidence intervals for the outcomes, no definite conclusions can be drawn from these data, and the results are given as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals that have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons.\n\n【34】Post hoc sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary-outcome results. These analyses addressed between-group differences in the frequency of seizures during epoch 2, the choice of postpartum or prepregnancy as the comparator state among nonpregnant women, and the use of multiple imputation to assess the effect of missing data. A summary of the sensitivity analyses is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . All the analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Patients\n--------\n\n【37】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Enrollment and Outcomes.\n\n【38】Study participants could have more than one reason for lack of eligibility or nonenrollment. In the two groups, among the reasons for withdrawal from the study were scheduling conflicts, transportation issues, pregnancy in the control group, and loss to follow-up.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Participants at Baseline.\n\n【39】A total of 1087 women were assessed for eligibility, which resulted in the enrollment of 351 pregnant women and 109 controls 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. A total of 299 of 351 pregnant women (85%) and 93 of 109 controls (85%) were included in the main analysis of seizures that impaired awareness; 87% of the women in the two groups (307 and 95, respectively) were included in the analysis of any seizure type. Pregnant women and controls were similar in terms of demographic features, seizure types, types of antiepileptic drugs that were used, and the percentages who were seizure-free during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【40】Primary and Key Secondary Outcomes\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】Table 2. Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes. Figure 3.  Figure 3. Changes in Seizure Frequency and Antiepileptic-Drug Dose.\n\n【42】Panel A shows the changes in the frequency of seizures that impaired awareness during epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2 in pregnant women and in controls (odds ratio for an increase in seizure frequency during pregnancy, 0.93; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.60). Panel B shows the changes in the dose of an antiepileptic drug by the time of delivery in pregnant women and by 9 months after enrollment in controls (odds ratio for a change in dose during pregnancy, 6.36; 95% CI, 3.82 to 10.59).\n\n【43】The primary outcome (a frequency of seizures that impaired awareness that was higher in epoch 1 than in epoch 2) occurred in 70 of 299 pregnant women (23%) and in 23 of 93 controls (25%) (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 1.60) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , Figure 3A , and Table S1)</u>. Among the key secondary outcomes, the distribution of the increase in seizure frequency in epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2 was similar in the two groups within trimesters and according to seizure type 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S2)</u>. The distribution of baseline characteristics was similar in the two groups of women who were included in an analysis of each seizure type 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>. During epoch 1, at least one seizure that impaired awareness was reported in 87 of 299 pregnant women (29%) and in 29 of 93 controls (31%); during epoch 2, at least one such seizure was reported in 78 of 299 pregnant women (26%) and in 14 of 93 controls (15%) 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>.\n\n【44】Other Secondary Outcomes\n------------------------\n\n【45】The mean frequency of seizures that impaired awareness, as normalized to a 28-day value and measured as a continuous outcome, was 0.69 seizures in epoch 1 and 0.55 seizures in epoch 2 among pregnant women and 1.40 and 0.28 seizures, respectively, among nonpregnant women 删除2:<u>(Table S1)</u>. The frequency of seizures was higher in epoch 1 than in epoch 2 among both pregnant women and controls, with a mean change of 0.14 seizures per 28 days (95% CI, −0.04 to 0.31) and 1.12 seizures per 28 days (95% CI, −1.05 to 3.28), respectively 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. Among the women who were seizure-free or convulsion-free during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment, no between-group difference was observed in the percentage of women who had seizures or convulsions during epoch 1 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>.\n\n【46】Among the women with seizures that impaired awareness, at least one change in the dose of an antiepileptic drug was reported in 222 of 299 pregnant women (74%) by the time of delivery and in 29 of 93 controls (31%) by 9 months after enrollment (odds ratio, 6.36; 95% CI, 3.82 to 10.59) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 3B )</u>. In 209 of 299 pregnant women (70%), the dose of an antiepileptic drug was higher by the end of pregnancy than in the period before pregnancy, as compared with an increase in 22 of 93 controls (24%) during the corresponding period (odds ratio, 7.49; 95% CI, 4.37 to 12.84) 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. Figure S3 shows the changes in doses of the six most common antiepileptic drugs according to trimester and postpartum period.\n\n【47】In risk-factor models for calculating a higher frequency of seizures in epoch 1 than in epoch 2, the odds ratio for being seizure-free during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.41). Models were adjusted for seizure type, antiepileptic drug category and group, presence of catamenial epilepsy, mother’s IQ, and age 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>. No differences in the risk of an increased frequency of seizures were identified among different seizure types or drug categories or between groups in unadjusted or adjusted models. Results of post hoc sensitivity analyses were consistent with the findings of the primary analysis (Tables S9 through S12). Estimates of odds ratios from a post hoc analysis that was performed with imputation of missing data in the adjusted logistic-regression model for identification of risk factors were in the same direction as the estimates in the main analysis 删除2:<u>(Table S13)</u>.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】During the past 20 years, prescribing patterns regarding antiepileptic drugs among pregnant women have changed at the same time that there has been a decline in the incidence of major congenital malformations 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> and in the frequency of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20 </a></sup></u> It is not known whether the use of antiepileptic drugs that have been associated with a relatively low risk of malformations has been at the expense of seizure control, as was initially reported with respect to lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,21,22 </a></sup></u> The EURAP, an international registry of antiepileptic drugs, reported no significant change over time in the percentage of women who had convulsive seizures during pregnancy, despite the increased use of antiepileptic drugs that have been associated with a decreased incidence of congenital malformations. This lack of change was attributed to a probable increased awareness of the need for monitoring of serum drug levels and dose adjustments during pregnancy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> However, pregnancy registries lack details about doses throughout pregnancy and a control group of nonpregnant women to inform such treatment decisions.\n\n【50】The main finding in our analysis was that there was no meaningful difference between pregnant women and nonpregnant women in increased seizure frequency during epoch 1 as compared with epoch 2. However, at the same time, the frequency of increases in drug doses was higher among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. The frequency of seizures decreased in 14% of pregnant women and in 11% of controls between these two time periods.\n\n【51】Previous studies have suggested that seizures may increase during certain trimesters of pregnancy or during the peripartum period, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,12,22 </a></sup></u> but we did not find differences between the pregnant women and controls according to pregnancy stage or seizure type, including convulsive seizures. The results for secondary outcomes showed that women who had no seizures during the 9 months before pregnancy or enrollment were more likely to remain seizure-free during pregnancy than those who had such seizures, findings that were similar to the results of previous studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,23</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】There are limitations of this study related to missing data and underpowering to detect between-group differences for specific seizure types. Although visit schedules to obtain outcome data were similar in the two groups, because of the observational study design, most pregnant women were monitored with routine measurement of antiepileptic-drug levels and dose adjustments to maintain the target-drug level they had before conception, a method that is consistent with national and international recommendations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25 </a></sup></u> The percentage of women who had at least one change in an antiepileptic-drug dose or an overall dose increase during pregnancy and a decrease in drug dose during the postpartum period was higher among pregnant women than among controls, a finding that was consistent with changes in drug clearance during pregnancy. <sup><a>6,9,24,26-28</a></sup>\n\n【53】Among women with epilepsy, the percentage who had a higher incidence of seizures that impaired awareness during pregnancy than during the postpartum period was similar to that in women who were not pregnant during the corresponding epochs. Changes in doses of antiepileptic drugs occurred more frequently in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women during similar time periods.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants (U01-NS038455 and U01-NS050659) from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. French reports receiving consulting fees, steering committee fees, and advisory board fees, all paid to the Epilepsy Study Consortium (TESC), consulting fees, and travel support from Adamas, consulting fees, paid to TESC, from Anavex, Athenen Therapeutics, BioMotiv, BioXcel Therapeutics, Bloom Science, Bridge Valley Ventures, Eliem, Engrail, Epitel, Idorsia, Ionis, Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Mend Neuroscience, Shire, SpringWorks Therapeutics, Sofinnova, Stoke, Vyera, and Xeris, consulting fees, paid to TESC, and travel support from Arvelle Therapeutics, consulting fees, fees for trial development, and training fees, all paid to TESC, from Axcella Health, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, consulting fees, advisory board fees, and fees for training, all paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, travel support from Biogen, consulting fees and advisory board fees, all paid to TESC, from Blackfynn, Cerebral Therapeutics, and Redpin Therapeutics, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, and consulting fees, paid to TESC, from Cavion, consulting fees, paid to TESC, and travel support from Cerevel and Crossject, consulting fees, fees for trial development, fees for training, and reviewer fees, all paid to TESC, from CuroNZ, consulting fees and advisory board fees, all paid to TESC, from Eisai, consulting fees, paid to TESC, from Encoded, Epiminder, Fortress Biotech, Greenwich Biosciences, Janssen, Knopp Biosciences, Merck, Neurocrine Biosciences, Passage Bio, Praxis, Supemus Pharmaceuticals, and West Therapeutic Development, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, consulting fees, fees for trial development, reviewer fees, and training fees, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Engage Therapeutics, advisory board fees, consulting fees, fees for training, and reviewer fees, all paid to TESC, from GW Pharmaceuticals, consulting fees, advisory board fees, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Lundbeck, consulting fees, reviewer fees, and fees for trial development, all paid to TESC, from Marinus, consulting fees, paid to TESC, and travel support from NeuCyte, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, from Neurelis and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, consulting fees, advisory board fees, fees for trial development, and fees for serving as a principal investigator, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Otsuka Pharmaceutical, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, consulting fees, advisory board fees, fees for trial development, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Ovid, consulting fees, advisory board fees, and trial development, all paid to TESC, from Pfizer, consulting fees, advisory board fees, steering committee fees, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Sage, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, consulting fees, fees for trial development, training fees, all paid to TESC, and travel support from SK Life Science, consulting fees and training fees, all paid to TESC, from Sunovion, consulting fees, advisory board fees, reviewer fees, and fees for trial development, all paid to TESC, from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, advisory board fees, consulting fees, fees for serving as clinical director, all paid to TESC, and travel support from UCB, consulting fees, steering committee fees, reviewer fees, all paid to TESC, and travel support from Xenon Pharmaceuticals, grant support, paid to NYU Langone Medical Center, consulting fees, paid to TESC, and travel support form Zogenix, and advisory board fees, consulting fees, and reviewers fees, all paid to TESC, from Zynerba;

Dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11) activates the small Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), a central regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The role of DOCK11 in human immune-cell function and disease remains unknown.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We conducted genetic, immunologic, and molecular assays in four patients from four unrelated families who presented with infections, early-onset severe immune dysregulation, normocytic anemia of variable severity associated with anisopoikilocytosis, and developmental delay. Functional assays were performed in patient-derived cells, as well as in mouse and zebrafish models.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified rare, X-linked germline mutations in _DOCK11_ in the patients, leading to a loss of protein expression in two patients and impaired CDC42 activation in all four patients. Patient-derived T cells did not form filopodia and showed abnormal migration. In addition, the patient-derived T cells, as well as the T cells from _Dock11_ \\-knockout mice, showed overt activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines that were associated with an increased degree of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1).

On the one hand, diabetes is associated with an increased risk of severe Covid-19. On the other hand, new-onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of preexisting diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolarity for which exceptionally high doses of insulin are warranted, have been observed in patients with Covid-19. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> These manifestations of diabetes pose challenges in clinical management and suggest a complex pathophysiology of Covid-19–related diabetes.\n\n【3】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are expressed in key metabolic organs and tissues, including pancreatic beta cells, adipose tissue, the small intestine, and the kidneys. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Thus, it is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 may cause pleiotropic alterations of glucose metabolism that could complicate the pathophysiology of preexisting diabetes or lead to new mechanisms of disease.\n\n【4】There are also several precedents for a viral cause of ketosis-prone diabetes, including other coronaviruses that bind to ACE2 receptors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Greater incidences of fasting glycemia and acute-onset diabetes have been reported among patients with SARS coronavirus 1 pneumonia than among those with non-SARS pneumonia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】In the aggregate, these observations provide support for the hypothesis of a potential diabetogenic effect of Covid-19, beyond the well-recognized stress response associated with severe illness. However, whether the alterations of glucose metabolism that occur with a sudden onset in severe Covid-19 persist or remit when the infection resolves is unclear. How frequent is the phenomenon of new-onset diabetes, and is it classic type 1 or type 2 diabetes or a new type of diabetes? Do these patients remain at higher risk for diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis? In patients with preexisting diabetes, does Covid-19 change the underlying pathophysiology and the natural history of the disease? Answering these questions in order to inform the immediate clinical care, follow-up, and monitoring of affected patients is a priority.\n\n【6】To address these issues, an international group of leading diabetes researchers participating in the CoviDIAB Project have established a global registry of patients with Covid-19–related diabetes ( covidiab.e-dendrite.com . opens in new tab ). The goal of the registry is to establish the extent and phenotype of new-onset diabetes that is defined by hyperglycemia, confirmed Covid-19, a negative history of diabetes, and a history of a normal glycated hemoglobin level. The registry, which will be expanded to include patients with preexisting diabetes who present with severe acute metabolic disturbance, may also be used to investigate the epidemiologic features and pathogenesis of Covid-19–related diabetes and to gain clues regarding appropriate care for patients during and after the course of Covid-19. Given the very short history of human infection with SARS-CoV-2, an understanding of how Covid-19–related diabetes develops, the natural history of this disease, and appropriate management will be helpful. The study of Covid-19–related diabetes may also uncover novel mechanisms of disease.\n\n【7】参考删除-2:<u>Francesco Rubino, M.D.  \nStephanie A.

Figure 1. The Patient at 14 Years of Age.\n\n【3】One of us and several colleagues previously reported in the _Journal_ the survival, at 18 months of age, of a girl with extreme symmetrical intrauterine growth restriction; she had a birth weight of 280 g and a length of 25 cm at a gestational age of 26 weeks and 6 days. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> To our knowledge, her birth weight remains the lowest in the world literature. We now report her growth and development at 14 years of age, as she enters high school 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【4】At two years of age, our patient had a Mental Development Index score of 86 (normal range, 84 to 116) on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and was walking independently. Toilet training took place at three years of age. At five years of age, her visual acuity was 20/200 (in the right eye) and 20/100 (in the left) and was corrected with eyeglasses. Her only hospitalization was at four years of age, for pneumonia. She continues to have reactive airway disease. She started kindergarten at six years of age. A workup for failure to thrive and short stature at three and nine years of age, respectively, revealed no abnormalities. Menarche occurred at 13 years of age. She attends a regular school and has a cumulative grade-point average of 3.70 (of a possible 4.00) for the previous eight years. Since her birth, she has gained an average of 1.8 kg in weight and 9.7 cm in height annually. The 50th percentile for weight and height for girls at the age of 14 years are 50 kg and 163 cm, respectively. Despite her present weight of 25.4 kg and height of 136.5 cm, no psychosocial maladaptations have been reported. The results of her high-school entrance examinations were in the 83rd percentile nationally.\n\n【5】Neonatal survival improves dramatically from 5 percent at a gestational age of 23 weeks to 90 percent at a gestational age of 27 weeks. Despite the routine use of antenatal and postnatal corticosteroids, surfactants, and aggressive ventilation, prospective studies have demonstrated that newborns delivered before 24 weeks of gestation have been completed are less likely to survive and to survive without deficits than are those delivered after a longer gestation. Girls generally have a better prognosis than boys. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The normal cognitive development of our patient is more remarkable than her survival.

Treatment was considered successful if cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative at 2 and 10 weeks or if the patient was clinically stable at 2 weeks and asymptomatic at 10 weeks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】At two weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative in 60 percent of the 202 patients receiving amphotericin B plus flucytosine and in 51 percent of the 179 receiving amphotericin B alone (P = 0.06). Elevated intracranial pressure was associated with death in 13 of 14 patients during step one. The clinical outcome did not differ significantly between the two groups. Seventy-two percent of the 151 fluconazole recipients and 60 percent of the 155 itraconazole recipients had negative cultures at 10 weeks (95 percent confidence interval for the difference in percentages, -100 to 21). The proportion of patients who had clinical responses was similar with fluconazole (68 percent) and itraconazole (70 percent). Overall mortality was 5.5 percent in the first two weeks and 3.9 percent in the next eight weeks, with no significant difference between the groups. In a multivariate analysis, the addition of flucytosine during the initial two weeks and treatment with fluconazole for the next eight weeks were independently associated with cerebrospinal fluid sterilization.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】For the initial treatment of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis, the use of higher-dose amphotericin B plus flucytosine is associated with an increased rate of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization and decreased mortality at two weeks, as compared with regimens used in previous studies. Although consolidation therapy with fluconazole is associated with a higher rate of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization, itraconazole may be a suitable alternative for patients unable to take fluconazole.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Cryptococcosis is the most common life-threatening fungal infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Before the epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the standard therapy for cryptococcal meningitis was amphotericin B (0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and flucytosine (150 mg per kilogram per day) for four to six weeks. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> However, the use of flucytosine in patients with AIDS has been controversial. In one large retrospective study, the addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B was associated with significant toxicity and offered no benefit over amphotericin B alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】The oral triazole antifungal drugs, fluconazole and itraconazole, are alternatives to amphotericin B, but there are conflicting data on the efficacy of these drugs. The largest prospective study of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis found no difference in outcome between treatment with amphotericin B (0.4 mg per kilogram per day) and treatment with fluconazole, with negative cerebrospinal fluid cultures in less than 50 percent of the patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Overall mortality was 14 percent in the amphotericin B group and 18 percent in the fluconazole group; mortality at two weeks was 8 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The results of smaller studies suggest that amphotericin B given in a higher dose (0.7 or 0.8 mg per kilogram per day), either alone or in combination with flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day), may be superior to an oral triazole. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> Thus, questions persist about the optimal initial therapy for AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n【13】The Mycoses Study Group and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases designed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial to determine the effectiveness of 14 days of higher-dose amphotericin B, with or without flucytosine, as induction therapy in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and to compare fluconazole and itraconazole as consolidation therapy for an additional 8 weeks in patients whose clinical condition had not deteriorated during the induction phase.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Study Design\n------------\n\n【16】The study was conducted in two steps. In step one, patients with a first episode of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis were randomly assigned to receive amphotericin B (0.7 mg per kilogram per day) with either flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day in four divided doses) or placebo for the initial two weeks of therapy. In step two, patients whose condition was stable or improved at the completion of step one were randomly assigned, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, to consolidation therapy with either fluconazole (a loading dose of 800 mg per day for two days, followed by 400 mg per day for eight weeks) or itraconazole (a loading dose of 600 mg per day for three days, followed by 200 mg twice each day for eight weeks). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at each study site. All patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【17】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【18】The criteria for enrollment in step one of the study included HIV infection documented by a positive test for HIV antibody or a previous AIDS-defining opportunistic infection, an age of 13 years or older, and a first episode of cryptococcal meningitis documented by a cerebrospinal fluid culture that was positive for _Cryptococcus neoformans_ . Patients were excluded if they had already received a total dose of more than 1 mg of amphotericin B per kilogram or more than 1200 mg of fluconazole, itraconazole, or ketoconazole as treatment for this episode of meningitis. Patients were also excluded if they were comatose; were taking medications that affect the metabolism of itraconazole (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or rifamycins) or decrease the absorption of itraconazole (histamine H <sub>2 </sub> blockers); were receiving 50 mg or more of hydrocortisone daily; were pregnant or lactating; were unable to take medications by mouth or nasogastric tube; had a history of active hepatitis or moderate-to-severe hematologic, renal, or hepatic dysfunction; or had another acute opportunistic infection requiring therapy during the first two weeks. At the time of the base-line randomization, the patients were stratified according to their mental status (normal, defined as awake and alert, or abnormal, defined as somnolent or obtunded) and the institution at which they were receiving treatment.\n\n【19】The eligibility criteria for step two were a stable or improved clinical condition during the previous 14 days, receipt of a minimal total dose of 7.5 mg of amphotericin B per kilogram, the ability to take oral medications, and hepatic enzyme values that remained lower than 10 times the upper limit of normal and serum bilirubin values that remained lower than 2 times the upper limit of normal. The patients were stratified according to their base-line mental status and the therapy received during step one.\n\n【20】Evaluation\n----------\n\n【21】Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at base line, twice weekly for the first 2 weeks, weekly for the next 2 weeks, and then every 2 weeks until the 10-week study period was completed. Studies of cerebrospinal fluid and tests of serum cryptococcal antigen were performed at base line and weeks 2, 4, and 10. The Mini–Mental State Examination was performed at base line and weeks 2 and 10. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【23】Mycologic and clinical outcomes were evaluated separately and together as a composite outcome. At two weeks, the mycologic outcome was considered to be successful if the cerebrospinal fluid fungal culture was negative, and the clinical outcome was considered to be successful if fever, headache, and meningismus were improved or no worse. Successful treatment at 10 weeks was defined mycologically as a negative cerebrospinal fluid fungal culture and clinically as the absence of fever, headache, and meningismus. Toxicity was defined according to the ACTG scale for reporting adverse events.\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】For both steps, there were two primary evaluations of the outcome: mycologic and clinical. For step one, we assumed that amphotericin B alone would result in cerebrospinal fluid sterilization or clinical stabilization in 20 percent of the patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> With a two-sided test, an alpha level of 0.05, and a power of 80 percent to detect a true difference of 20 percent in the mycologic outcome at two weeks in the two groups, the analysis would require 182 patients per group.\n\n【26】For step two, our null hypothesis was that the success rate for fluconazole was at least 15 percent higher than that for itraconazole in terms of both clinical and mycologic outcomes. We wanted to determine whether an analysis of our data would reject this hypothesis in favor of the alternative, that the two triazoles were equally effective. If the true success rate for each triazole were 34 percent, an analysis using a one-sided test with an alpha level of 0.025 and a power of 80 percent to detect a difference would require 157 patients per group, for a total of 314 patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> On the basis of an earlier study, we estimated that 20 percent of patients would not be available for random assignment in step two 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> ; consequently, we planned to enroll 400 patients in step one.\n\n【27】The outcome analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. In the case of patients who were not available for a lumbar puncture or evaluation of clinical status at week 2 or 10, treatment was considered to have failed. In the case of patients who died, elevated intracranial pressure was considered to be associated with death if the last known cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was 250 mm or higher within two weeks before death or if there was no pressure measurement available and the patient had cranial-nerve or other central nervous system findings consistent with elevated pressure or herniation.\n\n【28】The treatment groups were compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test for ordinal measurements and the chi-square test for categorical measurements. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The Kaplan–Meier method was used in survival analyses, and the treatment groups were compared by the log-rank test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> The logistic-regression model was used for multivariate assessment of the relative risk of mycologic failure during therapy, after adjustment for potentially confounding factors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Base-line data associated with successful outcomes at 2 and 10 weeks (P<0.30) in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate models. Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was not included in the multivariate model because of the large number of missing data.\n\n【29】Results\n-------\n\n【30】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【31】Table 1.  Table 1. Base-Line Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics of 381 Patients with AIDS-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis Treated with Amphotericin B plus Flucytosine or Amphotericin B Alone (Step One).\n\n【32】From October 1991 through August 1994, 408 patients were enrolled in step one of the study. Twenty-seven of these patients were ineligible at base line (19 had negative cerebrospinal fluid cultures, 4 were receiving corticosteroids or rifampin, 2 had had a previous episode of cryptococcal disease, 1 was HIV-negative, and 1 was pregnant). Of the 381 eligible patients, 202 received amphotericin B plus flucytosine and 179 received amphotericin B alone. Demographic characteristics and base-line laboratory values, CD4 lymphocyte counts, and clinical signs and symptoms of cryptococcal disease did not differ significantly between the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Eighty-nine percent of the patients were judged to be awake and alert; however, there were behavioral changes in 21 percent.\n\n【33】Table 2.  Table 2. Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics of the 306 Patients Randomly Assigned to Consolidation Therapy with Fluconazole or Itraconazole (Step Two).\n\n【34】A total of 306 patients were eligible for randomization in the second step of the study: 151 received fluconazole and 155 received itraconazole. There were no differences between these two treatment groups at the time of the base-line assessments in step two 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Seventy-five patients were not randomly assigned to a treatment group in step two: 19 died while receiving therapy in step one; 11 had a deterioration in clinical status; 11 had toxic effects necessitating discontinuation of the study drug; 7 were receiving antiepileptic agents, rifampin, or H <sub>2 </sub> blockers; 4 had concurrent acute opportunistic infections; 1 did not receive an adequate total dose of amphotericin B; 1 was not alert enough to take oral medications; and 21 withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up.\n\n【35】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【36】### _Step One_\n\n【37】Table 3.  Table 3. Outcome at Two Weeks (Step One).\n\n【38】As shown in Table 3 , at two weeks, cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative in 60 percent of the patients who received amphotericin B with flucytosine and in 51 percent of those who received amphotericin B alone (P = 0.06). There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients with stable or improved symptoms (78 percent of the combination-therapy group and 83 percent of the amphotericin B group, P = 0.18), unchanged or improved scores on the Mini–Mental State Examination (77 percent of the combination-therapy group and 74 percent of the amphotericin B group, P = 0.42), or combined mycologic and clinical responses (50 percent of the combination-therapy group and 42 percent of the amphotericin B group, P = 0.12). Over the two-week period, the median titer of cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen declined from 1:1024 at base line in both treatment groups to 1:200 in the combination-therapy group and 1:256 in the amphotericin B group (P = 0.56).\n\n【39】### _Step Two_\n\n【40】Table 4.  Table 4. Outcome at 10 Weeks (Step Two).\n\n【41】At 10 weeks, 72 percent of the patients receiving fluconazole had negative cerebrospinal fluid cultures; lumbar punctures were not performed in 39 patients 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. In the itraconazole group, cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative in 60 percent of the patients; 54 patients did not have lumbar punctures (95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the percentages of patients with negative cultures in the two groups, -100 to 21). Therefore, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that fluconazole was 15 percent more effective than itraconazole in terms of the sterilization of cerebrospinal fluid cultures.\n\n【42】With regard to clinical efficacy, 68 percent of the fluconazole recipients and 70 percent of the itraconazole recipients had complete resolution of symptoms (headache, fever, and meningismus). On the Mini–Mental State Examination, 68 percent of the fluconazole recipients and 70 percent of the itraconazole recipients had unchanged or improved scores. Thus, in terms of clinical success, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups, and the null hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of fluconazole was 15 percent greater than that of itraconazole was rejected.\n\n【43】Over the eight-week period of consolidation therapy, the median titer of cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen declined in both treatment groups, from 1:256 in both groups at 2 weeks to 1:57 in the fluconazole group and 1:32 in the itraconazole group at 10 weeks (P = 0.22). The four treatment combinations did not differ significantly with regard to cerebrospinal fluid culture sterilization, resolution of clinical symptoms, or survival at 10 weeks (data not shown).\n\n【44】Deaths\n------\n\n【45】During step one, 21 patients died (5.5 percent): 11 of the 202 patients in the amphotericin B group and 10 of the 179 in the combination-treatment group (P = 0.65 by the log-rank test). During step two, there were 2 deaths among the 151 fluconazole recipients and 5 among the 155 itraconazole recipients; an additional 2 fluconazole recipients and 3 itraconazole recipients died during weeks 3 to 10 but were not receiving the study drug at the time (P = 0.27, by the log-rank test, for total deaths). Thus, 12 of the 306 patients (3.9 percent) in step two died. Seven other patients who had been enrolled in step one but were not randomly assigned to treatment in step two died during weeks 3 to 10.\n\n【46】Cerebrospinal Fluid Opening Pressure\n------------------------------------\n\n【47】During step one, the median base-line cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was 220 mm in the 123 patients with negative cerebrospinal fluid cultures at two weeks and 280 mm in the 97 with persistently positive cultures (P = 0.01). Of the 14 patients who died and for whom cerebrospinal fluid opening pressures were determined, 13 had pressures higher than 250 mm at the time of the last lumbar puncture. Six of these patients also had cranial-nerve abnormalities or palsies, ataxia, or herniation. Two patients in whom opening pressures were not measured had ataxia or a clinical diagnosis of elevated intracranial hypertension; both patients died.\n\n【48】Factors Predicting Outcome\n--------------------------\n\n【49】Table 5.  Table 5. Multivariate Analysis of Base-Line Characteristics Associated with Negative Cerebrospinal Fluid Cultures at 2 and 10 Weeks.\n\n【50】We performed a multivariate analysis of base-line characteristics associated with a negative cerebrospinal fluid culture at 2 weeks and at 10 weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 5 )</u>. Data were available for 268 patients at 2 weeks and 306 patients at 10 weeks. An elevated base-line serum creatinine value (P = 0.04), treatment with amphotericin B plus flucytosine (P = 0.01), the presence of fever (P = 0.02), and a negative blood culture for _C. neoformans_ (P = 0.001) were independently associated with a negative cerebrospinal fluid culture at two weeks. Factors significantly associated with a negative culture at 10 weeks, after adjustment for the covariate of time, were the absence of intravenous drug use (P = 0.03), fluconazole therapy (P = 0.02; odds ratio, 1.78), and a negative cerebrospinal fluid culture at 2 weeks (P = 0.01). A multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed that the study treatment was not associated with a clinical benefit at 2 or 10 weeks.\n\n【51】Drug Toxicity\n-------------\n\n【52】### _Step One_\n\n【53】Eleven patients (2.9 percent) had toxic effects requiring the withdrawal of the study drug (six receiving combination therapy and five receiving amphotericin B alone). Three patients had elevated serum creatinine values, two had nausea, two had hypokalemia, and one each had a rash, headache, hemolytic anemia, and a gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Overall, there were no differences in toxic effects between the treatment groups, regardless of whether the base-line hematologic values were normal or abnormal. Among the patients with normal serum creatinine values at base line, 1 percent in each group had values that were more than three times the upper limit of normal during the two weeks of treatment.\n\n【54】### _Step Two_\n\n【55】During step two, 12 patients (6 in each group) had toxic effects requiring the withdrawal of the study drug. Six patients had nausea and vomiting, two of whom had elevated serum creatinine values. Two patients had rashes, including one patient receiving fluconazole, who had the Stevens–Johnson syndrome and survived. One patient each had hyperkalemia, headache, neutropenia, and hepatic failure. Two of these patients died (the patient with hepatic failure and the patient with hyperkalemia); both were in the itraconazole group. Overall, 28 percent of the patients had hematologic toxic effects, 7 percent had hepatic toxic effects, and 4 percent had renal toxic effects.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】This study was designed to address a number of critical questions in the management of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis: Does the addition of flucytosine offer any advantage over amphotericin B alone? Are the triazole antifungal drugs, fluconazole and itraconazole, equally effective after initial treatment with amphotericin B? Do higher doses of amphotericin B lead to a reduction in the mortality rates reported in previous studies (14 to 18 percent)?\n\n【58】Both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that flucytosine has at least an additive effect, if not a synergistic effect, when combined with amphotericin B. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> In the era before AIDS, the combination regimen of flucytosine (150 mg per kilogram per day) and low-dose amphotericin B (0.3 mg per kilogram per day) for 6 weeks was equivalent to or better than amphotericin B alone (0.4 mg per kilogram per day) for 10 weeks, with regard to cures, relapses, and rates of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> In contrast, among patients with AIDS and cryptococcal disease evaluated retrospectively, the combination of flucytosine (75 to 100 mg per kilogram per day) and amphotericin B did not alter survival, as compared with amphotericin B alone; in addition, in 53 percent of the patients receiving combination therapy, flucytosine had to be withdrawn because of drug-associated cytopenias. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> A small study showed that treatment with higher doses of amphotericin B (0.7 mg per kilogram per day) combined with flucytosine (150 mg per kilogram per day) was dramatically successful. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【59】In our study, the addition of lower-dose flucytosine (100 mg per kilogram per day) to amphotericin B for the first two weeks of therapy was not associated with a statistically significant benefit in the univariate analysis, although the rate of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization was higher with the combination regimen than with amphotericin B alone. The addition of flucytosine was independently associated with a better outcome in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, in our study, the addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B was not associated with an increased incidence of toxic effects, probably because of the shorter duration of flucytosine therapy and the use of a daily dose lower than those in a previous study. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】For the consolidation phase (step two), we were unable to reject the null hypothesis that fluconazole was 15 percent more effective than itraconazole in terms of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization. The multivariate analysis showed a significant association between fluconazole therapy and negative cultures at 10 weeks. The clinical efficacy of fluconazole and itraconazole was similar with respect to the resolution of symptoms, scores on the Mini–Mental State Examination, and the mortality rate.\n\n【61】One possible reason for the different culture results in the two groups in step two is the difference in the number of patients who did not have lumbar punctures at 10 weeks (54 of the 155 itraconazole recipients vs. 39 of the 151 fluconazole recipients), since the mycologic outcome in these patients was considered to be unsuccessful. Among the study participants who underwent lumbar punctures at week 10, the cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative in 97 percent of those receiving fluconazole (109 of 112) and in 92 percent of those receiving itraconazole (93 of 101). Just as we found that fluconazole resulted in a higher rate of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization than itraconazole, a separate study comparing a lower dose of fluconazole (200 mg per day) with itraconazole (200 mg per day) has clearly shown that fluconazole is superior as maintenance therapy in suppressing cryptococcal infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【62】Mortality rates for AIDS-associated acute cryptococcal meningitis have ranged from 14 percent among patients receiving amphotericin B alone in our most recent trial to over 25 percent in some trials of azoles as initial therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,17 </a></sup></u> Most of the deaths occurred during the first two weeks of therapy. Thus, to our knowledge, the mortality rates in our current study (5.5 percent in the first two weeks and 3.9 percent in the next eight weeks) represent the best outcome reported thus far in a large, randomized trial.\n\n【63】The higher dose of amphotericin B in our study (0.7 mg per kilogram per day), with or without flucytosine, may account, in large part, for the low mortality rate. The increased dose of amphotericin B also resulted in a 50 percent rate of cerebrospinal fluid sterilization at two weeks without significant toxicity, which is substantially better than the 20 percent sterilization rate reported in our previous large study of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis, in which the dose of amphotericin B was 0.4 mg per kilogram per day. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> We believe these two studies are comparable, since the patients in the previous study had similar base-line characteristics, including positive blood cultures in 53 percent, abnormal mental status in 27 percent, and a median cerebrospinal fluid white-cell count of 5 cells per cubic millimeter. The patients in the previous study had lower median titers of cryptococcal antigen in serum (1:1000, P<0.001) and in cerebrospinal fluid (1:512, P<0.001) at base line and thus presumably had a lower fungal burden. In a recent study, an even higher dose of amphotericin B (1 mg per kilogram per day), with or without flucytosine, for two weeks, followed by fluconazole or itraconazole, resulted in a successful outcome in 29 of 31 patients (94 percent), with no deaths due to cryptococcal disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【64】Careful management of elevated intracranial pressure is another important factor that probably played a part in the improved outcome in this study. High pressures have been associated with catastrophic neurologic deterioration and death in the absence of hydrocephalus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Almost all the early deaths in this study (13 of 14) and 40 percent of the deaths during weeks 3 through 10 were associated with elevated intracranial pressure. Our study protocol included a treatment algorithm for the management of increased pressure, including daily lumbar punctures, use of acetazolamide, and ventriculoperitoneal shunts for asymptomatic patients with intracranial cerebrospinal fluid pressures higher than 320 mm and for symptomatic patients with pressures higher than 180 mm. Further research is needed to examine this association and determine whether a reduction of high pressure can, in fact, decrease mortality.\n\n【65】In summary, induction treatment for two weeks with the combination regimen of higher-dose amphotericin B plus flucytosine, followed by consolidation therapy with oral fluconazole, is safe and effective and should now be considered the treatment of choice for AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis. In view of the positive influence of flucytosine therapy on the mycologic outcome (in our multivariate analysis), its low degree of toxicity in our study, and recent data demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing relapses (regardless of the maintenance regimen), we believe that the addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B is warranted for induction therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> For consolidation therapy, itraconazole is a suitable alternative for patients unable to take fluconazole. The strong association between elevated intracranial pressure and early death in our study should encourage clinicians to monitor cerebrospinal fluid pressure even in the absence of symptoms and initiate aggressive management if the pressure is elevated.\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Presented in part at the 35th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, San Francisco, September 17–20, 1995.</u>\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to the Mycoses Study Group (NO1-AI-15082 and NO1-AI-65296) and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group and by grants from the National Center for Research Services and the Janssen Research Foundation.

Addressing Undeserved Suffering in Health Care\n*   _3_ Comments\n\n【1】Article\n-------\n\n【2】“What brings your loved one here?” the hospice nurse asked. She was seeking an abbreviated history of my mémère’s terminal diagnosis, but I couldn’t muster the words without losing my composure. Somehow, the nurse understood. She said, “Tell me about Mrs. Rosalie.”\n\n【3】“She doesn’t want to suffer. She suffered all her life,” I began.\n\n【4】My mother squeezed my shoulder and nodded.\n\n【5】“No restraints,” I added. “She doesn’t like them.”\n\n【6】She’d been restrained enough. Abandoned as a child, she was repeatedly tied to a bed in an asylum for insane colored children, until the warden took her home to assist his wife with chores. Afraid she’d be institutionalized indefinitely, she ran away. Left unvaccinated, she contracted diphtheria at age 12. She married a man 6 years her senior who’d also been abandoned. At 15, she gave birth to the first of seven children. To get her family public housing, she had to oust her husband. She was assaulted in the stairwell by a neighbor. She worked two jobs to escape a notorious housing project. She finally became a homeowner, but at what cost?\n\n【7】The nurse listened, setting aside the prescribed intake process. I was grateful that in this final hour, she wanted to examine the details of my mémère’s health, to unpack her pain.\n\n【8】Was this moment the liberating, comprehensive health care experience my grandmother had long awaited? During the Covid-19 pandemic, as many Americans have been awakened to implicit biases in health care, the ramifications of social injustice for the value of Black lives, and the shared disparities in outcome whether one is shackled to an underresourced safety-net hospital or a dehumanizing justice system, I’ve been reminded of Gustavo Gutierrez’s liberation theology and the public health applications of its approaches to achieving social justice. Embracing a preferential health care option for society’s most vulnerable would acknowledge that health care is a human right demanding equity and justice. But there is no liberation in health care for the poor, just symptom containment.\n\n【9】The health care system saw Mémère as a collection of patient identifiers — medical record number, date of birth, last-name-first-initial. They butchered the spelling and pronunciation of her Louisiana French-Creole surname. They accused her of poor understanding when she didn’t respond. Ironically, she accused them of the same. Overworked and overburdened, they were dismissive of her person, reducing her to a list of conditions — hypertension, high cholesterol, prediabetes.\n\n【10】In that moment of reflection, I recalled the chants in homage to Sandra Bland, “Say her name. Say her name.”\n\n【11】“She likes being called Rosie,” I said. The nurse smiled politely.\n\n【12】The years had taken their toll. Mémère was poor, Black, undereducated, and now unkempt. She had been encouraged to quit smoking but offered no treatment options. Smoking-cessation drugs were not covered by her health plan. “My nerves are bad,” she would say; “I can’t just quit.”\n\n【13】So she puffed her problems away. Clinical depression; the loss of two sons to gun violence; the loss of grandkids to the penal system; the loss of her partially paralyzed husband to “John Henryism” (the psychosocially influenced workaholic coping strategy that results in poor health in Black men); the loss of sleep from guarding the door.\n\n【14】She would wait for me at the bus stop after school. My private school uniform made me a target on public transportation, and one day I was robbed. I emerged from the bus crying, but she didn’t care that my money was stolen — she rushed over to check whether my body had been violated.\n\n【15】For years, the health care system swiped her copays and neglected her being. She thought she was unscathed, but she had been violated — picked clean for profits rather than protected.\n\n【16】In reality, she was not prediabetic: she drank coffee before the fasting glucose test. She didn’t have uncontrolled hypertension: afraid of soiling herself on public transportation, she didn’t take her diuretic before appointments. She worked until her body failed at age 82. After 6 months of weight loss and 4 months of delayed tests, she was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer in the emergency department. It took terminal cancer to get social work and case management involved. For years, health care had contributed to, rather than healed, her suffering. Yet she never missed an appointment.\n\n【17】Tragically, protests and policy measures won’t be effective until there is first a change in praxis. For America to be truly free, there must be liberation for our most vulnerable and recognition of their humanity — even in medicine.\n\n【18】Shantel Hébert-Magee, M.D., M.P.H.  \nLouisiana Office of Public Health, Baton Rouge, LA  \n\n【19】Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------\n\n【20】Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】This article was published on August 7, 2020, at NEJM.org.\n\n【22】Supplementary Material\n----------------------\n\n| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 147KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【24】Comments _(3)_\n--------------\n\n【25】*   Showing 1-3 of 3 comments\n*   Contributors\n*   Newest\n\n【26】    *   Newest\n    *   Oldest\n\n【27】Dr. Prem raj Pushpakaran  \nAug 24, 2020\n\n【28】Dr. Prem raj Pushpakaran  \nOther  \nDisclosure: None  \n_India_\n\n【29】Disparities in Health Care -- A Moral Dilemma\n\n【30】The admixture of systemic quality and access problems in healthcare is intertwined with historic injury and it is the duty of us to join hands to eliminate this social evil.

How have we let this be 'normal'? And what are we doing right this day to correct this? As an ex-school teacher and patient advocate, my first impulse is to think that education will solve all of it. Naturally, there is so much more than poor education--by which I mean, poor education on the part of the medical world! Rather, this must be an obvious and simple lack of human care for one another. Yet that can also be taught, but it starts with simple respect for one another, and humility for our own failings. We can do so much better, but it begins with the reality that we must want to do so.

In 1983, we reported a deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II, one of the isozymes of carbonic anhydrase, in three sisters with this disorder. We now describe our study of 18 similarly affected patients with this syndrome in 11 unrelated families of different geographic and ethnic origins. Virtual absence of the carbonic anhydrase II peak on high-performance liquid chromatography, of the esterase and carbon dioxide hydratase activities of carbonic anhydrase II, and of immunoprecipitable isozyme II was demonstrated on extracts of erythrocyte hemolysates from all patients studied. Reduced levels of isozyme II were found in obligate heterozygotes. These observations demonstrate the generality of the findings that we reported earlier in one family and provide further evidence that a deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II is the enzymatic basis for the autosomal recessive syndrome of osteopetrosis with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification.\n\n【2】We also summarize the clinical findings in these families, propose mechanisms by which a deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II could produce this metabolic disorder of bone, kidney, and brain, and discuss the clinical evidence for genetic heterogeneity in patients from different kindreds with this inborn error of metabolism. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1985; 313:139–45.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Stimulation of platelet production may be an effective treatment for this disorder.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a trial in which 118 adults with chronic ITP and platelet counts of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter who had had relapses or whose platelet count was refractory to at least one standard treatment for ITP were randomly assigned to receive the oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist eltrombopag (30, 50, or 75 mg daily) or placebo. The primary end point was a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter on day 43.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the eltrombopag groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg per day, the primary end point was achieved in 28%, 70%, and 81% of patients, respectively. In the placebo group, the end point was achieved in 11% of patients. The median platelet counts on day 43 for the groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag were 26,000, 128,000, and 183,000 per cubic millimeter, respectively; for the placebo group the count was 16,000 per cubic millimeter. By day 15, more than 80% of patients receiving 50 or 75 mg of eltrombopag daily had an increased platelet count. Bleeding also decreased during treatment in these two groups. The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in the placebo and eltrombopag groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Eltrombopag increased platelet counts in a dose-dependent manner in patients with relapsed or refractory ITP. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00102739 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which antiplatelet antibodies accelerate the destruction of platelets. In addition, platelet production can be impaired 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> because the antiplatelet antibodies can also damage megakaryocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-4 </a></sup></u> Although the thrombocytopenia of ITP can be severe, signs of bleeding are usually only minor. Persistently low platelet counts (<20,000 per cubic millimeter), however, are associated with an increased risk of serious bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> The goal of managing chronic ITP is to maintain platelet counts, with the least possible intervention, at levels that prevent bleeding, thereby reducing treatment-related toxicity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulins increase platelet counts in ITP primarily by reducing the extent of platelet destruction. However, the recognition that platelet production in ITP is often suboptimal has led to the use of treatments that enhance thrombopoiesis. This approach has focused on thrombopoietin, the growth factor underlying megakaryocytopoiesis. Thrombopoietin is the ligand for the thrombopoietin receptor on megakaryocytes and platelets. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-11 </a></sup></u> In many patients with ITP, however, serum levels of thrombopoietin are within the normal range despite the thrombocytopenia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Two recent studies showed that AMG 531, a subcutaneously administered thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein, can increase platelet counts in patients with chronic ITP. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> In one study, single doses increased platelet counts substantially in 7 of 12 patients, and multiple doses increased platelet counts in 12 of 16 patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Eltrombopag (SB-497115) is an oral, small-molecule, nonpeptide thrombopoietin-receptor agonist. The drug initiates thrombopoietin-receptor signaling by interacting with the transmembrane domain of the receptor, thereby inducing proliferation and differentiation of cells in the megakaryocytic lineage. Administration of eltrombopag increased platelet production in preclinical studies, in volunteers with normal platelet counts, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-21 </a></sup></u> and in patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C virus infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> This study was designed to assess whether eltrombopag could safely increase platelet counts in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic ITP.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Patients\n--------\n\n【16】Patients at 44 clinical sites were enrolled between February and November 2005. The protocol was approved by the human subjects committee at each institution, and all patients gave written informed consent before enrollment. Participants were at least 18 years of age, had at least a 6-month history of ITP, had received at least one previous treatment for ITP, and had a platelet count of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter at enrollment. Patients receiving maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, primarily glucocorticoids, were eligible if the dose had been stable for at least 1 month. The dose had to remain unchanged throughout the study. Other treatments for ITP must have been completed at least 2 weeks before enrollment.\n\n【17】Patients with the following conditions were excluded: secondary immune thrombocytopenia (e.g., patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus or patients with systemic lupus erythematosus), hemoglobin levels of less than 10 g per deciliter, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, thrombosis within 1 year before enrollment, or myocardial infarction within 3 months before enrollment; women who were nursing or pregnant were also excluded. Women of childbearing age agreed to use contraception throughout the study. Values within the normal range were required for neutrophils, reticulocyte count, creatinine, and liver enzymes.\n\n【18】Study Design\n------------\n\n【19】This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined once-daily oral treatment with eltrombopag. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive placebo or 30, 50, or 75 mg of eltrombopag per day for up to 6 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to concomitant ITP medication (yes or no), splenectomy (yes or no), and the baseline platelet count (>15,000 per cubic millimeter vs. ≤15,000 per cubic millimeter), with a block size of four within each stratum. To reduce the risk of thrombocytosis, treatment was discontinued when platelet counts exceeded 200,000 per cubic millimeter. Race was self-reported and recorded on the case report form by each participating center.\n\n【20】The primary end point was a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter on day 43 of the study. Secondary end points included safety and tolerability, signs of bleeding, serum thrombopoietin level (as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, R&D Systems), and health-related quality of life (as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form General Health Survey, version 2 \\[SF36v2\\]; QualityMetric). The incidence and severity of bleeding were assessed at every visit according to the World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding scale (grade 0, no bleeding; grade 1, petechiae; grade 2, mild blood loss; grade 3, gross blood loss; grade 4, debilitating blood loss).\n\n【21】All patients were assessed weekly for safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the treatment during the 6-week treatment period and at 2-week intervals for 6 weeks after the study medication had been discontinued. In preclinical studies, cataract formation was found in rodents but not dogs, and patients therefore received ophthalmic evaluations before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after the last dose of the study medication. An independent safety committee reviewed the ocular findings. The study was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws and regulations.\n\n【22】The protocol was developed by the academic principal investigators at the study sites and employees of the sponsor (GlaxoSmithKline). Data were collected and analyzed by the sponsor. Decisions related to the content and publication of the manuscript were made by the academic principal investigator of the study in consultation with the coauthors. All academic and nonacademic authors had access to the primary data and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data.\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【24】An adaptive sequential design was applied. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> Response to treatment was defined as achievement of the primary end point: a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter. All patients who were treated with at least one dose of study medication and who had a baseline platelet count of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter were included in the analyses of the primary end point. Two interim analyses were planned when data were available for one third and two thirds of the maximum intended sample size of 272 patients (68 per group). The trial had 90% statistical power at the 2.5% level of significance (one-sided) to detect a 30% difference in the proportion of patients with a response (platelet count ≥50,000 per cubic millimeter) to patients without a response between the placebo group and each eltrombopag group, assuming that 30% of patients receiving placebo would have a response. A logistic-regression model with adjustment for the use or nonuse of concomitant medication for ITP, splenectomy status, and baseline platelet count (≤15,000 per cubic millimeter vs. >15,000 per cubic millimeter) was used to test the global null hypothesis that the odds of a response were equal across all four study groups. If the null hypothesis was rejected, the odds of a response in each eltrombopag group were compared with the odds of a response in the placebo group by means of a closed testing procedure to maintain the overall type 1 error at 2.5% (one-sided). The interactions between treatment response and stratification variables were evaluated at the 10% level of significance.\n\n【25】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment, Group Assignments, and Outcome.\n\n【26】Patients eligible for screening had received previous treatment for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and had platelet counts of less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter. The efficacy population was defined as all patients who had undergone randomization and had been treated with at least one dose of eltrombopag or placebo. Eight patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis for these reasons: a platelet count greater than or equal to 30,000 per cubic millimeter (four patients), a missing baseline platelet count (one patient), and audit findings at one site (three patients). Four patients attained a platelet count of 200,000 or more per cubic millimeter but were not withdrawn from the study: one in the group receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag, one in the group receiving 50 mg, and two in the group receiving 75 mg. These four patients were therefore counted in the number completing the study. Adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study were as follows: placebo group — toxic hepatitis (in one patient), elevated bilirubin level (one), and convulsion (one); group receiving 50 mg of eltrombopag — menorrhagia (one) and hepatitis, embolism, and pulmonary embolism (one); group receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag — tonsillitis and urticaria (one). Other events leading to withdrawal from the study: placebo group — treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins before surgery for glaucoma (one) and patient's decision (two); group receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag — lack of efficacy (two) and treatment with rescue medication (one); group receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag — lack of efficacy (one), a baseline platelet count of greater than 30,000 per cubic millimeter (one), and use of prohibited medication (one).\n\n【27】The primary end point was analyzed by use of a prospectively defined last-observation-carried-forward imputation in which the last platelet count during treatment was carried forward to day 43 for patients who withdrew prematurely because of a platelet count of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter. Patients who withdrew prematurely for any other reason were counted as not having had a response, irrespective of the platelet count 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Additional supportive analyses were performed with the use of only observed data at day 43, with no imputations.\n\n【28】For each planned interim analysis, critical boundaries for assessing efficacy and futility by means of step-down and step-up procedures, respectively, were derived with the use of EAST 3 software (Cytel Software). At the first interim analysis, performed by the study sponsor, a given dose of eltrombopag could be stopped for reasons of efficacy (one-sided P≤0.0113), futility (one-sided P≥0.333), or safety. In the first interim analysis, involving data from 104 patients, the groups receiving the two highest doses of eltrombopag met the predefined stopping criteria for efficacy under the closed testing procedure. The group receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag did not meet the stopping criterion for either efficacy or futility (two-sided P=0.340); however, this dose was not continued because of high response rates for doses of 50 mg and 75 mg and a similar incidence of adverse events among patients in all four study groups. After the decision was made to stop the study, the final analysis involving data from 118 patients, including 14 patients who enrolled after the interim cutoff date 删除4:<u>(September 2005)</u>, was performed and is presented here.\n\n【29】Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and safety data. All P values for these data were two-sided and were not adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【32】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics at Baseline.\n\n【33】Of 153 patients screened, 118 underwent randomization, and 117 were treated 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The most common reasons for ineligibility were a platelet count of 30,000 or more per cubic millimeter (18 patients) and withdrawal of consent before randomization (7 patients). The median age of enrolled patients was 50 years; 62% were women, and 79% were white 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Forty-seven percent of the patients had undergone splenectomy, 32% were receiving concomitant medication for ITP, and 48% had a platelet count of 15,000 or less per cubic millimeter. Seventy-four percent of the patients had previously received two or more treatments for ITP. Only 20 of the 117 patients had received therapy for ITP other than glucocorticoids or intravenous immune globulins within the 3 months preceding the start of the protocol treatment, and these 20 patients were equally distributed among the four treatment groups. Significant differences in median age and race (white vs. nonwhite) were observed between treatment groups at baseline 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【34】Of the 117 patients who began the trial, 7 in the placebo group and 36 in the eltrombopag groups did not complete 6 weeks of the study treatment 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these 43 patients, 28 withdrew early because they had a platelet count of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter. Four additional patients had a platelet count of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter but did not withdraw from the trial. Efficacy was evaluated in 109 patients 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>; all 117 patients were evaluated for safety.\n\n【35】Platelet Counts\n---------------\n\n【36】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Analyses of Platelet Counts and Responses.\n\n【37】Panel A shows the percentage of patients with a response in the four study groups at each weekly treatment visit, on the basis of last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) data. On day 8, among patients treated with eltrombopag, 44% and 62% of patients receiving 50 mg and 75 mg, respectively, had a platelet count of more than 50,000 per cubic millimeter, and 88% and 81% of patients in these groups had a response by day 15. Panel B shows the median platelet counts at each visit, with the 25th and 75th percentiles shown as I bars, on the basis of LOCF data. By day 15, the median platelet counts for the groups receiving 50 mg and 75 mg of eltrombopag approached the normal range and remained there for the duration of the 6-week treatment period. Panel C shows the median platelet count at each weekly visit during the treatment period and at each biweekly visit after the treatment period on the basis of observed data. Patients who withdrew before day 43 were included in the follow-up. Discontinuation of treatment with 50 or 75 mg of eltrombopag before completion of the 6-week treatment period was primarily due to achievement of a platelet count of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter. The median observed platelet counts remained elevated at 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter for the duration of the treatment in the groups receiving 50 mg and 75 mg of eltrombopag and returned to or were close to baseline levels within 2 weeks after the cessation of treatment. Panel D shows response rates according to the three stratification variables — use or nonuse of concomitant ITP therapy (primarily prednisone or prednisolone), splenectomy status, and baseline platelet count (>15,000 per cubic millimeter or ≤15,000 per cubic millimeter). A dose–response relationship was observed for each stratification variable.\n\n【38】The primary end point, a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter on day 43, was achieved in 81% of patients (21 of 26) given 75 mg of eltrombopag, 70% of patients (19 of 27) given 50 mg, and 28% of patients (8 of 29) given 30 mg; 11% of patients (3 of 27) in the placebo group reached the end point (P<0.001 for the groups taking 50 mg and 75 mg of eltrombopag) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Results were similar in an analysis of data at day 43 with no last-observation-carried-forward imputation: 73% (8 of 11), 56% (9 of 16), and 22% (5 of 23) of patients given 75 mg, 50 mg, or 30 mg of eltrombopag, respectively, and 10% (2 of 21) of patients given placebo reached the primary end point (two-sided P=0.002 for the comparison of 50 mg with placebo and P=0.001 for the comparison of 75 mg with placebo). At the first visit (day 8), 44% of patients receiving 50 mg of eltrombopag and 62% of those receiving 75 mg had a platelet count of 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter. By day 15, 88% of patients receiving 50 mg and 81% of those receiving 75 mg had a response 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>, with the median platelet count (last-observation-carried-forward data) approaching the normal range (i.e., 150,000 to 400,000 per cubic millimeter); at these two doses, the 25th percentile of the platelet counts was approximately 50,000 per cubic millimeter 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. After the first interim analysis showed that the two highest eltrombopag doses met predefined stopping criteria for efficacy, the trial was stopped by the sponsor. The median platelet count for patients who continued treatment 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u> was maintained at 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter at each subsequent visit during treatment in the groups receiving 50 mg or 75 mg of eltrombopag (observed data, Figure 2C ).\n\n【39】During the study, platelet counts rose to more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter in 4% of patients (1 of 27) in the placebo group and in 14% (4 of 29), 37% (10 of 27), and 50% (13 of 26) in the groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag, respectively. The increase in the platelet count to more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter occurred earlier in the group receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag than in the other eltrombopag groups. After 1 week of treatment (day 8), more than 10% of patients in the groups receiving 50 mg or 75 mg of eltrombopag had platelet counts of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter, and by day 15, more than 25% of patients in these two groups had a platelet count of more than 200,000 per cubic millimeter. Median platelet counts in these two groups returned to levels near baseline within 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>.\n\n【40】Further analyses showed no significant interaction between a response and prior splenectomy, age, or race (white vs. nonwhite). In all groups except those receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag, there was a higher percentage of responders among patients using concomitant ITP medication. Among patients who had a baseline platelet count of more than 15,000 per cubic millimeter, there was a substantially higher percentage of responders in all groups except for the group receiving 30 mg of eltrombopag (in which the overall percentage of responders was lowest) (two-sided P=0.093 for patients taking concomitant ITP medications and P=0.042 for patients with a baseline platelet count >15,000 per cubic millimeter) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2D )</u>.\n\n【41】Bleeding\n--------\n\n【42】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Incidence of Bleeding Symptoms during and after Treatment According to Treatment Group.\n\n【43】The incidence of bleeding symptoms (defined according to the World Health Organization bleeding scale) decreased as platelet counts increased during treatment for patients receiving 50 mg or 75 mg of eltrombopag. The occurrence of bleeding symptoms gradually returned to baseline levels during the 6 weeks of follow-up, as the platelet counts returned to near-baseline levels.\n\n【44】During treatment with eltrombopag (50 mg or 75 mg), the incidence of bleeding (assessed according to the WHO bleeding scale) decreased 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u> as the platelet count increased and gradually returned to baseline levels during the 6 weeks of follow-up, as the platelet count returned to near-baseline levels. The incidence of bleeding events during treatment, regardless of grade and cause, was 14% in the placebo group and 17%, 7%, and 4% in the groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag, respectively.\n\n【45】Thrombopoietin Levels\n---------------------\n\n【46】Median baseline serum thrombopoietin levels were 54 ng per liter in the placebo group and 56, 57, and 54 ng per liter in the eltrombopag groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg, respectively — all within the range in healthy volunteers (26 to 209 ng per liter). 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Similar median serum thrombopoietin levels were observed at day 43 (59 ng per liter in the placebo group and 49, 52, and 45 ng per liter in the groups receiving 30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag, respectively). Patients with a response generally had platelet counts within the normal range as well as normal thrombopoietin levels.\n\n【47】Quality of Life\n---------------\n\n【48】Health-related quality of life, based on the physical and mental component scores of the SF36v2 survey, was similar at baseline and at the end of the study. Individual dimension scores, such as those for physical health and vitality, remained similar. The single exception was a significant decrease from baseline in the mean emotional-role score for the group receiving 75 mg of eltrombopag (P=0.02).\n\n【49】Safety and Adverse Events\n-------------------------\n\n【50】Table 2.  Table 2. Adverse Events in 5% or More of Patients in Any Study Group.\n\n【51】The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar for all four study groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The most common adverse event in each group, including the placebo group, was mild to moderate headache. The number of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 adverse events 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> during the study, or within 30 days after discontinuation of the study treatment, was similar among all four study groups. A single case of cataract progression was reported 181 days after the last dose of study medication in a 60-year-old woman with a history of glucocorticoid use and cigarette smoking who received 75 mg of eltrombopag daily for 8 days. The event was assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug.\n\n【52】The only death occurred in a 66-year-old man who had undergone a pneumonectomy for non–small-cell lung cancer and entered the study with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and peripheral edema. He received 50 mg of eltrombopag for 21 days and had grade 3 pneumonia, hepatitis, and renal insufficiency and grade 4 exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Twenty-five days after entering the study, the patient died of cardiopulmonary failure, with clinical signs of sepsis. Thromboemboli were noted in the small vessels of the liver and kidneys on autopsy.\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】This dose-ranging study of eltrombopag, an oral small-molecule nonpeptide platelet growth factor, showed that a daily dose of 50 or 75 mg of the drug is an effective short-term treatment for chronic ITP. At these doses, eltrombopag elevated platelet counts to 50,000 or more per cubic millimeter in more than 80% of patients within 2 weeks. Platelet counts rose above 200,000 per cubic millimeter in 37% of patients receiving 50 mg of eltrombopag and in 50% of patients receiving 75 mg — and this level was reached sooner in patients receiving the 75-mg dose. Patients with refractory disease after splenectomy responded in the same way as patients who had not undergone splenectomy. There was no significant difference between the placebo and eltrombopag groups in the incidence and severity of adverse events. The trial was stopped by the sponsor after the first interim analysis showed that the two highest doses (50 and 75 mg per day) met the predefined stopping criteria for efficacy. These data confirm that a treatment designed to increase platelet production in ITP can be effective, as was demonstrated with the thrombopoiesis-stimulating protein AMG 531. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】Our patients had normal thrombopoietin levels, a finding that has been reported in other patients with ITP. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,25,26 </a></sup></u> In this study, thrombopoietin levels were unaffected by treatment with eltrombopag.\n\n【56】At the two highest doses of eltrombopag, bleeding decreased as the platelet count increased, indicating the hemostatic efficacy of the newly produced platelets. Rates of adverse events were similar in the placebo group and the three groups receiving eltrombopag, with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicity. Cataracts had been observed in studies of eltrombopag in rodents, but no treatment-related cataracts were observed in this study. We are continuing to evaluate the risk of cataracts in our patients, who have multiple risk factors for cataracts (e.g., advanced age and long-term use of glucocorticoids).\n\n【57】Unanswered questions about the use of eltrombopag and other thrombopoietic growth factors concern their role and safety in long-term treatment and whether such agents are effective in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. It is also not known whether patients whose platelet counts do not respond to 75 mg of eltrombopag would have a response to higher doses.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Presented in part at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Atlanta, June 2–6, 2006; at the 11th Congress of the European Hematology Association, Amsterdam, June 15–18, 2006; and at the 48th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, Orlando, FL, December 9–12, 2006.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Bussel reports receiving research grants from Amgen, Biogen–IDEC, Cangene, Genentech, GSK, and Sysmex; lecture fees from Baxter; and consulting fees from Amgen, Symphogen, GSK, and Baxter; and reports having equity ownership in Amgen and GSK.

All patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 105, with a higher score indicating a worse quality of life) and underwent echocardiography and a 6-minute walk test (the composite primary end point). Over a 6-month period, patients were monitored for both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In all, 41 patients underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, and 40 underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; none were lost to follow-up at 6 months. The composite primary end point favored the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, with an improved questionnaire score at 6 months (60, vs. 82 in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing; P<0.001), a longer 6-minute-walk distance (340 m vs. 297 m, P<0.001), and a higher ejection fraction (35% vs. 28%, P<0.001). In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, 88% of patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs and 71% of those not receiving such drugs were free of atrial fibrillation at 6 months. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, pulmonary-vein stenosis developed in two patients, pericardial effusion in one, and pulmonary edema in another; in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, lead dislodgment was found in one patient and pneumothorax in another.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Pulmonary-vein isolation was superior to atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure who had drug-refractory atrial fibrillation. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00599976 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Trials of ablation for atrial fibrillation have shown the procedure to be efficacious in reducing morbidity, improving the quality of life and functional capacity, and, in a retrospective analysis comparing ablation and antiarrhythmic medications, reducing mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-7 </a></sup></u> Increasingly, patients with heart failure have atrial fibrillation as well, and studies have shown that the efficacy rates for ablation are similar in this population with a low ejection fraction and among patients with heart failure alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-10 </a></sup></u> Atrioventricular-node ablation has been used to treat symptomatic atrial fibrillation with poor rate control, although few patients in these studies had a low ejection fraction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Recently, biventricular pacing was found to be superior to right ventricular pacing after atrioventricular-node ablation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Thus, the Pulmonary Vein Antrum Isolation versus AV Node Ablation with Bi-Ventricular Pacing for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure (PABA-CHF) study was undertaken to compare pulmonary-vein isolation with atrioventricular-node ablation and biventricular pacing with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) (atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing) in patients with a low ejection fraction and symptomatic atrial fibrillation.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】The PABA-CHF study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing pulmonary-vein isolation with atrioventricular-node biventricular pacing. We studied patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and symptoms of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure, despite the use of antiarrhythmic medications. Patients were included if they had an ejection fraction of 40% or less; had a medication regimen of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors and, in patients with NYHA class III heart failure, spironolactone; were able to complete a 6-minute walk test; and were 18 years of age or older. The institutional review board at each participating center reviewed and approved the study.\n\n【14】Exclusion criteria were reversible causes of atrial fibrillation and heart failure; postoperative atrial fibrillation; previous maze or maze-like surgery; previous left atrial ablation; a life expectancy of 2 years or less; a high probability of undergoing cardiac transplantation within the next 12 months; a contraindication to antiarrhythmic or anticoagulation medications; severe pulmonary disease; a documented intraatrial thrombus, tumor, or other abnormality that precludes catheter placement; or cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, or percutaneous coronary intervention within the previous 3 months.\n\n【15】Randomization was computer-generated. After providing written informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to undergo either pulmonary-vein isolation or atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, with follow-up at 3 and 6 months that consisted of a clinical assessment, 6-minute walk test, echocardiographic study, and completion of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 21 questions regarding patients' perception of the effects of heart failure on their daily lives; the score for each question ranges from 0 to 5, producing a total score of 0 to 105, with a higher score indicating a worse quality of life.\n\n【16】Crossover of patients from the assigned group to the other treatment group was discouraged during the study period, although patients assigned to the group undergoing pulmonary-vein isolation were permitted to undergo implantation of an ICD for primary or secondary prophylaxis against sudden death from cardiac causes. In addition, after the study period, patients were allowed to cross over to the other treatment.\n\n【17】The primary end point was a composite of ejection fraction, distance on the 6-minute walk test, and MLWHF score. The primary end point of the trial was reached if all three end points had a P value of less than 0.05 for the comparison between baseline, if two end points had a P value of less than 0.025, or if one end point had a P value of less than 0.017 (similar to the composite end point used in the Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation \\[MIRACLE\\] and the Multicenter InSync ICD Randomized Clinical Evaluation \\[MIRACLE ICD\\] trials). 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-15 </a></sup></u> Both patients and physicians were made aware of the treatment assignments; however, collection of results of the 6-minute walk test, echocardiographic measurements, and MLWHF scores was performed without knowledge of the treatment assignments.\n\n【18】Follow-up was performed with the use of a loop event monitor that patients wore at months 2 through 6 after the procedure. Patients were instructed to record any symptoms and to record at least two or three transmissions weekly even if they were asymptomatic. Episodes were recorded if the duration was longer than 30 seconds. All but one patient in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation sent transmissions through month 6. One patient stopped sending transmissions 4 months after randomization, but he did follow up at month 6. All transmissions up to month 4 revealed sinus rhythm. Four patients in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing stopped sending transmissions after it was clear that they had persistent atrial fibrillation; device interrogation at 6 months confirmed the persistence of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【19】Pulmonary-Vein Isolation\n------------------------\n\n【20】Details of the pulmonary-vein–isolation procedure have been described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4,7 </a></sup></u> The ablation and circular-mapping catheters were advanced to the left atrium through sheaths from the right femoral vein after double transseptal puncture was performed with guidance from intracardiac echocardiography. Intravenous heparin was given with a target activated clotting time of 350 to 400 seconds.\n\n【21】The goal of the procedure was isolation of all pulmonary-vein antra with the aid of the circular-mapping catheter and the use of an ablation catheter with a tip 8 mm in length. Additionally, intracardiac echocardiography or venography was used to locate the pulmonary veins. Isolation was complete when no further pulmonary-vein potentials were recorded in the pulmonary-vein antra or no dissociated firing was seen. Ablation of additional linear lesions and the sources of complex fractionated electrograms was performed according to the preference of the center.\n\n【22】Warfarin was started after completion of the pulmonary-vein isolation and was continued for 3 months with target international normalized ratio of 2 or 3. Antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued after 2 months. The antiarrhythmic medications could be restarted at the discretion of the treating physician after 2 months. All reinitiations of antiarrhythmic medications were noted. After 3 and 6 months, warfarin was continued at the discretion of the treating physician. All patients were monitored for pulmonary-vein stenosis at 3 months and, if a second procedure was performed, at 6 months. A second pulmonary-vein isolation procedure or a procedure for atrial flutter could be performed at 3 months if atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter recurred. If patients underwent a second ablation, they were followed for a total of 6 months after the last ablation, and the 6-month analysis was done using these follow-up data. All patients underwent computed tomography at baseline and at 3 months after ablation to assess for pulmonary-vein stenosis.\n\n【23】Atrioventricular-Node Ablation with Biventricular Pacing\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Patients assigned to atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing underwent atrioventricular-node ablation and placement of a biventricular ICD. Ablation of the bundle of His was targeted with an ablation catheter to achieve complete atrioventricular block. Subsequently, a biventricular ICD system with an atrial lead was implanted. With the aid of venography, placement of the coronary sinus lead in a posterolateral or lateral branch was preferred if permitted by the coronary venous anatomy. Defibrillation-threshold testing was done to ensure a safety margin of at least 10 J. The type and settings of the device and the atrioventricular and venoventricular timing were chosen by the physician.\n\n【25】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【26】The primary end point was a composite of the ejection fraction, distance on the 6-minute walk test, and MLWHF score at 6 months. For this composite end point, the difference between the study groups was considered to be significant if all three components had P values of less than 0.05, if two components had P values of less than 0.025, or if one component had a P value of less than 0.017. The secondary end points were freedom from atrial fibrillation and left atrial internal diameter at 6 months; for each of these end points, the difference between the groups was considered to be significant if the associated P value was less than 0.05. We estimated that 40 patients per group would be needed to detect differences of 35 m in the distance on the 6-minute walk test, 6% in the ejection fraction, and 15 points in the MLWHF score (for a statistical power of 80% with a two-sided alpha of 0.017). All end points were examined by means of an intention-to-treat analysis. All reported P values are two-sided. All categorical variables were compared with Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were expressed as means (±SD) and were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests.\n\n【27】For recurrence of atrial fibrillation, data for the first 2 months in each group were censored, since early recurrence after pulmonary-vein isolation does not correlate with recurrence during a longer follow-up period and may reflect inflammation due to the procedure. All other recordings were used to classify the patient's rhythm status. Any recording of atrial fibrillation for more than 30 seconds was considered to be recurrent atrial fibrillation. If a second pulmonary-vein–isolation procedure was performed, data were censored for an additional month after the procedure.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Follow-up of Study Patients.\n\n【31】AV denotes atrioventricular.Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【32】Between November 2002 and June 2006, a total of 177 patients were screened, of whom 81 were eligible for and consented to participate in the study. In all, 41 patients were randomly assigned to undergo pulmonary-vein isolation and 40 to undergo atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. No patients were lost to follow-up. The baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . The distances on the 6-minute walk, ejection fractions, and MLWHF scores were similar to those in previous trials involving patients with heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,15 </a></sup></u> At baseline, in the pulmonary-vein isolation group, 33 patients were receiving amiodarone, and 8 were receiving class III antiarrhythmic medications. In the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, 36 patients were receiving amiodarone, and 4 patients were receiving class III antiarrhythmic medications.\n\n【33】Freedom from Atrial Fibrillation\n--------------------------------\n\n【34】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Freedom from Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Undergoing Pulmonary-Vein Isolation with or without Antiarrhythmic Drugs (AAD).\n\n【35】All patients undergoing atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing had continuation of atrial fibrillation at 3 and 6 months. Among patients undergoing pulmonary-vein isolation, 78% were free from atrial fibrillation at 3 months, with or without the use of antiarrhythmic medications 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. At 6 months, there had been eight repeat procedures for recurrent atrial fibrillation (in four patients) and atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia (in four other patients), and 88% of patients in the pulmonary-vein isolation group had freedom from atrial fibrillation with or without the use of antiarrhythmic medications. At 6 months, 71% of those patients were free from atrial fibrillation and from antiarrhythmic medications. All patients had symptomatic recurrence of atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia, except for two patients in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation.\n\n【36】Morphologic Changes on Echocardiography\n---------------------------------------\n\n【37】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Composite Primary End Point of Ejection Fraction, 6-Minute Walk Distance, and Score on the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire at 6 Months.\n\n【38】There were significant improvements in each component of the primary end point in the group of patients who underwent pulmonary-vein isolation (PVI), as compared with those who underwent atrioventricular (AV) node ablation with biventricular pacing (BiV).\n\n【39】Ejection fraction and left atrial internal diameter were measured with the use of echocardiography. At 6 months, the difference in the mean ejection fraction between the two groups was significant: 35±9% for pulmonary-vein isolation, as compared with 28±6% for atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. The mean absolute change in the ejection fraction was an increase of 8±8% with pulmonary-vein isolation as compared with a decrease of 1±4% with atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001). The ejection fraction improved in 76% of patients who underwent pulmonary-vein isolation but only in 25% of patients who underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing.\n\n【40】Left atrial internal diameter decreased in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, from 4.9±0.5 cm at baseline to 4.5±0.4 cm at 6 months, whereas left atrial internal diameter increased slightly in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, from 4.7±0.6 cm to 4.9±0.6 cm (P<0.001 for the comparison of the two groups at 6 months). The mean change in left atrial internal diameter was a reduction of 0.4±0.3 cm with pulmonary-vein isolation as compared with an increase of 0.1±0.2 cm with atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001). There was improvement in left atrial internal diameter in 80% of patients undergoing pulmonary-vein isolation but in only 15% of patients undergoing atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing.\n\n【41】Functional Capacity and Quality of Life\n---------------------------------------\n\n【42】Functional capacity was measured as distance on the 6-minute walk test. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, the distance increased from 269±54 m at baseline to 340±49 m at 6 months, as compared with 281±44 m to 297±36 m at 6 months in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>.\n\n【43】The quality of life was measured as the score on the MLWHF questionnaire, on which a lower score indicates a better quality of life. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, the mean score improved, with a reduction from 89±12 at baseline to 60±8 at 6 months 删除2:<u>( Figure 3C )</u>. In the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, scores also improved, though not as much: a reduction from 89±11 at baseline to 82±14 at 6 months (P<0.001 for the comparison between the two groups at 6 months).\n\n【44】Primary End Point\n-----------------\n\n【45】The criteria for significant differences between the groups with respect to the primary end point were met, since the differences at 6 months for all three components (ejection fraction, distance on 6-minute walk, and MLWHF score) had P values of less than 0.017, thus satisfying any one of the three criteria. For pulmonary-vein isolation as compared with atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, at 6 months the ejection fraction was significantly higher (35±9% vs. 28±6%, P<0.001), the 6-minute walking distance significantly longer (340±49 m vs. 297±36 m, P<0.001), and the MLWHF scores significantly better (60±8 vs. 82±14, P<0.001).\n\n【46】Type of Atrial Fibrillation and Progression\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Patients were classified as having atrial fibrillation that was paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent. Progression of atrial fibrillation was defined as atrial fibrillation that was becoming more advanced, and regression as atrial fibrillation that was becoming less advanced or disappearing. Progression was found in none of the patients who underwent pulmonary-vein isolation but in 30% of patients who underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001). Conversely, the type of atrial fibrillation improved from nonparoxysmal to paroxysmal in 100% of patients in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation as compared with 5% in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (P<0.001). At 6 months, more patients were receiving antiarrhythmic medications in the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing (14 patients receiving amiodarone and 1 receiving class III agents) than in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation (5 patients receiving amiodarone, 4 receiving class III agents, and 1 receiving class IC agents).\n\n【48】We investigated whether the improvement in morphologic and functional variables in the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation occurred predominantly in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or in those with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation. Although the ejection fraction had increased by 3±3 percentage points at 6 months in the subgroup of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the increase among patients with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation was 12±10 percentage points (P<0.001). Similarly, there was greater improvement in the nonparoxysmal subgroup than in the paroxysmal subgroup in the 6-minute walking distance (an increase of 99±66 m vs. 43±23 m, P=0.002), the MLWHF score (a decrease of 33±14 points vs. 24±8 points, P=0.001), and the left atrial internal diameter (an increase of 0.6±0.3 cm vs. 0.2±0.2 cm, P<0.001).\n\n【49】Complications\n-------------\n\n【50】There were no significant differences in the number of complications between the two groups. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, three patients had groin bleeding, one had pericardial effusion, and another had pulmonary edema. There were also two patients with mild, asymptomatic stenosis of a single pulmonary vein. In the group that underwent atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing, two patients had left ventricular-lead dislodgment, two had a high left ventricular threshold, two had pocket hematoma, and one had pneumothorax. No patients died during the procedure or during follow-up.\n\n【51】Discussion\n----------\n\n【52】This randomized, controlled trial compared pulmonary-vein isolation with the combination of atrioventricular-node ablation and biventricular pacing for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and an ejection fraction of 40% or less. The significance criteria for the composite primary end point were met, favoring pulmonary-vein isolation, with significant improvements in the ejection fraction, 6-minute walk distance, and MLWHF score. In the group that underwent pulmonary-vein isolation, freedom from atrial fibrillation at 6 months was seen in 88% of patients regardless of the use of antiarrhythmic medications and in 71% without the use of antiarrhythmic medications and with the use of at least one repeat procedure.\n\n【53】It has been argued that the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000556) favors rate-control therapy over a rhythm-control approach. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> In fact, atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing can be considered an extreme form of the rate-control strategy and of rate regularization. However, limitations of AFFIRM included the exclusion, at the discretion of the participating centers, of patients who were symptomatic or thought to benefit from rhythm control. In fact, a subsequent analysis of the AFFIRM data has shown that restoration of sinus rhythm is related to survival and that rhythm control with the use of antiarrhythmic medications does not have a high success rate. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> However, our study has shown that pulmonary-vein isolation (a form of rhythm control) has a high success rate and that, as compared with the best possible rate-control and rate-regularization strategy (atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing), pulmonary-vein isolation provides superior morphologic and functional improvements. The rationale for using atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing in patients with mean heart rates of less than 100 beats per minute derives from data showing that not only does cardiac function improve with regularization of the ventricular rate in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation who have normal ventricular rates, but symptoms also improve. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18,19 </a></sup></u> In addition, patients undergoing atrioventricular-node ablation have improved 6-minute walk distances and feel better when a biventricular ICD is implanted, as compared with a right ventricular ICD alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】An unexpected observation was the high incidence of progression of atrial fibrillation associated with atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing. This finding makes atrioventricular-node ablation with biventricular pacing a less appealing option in centers where experienced atrial-fibrillation ablationists are available to perform pulmonary-vein isolation, a more definitive ablation procedure.\n\n【55】A subgroup analysis showed that, as compared with patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, those with nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation derived more benefit from pulmonary-vein isolation in terms of the ejection fraction, 6-minute walking distance, quality-of-life score, and left atrial internal diameter. These data may contradict the conventional wisdom that patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation are thought to have such an advanced form of atrial fibrillation as to preclude pulmonary-vein isolation.\n\n【56】The study has several limitations. Pulmonary-vein isolation was performed at centers with experienced ablationists, and the results thus may not be reproducible in all centers. In addition, the results might vary with longer follow-up. Also, the study was not blinded, and cost-effectiveness was not addressed.\n\n【57】In this study of symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation and an ejection fraction of 40% or less, an ablation strategy involving pulmonary-vein isolation was found to be superior to atrioventricular-node ablation with implantation of a biventricular ICD, in terms of morphologic, functional, and quality-of-life variables. In addition, the pulmonary-vein–isolation strategy resulted in high rates of freedom from both atrial fibrillation and antiarrhythmic medications. In such a population, pulmonary-vein isolation should be strongly considered at experienced centers.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (257-2) from the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic and by a St. Jude Medical Educational Grant.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Khan reports receiving lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Jaïs, consulting fees from St. Jude Medical, Sorin Medical, and Biosense Webster; Dr. Cummings, consulting fees from St. Jude Medical and lecture fees from Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Corazon, Biosense Webster, and Siemens; Dr. Sanders, consulting fees from Medtronic and St. Jude Medical and lecture fees from St. Jude Medical, Biosense Webster, and Bard Electrophysiology; Dr. Kautzner, consulting and lecture fees from Boston Scientific, Biosense Webster, Medtronic, and St. Jude Medical; Dr. Wazni, lecture fees from St. Jude Medical; Dr. Schweikert, lecture fees from Medtronic, Biotronik, St. Jude Medical, Boston Scientific, Reliant Pharmaceuticals, Biosense Webster, and Siemens; and Dr. Saliba, lecture fees from Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and St. Jude Medical.

The participants were assigned to intramuscular dexamethasone or identical placebo. The primary outcomes were neonatal death alone, stillbirth or neonatal death, and possible maternal bacterial infection; neonatal death alone and stillbirth or neonatal death were evaluated with superiority analyses, and possible maternal bacterial infection was evaluated with a noninferiority analysis with the use of a prespecified margin of 1.25 on the relative scale.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 2852 women 删除4:<u>(and their 3070 fetuses)</u> from 29 secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan underwent randomization. The trial was stopped for benefit at the second interim analysis. Neonatal death occurred in 278 of 1417 infants (19.6%) in the dexamethasone group and in 331 of 1406 infants (23.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.72 to 0.97; P=0.03). Stillbirth or neonatal death occurred in 393 of 1532 fetuses and infants (25.7%) and in 444 of 1519 fetuses and infants (29.2%), respectively (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99; P=0.04); the incidence of possible maternal bacterial infection was 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively (relative risk, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.03). There was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of adverse events.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among women in low-resource countries who were at risk for early preterm birth, the use of dexamethasone resulted in significantly lower risks of neonatal death alone and stillbirth or neonatal death than the use of placebo, without an increase in the incidence of possible maternal bacterial infection.

These findings reopened the debate about the safety and efficacy of antenatal glucocorticoids in low-resource countries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Because of these considerations, in 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that antenatal glucocorticoids should be used only under certain conditions, including the accurate assessment of gestational age, imminent preterm birth, the absence of maternal infection, and adequate care for childbirth and preterm newborns. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The guideline panel and an expert panel that was subsequently convened by the WHO identified the conduct of efficacy trials in hospitals in low-resource countries as a research priority in order to resolve this controversy and guide clinicians and policymakers on the use of antenatal glucocorticoids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> We conducted the WHO ACTION-I (Antenatal Corticosteroids for Improving Outcomes in Preterm Newborns) trial, a randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone in women in hospitals in low-resource countries who were at risk for early preterm birth.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【16】We designed a multicountry, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, individually randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare intramuscular dexamethasone with identical placebo in women at risk for imminent preterm birth. We conducted the trial at 29 secondary- and tertiary-level hospitals across six trial sites in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The trial protocol , which has been published previously, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. It was approved by the relevant ethics committees and regulatory agencies in each country and by the WHO Ethics Review Committee. WHO was the trial sponsor. A steering group comprising a trial coordinating unit, principal investigators, and technical advisors provided trial oversight.\n\n【17】Fresenius Kabi–Labesfal (Portugal) produced dexamethasone sodium phosphate and identical placebo, which were packaged and shipped to the trial sites by Ivers–Lee Clinical Supplies Management (Switzerland). Fresenius Kabi–Labesfal had no role in the trial design, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data, the writing of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The first, second, third, and seventh members of the writing committee vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【18】Trial Setting\n-------------\n\n【19】The trial hospitals were selected through a standardized assessment of maternal and newborn health care services 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org)</u> to ensure that the WHO criteria for antenatal glucocorticoid treatment could be reasonably met. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> To make the trial procedures consistent and to ensure that the trial participants received at least the minimum quality of care, ultrasonographic systems (Philips HD5, the Netherlands), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines (DiaMedica UK, United Kingdom), pulse oximeters (Masimo International, Switzerland), and glucometers were procured for all the hospitals. Standardized training was provided to all research and clinical staff.\n\n【20】Screening and Recruitment\n-------------------------\n\n【21】Pregnant women who had confirmed live fetuses between 26 weeks 0 days and 33 weeks 6 days of gestation and who were at risk for preterm birth were eligible for inclusion. The inclusion criteria were planned or expected birth in the next 48 hours (either provider-initiated preterm birth or after preterm, prelabor rupture of membranes or spontaneous labor). Gestational age was determined by the earliest ultrasonographic examination or an ultrasonographic examination performed at admission. Women were excluded if they had clinical signs of severe infection, major congenital fetal anomalies, concurrent or recent (within the previous 2 weeks) use of systemic glucocorticoids, or a contraindication to glucocorticoids or if they were participating in another trial. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before randomization.\n\n【22】Randomization and Trial Regimens\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a course of intramuscular injections of either 6 mg of dexamethasone or identical placebo administered every 12 hours, for a maximum of four doses, or until hospital discharge or birth. The women were eligible for a repeat course if they had not given birth after 7 completed days but still met the inclusion criteria. The repeat course was identical to the first course and the same as the initial assignment.\n\n【24】Site-stratified individual randomization with balanced permuted blocks of 10 were used. The computer-generated randomization sequence was prepared centrally at the WHO. All the sites received serially numbered identical packs containing ampules of 4 mg per milliliter of dexamethasone or placebo for two full courses. The trial participants, care providers, and investigators were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【25】The participants received either dexamethasone or placebo immediately after randomization. Clinical care was provided according to local guidelines. Follow-up of the fetuses was conducted until 28 days after birth or until death (stillbirth or neonatal death), whichever came first, and follow-up of the women was conducted until 28 days after they gave birth or until death, whichever came first. Trained research staff collected data during the hospital admission or admissions and during community-level visits.\n\n【26】Trial Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【27】The three primary outcomes were neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within 28 completed days of life), stillbirth or neonatal death, and a composite of possible maternal bacterial infection, defined as maternal fever (temperature ≥38°C) or clinically suspected or confirmed infection for which therapeutic antibiotics were used. The secondary outcomes were maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity as well as process-of-care outcomes (a list and definitions of these outcomes are provided in the Statistical Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【28】All trial-related information was stored securely at the trial sites. Data were double-entered into a Web-based data-management platform and centrally managed by Centro Rosarino de Estudios Perinatales (Argentina).\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】We estimated that 6018 women would have to be recruited to detect a decrease in the risk of neonatal death of 15.00% or more, from 25.00% to 21.25%, in a two-sided 5% significance test with 90% power and 10% loss to follow-up. The estimated sample size would provide more than 80% power at the 2.5% significance level to detect whether dexamethasone is noninferior to placebo for maternal infection, within a noninferiority margin of 1.25 on the relative scale. The noninferiority margin was based on the consideration that a maximum increase of 25% over a 10% baseline incidence of maternal bacterial infection could be accepted for a fetal or infant mortality benefit.\n\n【31】For the primary outcomes, intention-to-treat analyses were to be performed. We hypothesized that the use of dexamethasone would result in a decrease in the risk of neonatal death and stillbirth or neonatal death without increasing the risk of maternal infection. Therefore, we applied a superiority hypothesis to neonatal death and stillbirth or neonatal death, and we applied a noninferiority hypothesis to maternal infection. Analyses were first performed on all available data, and sensitivity analyses were then performed with the use of multiple imputation 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> to judge the effect of missing data. Analyses of primary outcomes were corrected for multiplicity with the false-discovery-rate approach. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The dexamethasone group was compared with the placebo group for the primary outcomes with the use of relative risks with 95% confidence intervals, according to a logistic model with a binomial distribution and a log link to obtain relative risks. The stratifying variable — trial site — was included in the model, as well as a clustering feature for multiple births for neonatal outcomes. For continuous variables, means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges according to group were reported. The trial groups were compared with mean or median differences and 95% confidence intervals according to a general linear model that included trial site as the stratifying variable. Separate models were fitted for each of the primary and secondary outcomes.\n\n【32】The primary outcomes were analyzed in prespecified subgroups (see the Statistical Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ). The results for all secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses are presented as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. No correction was made for multiplicity, and the width of the confidence intervals should not be used to infer treatment effects. All the models were fitted with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\n【33】Three interim analyses by the data and safety monitoring board were planned. The board members were to inform the steering group chair if, in their view, there was proof beyond a doubt that dexamethasone was indicated or contraindicated on the basis of statistical considerations (using the Haybittle–Peto stopping rule 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> for the primary outcomes for fetuses and infants) or clinical considerations, practical issues, or new external information. After the second interim analysis involving 2304 women and 2536 fetuses and infants, with complete follow-up of primary outcomes, the data and safety monitoring board decided to unblind the trial and recommended that the trial be stopped for fetus and infant mortality benefits and strong evidence of a graded dose–response effect, in the context of existing evidence of benefits of antenatal glucocorticoids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Recruitment was stopped across all sites on November 21, 2019, and all ethics committees and regulatory authorities were informed. The funders had no role in the decision to stop the trial.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up.\n\n【37】Women could have more than one reason for not meeting eligibility criteria.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Participants at Trial Entry.\n\n【38】From December 2017 through November 2019, of the 7008 women who were screened for eligibility, 2852 underwent randomization 删除4:<u>(1429 to the dexamethasone group and 1423 to the placebo group)</u> 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The most common reason for ineligibility was that birth was not planned or expected in the next 48 hours. A total of 90.0% of the infants in the dexamethasone group and 90.8% of those in the placebo group were born before 37 weeks. More than 99.0% of the women who underwent randomization and their infants completed follow-up. The characteristics of the dexamethasone and placebo groups were similar at trial entry 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table S2)</u>.\n\n【39】Adherence to Assigned Trial Regimen\n-----------------------------------\n\n【40】All the women except 1 received at least one dose of dexamethasone or placebo 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. A total of 815 of 1429 women (57.0%) in the dexamethasone group and 756 of 1423 women (53.1%) in the placebo group received all four doses in the first course. The repeat course was administered to 61 women in the dexamethasone group and 74 women in the placebo group, of whom 46 and 47 women, respectively, received four doses. The most common reason that a scheduled dose was not administered was the occurrence of birth between the administration of doses.\n\n【41】Primary Outcomes\n----------------\n\n【42】Table 2.  Table 2. Primary Outcomes.\n\n【43】There were 278 neonatal deaths among 1417 live-born infants in the dexamethasone group (19.6%) and 331 neonatal deaths among 1406 live-born infants in the placebo group (23.5%) (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.72 to 0.97; P=0.03) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. We determined that 25 women would need to be treated with dexamethasone to prevent 1 neonatal death (95% CI, 14 to 110). The incidence of stillbirth or neonatal death was also significantly lower in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group (25.7% vs. 29.2%; relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.99; P=0.04).\n\n【44】Possible maternal bacterial infection occurred in 68 of 1416 women (4.8%) in the dexamethasone group and in 89 of 1412 women (6.3%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.03; P=0.002 for noninferiority); this result was consistent with noninferiority at the prespecified margin of 1.25 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. In the per-protocol population, possible maternal bacterial infection occurred in 63 of 1393 women (4.5%) in the dexamethasone group and in 89 of 1385 women (6.4%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.96); this result was also consistent with noninferiority. Multiple imputation for missing values 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> yielded identical results for all the primary outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>.\n\n【45】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Prespecified Subgroup Analyses of Primary Neonatal Outcomes.\n\n【46】Shown are the results of the analysis of neonatal death (Panel A) and stillbirth or neonatal death (Panel B) (the primary neonatal outcomes) in prespecified subgroups. The widths of the confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity, so the intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. The size of each black square is proportional to the total number of fetuses, infants, or both in the subgroup.\n\n【47】The results according to the prespecified subgroups are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1. Analyses of neonatal death, according to the time from the first dose of dexamethasone or placebo to birth, stratified according to gestational age, suggest greater benefit with increasing time from the first dose to birth and increasing gestational age at the first dose (from 26 to 32 weeks) (Fig. S2). In a post hoc analysis of the causes of neonatal death, the frequency of neonatal death caused by respiratory distress syndrome was lower in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【48】Secondary Neonatal Outcomes\n---------------------------\n\n【49】Table 3.  Table 3. Secondary Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes.\n\n【50】The results with respect to early neonatal death, severe respiratory distress at 24 hours after birth, neonatal hypoglycemia at 6 hours after birth, major resuscitation at birth, the use of CPAP, and the duration of oxygen therapy provide support for the primary findings. Other secondary and process-of-care outcomes were similar in the dexamethasone and placebo groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Table S5)</u>.\n\n【51】Secondary Maternal Outcomes\n---------------------------\n\n【52】The secondary maternal outcomes were similar in the dexamethasone and placebo groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Five women died in the dexamethasone group, and four women died in the placebo group.\n\n【53】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【54】Prespecified maternal and neonatal outcomes were excluded from the reporting of serious adverse events. There was no significant between-group difference in the incidence of serious adverse events, which occurred in 1.1% of the women in both groups 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. No serious adverse events were reported in the neonates.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this hospital-based randomized trial conducted in low-resource countries, we found that the administration of dexamethasone to women who were at risk for early preterm birth reduced the incidences of neonatal death and stillbirth or neonatal death without increasing the incidence of maternal bacterial infection. Dexamethasone had no effect on stillbirth, but the findings for several secondary outcomes, including early neonatal death, severe respiratory distress, and the use of major neonatal resuscitation and CPAP were consistent with the overall results for neonatal deaths by 28 days. These clinical benefits were observed even though 45% of the participants received fewer than four doses of their assigned medication.\n\n【57】Our findings are generally consistent with the results of a meta-analysis of 22 trials that were mostly conducted in high-resource settings. That meta-analysis showed a substantial decrease in the incidence of neonatal death among infants of women who received glucocorticoids. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Previous efforts to increase the low use of antenatal glucocorticoids in women at risk for preterm birth in low-resource countries 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> were challenged by the results of the Antenatal Corticosteroids Trial (ACT). 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,15 </a></sup></u> ACT was a cluster-randomized trial of an implementation strategy that included provider training and tools to identify women who were eligible to receive dexamethasone at all levels of care, including primary health care and care at the community level.\n\n【58】In contrast to ACT, which selected women for treatment on the basis of their last menstrual period or measurement of uterine height and included clinical settings where resources for neonatal care were inadequate, the hospitals in our trial selected patients for whom treatment was warranted (through assessment by obstetrical physicians and verification of gestational age by ultrasonographic examination) and provided minimum standards of neonatal care, including access to oxygen and CPAP. In the current trial, 90% of the infants who were exposed to dexamethasone were born preterm, whereas only 16% of the infants exposed to dexamethasone in the ACT intervention clusters had a birth weight below the fifth percentile. The low incidence of apparent preterm birth among infants exposed to dexamethasone in ACT indicates substantial overtreatment, which may explain at least in part the lack of mortality benefit and overall harm observed. Appropriate selection of participants and the provision of a minimum standard of care appear to be critical in achieving benefits and preventing potential harms from glucocorticoids and should be incorporated into future implementation strategies.\n\n【59】The results of our trial provide reassurance regarding the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids with respect to reducing neonatal mortality in low-resource settings, and they expand the scarce body of evidence from low- and middle-income countries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-20 </a></sup></u> Although smaller trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries have suggested benefits, most of them were not placebo-controlled trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,19,20</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】The use of dexamethasone in our trial did not increase the risk of maternal or neonatal infection; this finding is consistent with those of previous trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-20 </a></sup></u> where the baseline risks of such infections are high. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21-23 </a></sup></u> The lack of effect on the overall incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia and the suggestion of a reduced risk of early hypoglycemia with the use of dexamethasone, however, were unexpected. Studies in animals and pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that neonatal hypoglycemia is a potential complication of the use of standard doses of dexamethasone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> Moreover, in the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, the administration of betamethasone to women with a singleton pregnancy at 34 weeks 0 days to 36 weeks 5 days of gestation who were at risk for preterm birth increased the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia by 60%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> The effects of maternal glucocorticoid administration on preterm infants have been inconsistent across studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>26,27 </a></sup></u> and may differ in infants with early preterm birth and those with late preterm birth.\n\n【61】The current trial is larger than previous placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of antenatal glucocorticoids in low-resource countries, and we used broad eligibility criteria. We assessed neonatal death according to the standard definition (which was largely unspecified or restricted to in-hospital deaths in previous trials 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> ), and we carefully selected hospitals that could reasonably meet minimum preconditions for glucocorticoid use. The loss to follow-up of trial participants and the percentage of participants with missing primary outcome data were very low despite the need for follow-up in the community. The trial was limited by the challenges in standardizing maternal and neonatal care across trial sites and the use of ultrasonographic examination to assess gestational age for a substantial percentage of the participants in the third trimester.\n\n【62】Further study is warranted to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen 删除3:<u><sup><a>28,29 </a></sup></u> and the safety and efficacy of administering glucocorticoids in late preterm pregnancy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> particularly in low-resource countries. The observed benefits with respect to neonatal mortality appeared to increase with tocolysis and with the duration of fetal exposure to dexamethasone; the role of tocolytic agents in safely delaying early preterm birth in women who are eligible for the use of antenatal glucocorticoids also merits further investigation.\n\n【63】The use of antenatal dexamethasone that was targeted to women at risk for imminent preterm birth in hospitals with minimum resources for maternal and preterm newborn care resulted in significantly lower risks of neonatal death and stillbirth or neonatal death than did the use of placebo, without any evidence of harm to women or newborns.\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (OPP1136821) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and by the United Nations Development Program–United Nations Population Fund–United Nations Children’s Fund– World Health Organization –World Bank Special Program of Research, Development, and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research and the Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Ageing, World Health Organization , Geneva.</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>The members of the writing committee are as follows: Olufemi T.

The outcome variable was \"awakening,\" which was defined as having comprehensible speech or the ability to follow commands. Predictor variables that we considered included both preadmission and admission data. Using discriminant analysis, we derived models from a 60 per cent random sample of cases and tested the models on the remaining 40 per cent. We judged that the best model contained four variables from the admission examination: motor response, pupillary light response, spontaneous eye movements, and blood glucose (levels below 300 mg per deciliter predicted awakening). Overall correct classification was 80 per cent in the derivation sample and 77 per cent in the test sample. In a simplified form, the model's predictions of awakening had a sensitivity of 0.92, a specificity of 0.65, a positive predictive value of 0.80, and a negative predictive value of 0.84.

Eleven countries have responded to health concerns regarding people who use drugs by opening sanctioned safe consumption sites; however, no such sites exist yet in the United States. Safe consumption sites provide a space for people to bring preobtained drugs and use them with sterile supplies under clean conditions and with safe disposal of used drug equipment. These sites provide monitoring by staff equipped and trained in the use of naloxone to reverse overdose. Most sanctioned sites can also provide related services, including voluntary screening for infectious diseases, peer counseling, wound care, and referral to other social and medical services, such as substance use treatment. Observational studies from sites outside the United States show that sanctioned safe consumption sites improve the health of people who use the sites by reducing overdose mortality, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> infectious disease risk, and drug use 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and by facilitating access to health and social services. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】In September 2014, in response to a local opioid overdose crisis, an organization in an undisclosed U.S. city opened an unsanctioned safe consumption site. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Injections by people who came to this site were monitored by trained staff and were conducted with sterile equipment on stainless-steel tables disinfected before each use, thereby limiting the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus. All syringes were used only once, after which they were disposed of safely at the site. Site staff used an online data-collection system to document every drug injection, type of drug used, opioid-involved overdose, and related death that occurred during injections at the site, and we used that information to evaluate the first 5 years of operation of this unsanctioned site. (The methods are described in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Injections, Opioid-Involved Overdoses, and Overdose Deaths at an Unsanctioned Safe Consumption Site, 2014 through 2019.\n\n【5】In total, there were 10,514 injections and 33 opioid-involved overdoses over 5 years, all of which were reversed by naloxone administered by trained staff 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. No person who overdosed was transferred to an outside medical institution, and there were no deaths. The number of overdoses increased over the years of operation, due partially to the number of injections increasing over the same period of time (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The types of drugs used at the site changed over the 5 years of operation, with a steady increase in the proportion of injections involving the combination of opioids and stimulants, from 5% in 2014 to 60% in 2019 (Fig. S2).\n\n【6】Although this evaluation was limited to one city and one site that is unsanctioned, and therefore the findings cannot be generalized, our results suggest that implementing sanctioned safe consumption sites in the United States could reduce mortality from opioid-involved overdose. Sanctioning sites could allow persons to link to other medical and social services, including treatment for substance use, and facilitate rigorous evaluation of their implementation and effect on reducing problems such as public injection of drugs and improperly discarded syringes.\n\n【7】参考删除-2:<u>Alex H.

After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children, 65.9% (95% CI, 63.2 to 68.5) of emergency department visits for single-supplement–related adverse events involved herbal or complementary nutritional products; 31.8% (95% CI, 29.2 to 34.3) involved micronutrients. Herbal or complementary nutritional products for weight loss (25.5%; 95% CI, 23.1 to 27.9) and increased energy (10.0%; 95% CI, 8.0 to 11.9) were commonly implicated. Weight-loss or energy products caused 71.8% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.1) of supplement-related adverse events involving palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia, and 58.0% (95% CI, 52.2 to 63.7) involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Among adults 65 years of age or older, choking or pill-induced dysphagia or globus caused 37.6% (95% CI, 29.1 to 46.2) of all emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events; micronutrients were implicated in 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 92.9) of these visits.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】An estimated 23,000 emergency department visits in the United States every year are attributed to adverse events related to dietary supplements. Such visits commonly involve cardiovascular manifestations from weight-loss or energy products among young adults and swallowing problems, often associated with micronutrients, among older adults. (Funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Herbals (botanical products), complementary nutritionals (e.g., amino acids), and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are all considered to be dietary supplements by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Although supplements cannot be marketed for the treatment or prevention of disease, they are often taken to address symptoms or illnesses, as well as to maintain or improve overall health. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The estimated number of supplement products increased from 4000 in 1994 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> to more than 55,000 in 2012 (the most recent year for which data are publicly available), 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and approximately half of all adults in the United States report having used at least one dietary supplement in the past month. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> In 2007, out-of-pocket expenditures for herbal or complementary nutritional products reached $14.8 billion, one third of the out-of-pocket expenditures for prescription drugs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is tasked with the oversight of dietary supplements; if a dietary supplement is found to be unsafe, the FDA can have the manufacturer remove the product from the market. However, the regulatory framework differs from that for prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers of dietary supplements containing ingredients that were introduced after October 15, 1994, are required to notify the FDA before marketing and to provide a rationale for the safety of the ingredients, such as historical use. However, neither safety testing nor FDA approval is required before the marketing of dietary supplements. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Postmarketing reporting of adverse events by dietary-supplement manufacturers is required only for serious 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> adverse events (e.g., those resulting in hospitalization, significant disability, or death), and voluntary reporting may substantially underestimate the adverse events associated with dietary supplements. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> Postmarketing regulatory actions to remove adulterated supplement products from the market have received public attention. From 2004 through 2012, more than 200 recalls were issued for dietary supplements containing unapproved regulated substances or impurities, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> and calls for changes in oversight have followed. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,12-18</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】The safety of dietary supplements that are not known to be adulterated remains poorly described, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> however. Data are lacking to quantify the frequency of adverse events associated with dietary supplements in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,20-24 </a></sup></u> We used nationally representative surveillance data to estimate the number of emergency department visits for adverse events related to dietary supplements and to identify the associated characteristics of the patients, products, and types of adverse events.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Data Collection\n---------------\n\n【17】We estimated the number of emergency department visits for adverse events associated with dietary supplements in the United States using 10 years of data 删除4:<u>(from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2013)</u> from the 63 hospitals participating in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES) project conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the FDA, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These hospitals make up a nationally representative probability sample drawn from all hospitals with at least six beds and 24-hour emergency departments (excluding psychiatric and penal institutions) in the United States and its territories, with four strata based on hospital size and a fifth stratum for pediatric hospitals.\n\n【18】Trained abstractors at each hospital reviewed the clinical records of every emergency department visit to identify physician-diagnosed adverse events and reported up to 2 implicated products and 10 concomitant products, as described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> Abstractors also recorded narrative descriptions of the event, including preceding circumstances, physician diagnoses, testing, treatments administered in the emergency department or by emergency medical services, and patient outcome. Narrative data were coded with the use of the _Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities_ (MedDRA), version 9.1. Since data collection is considered to be a public health surveillance activity, no approval from institutional ethics committees or review boards was required. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】Study Definitions\n-----------------\n\n【20】Cases were defined as emergency department visits for problems that the treating clinician explicitly attributed to the use of dietary supplements. This analysis included orally administered herbal or complementary nutritional products (including botanicals, microbial additives, and amino acids) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) but excluded products that are typically considered to be foods or drinks (e.g., energy drinks, herbal tea beverages). Additional products that are often used by consumers for complementary health but do not fall under the regulatory definition of dietary supplements (e.g., topically administered herbal or homeopathic products) were also included in the analysis. Herbal or complementary nutritional products were categorized according to common reasons for use. (For detailed definitions and specific products, see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)\n\n【21】Adverse events were categorized as adverse reactions, allergic reactions, excess doses, unsupervised ingestion by children, or other events (e.g., choking). Cases involving death on the way to the emergency department or after arrival were excluded because death registration practices vary among participating hospitals, and details about event circumstances are often lacking. Visits involving intentional self-harm, drug abuse, therapeutic failures, nonadherence, or withdrawal were also excluded. The categorization of symptoms was based on MedDRA-coded narratives.\n\n【22】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【23】The Consumer Product Safety Commission weighted cases of adverse events on the basis of the inverse probability of selection after adjustment for nonresponse and hospital nonparticipation and accounting for changes in the number of U.S. emergency department visits each year. We calculated national estimates as the sum of the number of cases multiplied by their respective weights and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, using the SURVEYMEANS procedure in SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Cumulative estimates and corresponding confidence intervals were divided by 10 to calculate average annual estimates and confidence intervals. We used the SURVEYFREQ procedure with the Rao–Scott modified chi-square test to assess differences in weighted proportions. We used SURVEYLOGISTIC and SURVEYREG procedures to assess linear trends in biennial estimates of emergency department visits. Biennial estimates were used to allow trend analyses to be conducted for categories of supplements associated with a small number of cases. We used intercensal estimates from the Census Bureau to calculate population rates. All analyses accounted for weighting and complex sample design. We considered that cumulative estimates of less than 1200, estimates that are based on fewer than 20 cases, or estimates with with coefficients of variation of more than 30% are statistically unreliable and are thus noted. Analyses of implicated products and symptoms were limited to cases in which a single dietary supplement product was implicated; unsupervised ingestions by children were analyzed separately.\n\n【24】Results\n-------\n\n【25】Supplement-Related Emergency Department Visits\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Table 1.  Table 1. Number of Cases and National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits per Year for Adverse Events Associated with Dietary Supplements (2004–2013).\n\n【27】On the basis of 3667 cases identified from 2004 through 2013, we calculated an average of 23,005 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 18,611 to 27,398) emergency department visits for adverse events associated with dietary supplements annually and further estimated that these visits would result in an average of 2154 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 1342 to 2967)</u> hospitalizations annually 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In 88.3% of emergency department visits, clinicians attributed adverse events to only one supplement (as compared with multiple supplements). More than half of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involved female patients. The mean age of patients who were treated for supplement-related adverse events was 32 years; more than a quarter (28.0%) of emergency department visits that were attributed to supplement-related adverse events involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Persons 65 years of age or older were more likely to be hospitalized than were younger persons, with rates of 16.0% and 8.4%, respectively (P=0.003) 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. One fifth of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involved unsupervised ingestion by children.\n\n【28】Products\n--------\n\n【29】Most emergency department visits for unsupervised ingestion of supplements by children involved a micronutrient product (61.9%; 95% CI, 56.5 to 67.3). The specific product categories that were most commonly implicated were multivitamins (33.6%; 95% CI, 29.0 to 38.3), iron (11.8%; 95% CI, 8.6 to 15.0), supplements for weight loss (10.4%; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.1), and supplements for sleep, sedation, or anxiolysis (8.8%; 95% CI, 6.0 to 11.5).\n\n【30】Table 2.  Table 2. National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits for Adverse Events Associated with Dietary Supplements, According to Product Category (2004–2013).\n\n【31】After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, 65.9% of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involved a single herbal or complementary nutritional product; 31.8% involved a single micronutrient product 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, a weight-loss product was implicated in 25.5% of emergency department visits and an energy product in 10.0% of such visits.\n\n【32】### _According to Sex of Patients_\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits for Adverse Events Associated with Dietary Supplements, According to Sex and Product Category (2004–2013).\n\n【34】Shown are the estimated number of emergency department visits per year, after the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children, during a 10-year period. National estimates are based on fewer than 20 cases or have a coefficient of variation of more than 30% and may be statistically unreliable for the following combinations of product category and sex of the patient: sexual-enhancement products among women, bodybuilding products among women, and calcium among men.\n\n【35】Weight-loss products were implicated in an estimated 3399 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 2618 to 4180)</u> emergency department visits per year by female patients, almost three times the number of emergency department visits by male patients associated with these products 删除4:<u>(1223; 95% CI, 858 to 1588)</u> 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of the total number of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events, weight-loss products were implicated in 30.4% (95% CI, 27.4 to 33.4) of such visits among female patients, as compared with 17.6% (95% CI, 14.3 to 20.9) among male patients. Sexual-enhancement products or bodybuilding products were implicated in 14.1% (95% CI, 10.5 to 17.7) of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events among male patients; there were too few cases among female patients to calculate a reliable estimate.\n\n【36】### _According to Age of Patients_\n\n【37】After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, micronutrients were implicated in two thirds of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events among children 4 years of age or younger (67.3%) and adults 65 years of age or older (62.7%) 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In contrast, herbal or complementary nutritional products were most commonly implicated among the other age groups.\n\n【38】Figure 2.  Figure 2. National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits for Adverse Events Associated with Dietary Supplements, According to Age Group and Product Category (2004–2013).\n\n【39】National estimates are based on fewer than 20 cases or have a coefficient of variation of more than 30% and may be statistically unreliable for the following combinations of age group and product category: weight loss (persons ≥65 years of age), energy (persons 50 to 64 years and ≥65 years of age), cardiovascular health or potassium (persons 5 to 19 years and 20 to 34 years of age), calcium (persons 5 to 19 years, 20 to 34 years, and 35 to 49 years of age), and iron (persons 5 to 19 years and 50 to 64 years of age).\n\n【40】Weight-loss products or energy products were implicated in more than half the emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events among patients 5 to 19 years of age (51.2%; 95% CI, 44.2 to 58.3) and those 20 to 34 years of age (56.4%; 95% CI, 51.8 to 61.1) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Weight-loss products were implicated in 2661 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 1995 to 3326)</u> emergency department visits per year for supplement-related adverse events among patients 20 to 34 years of age, a number similar to that for visits associated with all other products combined among patients in each of the older age groups 删除2:<u>(Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among adults 65 years of age or older, three specific micronutrients (iron, calcium, and potassium) were implicated in almost one third (29.9%; 95% CI, 24.9 to 35.0) of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events.\n\n【41】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【42】Table 3.  Table 3. National Estimates of Symptoms Documented during Emergency Department Visits for Adverse Events Associated with Dietary Supplements from Selected Product Categories (2004–2013).\n\n【43】Cardiac symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia) were the most common symptoms associated with weight-loss products (in 42.9% of patients) and energy products (in 46.0% of patients) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Weight-loss or energy products were implicated in 71.8% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.1) of all emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involving palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia. Most of the visits for cardiac symptoms (58.0%; 95% CI, 52.2 to 63.7) involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Cardiac symptoms were also commonly documented in emergency department visits attributed to bodybuilding products (49.8%; 95% CI, 34.5 to 65.0) and sexual-enhancement products (37.3%; 95% CI, 25.3 to 49.3). Most patients with palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia associated with supplement-related adverse events were discharged from the emergency department (89.9%; 95% CI, 87.2 to 92.6).\n\n【44】The most common adverse effects from most micronutrients (excluding iron, calcium, and potassium) were mild-to-moderate allergic reactions (40.6%) and swallowing problems (combination of choking and pill-induced dysphagia or globus, 41.0%; 95% CI, 32.4 to 49.7). Swallowing problems caused most emergency department visits involving calcium products (54.1%; 95% CI, 40.9 to 67.2), whereas abdominal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) were frequently associated with iron or potassium products.\n\n【45】Emergency department visits for supplement-induced swallowing problems were not common among patients 6 to 64 years of age (9.4%; 95% CI, 7.3 to 11.4) but were more common among those 65 years of age or older (37.6%; 95% CI, 29.1 to 46.2). Among older adults, 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 92.9) of emergency department visits for supplement-induced swallowing problems involved micronutrients.\n\n【46】Trends over Time\n----------------\n\n【47】The estimated number of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events was 20,517 (95% CI, 15,187 to 25,847) annually in 2004–2005 and 26,779 (95% CI, 21,703 to 31,854) annually in 2012–2013. However, after accounting for population increases, the incidence of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events did not significantly change during this period (P=0.09). There were no significant changes in the estimated numbers of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events associated with herbal or complementary nutritional products, micronutrients, weight-loss products, or energy products or for unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children. However, emergency department visits for adverse events associated with micronutrients (excluding iron, calcium, and potassium) increased from 3212 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 1930 to 4493)</u> annually in 2004–2005 to 4578 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 3397 to 5759)</u> annually in 2012–2013 (P=0.03 after accounting for population increases).\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】On the basis of reports from a nationally representative sample of emergency departments from 2004 through 2013, we estimated that dietary supplements were implicated in an average of 23,000 emergency department visits and 2000 hospitalizations annually. Although the numbers of emergency department visits and hospitalizations were less than 5% of the numbers that have been reported for pharmaceutical products previously, 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> dietary supplements are regulated and marketed under the presumption of safety.\n\n【50】Although the incidence of emergency department visits for adverse drug events is reported to be low among young adults, 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> more than one quarter (28%) of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events in our study involved young adults between the ages of 20 and 34 years. Weight-loss or energy products caused more than half these visits, commonly for cardiac symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia). Notably, cardiac symptoms were documented more frequently in emergency department visits for adverse events associated with weight loss (43%) and energy products (46%) than for prescription stimulants. In a previous study 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> that used the same data source as the one used in our study, cardiac symptoms were documented in 23% of emergency department visits that were associated with prescription stimulants, which have label warnings for sympathomimetic adverse effects. Unlike over-the-counter or prescription medications, there are no requirements to identify adverse effects on dietary-supplement packaging. Clinicians could be encouraged to educate patients about potential cardiac effects from these products. However, since dietary-supplement histories are infrequently obtained, 删除3:<u><sup><a>29-32 </a></sup></u> particularly among young adults, 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> other opportunities for informing users of these potential adverse effects may be needed.\n\n【51】Unsupervised ingestions by children caused more than one fifth (21%) of all estimated emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events, with almost two thirds involving micronutrients. Child-resistant packaging is not required for dietary supplements other than those containing iron, 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> and despite such packaging, iron supplements were the second most commonly implicated type of supplement in unsupervised ingestion by children. Innovative safety packaging and targeted education on safe storage are potential interventions to reduce unsupervised ingestion of supplements by children. 删除3:<u><sup><a>34</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】Among older adults, swallowing problems caused nearly 40% of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events, with micronutrients implicated in more than 80% of these visits. The FDA recommends limiting the size of pharmaceutical tablets to 22 mm and requires the reporting of tablet size and shape on abbreviated new-drug applications. 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> However, there are no size recommendations or similar reporting requirements for dietary supplements. Large amounts or multiple types of micronutrients are often packaged in a single large pill, and many micronutrient products approaching or exceeding 22 mm are commercially available. 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> Considerations for reducing the number of emergency department visits for swallowing problems include decreasing the size of supplement pills or using other delivery vehicles (e.g., liquids, gels, or powders), particularly for micronutrients for older adults, along with educating patients on methods for avoiding swallowing problems.\n\n【53】Limitations of our analysis should be noted. The number of emergency department visits attributed to supplement-related adverse events that we identified is probably an underestimation, since supplement use is underreported by patients, and physicians may not identify adverse events associated with supplements as often as they do those associated with pharmaceuticals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29-31,37 </a></sup></u> Physicians also may have more limited knowledge of interactions between prescription drugs and dietary supplements than they do interactions between prescription drugs. In addition, we did not collect data on emergency department visits associated with products that are generally considered to be foods or drinks by consumers but that may be considered to be dietary supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (e.g., energy drinks). However, it is also possible that emergency department physicians may incorrectly attribute certain symptoms to supplements, which could lead to overestimation.\n\n【54】The relatively wide confidence intervals around the reported national estimates indicate the precision limitations of using a relatively small, albeit representative, sample of hospitals. Sample size and design also prevent identification of differences among metropolitan areas, states, or regions. Nonetheless, population-based active surveillance can quantify adverse events better than voluntary reporting. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【55】A limited regulatory framework makes it challenging to accurately monitor the safety of supplements. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> It was not possible to calculate rates of emergency department visits for adverse events associated with supplements according to specific ingredient, product, or type, because data quantifying supplement use are extremely limited. Estimates of overall supplement use are available from national surveys, but studies have used varying categorizations, and most lack product-specific data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,38 </a></sup></u> Identifying specific ingredients is also challenging because dietary supplements often contain multiple ingredients, and similarly named products can have different ingredients. For example, a product called Pro Clinical Hydroxycut Lose Weight lists 10 active ingredients, none of which are the three listed active ingredients in Hydroxycut Appetite Control. 删除3:<u><sup><a>39</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】We categorized supplements on the basis of common reasons for use. In some cases, products were identified only by intended use (e.g., weight-lifting supplement). In other cases, specific products or ingredients were named, but because some products and ingredients are marketed for multiple uses (e.g., to improve energy and sexual performance), patients’ reasons for use might have differed from assigned categories.\n\n【57】In conclusion, we estimate that more than 23,000 emergency department visits annually in the United States from 2004 through 2013 were for adverse events associated with dietary supplements. Such visits commonly involved cardiovascular adverse effects from weight-loss or energy herbal products among young adults, unsupervised ingestion of micronutrients by children, and swallowing problems associated with micronutrients among older adults. These findings can help target interventions to reduce the risk of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Department of Health and Human Services.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>The findings and conclusions in this study are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the CDC or the FDA.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>We thank Dr. Lee M.

Data on survival were collected for all women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in British Columbia during each of three calendar years chosen to represent different province-wide treatment recommendations: 1974, when no adjuvant systemic therapy was recommended; 1980, when adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended only for premenopausal women with node-positive disease; and 1984, when adjuvant chemotherapy was also recommended for premenopausal women with node-negative disease and lymphatic, vascular, or neural invasion and tamoxifen was recommended for postmenopausal women with involved lymph nodes or lymphatic, vascular, or neural invasion unless their tumors were negative for estrogen receptors.\n\n【4】Results\n-------\n\n【5】For women less than 50 years of age, disease-specific survival at seven years (i.e., with censoring of data on women who died from causes other than breast cancer) improved from 65.2 to 76.3 percent between 1974 and 1984 (P = 0.008), and overall survival improved from 64.8 to 74.6 percent (P = 0.02). For women from 50 through 89 years of age, disease-specific survival at seven years improved from 62.5 to 70.4 percent between 1980 and 1984 (P = 0.001), and overall survival improved from 53.9 to 58.3 percent (P = 0.05). The timing of the improvements in survival correlated with the introduction of adjuvant systemic therapy in each group.\n\n【6】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【7】Survival among women with breast cancer improved significantly in a geographically defined population during the period when adjuvant systemic therapy became widely used.\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】Adjuvant combination chemotherapy, tamoxifen, or both improve survival when given to women with stage I and II invasive primary breast cancer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> but overall mortality rates for the disease have remained stable 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> . Slight improvements in five-year survival have been noted, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> but in previous population-based studies it was not possible to separate the effects of lead-time bias (increased survival due to earlier diagnosis) from the possible beneficial effects of treatment 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,4,5 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【10】In British Columbia, Canada 删除4:<u>(population in 1991, 3.3 million)</u>, there is a single centralized cancer agency that attempts to develop consensus, circulate province-wide recommendations for the treatment of cancer, and coordinate cancer-treatment services in the province. This system makes it possible to obtain information on such questions as when adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer was introduced and to determine what effect changes in treatment may have had on survival among women with breast cancer. In addition, a comprehensive provincial medical insurance plan guarantees that the inability to pay is not an impediment to treatment.\n\n【11】To determine whether the rate of survival among all women in the province in whom breast cancer was diagnosed had changed since the introduction of widespread adjuvant systemic therapy, we reviewed previous policy statements and then selected three cohorts, according to year of diagnosis, whom we studied to determine the effect of various treatment policies. We assessed the results of recommendations for the use of adjuvant systemic therapy within the province; we were not testing a specific treatment regimen.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Collection of Data\n------------------\n\n【14】Data were obtained from the provincial cancer registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> on all cases of breast cancer in women that were reported during the calendar years 1974, 1980, and 1984. Additional information was sought from the records of the cancer-treatment clinics, from the women's original physicians, and from other sources for women not known to have died for whom less than five years of follow-up data were available. The minimal information in all cases included the patient's name, date of birth, and date of diagnosis, the anatomical site, and the histologic findings. The registry does not record the stage of disease, so it was not possible to determine directly whether the distribution of stages was constant throughout the study period. The date of death and the principal and underlying causes of death were determined for each woman who had died. All deaths before January 1, 1992, were included in this analysis. A woman was considered to have died of breast cancer if the records of the cancer-treatment clinic or the death certificate listed breast cancer as the principal or underlying cause of death.\n\n【15】Selection of the Cohorts\n------------------------\n\n【16】The British Columbia Cancer Institute was established in 1939. In 1974 legislation was enacted creating a single provincial cancer authority. This organization has two treatment clinics in Vancouver and Victoria, provides all radiation-therapy services, and pays for the costs of all antineoplastic drugs used in therapy in the province, thus effectively controlling their use. Multidisciplinary panels regularly review and publish recommendations for treatment that are circulated to all physicians in the province.\n\n【17】Using policy manuals, archival memorandums, and minutes of meetings related to policies regarding systemic therapy from 1974 to 1985, we determined that adjuvant chemotherapy was first recommended for premenopausal women in late 1976. A woman was defined as premenopausal if she had menstruated in the 12 months before the diagnosis of breast cancer or, in the case of a woman who had undergone hysterectomy without oophorectomy, if she was younger than 50 years of age or had a serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration in the premenopausal range.\n\n【18】Initially, adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen of Bonadonna et al., 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> using cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), was offered to premenopausal women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who had pathologically involved lymph nodes. By the middle of 1977, cyclophosphamide (800 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously on day 1) was substituted for the oral doses. In 1981, the duration of chemotherapy was reduced to 6 months, with all three drugs given intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (600 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter, 40 mg of methotrexate per square meter, and 600 mg of fluorouracil per square meter). Beginning in 1979, anthracycline-based chemotherapy was recommended for women with inflammatory breast cancer and for some patients with clinical stage III disease; by 1983 this recommendation had evolved into a specific neoadjuvant-therapy protocol 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【19】In July 1981 a policy of offering adjuvant tamoxifen therapy (20 mg per day for two years) was introduced for postmenopausal women with levels of estrogen receptors greater than 9 fmol per milligram of cytosol protein 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> or with unknown estrogen-receptor levels and a high risk of relapse.\n\n【20】The definition of high risk was initially restricted to women with pathologically involved lymph nodes. Since 1982, women with negative nodes were also included if lymphatic, vascular, or neural invasion was seen in the primary tumor 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> . In all cases referred to the Vancouver clinic, the pathological findings were reviewed before treatment was planned.\n\n【21】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Incidence of Breast Cancer among Women in British Columbia, 1971 through 1991, According to Age at Diagnosis.\n\n【22】The dashed line represents 275 new cases per 100,000 population per year, which was the approximate incidence among women 50 years of age or older in 1974, 1980, and 1984.Figure 2.  Figure 2. Number of Mammograms Performed for Any Reason and Paid for by the Provincial Medical Insurance Plan or the Screening Mammography Program of British Columbia in Each Fiscal Year since 1980-81.\n\n【23】The number grew more than 15-fold between 1980 and 1990, and 90 percent of the increase occurred after 1984. Fiscal years ran from April 1 through March 31. Data are from the Medical Services Plan of British Columbia and the Screening Mammography Program of British Columbia.\n\n【24】A potential confounding influence affecting the interpretation of the data on survival might be an increase in the number of early cases detected by mammography or a greater awareness of breast cancer on the part of women or physicians 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> . This potential source of bias was considered when the cohorts were chosen for study. Figure 1 shows the annual incidence of breast cancer in British Columbia from 1971 through 1991. The rise after 1984 parallels but starts a few years later than a similar trend attributed to the increased use of screening mammography in the United States 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,11,12 </a></sup></u> . In 1976, 26 dedicated film-mammography units were installed in hospitals throughout the province, and indications for their use were circulated to all physicians 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> . Data from the provincial health insurance plan and the Screening Mammography Program 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> demonstrate an increase of more than 15-fold in the use of mammography for diagnosis, screening, follow-up, and other reasons between the fiscal years 1980-81 and 1990-91. Figure 2 shows that 90 percent of this increase occurred after 1984. We chose 1984 as the year of the most recent cohort since it predated any measurable increase in the annual incidence of breast cancer that could be attributed to earlier diagnosis. In a further effort to reduce a possible effect of lead-time bias (improvement in survival due to earlier diagnosis), all cases of noninvasive breast cancer were eliminated from the analysis.\n\n【25】Thus, we selected three cohorts of women with primary breast cancer: those in whom the disease was first diagnosed in 1974, when only local-regional therapy was offered; those in whom the diagnosis was made in 1980, when 12 months of intravenous CMF therapy was offered to premenopausal women with pathologically involved lymph nodes but adjuvant tamoxifen was not used; and those in whom the disease was diagnosed in 1984, when the indications for adjuvant systemic therapy were extended to include women with negative lymph nodes if lymphatic, vascular, or neural invasion was identified in the primary tumor. Women at high risk in the 1984 cohort were offered CMF therapy for six months if they were premenopausal and tamoxifen for two years if they were postmenopausal.\n\n【26】The Study Population\n--------------------\n\n【27】Table 1. Table 1. Cases of Breast Cancer in Women Less Than 50 Years of Age in 1974, 1980, and 1984 in British Columbia. Table 2.  Table 2. Cases of Breast Cancer in Women 50 through 89 Years of Age in 1974, 1980, and 1984 in British Columbia.\n\n【28】The female population of British Columbia was 1,184,800 in 1974, increasing to 1,338,700 in 1980 and to 1,445,300 in 1984 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> . The median age of the female population increased from 31 to 33 years between 1974 and 1984. During the three calendar years selected for study, 3722 women younger than 90 years of age received a new diagnosis of breast cancer that was recorded in the provincial registry. Table 1 and Table 2 show the number of cases included in our study among women less than 50 years of age and from 50 through 89 years of age. Women 90 years of age or older at diagnosis 删除4:<u>(18, 36, and 28 women in 1974, 1980, and 1984, respectively)</u> and women with noninvasive and nonepithelial cancers, those with cancer first diagnosed at the time of death, and those who died within 30 days after the diagnosis were excluded, as were the women (3.8 percent) who could not be traced beyond the date of diagnosis. Thus, a total of 3284 of the original 3722 women (88.2 percent) whose diagnoses were registered in the three calendar years were available for analysis. Only 49 women (1.5 percent), 11 of whom were younger than 50 years of age, were lost to follow-up before five years of follow-up were completed. These women were included in the analysis with follow-up data censored at the date of the last contact.\n\n【29】Although breast-conserving techniques were used increasingly during the period covered by this study, the majority of women we studied were treated with radical or modified radical mastectomy. Radiation was delivered to the breast after breast-conserving surgery or if the disease was inoperable, and to the chest wall and regional nodes after mastectomy if lymph nodes were pathologically involved.\n\n【30】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【31】Actuarial overall survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis. For the calculation of actuarial disease-specific survival, data were censored at the time of death if breast cancer was not the primary or underlying cause of death. Three women younger than 50 years of age 删除4:<u>(2 from the 1980 cohort and 1 from the 1984 cohort)</u> and 18 women 50 through 89 years of age 删除4:<u>(6 from the 1974 cohort, 3 from the 1980 cohort, and 9 from the 1984 cohort)</u> had a known date of death but an unknown cause of death. They were excluded from the analysis of disease-specific survival but were included in the analysis of overall survival.\n\n【32】Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> were calculated for each cohort. The difference between each pair of cohorts was tested in a two-tailed test using the log-rank statistic 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Outcome\n-------\n\n【35】Women Less Than 50 Years Old at Diagnosis\n\n【36】Figure 3.

Survival seven years after diagnosis was higher in the 1984 cohort than in the 1974 cohort (P = 0.008 by the log-rank test). The difference between the 1974 and 1980 cohorts was not significant (P = 0.17). Panel B shows survival among women 50 through 89 years of age at diagnosis in 1984 (977 women), 1980 (827 women), and 1974 (711 women). Survival seven years after diagnosis was significantly higher in the 1984 cohort than in either the 1974 cohort (P = 0.01) or the 1980 cohort (P = 0.001).Table 3. Table 3.

Actuarial Overall Survival after Seven Years among Women in British Columbia with Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer.\n\n【38】The disease-specific survival, regardless of the disease stage or the treatment delivered, among the women less than 50 years of age at the first diagnosis of breast cancer is shown in Figure 3A . Complete data on mortality are available through the end of 1991; thus, we have reported the actuarial overall and disease-specific survival at seven years 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Table 4 )</u>.\n\n【39】A trend toward improved disease-specific survival was observed in the 1980 cohort as compared with the 1974 cohort (P = 0.17 10 years after diagnosis), with a further improvement for women in the 1984 cohort. In the comparison of the 1974 and 1984 cohorts seven years after diagnosis, disease-specific survival among women less than 50 years of age improved from 65.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 58.9 to 71.6 percent) to 76.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 71.1 to 81.4 percent; P = 0.008) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. This represents a 32 percent reduction in the chance of dying from breast cancer for the 1984 cohort. Similarly, actuarial seven-year overall survival in this age group improved from 64.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 58.5 to 71.2 percent) to 74.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 69.3 to 79.8 percent; P = 0.02), a 28 percent reduction in the chance of dying from any cause 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Only 13 of the 237 deaths occurring in the first seven years of follow-up among women younger than 50 years of age were from causes other than breast cancer.\n\n【40】Women 50 through 89 Years Old at Diagnosis\n\n【41】The disease-specific survival rates among women 50 through 89 years of age are shown in Figure 3B . The curves for the 1974 and 1980 cohorts are almost identical. However, the seven-year disease-specific survival improved between the 1974 and 1984 cohorts, from 63.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 59.6 to 66.9 percent) to 70.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 67.5 to 73.4 percent; P = 0.01) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Also, between the 1980 and 1984 cohorts it improved from 62.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 59.0 to 65.9 percent) to 70.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 67.5 to 73.4 percent; P = 0.001). There was thus a 20 percent reduction in the chance of dying from breast cancer between the 1974 and 1980 cohorts and the 1984 cohort.\n\n【42】The actuarial overall survival seven years after diagnosis for the 1980 cohort (53.9 percent \\[95 percent confidence interval, 50.5 to 57.3 percent\\]) was slightly worse than that for the 1974 cohort (56.0 percent \\[95 percent confidence interval, 52.3 to 59.6 percent; P not significant\\]) but improved to 58.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 55.2 to 61.4 percent) for the 1984 cohort (P = 0.05) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. A woman with breast cancer diagnosed in 1984 was 10 percent less likely to die of any cause within seven years than a woman with disease diagnosed in 1980.\n\n【43】Policy Changes and Survival\n---------------------------\n\n【44】When one compares the two panels in Figure 3 , it is clear that the improvements in survival for each age group occurred at different times and coincided with the introduction of policies that led to the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy. There was no improvement in disease-specific survival among women 50 to 89 years of age until the 1984 cohort. In contrast, a trend toward improved disease-specific survival among women less than 50 years of age occurred earlier, between 1974 and 1980, and became statistically significant with the 1984 cohort. The consistency of the survival rates among the older group in the 1974 and 1980 cohorts (who were treated with local-regional therapy alone) suggests that data collection by the registry and the types of cases diagnosed were essentially unchanged during this period.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】Significant improvements in survival occurred between 1974 and 1984 among women in British Columbia in whom breast cancer was newly diagnosed. Although this is a retrospective, observational study, we believe this improvement can be attributed to the use of adjuvant systemic therapy for selected women with a high risk of relapse and death from breast cancer.\n\n【47】The improved survival among these women during this period is particularly noteworthy because it was observed in an unselected population, rather than in selected subgroups or subgroups treated with particular regimens. All registered cases of breast cancer in women, regardless of the disease stage or the treatment actually received, in a large, well-defined geographic area have been included. Exclusions were restricted to women 90 years of age or older, those in whom the cancer was first reported at the time of death, those with noninvasive or nonepithelial histologic features, and those (3.8 percent) for whom no follow-up data were available after the date of diagnosis.\n\n【48】A 32 percent reduction in the chance of dying from breast cancer and a 28 percent reduction in the chance of dying from any cause within seven years of diagnosis were observed among women younger than 50 years of age. The magnitude of these reductions is consistent with the findings of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which reported a reduction of 24 ±5 percent in the odds of dying from any cause within 10 years among women less than 50 years of age who had stage I or II disease that was treated with prolonged adjuvant combination chemotherapy in worldwide randomized trials initiated before 1985 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【49】Among women 50 through 89 years of age, there was a 20 percent reduction in the chance of dying from breast cancer and a 10 percent reduction in the chance of death from any cause within seven years after diagnosis 删除4:<u>(in the 1984 cohort as compared with the 1980 cohort)</u>. The EBCTCG reported a 23 ±3 percent reduction in deaths from all causes among women 50 years of age or older who were randomly assigned to at least two years of tamoxifen therapy, as compared with the control groups 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . The apparently lesser efficacy of tamoxifen in our study may partly be explained by our inclusion of women up to 89 years of age. Most randomized trials initiated before 1985 included only women who were younger than 70 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Women older than 70 are at higher risk than younger women for death from causes other than breast cancer. In addition, in 1984, tamoxifen was not offered to the 25 to 30 percent of postmenopausal women who were estrogen-receptor-negative, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,18 </a></sup></u> even if they were considered to have a high risk of relapse. Other women who were estrogen-receptor-positive, and who today would receive tamoxifen, were also not offered adjuvant systemic therapy because of the more restrictive definition of high risk used in 1984.\n\n【50】The most compelling evidence that the observed improvements in survival can be attributed to the difference in treatment is that the improvements in survival coincided with the introduction of recommendations that adjuvant systemic therapy be used in each age group. Disease-specific survival among women 50 through 89 years of age was virtually identical in the 1974 and 1980 cohorts but improved after tamoxifen began to be used as adjuvant therapy for high-risk postmenopausal patients. In contrast, among women younger than 50 years of age, disease-specific survival began to improve between 1974 and 1980, with a further increase observed by 1984. The decision to offer adjuvant chemotherapy to premenopausal women with pathologically involved lymph nodes was implemented in 1976, and the indications were broadened in 1982 to include women with negative nodes if lymphatic, vascular, or neural invasion was present in the primary tumor.\n\n【51】An alternative hypothesis that might explain the observed improvements in survival would be an increase in the use of mammography or a lower threshold for investigating breast abnormalities. We do not have information on disease stages for the women who were not referred to one of the treatment clinics, so we are not able to rule out the possibility that earlier diagnosis might have contributed to a stage drift over the period covered by this study. Such changes might have resulted in earlier diagnosis of cases, with a resulting increase in the annual incidence of breast cancer and an apparent improvement in survival due to lead-time bias 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,11,12 </a></sup></u> .\n\n【52】In an attempt to minimize lead-time bias in this population, we chose the most recent cohort after reviewing trends in the province-wide incidence of breast cancer and the use of mammography and by excluding cases of noninvasive breast cancer from our analysis. Increases in the incidence of breast cancer in British Columbia, starting in 1985 among women 50 years of age or older, and starting in 1988 among women 20 through 49 years of age, parallel similar trends attributed to screening mammography in the United States 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> . Although we cannot exclude a limited effect of earlier diagnosis, especially among women older than 50, lead-time bias is unlikely to have substantially altered survival patterns in the population we studied until after the 1984 cohort was enrolled.\n\n【53】Another possible explanation for the improvements in the more recent cohorts could be improvements in the treatment of women with established metastatic disease. Previous reports have shown either no survival advantage 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> or a short-term improvement in survival from the date of the first metastasis, but no difference in survival from the date of diagnosis 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> with the addition of multidrug chemotherapy to the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer. Altered therapy for metastatic disease is thus unlikely to explain the observed improvements in survival.\n\n【54】In conclusion, we have demonstrated a modest but probably important improvement in survival between 1974 and 1984 among women in British Columbia with breast cancer. The magnitude of this benefit in women younger than 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis is consistent with that seen in the EBCTCG overview 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> . The occurrence of such an improvement in survival throughout a geographically defined population was correlated with the introduction of policies that broadened the use of adjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer.\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Eunice Dietrich, former head of the British Columbia Cancer Registry, and to Linda Lee for assistance in compiling this data; to Ferguson Neville, Jeanette Matheson, and Ramona Bianco for the preparation of the figures and tables; and to Drs.

The primary outcome was health-related quality of life measured with the use of utility scores on the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire at 4 months after randomization (range of scores, −0.594 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life; range for minimal clinically important difference, 0.050 to 0.075).\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 610 patients were assigned to undergo cemented hemiarthroplasty and 615 to undergo modern uncemented hemiarthroplasty; follow-up data were available for 71.6% of the patients at 4 months. The mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.371 in patients assigned to the cemented group and 0.315 in those assigned to the uncemented group (adjusted difference, 0.055; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.009 to 0.101; P=0.02). The between-group difference at 1 month was similar to that at 4 months, but the difference at 12 months was smaller than that at 4 months. Mortality at 12 months was 23.9% in the cemented group and 27.8% in the uncemented group (odds ratio for death, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.05). Periprosthetic fractures occurred in 0.5% and 2.1% of the patients in the respective groups (odds ratio \\[uncemented vs. cemented\\], 4.37; 95% CI, 1.19 to 24.00). The incidences of other complications were similar in the two groups.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】Among patients 60 years of age or older with an intracapsular hip fracture, cemented hemiarthroplasty resulted in a modestly but significantly better quality of life and a lower risk of periprosthetic fracture than uncemented hemiarthroplasty.

If the implant is not securely bonded to the patient’s bone, it can loosen, causing pain and restricting activities of daily living. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials showed that implants fixed with bone cement were associated with less postoperative pain and better mobility than the first generation of “press-fit” uncemented implants (e.g., Austin Moore prosthesis). 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> However, injection of bone cement during surgery has been associated with a drop in patients’ blood pressure and, in rare cases, cardiovascular collapse and death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】More recent uncemented implants have been designed to provide better integration with the bone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Proponents of these newer hydroxyapatite-coated uncemented implants suggest that they provide reliable fixation, which promotes early return to normal activities, while avoiding the potential risks of using bone cement. We conducted the World Hip Trauma Evaluation (WHiTE) 5 trial to compare health-related quality of life in adults 60 years of age or older with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture who were randomly assigned to undergo either cemented hemiarthroplasty or modern uncemented hemiarthroplasty.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】WHiTE 5 was a multicenter, randomized, controlled superiority trial. The protocol has been published previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The trial was conducted as an initial feasibility phase in 4 centers followed by a main phase in 14 centers. Recruiting centers took part in the WHiTE cohort study, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> which involves patients with a hip fracture admitted to participating centers and provides a framework for identifying participants for embedded randomized trials.\n\n【19】The trial was coordinated by the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. A steering committee and independent data and safety monitoring committee oversaw trial conduct and patient safety. The Wales Research Ethics Committee 5 approved the trial.\n\n【20】Patients\n--------\n\n【21】Patients 60 years of age or older with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture whose planned treatment was a hemiarthroplasty were eligible to enter the trial. Patients who were unable to provide consent owing to a lack of capacity were included under a process of consultee agreement in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act in England and Wales. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【23】After consent had been obtained, Web-based randomization software managed by the University of Oxford was used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either cemented hemiarthroplasty (cemented group) or modern hydroxyapatite-coated uncemented hemiarthroplasty (uncemented group). The randomization sequence was generated with the use of variable block sizes, stratified according to center. Patients were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Operating surgeons had to be aware of the trial-group assignments but were not involved in patient follow-up or assessment.\n\n【24】Preoperative investigations, perioperative antibiotic treatment, the choice between regional and general anesthetic technique, analgesia, and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis were guided by local policy. The surgical steps of canal preparation, implant trialing, cementation (where applicable), and insertion of the definitive implant were inherent to the trial-group assignments, but the surgical approach and method of wound closure were left to the discretion of the operating surgeon. In the postoperative period, patients in both groups underwent assessments for physiotherapy or occupational therapy aimed at mobilization on the day of or day after surgery.\n\n【25】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【26】Outcome data were obtained through telephone interviews with the patient (or, for those lacking capacity, the main caregiver) and from routine medical records. The primary outcome was death-adjusted health-related quality of life (with death imputed as a score of 0 on the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension \\[EQ-5D\\] questionnaire) measured with the use of the EQ-5D utility score 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> at 4 months after randomization (range of scores, −0.594 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality of life).\n\n【27】The EQ-5D questionnaire is a validated, patient-rated instrument comprising a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health from 0 (worst imaginable state of health) to 100 (best imaginable state of health) and a health-status instrument that consists of a five-level response from “no problems” to “unable” for five domains related to daily activities: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> The EQ-5D score has been shown to be responsive to changes in health-related quality of life, including when reported by proxy for persons with cognitive impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the EQ-5D utility score is estimated to be between 0.050 and 0.075. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> The responses on the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument for each of the five domains of health were converted into a single utility score with the use of the Crosswalk Index Value Calculator of the 3-Level (3L) instrument and its established time trade-off utility algorithm for the U.K. population. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【28】Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (EQ-5D utility score) at 1 month and 12 months; mortality at 12 months; complications; mobility status at 1 month, 4 months, and 12 months on an ordinal scale from “freely mobile without aids” to “no functional mobility (using lower limbs)”; and residential status at hospital discharge on an ordinal scale from “own home or sheltered housing” to “acute care hospital.” We also performed a prespecified analysis of the EQ-5D-5L domain scores, EQ-5D VAS scores, and EQ-5D scores without adjustment for death (i.e., with EQ-5D scores excluded rather than set to 0 for those who died). Cost effectiveness is being analyzed separately.\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】A minimum sample of 1128 patients was selected to detect a between-group difference in the EQ-5D utility score (primary outcome measure) of 0.075 at 4 months with 90% power, a type I error rate of 5% (significance level), and the assumption of 40% loss to follow-up. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> High loss to follow-up was anticipated owing to the fact that the patients represent a frail, older population with multiple coexisting conditions and care needs who may have difficulty completing patient-reported questionnaires. Patients’ baseline characteristics and outcome data were summarized with the use of means and standard deviations for symmetrically distributed continuous (i.e., approximately normally distributed) variables, as medians and interquartile ranges for nonsymmetrically distributed continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical variables.\n\n【31】We performed an initial analysis testing for differences between the trial groups using linear regression analysis. In addition to this unadjusted analysis, we performed regression analyses to adjust for age and sex without inclusion of the baseline EQ-5D utility score. Inclusion of the baseline EQ-5D utility score in the model was found to reduce the data available for analysis, owing to missingness of the baseline EQ-5D utility score; therefore, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, it was not included in the model. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> (The statistical analysis plan is available with the protocol at NEJM.org.) The primary analysis was therefore a mixed-effects model of the death-adjusted EQ-5D utility score at 4 months (i.e., with death imputed as a score of 0), 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> with adjustment for age and sex, with recruiting center as a random effect and treatment included in the model on an intention-to-treat (as randomly assigned) basis. In addition, a per-protocol analysis was undertaken, in which patients who did not receive their assigned intervention were excluded to assess the effect of the actual treatment (cemented or uncemented) that was received. Analysis of EQ-5D utility scores at 1 month and 12 months was performed with the use of the strategy defined above for the primary analysis.\n\n【32】A longitudinal mixed-effects model was also fitted to the totality of EQ-5D data (from 1 month, 4 months, and 12 months), with the same fixed-effects structure as the primary model (i.e., with adjustment for age and sex) but with a three-level random-effects structure in which observations (time points) were nested within patients and patients were nested within recruitment centers. In the protocol, we refer to this model as the area-under-the-curve analysis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> which provides an estimate of the average treatment effect throughout the follow-up period. To test the sensitivity of the main analysis to missing data, data were imputed in the R package mice (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> with the use of predictive mean matching (using 100 imputations with age, sex, recruitment center, baseline EQ-5D utility score and EQ-5D VAS score, alcohol consumption, status with respect to diabetes, smoking status, status with respect to chronic renal failure, residential status, and treatment as predictors), to provide pooled estimates (using Rubin’s rules) of treatment effects.\n\n【33】Dichotomous secondary outcome variables (e.g., complications) were analyzed with the use of a mixed-effects logistic-regression analysis. Time-to-event analysis (Kaplan–Meier) was used to assess the risk of death, and Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to test for differences in mortality between the trial groups after adjustment for age and sex. Odds ratios for mobility outcomes were estimated with the use of proportional-odds (cumulative) logistic-regression models.\n\n【34】Treatment effects were summarized with the use of 95% confidence intervals. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 for the primary outcome was considered to indicate statistical significance. The statistical analysis plan did not include a provision for correcting for multiplicity when tests were conducted for secondary outcomes. Because the widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, these intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects for secondary outcomes. Analyses were conducted with the use of the R software packages lme4 and lmerTest. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20</a></sup></u>\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Patients\n--------\n\n【37】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Randomization and Follow-up.\n\n【38】Details on the provision of consent for routinely collected data to be harvested and consent to be contacted to provide patient-reported outcomes are available in the protocol. Proxy consent was provided by a personal consultee (relative or caregiver) or a nominated consultee (a person independent of the trial). EQ-5D denotes the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension questionnaire, and THR total hip replacement.Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【39】From March 2017 through December 2019, a total of 1225 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either cemented hemiarthroplasty (610 patients) or modern uncemented hemiarthroplasty (615 patients). Final follow-up was completed in January 2021 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Baseline demographic data were similar in the two trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The number of patients who enrolled at each trial center and details regarding the use of bone-protection medication, venous thromboprophylaxis, physiotherapy, and discharge destination are provided in Tables S1 through S4 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【40】Adherence to Assigned Intervention\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】A total of 91.1% of the patients received their assigned intervention 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>; 50 patients (8.2%) assigned to the cemented group underwent uncemented hemiarthroplasty, and 43 patients (7.0%) assigned to the uncemented group underwent cemented hemiarthroplasty. Seven patients received treatments not described in the protocol, and 9 patients did not undergo surgery because they died.\n\n【42】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【43】Table 2.  Table 2. Results from Mixed-Effects Regression Analysis of EQ-5D Utility Scores (Intention-to-Treat Population).\n\n【44】Primary outcome data (EQ-5D utility score at 4 months) were available for 877 of 1225 patients (71.6%). The primary adjusted intention-to-treat analysis of health-related quality of life showed higher utility scores in the cemented group than in the uncemented group at 4 months after randomization, with a mean difference of 0.055 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.009 to 0.101; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Results of a per-protocol analysis were similar 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>.\n\n【45】There was no evidence that the patients who did not provide EQ-5D data at 4 months (348 patients \\[28.4%\\]) differed materially in their baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and EQ-5D utility score) from those who did provide such data 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. An analysis that used multiple imputation for missing data yielded results similar to those of the primary analysis (mean difference in the EQ-5D utility score at 4 months, 0.041 \\[95% CI, 0.003 to 0.079\\], favoring cemented hemiarthroplasty).\n\n【46】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【47】EQ-5D data were available for 927 of 1225 patients (75.7%) at 1 month and 876 of 1225 patients (71.5%) at 12 months after randomization. The between-group difference in mean scores from the mixed-effects regression analysis was 0.049 (95% CI, 0.009 to 0.089; favoring cemented hemiarthroplasty) at 1 month and 0.034 (95% CI, −0.012 to 0.079) at 12 months. Estimated differences for the per-protocol analysis are shown in Table S5. The unadjusted analysis yielded similar results 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. A breakdown of the EQ-5D-5L domain scores, EQ-5D VAS scores, and EQ-5D scores without adjustment for death is also provided in Tables S7 and S8 and Figure S1.\n\n【48】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Survival Curves, According to Type of Hemiarthroplasty.\n\n【49】The inset shows the same data on an expanded y axis. Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【50】Death occurred in 146 of 610 patients (23.9%) in the cemented group and in 171 of 615 patients (27.8%) in the uncemented group at 12 months (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.05). The survival analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.04) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Results of the per-protocol analysis are shown in Table S9.\n\n【51】Table 3.  Table 3. Complications Reported during 12 Months of Follow-up.\n\n【52】Periprosthetic fractures occurred more commonly in the uncemented group (2.1%) than in the cemented group (0.5%) (odds ratio \\[uncemented vs. cemented\\], 4.37; 95% CI, 1.19 to 24.00). Other complications and revision surgery were uncommon and balanced between the trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and the Results section in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【53】Mobility assessments are shown in Table S10. There was no material between-group difference in the percentage of patients returning to their own home after hospital discharge. Of those patients admitted from their own home, 298 of 425 (70.1%) in the cemented group and 279 of 400 (69.8%) in the uncemented group were discharged back to their own home (Tables S2 and S11).\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In adults 60 years of age or older with an intracapsular hip fracture, cemented hemiarthroplasty resulted in a modestly but significantly better health-related quality of life at 4 months after randomization than uncemented hemiarthroplasty. The mean between-group difference in the EQ-5D utility score (0.055) is within the range reported for the MCID (0.050 to 0.075) and is similar to the loss of utility that has been associated with asthma (0.05) and acute myocardial infarction (0.06). 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> These observations suggest that the difference may be clinically important for patients, although a slightly smaller estimate was suggested in an analysis that used multiple imputation to account for missing data. The results of mobility assessments at 1 month, but not later, were consistent with the results for health-related quality of life, favoring cemented hemiarthroplasty.\n\n【56】Periprosthetic fractures were more common in the uncemented group than in the cemented group (2.1% vs. 0.5%). However, the overall incidence was lower than that reported in other randomized, controlled trials of modern uncemented implants, which have shown incidences of 5.5 to 15%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22-26 </a></sup></u> The reason for this lower incidence is unclear and could represent increasing experience with modern uncemented techniques among surgeons.\n\n【57】This trial is larger than previous studies that have addressed this research question and provides more information on quality-of-life outcomes, which are considered important to patients and caregivers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> Three smaller randomized, controlled trials 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,24,25 </a></sup></u> and one registry study 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> that compared these procedures have yielded inconsistent findings with respect to quality of life. One trial that involved 220 patients 70 years of age or older showed little difference between groups in EQ-5D scores at 3 months and 12 months, 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> whereas two other trials showed significantly better quality-of-life scores with cemented hemiarthroplasty than with uncemented hemiarthroplasty. One of these trials, involving 141 ambulatory and cognitively intact patients, showed higher EQ-5D index scores at 4 months and 12 months in favor of cemented hemiarthroplasty 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> ; the other trial (201 patients) 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> showed higher 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical component scores (indicating better function) at 6 and 12 weeks after surgery in the cemented group than in the uncemented group. Data from the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register (30,178 patients) showed no significant difference in EQ-5D-3L scores at 1 year after surgery between patients who underwent cemented hemiarthroplasty and those who underwent uncemented hemiarthroplasty. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> The inclusion of patients with cognitive impairment in the current trial is an important strength because this large subgroup is often excluded from research. 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> The cohort in which this trial was nested has been shown to be representative of the national population of adults with hip fracture 删除2:<u>(Table S12)</u>, 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> although no data were available on race or ethnic group. The outcomes measured are part of the core outcome set for hip fracture, 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> a consensus-derived set of outcomes that are important to patients, caregivers, and health care professionals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】This trial has some limitations. The rate of attrition and missing baseline data in this older and often frail patient group was high (28.5% in the cemented group and 28.3% in the uncemented group at 4 months), although it was lower than the 40% loss to follow-up used in the sample-size calculation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> The high frequency of missing data probably reflects the realities of accessing data from the frailest subgroup of patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment and without consultees, such as next of kin or main caregivers, and may introduce an attrition bias toward a slightly fitter sample. The inclusion of patients with cognitive impairment means that more data within the trial were reported by proxy rather than being obtained directly from the patients. However, including information to inform the care of this subgroup of patients is important, because approximately 40% of all patients with hip fracture have some degree of cognitive impairment on admission to a hospital. Crossovers occurred in both trial groups, with similar frequency; these were predominantly explained by surgeon preference or surgical factors identified during the operation (8.2% in the cemented group and 7.0% in the uncemented group). Per-protocol analyses generally supported the intention-to-treat analyses but are subject to bias because they do not reflect the randomized patient groups.\n\n【59】Meta-analyses of studies of the first generation of uncemented implants showed outcomes that were inferior to those obtained with cemented implants, in particular with respect to postoperative pain (attributed to the lack of surface coating of early uncemented designs). 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Modern hydroxyapatite-coated uncemented hemiarthroplasty provides better integration with the patients’ bone, and meta-analyses have shown similar rates of death (although higher rates of periprosthetic fracture) as compared with contemporary cemented hemiarthroplasty. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,33 </a></sup></u> However, these meta-analyses focused on mortality and surgical complications and not on quality of life.\n\n【60】We found that cemented hemiarthroplasty resulted in modestly but significantly better quality of life and a lower risk of periprosthetic fracture than uncemented hemiarthroplasty among patients 60 years of age or older with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture.\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) under its Research for Patient Benefit.

Patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, or 6 were randomly assigned in a 5:1 ratio to receive the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir in a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Because of the low prevalence of genotype 5 in the study regions, patients with genotype 5 did not undergo randomization but were assigned to the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of the 624 patients who received treatment with sofosbuvir–velpatasvir, 34% had HCV genotype 1a, 19% genotype 1b, 17% genotype 2, 19% genotype 4, 6% genotype 5, and 7% genotype 6. A total of 8% of patients were black, 19% had cirrhosis, and 32% had been previously treated for HCV. The rate of sustained virologic response among patients receiving sofosbuvir–velpatasvir was 99% (95% confidence interval, 98 to >99). Two patients receiving sofosbuvir–velpatasvir, both with HCV genotype 1, had a virologic relapse. None of the 116 patients receiving placebo had a sustained virologic response. Serious adverse events were reported in 15 patients (2%) in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group and none in the placebo group.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Once-daily sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12 weeks provided high rates of sustained virologic response among both previously treated and untreated patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, including those with compensated cirrhosis.

There are now effective combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents for most patients, but in choosing an appropriate regimen, clinicians must take into account the patient’s treatment history, HCV genotype and subtype, stage of fibrosis, and, in some cases, patterns of antiviral resistance. Some regimens also include ribavirin, which has known hematologic and other side effects and is teratogenic. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> The development of a ribavirin-free single-tablet regimen of short duration that is effective in a broad range of patients with HCV infection would simplify clinical decision making and reduce the need for pretreatment testing and monitoring during therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase approved for the treatment of HCV in combination with a variety of other agents, including NS5A inhibitors, ribavirin, and peginterferon–ribavirin. Velpatasvir (formerly GS-5816, Gilead Sciences) is a new pangenotypic HCV NS5A inhibitor with antiviral activity against HCV replicons in genotypes 1 through 6. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-11 </a></sup></u> In phase 2 trials, the combination of 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir with or without ribavirin resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response in a broad range of patients with HCV. These included previously treated and untreated patients, those with and without compensated cirrhosis, and those infected with HCV of all six genotypes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> The inclusion of ribavirin did not appear to improve efficacy but was associated with a slightly increased incidence of some adverse events, including hematologic abnormalities.\n\n【15】We conducted a phase 3 trial (ASTRAL-1) to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of treatment with a fixed-dose combination of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir among both previously treated and untreated patients who were chronically infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, including those with compensated cirrhosis.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Patients\n--------\n\n【18】We enrolled patients at 81 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Hong Kong from July 18, 2014, through December 19, 2014. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older who had chronic infection with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. All patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【19】The original clinical-development program for sofosbuvir–velpatasvir involved two trials — one in patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (ASTRAL-1) and one in patients with HCV genotype 3. A separate trial with an active comparator group was deemed to be necessary for patients with HCV genotype 3 in light of the special clinical challenges presented in this population. After the protocol for the present study was finalized and trial activity had begun, the Food and Drug Administration requested a separate trial with an active comparator for patients with HCV genotype 2. Because enrollment in the present study had already begun, we did not amend the protocol to exclude patients with HCV genotype 2. Therefore, two additional phase 3 trials were conducted to evaluate sofosbuvir–velpatasvir in patients with HCV genotype 2 (ASTRAL-2) and HCV genotype 3 (ASTRAL-3), and the results are reported now in the _Journal_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15</a></sup></u>\n\n【20】The protocol targeted an enrollment of approximately 20% of patients who had been previously treated for HCV with a regimen containing interferon and who had not had a sustained virologic response. Those who had discontinued previous HCV treatment because of an adverse event were not eligible. Patients who had previously received any nucleotide analogue HCV NS5B inhibitor or any NS5A inhibitor were not eligible. Approximately 20% of patients could have evidence of cirrhosis, which was defined as liver-biopsy results showing a Metavir fibrosis score of 4 or an Ishak score of 5 or more, a FibroTest score of more than 0.75 and a ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to platelets of more than 2, or a FibroScan reading of more than 12.5 kPa. There were no upper limits for age or body-mass index. Patients with a history of hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma were not eligible for enrollment. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【21】Study Design\n------------\n\n【22】In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, or 6 were randomly assigned in a 5:1 ratio to receive a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir, administered orally once daily for 12 weeks, or a placebo tablet to match the active treatment once daily for 12 weeks. Patients in the placebo group were eligible for deferred treatment with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir. Randomization was stratified according to genotype (1, 2, 4, 6, or indeterminate) and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Given the low prevalence of genotype 5 HCV infection in the regions in which the study was conducted, we targeted the enrollment of only 20 patients with HCV genotype 5. These patients did not undergo randomization but were enrolled in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group only.\n\n【23】Study Assessments\n-----------------\n\n【24】Serum HCV RNA was measured by means of the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems), with a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU per milliliter. HCV genotype and subtype were determined with the use of the VERSANT HCV Genotype INNO-LiPA 2.0 assay (Siemens). _IL28B_ genotyping was performed by means of polymerase-chain-reaction amplification and sequencing of the rs12979860 single-nucleotide polymorphism.\n\n【25】Assessments during treatment included standard laboratory testing, serum HCV RNA, vital signs, electrocardiography, and symptom-directed physical examinations. All adverse events were recorded and graded according to a standardized scale. 删除2:<u>(Details are provided in the study protocol .)</u>\n\n【26】Deep sequencing of the target regions of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir, HCV NS5A and NS5B, respectively, was performed for all patients at baseline and again for all patients with virologic failure in samples obtained at the time of failure. The sequences from baseline samples were compared with those obtained at the time of virologic failure to detect emergent resistance-associated variants. Resistance-associated variants that were present in more than 1% of sequence reads are reported.\n\n【27】End Points\n----------\n\n【28】The primary efficacy end point was the rate of sustained virologic response, which was defined as an HCV RNA level of less than 15 IU per milliliter at 12 weeks after the end of treatment in all patients who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir or placebo. Secondary end points included the rate of adverse events and treatment discontinuations because of adverse events.\n\n【29】Study Oversight\n---------------\n\n【30】This study was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating study site and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements. The study was designed and conducted by the sponsor (Gilead Sciences) in collaboration with the principal investigators. The sponsor collected the data, monitored study conduct, and performed the statistical analyses. An independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed the progress and oversight of the study. The investigators, participating institutions, and sponsor agreed to maintain confidentiality of the data. All the authors had access to the data and assume responsibility for the integrity and completeness of the reported data and fidelity to the protocol. The initial draft of the manuscript was prepared by a professional writer employed by Gilead Sciences and the first and last authors with input from all the authors.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】The primary efficacy analysis was designed to test for the superiority of the rate of sustained virologic response among patients receiving sofosbuvir–velpatasvir to a prespecified performance goal of 85% by means of a two-sided exact one-sample binomial test. This 85% rate was not a historical control derived from rates of sustained virologic response in prior HCV treatment trials, since it would not be possible to calculate a single historical rate for the different standard treatments recommended for the various genotypes included in this study. Rather, it is a benchmark rate that is based on the general trend toward increasing rates of sustained virologic response in recent years and the general appeal of using a fixed, clinically relevant threshold as a measure of treatment benefit. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> We determined that the enrollment of 500 patients in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group would provide a power of 90% to detect an improvement of at least 5 percentage points in the rate of sustained virologic response over the performance goal of 85%, on the basis of the two-sided exact one-sample binomial test at the 0.05 significance level. We used the Clopper–Pearson method to calculate point estimates and two-sided 95% exact confidence intervals for rates of sustained virologic response for the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group as a whole, as well as according to HCV genotype (1a, 1b, 2, 4, 5, or 6), and various subgroups.\n\n【33】The inclusion of a placebo group was designed to provide the basis for evaluating the safety profile of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir in a population with expected coexisting medical conditions. We used a double-blind approach in the study-group assignments to ensure the elimination of bias in assessments of safety. No formal comparison of safety between the groups was planned.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】Baseline Characteristics\n------------------------\n\n【36】Of the 847 patients who were initially screened, 741 were enrolled and 706 underwent randomization; the 35 patients with genotype 5 infection were enrolled in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group, as prespecified 删除2:<u>(Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org)</u>. One patient, who was lost to follow-up after undergoing randomization to the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group but before receiving treatment, was excluded from the safety and efficacy analyses.\n\n【37】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【38】The demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of the 116 patients receiving placebo and the 624 patients receiving sofosbuvir–velpatasvir were generally balanced 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group, 34% of the patients had HCV genotype 1a, 19% genotype 1b, 17% genotype 2, 19% genotype 4, 6% genotype 5, and 7% genotype 6. Most patients were white (79%) and male (60%). Nineteen percent of the patients had cirrhosis, 69% had a non-CC _IL28B_ genotype (which has been associated with a reduced response to HCV treatment), and 32% had received previous unsuccessful treatment for HCV. Of the 201 patients in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group who had received previous treatment, 28% had received a regimen of peginterferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor, and 61% had received peginterferon and ribavirin; 48% of these patients had persistently detectable HCV RNA while receiving previous treatment, and 51% had a virologic relapse or breakthrough. A total of 51% of patients were enrolled in Europe, 46% in North America (Canada and the United States), and 3% in Hong Kong.\n\n【39】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【40】Table 2.  Table 2. Response during and after Treatment.\n\n【41】Overall, the rate of sustained virologic response among patients who received 12 weeks of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir was 99% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 98 to >99), which was significantly superior to the prespecified performance goal of 85% (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. None of the 116 patients in the placebo group had a sustained virologic response.\n\n【42】Rates of sustained virologic response were similar regardless of the HCV genotype: 98% (95% CI, 95 to >99) in patients with genotype 1a infection, 99% (95% CI, 95 to 100) with genotype 1b, 100% (95% CI, 97 to 100) with genotype 2, 100% (95% CI, 97 to 100) with genotype 4, 97% (95% CI, 85 to >99) with genotype 5, and 100% (95% CI, 91 to 100) with genotype 6. Of the 121 patients with any genotype who had cirrhosis, 120 (99% \\[95% CI, 95 to >99\\]) had a sustained virologic response.\n\n【43】Of the 624 patients who received at least one dose of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir, 2 (<1%) had virologic failure: a 56-year-old white man without cirrhosis who had received no previous treatment for genotype 1a HCV infection and a 58-year-old black man with cirrhosis who had persistently detectable HCV RNA during previous peginterferon–ribavirin treatment for genotype 1b HCV infection. The 2 men had undetectable serum HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment, and both had a virologic relapse by post-treatment week 4. Further details concerning these 2 patients are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【44】Four other patients in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group are not counted as having had a sustained virologic response. Two of the four were lost to follow-up (one did not return after completing 45 days of treatment; the other completed treatment and had undetectable serum HCV RNA at post-treatment week 4 but did not return for the post-treatment week 12 visit), one discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, and one died during follow-up. 删除2:<u>(Details regarding the last two patients are provided in the Safety subsection.)</u>\n\n【45】Rates of sustained virologic response in all patient subgroups, including those with cirrhosis (99%) and prior treatment experience (>99%), were high (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【46】Viral Resistance Testing\n------------------------\n\n【47】At baseline, NS5A resistance-associated variants were detected in 257 of 616 patients (42%) for whom sequencing data were available. Of these 257 patients, 255 (99%) had a sustained virologic response. The 2 patients who had virologic failure had NS5A-resistant variants at baseline and at the time of relapse. The patient with HCV genotype 1a infection who had a relapse had the Q30R variant in 2.6% of the viral population at baseline. At time of relapse, the Q30R variant was no longer present, but the Y93N variant was detected in more than 99% of the viral population. The second patient (with HCV genotype 1b who had a relapse) had the Q30L variant (in 1.1% of the viral population), Q30R (in 98.7%), and L31M (in >99%) at baseline and Q30R (in >99%), L31M (in >99%), and Y93H (in 99%) at the time of relapse. The Q30R variant confers an increase by a factor of 2.2 in the 50% effective concentration (EC <sub>50 </sub> ) of velpatasvir in the HCV genotype 1a replicon. Arginine (R) variants at position 30 of the NS5A protein were present at baseline in 62 patients in the entire study population: 5 patients with genotype 1, 5 with genotype 2, 50 with genotype 4, and 2 with genotype 5. Of these 62 patients, 60 (97%) had a sustained virologic response.\n\n【48】Variants associated with resistance to NS5B nucleoside inhibitors were detected at baseline in 54 of the 601 patients (9%) for whom sequencing data were available. No S282 variants were detected. All 54 patients had a sustained virologic response.\n\n【49】Safety\n------\n\n【50】Of the 624 patients in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group, 1 (<1%) discontinued treatment prematurely because of an adverse event. This patient, a 52-year-old white woman with genotype 1a HCV infection without cirrhosis, discontinued treatment because of an anxiety attack on the 13th day of treatment. Of the 116 patients in the placebo group, 2 (2%) discontinued treatment because of an elevated aminotransferase level, a prespecified criterion for discontinuation.\n\n【51】Table 3.  Table 3. Discontinuations, Adverse Events, and Hematologic Abnormalities.\n\n【52】A total of 15 patients (2%) in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group had 19 serious adverse events 删除2:<u>( Table 3 , and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. No single serious adverse event occurred in more than 1 patient. There was one death in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group. This patient, a 55-year-old white man with HCV genotype 5a without cirrhosis who had a history of dyslipidemia for which he was taking ezetimibe–simvastatin, died during sleep 8 days after the completion of treatment. The cause of death was not determined. The patient was not taking amiodarone. None of the patients in the placebo group had a serious adverse event.\n\n【53】There was no significant difference in the rates of any adverse event in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group and the placebo group (78% and 77%, respectively). The rates of individual adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and nausea.\n\n【54】Hematologic abnormalities were infrequent in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group, affecting 1% of patients or less. No patients in the placebo group had hematologic abnormalities 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. No patient in either study group had a grade 3 or 4 elevation in creatinine (>3.0 mg per deciliter \\[265 μmol per liter\\]) or total bilirubin (>2.5 mg per deciliter \\[43 μmol per liter\\]).\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】Of the 170 million patients who are chronically infected with HCV worldwide, approximately half have HCV genotypes other than genotype 1, including about one third of patients with HCV in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Currently approved regimens of direct-acting antiviral agents are not equally effective across all genotypes, which means that testing to determine genotype and subtype is required before treatment can be initiated. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> A single combination regimen that is effective in all patients regardless of HCV genotype would obviate the need for pretreatment testing, which is an obstacle to treatment in resource-limited settings and may limit treatment uptake outside of specialty clinics. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】In this international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, treatment with sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12 weeks resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response in patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, including those with cirrhosis and those who had received previous treatment and those who had not been treated. Virologic failure was rare in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, and there were no virologic failures among those with HCV genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6. The study patients, who were enrolled at 81 sites in eight countries, were diverse with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. Patients with characteristics that are historically associated with a lower response to treatment — the presence of cirrhosis, prior treatment failure, black race, and non-CC genotype of _IL28B_ — had rates of virologic response similar to those with historically favorable characteristics.\n\n【58】The rate of sustained virologic response we observed in patients with HCV genotype 2 (100%) was similar to that seen in a companion phase 3 trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> reported in the _Journal_ , in which 99% of the patients with HCV genotype 2 in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group had a sustained virologic response. In a companion phase 3 trial reported in the same _Journal_ article, 95% of the patients with HCV genotype 3 who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir had a sustained virologic response, including 98% of previously untreated patients without cirrhosis, 93% of previously untreated patients with cirrhosis, 91% of previously treated patients without cirrhosis, and 89% of previously treated patients with cirrhosis.\n\n【59】The presence of baseline resistance-associated variants was not associated with virologic failure, which was represented in our study by two relapses and no virologic breakthrough. Although the two patients who had a relapse had resistance-associated variants at baseline and at the time of virologic failure, 99% of the patients with baseline NS5A resistance-associated variants had a sustained virologic response, which suggests that pretreatment testing for resistance-associated variants is probably of little clinical value with sofosbuvir–velpatasvir.\n\n【60】Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of patients in the sofosbuvir–velpatasvir group and in no patients in the placebo group. No single serious adverse event occurred in more than one patient who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir. The type, frequency, and severity of nonserious adverse events were generally similar in the two study groups. Hematologic abnormalities occurred infrequently in patients receiving sofosbuvir–velpatasvir (≤1% of patients). No patients receiving placebo had hematologic abnormalities.\n\n【61】A factor limiting the generalizability of our results is that we did not enroll patients in certain regions where the less common HCV genotypes and subtypes are highly prevalent. In addition, we excluded patients with HCV genotype 3 and those with decompensated cirrhosis, but these patients are being evaluated in parallel phase 3 studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> that are reported now in the _Journal_ . Also, patients who had previous treatment failure with sofosbuvir or an NS5A-containing regimen were excluded from the study.\n\n【62】In conclusion, treatment with the single-tablet regimen of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12 weeks was highly effective for a broad range of patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection. The treatment was also effective among patients with compensated cirrhosis.\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Gilead Sciences.</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Feld reports receiving consulting fees from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Merck, and Theravance and grant support from AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Santaris; Dr. Jacobson, receiving consulting fees from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen, Merck, Achillion, and Enanta, lecture fees from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Janssen, and grant support from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen, Merck, and Tobira; Dr. Hézode, receiving personal fees from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, and Merck; Dr. Asselah, receiving fees for lectures and for serving on advisory boards from Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Janssen, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Roche; Dr. Ruane, receiving consulting fees and grant support from Gilead Sciences, Merck, AbbVie, and Janssen and having an equity interest in Gilead Sciences; Drs.

The expression of a truncated, “semifunctional” dystrophin molecule is usually associated with Becker's muscular dystrophy, which is milder than Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】It is not clear whether the full-length dystrophin molecule induces a specific immune response against the deleted sequence in a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy. We tested serum antibodies from a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy who had undergone cardiac transplantation.\n\n【4】Acute dilated cardiomyopathy led to cardiac transplantation in a man with Becker's muscular dystrophy, in whom exons 4 through 7 of the dystrophin gene were deleted. After only two days, the transplanted heart had to be replaced because of graft failure. Despite immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine (1200 mg per day) and prednisone (5 mg per day), the second graft was rejected after two years, and the patient underwent a third cardiac transplantation.\n\n【5】Figure 1.  Figure 1. IgG-Specific Reactivity of the Patient's Serum with Various Normal and Truncated Dystrophin Molecules.\n\n【6】The Western blot was cut in two parts, resulting in two “semi-lanes” of heart muscle from the patient (lane P). The left part of the blot was stained with the patient's serum, and the right part with NCL-Dys2 (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Lane 1 shows normal human muscle; lane 2, muscle from a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy and a deletion of exons 45 through 52 in the dystrophin gene; lane 3, muscle from a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy and a deletion of exons 2 through 7 (BMD1); lane 4, normal human muscle; and lane 5, muscle from a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy and a deletion of exons 3 through 7 (BMD2). Lane P, with the patient's cardiac muscle, was cut vertically.\n\n【7】Antibody NCL-Dys2 detected an immunoreactive band at approximately 380 kd on the right half of lane P (solid arrow). No corresponding band is seen on the left half of lane P, in which the blot was incubated with the patient's serum (open arrow). In the BMD-1 and BMD-2 muscle samples, NCL-Dys2 detected truncated dystrophin molecules (arrowheads, lanes 3 and 5 on the right) and showed an outline of the muscle-fiber membranes (corresponding photographs). The patient's serum did not react with the BMD-1 and BMD-2 muscle samples (arrowheads, lanes 3 and 5 on the left, and corresponding photographs).\n\n【8】Five years after the first cardiac transplantation, we tested the patient's serum for circulating antibodies. IgG and IgM antibodies in his serum reacted with a 400-kd membrane protein in normal human muscle and a series of animal muscles 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. No corresponding reactivity was observed in dystrophin-deficient muscle from patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy or from _mdx_ mice. Although there was serum reactivity with truncated dystrophin molecules in muscle specimens from a series of patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy who had deletions in regions of the gene other than the region in our patient, there was no corresponding reaction when the serum was incubated with the patient's own heart muscle 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【9】Epitope specificity of the patient's serum antibodies was ruled out when the serum failed to react specifically with muscle from two patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy in whom exons of the dystrophin gene encompassing our patient's deletion were also deleted. In one of these patients, exons 2 through 7 were deleted, and in the other, exons 3 through 7 were deleted 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【10】Our study provides evidence of region-specific dystrophin antibodies in the serum (i.e., antibodies directed against the dystrophin sequence that was deleted in the patient). However, we were not able to determine whether the antibodies were related to the clinical rejection.\n\n【11】Our findings are consistent with the results of studies demonstrating the presence of specific post-transplantation antibodies in patients with hereditary Alport-type nephritis who have received renal allografts 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and in _mdx_ mice after the implantation of dystrophin-expressing muscle from a normal congenic donor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Post-transplantation antibodies may represent powerful tools for identifying defective gene products in other inherited diseases.\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>Reginald E.

Combining checkpoint inhibition with cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a synergistic effect and improve efficacy.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who had not previously received treatment. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezolizumab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous random assignment) until they had unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.54 to 0.91; P=0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

Clinical activity of immunotherapies has been observed in patients with refractory or metastatic small-cell lung cancer 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-12 </a></sup></u> ; however, a phase 2 single-group study of maintenance pembrolizumab and a phase 3 study of ipilimumab plus chemotherapy showed no improved efficacy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Atezolizumab (Tecentriq, F. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal anti–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits PD-L1–programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1–B7-1 signaling and restores tumor-specific T-cell immunity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> In a phase 1 trial, atezolizumab monotherapy had an acceptable side-effect and safety profile, with promising durability of response in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】The IMpower133 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding atezolizumab or placebo to first-line treatment with carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. We report a planned interim analysis of overall survival and a final analysis of progression-free survival.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【17】F. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech sponsored the IMpower133 trial, provided the trial drugs, and collaborated with the academic authors on the design of the trial and on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. An independent data and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety data regularly. Protocol approval was obtained from an independent ethics committee at each site. The protocol is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. An author who is an employee of F. Hoffmann–La Roche and an author who is an employee of Genentech analyzed the data. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. All drafts of the manuscript were prepared by the authors, with editorial and writing assistance funded by the sponsor.\n\n【18】Patients\n--------\n\n【19】Eligible patients were adults with histologically or cytologically confirmed extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer as defined according to the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group staging system 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org)</u>, 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> measurable extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers reflecting greater disability) who had not received previous systemic treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Patients with treated asymptomatic central nervous system metastases were eligible (see the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ). Key exclusion criteria were a history of autoimmune disease and previous treatment with CD137 agonists or immune-checkpoint blockade therapies.\n\n【20】Trial Design and Interventions\n------------------------------\n\n【21】The IMpower133 trial is a multinational, phase 1 (safety) and phase 3 (efficacy), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive, in the induction phase, four 21-day cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per minute, administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle) and etoposide (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area, administered intravenously on days 1 through 3 of each cycle) with either atezolizumab (at a dose of 1200 mg, administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle) or placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The induction phase was followed by a maintenance phase during which patients received either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous random assignment) until the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression according to RECIST. Continuation of the trial regimen after the occurrence of disease progression during either phase was allowed if evidence of clinical benefit existed (see the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix ). During the maintenance phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation was permitted, but thoracic radiation therapy was not. Randomization was performed with the use of a permuted-block randomization method (IxRS) and was stratified according to sex, ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1), and presence of brain metastases (yes or no). PD-L1 testing was not performed during screening owing to the expected high rate of inadequate sample types (e.g., fine-needle aspirates, bronchoscopy findings), the low prevalence of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, and the lack of an association between response and PD-L1 expression in the phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-10,17,18</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Phase 1 of the trial was a safety run-in period to establish the side-effect and adverse-event profile of the treatment regimens; during this phase, a minimum of 12 patients were assigned to each group and received at least two cycles of treatment. Trial treatments were administered at full dose according to the protocol. Unblinded safety data were reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee for assessment of the side-effect profile; on the basis of the findings of the committee, the trial continued as a randomized phase 3 trial.\n\n【23】End Points and Assessments\n--------------------------\n\n【24】The primary end points were overall survival (the time from randomization to death from any cause) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (the time from randomization to disease progression according to RECIST or death from any cause, whichever occurred first) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary end points included investigator-assessed objective response rate (according to RECIST) and the duration of response. Confirmation of responses was not required per protocol, but confirmed response rates were reported in the interest of rigor and to protect against potential bias. The estimated rate of overall survival at 1 year was evaluated. Exploratory analyses included the assessment of efficacy according to tumor mutational burden. Assessments of tumor mutational burden were performed with the use of a blood-based assay (blood-based tumor mutational burden), as reported previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【25】Tumor assessments were conducted at screening, every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks starting from day 1 of cycle 1, and every 9 weeks thereafter until the occurrence of disease progression according to RECIST. Patients who continued the trial regimen beyond disease progression continued to undergo tumor assessments every 6 weeks until the regimen was discontinued. Adverse events were assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The investigators determined whether adverse events were related to the trial regimen.\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】The primary end points were assessed in the intention-to-treat population and were analyzed according to the assigned treatment, regardless of the actual treatment received. For the analysis of progression-free survival, data for patients who were alive and had no disease progression were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. For the analysis of overall survival, data for patients who were alive were censored at the time of the last contact.\n\n【28】To control the overall two-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a group-sequential weighted Holm procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> was used wherein the two-sided significance levels of 0.005 and 0.045 were allocated to the primary comparisons for progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. The test that was significant could pass its alpha level to the test that was not statistically significant at the original allocated alpha level.\n\n【29】The sample size of the trial was determined by the analysis of overall survival. We calculated that 306 deaths in the intention-to-treat population would be needed to provide 91% power at a two-sided significance level of 0.045 to detect a hazard ratio for death with atezolizumab as compared with placebo of 0.68, with the use of a log-rank test. One interim analysis of overall survival was performed when 238 deaths had occurred 删除4:<u>(the data cutoff date was April 24, 2018)</u>, with a two-sided alpha level of 0.0193 (stopping boundary), computed on the basis of the Lan–DeMets function approximating the O’Brien–Fleming boundary. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u>\n\n【30】The primary analysis of progression-free survival was conducted at the time of the interim analysis of overall survival. No interim analysis of progression-free survival was planned.\n\n【31】The stratified log-rank test (stratified according to sex and ECOG performance-status score \\[0 or 1\\]) was used for the primary analysis. As prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, the stratification factor that contained the level with the smallest size was dropped from the stratified analysis if at least one stratum had fewer than 10 events. As a result, the stratification factor of presence or absence of brain metastases was removed from the stratified analysis because it contained the level with the lowest number of patients.\n\n【32】Kaplan–Meier methodology was used to estimate the probability of overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as to calculate the median time from randomization to death (for overall survival) and the median time from randomization to disease progression or death (for progression-free survival) for each group, and the Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to construct the 95% confidence interval for the medians. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> A similar approach was used for the analysis of the duration of response. The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox regression model, with the same stratification factors that were used in the stratified log-rank test.\n\n【33】Results\n-------\n\n【34】Patients\n--------\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Eligibility, Randomization, and Analysis.\n\n【36】All patients who underwent randomization were included in the intention-to-treat analysis regardless of actual treatment received and duration of treatment or follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide (atezolizumab group) or placebo plus carboplatin and etoposide (placebo group); four 21-day cycles of treatment were administered in the induction phase, after which patients received atezolizumab or placebo in a maintenance phase. One patient assigned to the placebo group received a dose of atezolizumab and was included in the atezolizumab group in the safety analyses. The date of data cutoff was April 24, 2018.Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of All Enrolled Patients (Intention-to-Treat Population).\n\n【37】Between June 6, 2016, and May 31, 2017, a total of 403 patients were enrolled at 106 sites in 21 countries and were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group (201 patients) or the placebo group (202 patients) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Twenty-two patients in each group received prophylactic cranial irradiation.\n\n【38】In the intention-to-treat population, 104 patients in the atezolizumab group and 116 in the placebo group received at least one subsequent therapy 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Fifteen patients in the placebo group received subsequent immunotherapy.\n\n【39】Overall Survival Analysis\n-------------------------\n\n【40】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Overall Survival and Investigator-Assessed Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【41】Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival, and Panel B the Kaplan–Meier estimates of investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Tick marks indicate censored data. Panel C shows a subgroup analysis of overall survival according to baseline characteristics. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores range from 0 to 5, with higher scores reflecting greater disability. Tumor mutational burden was assessed with the use of a blood-based assay.\n\n【42】At the time of data cutoff, the median follow-up was 13.9 months. A total of 104 patients (51.7%) in the atezolizumab group and 134 patients (66.3%) in the placebo group had died. Overall survival was significantly longer in the atezolizumab group (median, 12.3 months; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 10.8 to 15.9) than in the placebo group (median, 10.3 months; 95% CI, 9.3 to 11.3). The stratified hazard ratio for death was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P=0.007) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>, and the 1-year overall survival rate was 51.7% in the atezolizumab group and 38.2% in the placebo group.\n\n【43】Progression-free Survival Analysis\n----------------------------------\n\n【44】A total of 171 patients (85.1%) in the atezolizumab group and 189 patients (93.6%) in the placebo group had disease progression or died. Progression-free survival was longer in the atezolizumab group (median, 5.2 months; 95% CI, 4.4 to 5.6) than in the placebo group (median, 4.3 months; 95% CI, 4.2 to 4.5). The stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>.\n\n【45】Survival Outcomes in Selected Patient Subgroups\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The benefit with respect to overall survival and progression-free survival associated with the addition of atezolizumab was consistent across key subgroups. Of the 403 patients in the two groups, 374 had plasma available for blood-based analysis of tumor mutational burden; 351 of the samples (93.8%) yielded high-quality data for analysis of tumor mutational burden. An exploratory analysis showed a consistent overall survival and progression-free survival benefit above and below the prespecified cutoffs of 10 and 16 mutations per megabase 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C , and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【47】Confirmed Objective Response Rate and Durations of Response\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Table 2.  Table 2. Response Rate, Duration of Response, and Disease Progression.\n\n【49】Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rates and median duration of response were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In total, five patients (2.5%) in the atezolizumab group and two patients (1.0%) in the placebo group had a complete response.\n\n【50】Safety\n------\n\n【51】The population that could be evaluated for safety included 198 patients who received at least 1 dose of atezolizumab and 196 patients who received placebo. The median duration of treatment with atezolizumab was 4.7 months (range, 0 to 21), and the median number of atezolizumab doses received was 7 (range, 1 to 30). The median number of doses of chemotherapy was the same in the two groups (median, 4 doses of carboplatin and 12 doses of etoposide). The median dose intensity and total cumulative dose of chemotherapy were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Table 3.  Table 3. Adverse Events Related to the Trial Regimen.\n\n【53】Adverse events related to any component of the trial regimen occurred in 188 patients (94.9%) in the atezolizumab group and in 181 patients (92.3%) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the trial regimen were neutropenia, anemia, and decreased neutrophil count 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【54】Deaths related to the trial regimen occurred in 3 patients (1.5%) in the atezolizumab group (death was due to neutropenia in 1 patient, pneumonia in 1 patient, and an unspecified cause in 1 patient) and in 3 patients (1.5%) in the placebo group (death was due to pneumonia in 1 patient, septic shock in 1 patient, and cardiopulmonary failure in 1 patient). Immune-related adverse events occurred in 79 patients (39.9%) in the atezolizumab group and in 48 patients (24.5%) in the placebo group, with rash and hypothyroidism being the most common. Additional information on adverse events is provided in Tables S7 through S10 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】At the time of the primary analysis of progression-free survival and the interim analysis of overall survival, this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial showed that the addition of atezolizumab to carboplatin and etoposide resulted in significantly longer overall and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. The median overall survival was 2 months longer in the atezolizumab group than in the placebo group, and the 1-year overall survival rate was approximately 13 percentage points higher in the atezolizumab group than in the placebo group (51.7% vs. 38.2%). Benefits with respect to overall survival and progression-free survival were consistent across patient subgroups. Objective response rates and median duration of response were similar in the two groups; however, more patients in the atezolizumab group than in the placebo group had an ongoing response at the time of data cutoff 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【57】In patients with treated brain metastases, no difference between the two groups was observed in overall survival or progression-free survival. Owing to the small number of patients with brain metastases enrolled in the trial and the exploratory nature of the analysis, no conclusions can be drawn. Further trials are needed to investigate the role of immunotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer who have brain metastases. An imbalance in overall survival benefit appeared to be present among patients younger than 65 years of age, with older patients faring better. There is no simple biologic explanation for this observation, and further analyses are needed to understand whether other factors may have contributed to this result.\n\n【58】Exploratory subgroup analyses showed no clear suggestion that blood-based tumor mutational burden levels at either cutoff (10 or 16 mutations per megabase) were predictive of benefit with atezolizumab in this population. These results are in contrast to previous studies that suggested an association between high tumor mutational burden and better clinical outcomes in patients receiving cancer immunotherapies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25 </a></sup></u> A possible explanation for the lack of greater benefit with respect to clinical outcomes in patients with high blood-based tumor mutational burden in this trial is that the combination of platinum and etoposide is highly active and also highly myelosuppressive.\n\n【59】In this trial, exposure to chemotherapy was maintained with the addition of atezolizumab. Rates of hematologic side effects were similar in the two groups, and the incidence and types of immune-related adverse events were similar to those seen with atezolizumab monotherapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26-28</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】One randomized, phase 3 study assessed an immunotherapy (ipilimumab) plus chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, but no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups was noted. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Ipilimumab targets CTLA-4 and stimulates peripheral T-cell activation but does not activate T cells in the tumor microenvironment; given this mechanism of action, Reck and colleagues speculated that ipilimumab may be of limited value when added to chemotherapy in patients with this disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> One possible explanation for the effectiveness of atezolizumab in addition to chemotherapy in the IMpower133 trial may be that carboplatin and etoposide might not deplete the intratumoral T-cell population, and atezolizumab may be able to activate the intratumoral T lymphocytes to exert an antitumor effect; however, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\n【61】In addition, a single-group, phase 2 study of maintenance pembrolizumab in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer did not show longer progression-free survival or overall survival when compared with historical data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In contrast, the current trial showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy as first-line treatment. This suggests that combining checkpoint inhibition with cytotoxic therapy during induction may be beneficial and potentially necessary to improve overall survival beyond that seen with the current standard of care, and thus it may be a preferred treatment approach over maintenance checkpoint-inhibitor therapy alone. Further studies directly comparing the two treatment approaches are needed.\n\n【62】In summary, this multinational trial in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in a patient population typical for this disease showed that the addition of atezolizumab to carboplatin and etoposide was associated with significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival, with a safety profile consistent with the defined toxic effects of the individual agents.\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by F.

Her husband — a 56-year-old whose father died of sudden cardiac arrest at 55 — had been feeling chest pressure. The pressure radiated down his arms and occasionally to his neck and, the previous day, had been accompanied by dyspnea and diaphoresis, making him worried enough to call an ambulance. The emergency medical technicians did an electrocardiogram, said it looked OK, and told him to call his primary care doctor. He did, and he was advised that given New York’s Covid-19 outbreak, it was not a good time to go to the hospital. Now, a day later, his colleague asked Lasic, what should they do?\n\n【3】Nearly apoplectic, Lasic advised urgent coronary angiography, which he performed a few hours later. The man had a thrombus extending from his proximal-to-midleft anterior descending artery and became hemodynamically unstable during the procedure. Nevertheless, revascularization was successful, and he was discharged the following day with preserved left ventricular function. Lasic, describing a precipitous decline across the New York region in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, worries that others won’t be so lucky. “I think the toll on non-Covid patients will be much greater than Covid deaths,” he said.\n\n【4】As the coronavirus pandemic focuses medical attention on treating affected patients and protecting others from infection, how do we best care for people with non–Covid-related disease? For some, new risks may warrant reconsideration of usual standards of care. For others, the need to protect caregivers and preserve critical care capacity may factor into decisions. And for everyone, radical transformation of the health care system will affect our ability to maintain high-quality care. As Michael Grossbard, chief of hematology at New York University’s Langone Hospital, told me, “Our practice of medicine has changed more in 1 week than in my previous 28 years combined.”\n\n【5】Cancer care, which often involves immunosuppressive therapy, tumor resection, and inpatient treatment, has been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Like other oncologists I spoke with, Grossbard, who primarily treats lymphoma, has been tasked with revising chemotherapy protocols to minimize both the frequency of chemotherapy visits and the degree of immunosuppression. For example, though patients with low-grade lymphoma typically receive maintenance therapy, it will not be recommended for now because it requires an office visit, worsens immunosuppression, and improves progression-free but not overall survival. Other protocol modifications have arisen because of cancellations of elective surgeries. For instance, some patients with solid tumors, such as breast and rectal cancers, are being offered systemic therapy before, rather than after, surgery.\n\n【6】Many modifications may not affect long-term outcomes. Eric Winer, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, believes, for instance, that giving antihormonal therapy to women with hormone-receptor–positive breast tumors and delaying surgery probably won’t alter overall survival, though this approach hasn’t been formally tested in Stage I disease. But even when there’s greater uncertainty about treatment modifications, Winer has been impressed by many patients’ graceful acceptance.\n\n【7】I spoke to Ms. C., a 40-year-old patient of Winer who was recently diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. Treatment typically involves 4 to 6 months of chemotherapy followed by surgical excision, though as Ms. C. said, “When you have cancer, your first reaction is ‘Just get it out of my body now.’” But as she and Winer watched Covid-19 decimate Italy, they began discussing what the evolving situation would mean for her. She’d started receiving an anthracycline, which heightened her risk of infection, and was supposed to have surgery in May. When we spoke, it wasn’t clear whether or when her surgery would proceed, but she and Winer had agreed that if it was postponed, she would resume targeted systemic therapy. She seemed to take this uncertainty in stride, partly because the hallmark rash of inflammatory breast cancer disappeared after she began receiving Herceptin (trastuzumab) a few months ago. “I literally saw my cancer shrink,” she told me, “and I’m so thankful we are where we are now, as opposed to 25 years ago.”\n\n【8】Suspending other aspects of cancer care will have graver consequences. David Ryan, chief of oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), told me that three patient groups worry him most. The first are the subgroup of patients with lymphoma for whom CAR-T therapy is potentially curative. More than half these patients receive therapy in clinical trials, many of which have been paused amid society-wide shutdowns; even if enrollment could continue, there’s concern about the need for ICU care in a resource-constrained system. A related concern is for patients requiring bone marrow transplants, given their high risk of infection and potential need for ICU care.\n\n【9】Finally, and most wrenching to Ryan, are patients with refractory tumors who are nearing the end of life, but for whom an experimental targeted therapy may hold promise; Ryan would otherwise offer these patients enrollment in an early-phase trial. One recent analysis suggests that such enrollment is associated with clinical benefit in nearly 20% of patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and participation allows patients to have some hope in their dying days and to feel like they’re “giving back” to the scientific community.\n\n【10】The individual toll, as clinical trials slow to a crawl, is mirrored by a societal one. As Ryan, who sent me an email message while serving a volunteer shift in the hospital’s Covid unit, lamented, “There’s no question that clinical research in cancer will be set back by at least a year as we all drop what we’re doing to take care of the surge of patients.”\n\n【11】Protecting Our Patients, Preserving Ourselves\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Another distressing trade-off is that between patients’ needs for procedures and the need to protect caregivers from infection and preserve hospital capacity. A cardiologist friend, for example, told me about a woman in her 70s with some cardiac risk factors who developed chest pressure and shortness of breath. She was reluctant to go to the hospital, and when she presented (at a highly regarded institution), she needed urgent intubation. When chest radiography revealed bilateral interstitial edema, she became a “Covid rule-out” and was transferred to the ICU. As her team awaited the Covid test results, her troponin level climbed, causing increasing concern about an acute coronary syndrome. Though this suspicion would usually prompt more urgent coronary angiography, the uncertainty about Covid status delayed the procedure. When the Covid result came back negative, she underwent urgent coronary angiography, which revealed an acute coronary occlusion. By then, however, she had developed progressive cardiogenic shock, and she ultimately died.\n\n【13】Though physicians must often make judgments amid uncertainty, we typically focus on the patient’s risk, not our own. In an infectious disease epidemic, our calculus must incorporate our own exposure risk — and how exposure would limit our ability to care for future patients. The agony and complexity of these decisions is currently compounded by shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). Ajay Kirtane, an interventional cardiologist at Columbia who has coauthored recommendations for cardiac catheterization laboratories during the pandemic, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> told me that “People are being told to do procedures with inadequate protection.” Though these recommendations aim to minimize both staff exposure and resource utilization, Kirtane recognizes the potential consequences of caution. “One of the yet-to-be-told stories of the Covid-19 pandemic is the recognition that the (necessary) proscriptions on the performance of less urgent cases has led to collateral damage to so many patients with medical conditions that truly couldn’t wait.”\n\n【14】Although canceling procedures such as elective hernia repairs and knee replacements is relatively straightforward, for many interventions the line between urgent and nonurgent can be drawn only in retrospect. As Brian Kolski, director of the structural heart disease program at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange County, California, told me, “A lot of procedures deemed ‘elective’ are not necessarily elective.” Two patients in his practice whose transthoracic aortic valvular replacements were postponed, for example, died while waiting. “These patients can’t wait 2 months,” Kolski said. “Some of them can’t wait 2 weeks.” Rather than a broad moratorium on elective procedures, Kolski believes we need a more granular approach. “What has been the actual toll on some of these patients?” he asked.\n\n【15】Mr. R., a 75-year-old man with advanced heart failure, is another of Kolski’s patients for whom the toll has been great. Because he had progressive volume overload and delirium, Kolski referred him to a hospital for an LVAD workup in early March. Then, as his wife, Ms. R., told me, “the world went wonky, and everything went down the toilet.” Having begun admitting patients with coronavirus, the hospital told the couple it was kicking everyone else out. “They are telling me my husband has 6 to 12 months to live without this procedure,” Ms. R. said, “and now they are canceling it on us.” They were then quarantined at home — 2 hours away from the hospital — with no plan in place. Mr. R.’s health quickly deteriorated again, but his wife had been advised to keep him out of the hospital. When they finally had a video visit on April 9, he’d become so ill that the heart failure physician didn’t recognize him. Mr. R. was promptly admitted, and the LVAD was placed. Though Ms. R. is relieved, ongoing challenges include her husband’s persistent delirium, a visitor policy that allows her to be at the bedside only intermittently, and the need for nearby lodging that they can’t afford.\n\n【16】As painful as these stories are, the degree of uncertainty renders calculated risk–benefit analyses impossible. Should hospitals schedule LVAD placements when ICU and ventilator capacity may soon be exceeded? Is a patient with severe aortic stenosis more likely to die from his underlying valvular disease or from a valve-replacement hospitalization that leaves him with coronavirus infection? How many times can you expose a cath-lab team to patients with Covid-19–associated myocarditis, which can mimic an acute coronary syndrome, before so many staff members are infected that no one remains to treat patients with real myocardial infarction? No one knows the answers to these questions because modern medicine has never faced them before.\n\n【17】Indeed, as Robert Yeh, an interventional cardiologist and health services researcher at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, emphasized, “there perhaps has never been a greater gap between what we need to know urgently and what is actually knowable.” From policy questions, such as how long to postpone elective procedures, to treatment decisions, such as whether to treat Covid-19 with investigational therapies, the stakes of “failing to understand the universe we don’t pursue” have increased. Referring to the global reduction in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, Yeh worries that our emphasis on social mitigation measures makes people who truly need care afraid to seek it. Equally worrisome is how we treat people with myocardial infarction who do reach the hospital. Concern about proceduralists’ exposure has led some physicians to advocate using thrombolytics rather than the standard revascularization strategy, but Yeh asks, “Are we protecting ourselves at the cost of worse patient outcomes?”\n\n【18】Yeh and his colleagues plan to attempt to answer some of these questions empirically, but as we await epidemiologic data, he cautioned against dismissing anecdotes emerging from around the world in the name of scientific purity. Right now, he emphasized, “the sum total of what we hear from our colleagues at other institutions is the best data we have.”\n\n【19】Trade-offs We Don’t Have to Make\n--------------------------------\n\n【20】Ms. D. is a 51-year-old ICU nurse who was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent lumpectomy in late February; unfortunately, the margins were not clear. When she then learned in early March that she carried the _BRCA2_ mutation, she discussed with her surgeon either further excision and intense monitoring or bilateral mastectomy. Ms. D chose the latter but wanted some time to process the decision. With “Covid barreling in,” however, she was urged not to delay. Pathology studies then revealed cancer in the contralateral breast. Though Ms. D. was relieved to have the procedure over with, the rush was hard. “I wished I had time to say goodbye to my breasts,” she recalled.\n\n【21】Harder still was follow-up. Ms. D. was discharged with bilateral axillary drains, which she removed herself, as was “strongly recommended.” But the most difficult moment was the postsurgical multidisciplinary meeting, which would typically be a discussion of treatment options with the team who’d be caring for her, followed by an opportunity to learn about social and emotional support resources. For Ms. D., this meeting instead happened more quickly over the phone, without the visual cues we rely on to signal that we may be overwhelmed or confused. She knows she received lifesaving care. Indeed, sidelined by her illness while watching her nurse colleagues risk their lives on the front lines, she jokes that cancer saved her life. But the lack of face-to-face interaction, compounded by the unavailability of typical support systems, has made it difficult to cope. “Cancer is so emotionally loaded,” she told me, “You need some love. The human part is falling by the wayside.”\n\n【22】Humanity absent sound medical judgment is meaningless. But though the pandemic may force difficult choices, my sense from both doctors and patients is that making these decisions thoughtfully and transparently helps patients feel cared for. Under some circumstances, simply hewing to medicine’s foundational principles will suffice. For example, when I asked Brian Bergmark, a colleague and interventional cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, about whether our cath lab would use thrombolytics in lieu of the usual revascularization strategy for acute coronary syndromes, he said his group would maintain the standard of care as long as possible: “We still have the capacity to provide the right therapy for the right disease for the right patient.”\n\n【23】But what should we do when capacity limitations necessitate delays? Hugh Auchincloss, a thoracic surgeon at MGH, who, like many surgeons, has had to delay some cases, notes that patients may “think that a bunch of administrators and bureaucrats are issuing blanket proclamations about their care.” Auchincloss emphasizes how important it is for patients to know that he has personally reviewed their cases and postponed only those he has deemed nonurgent. Having spoken to all his patients facing delays, he said that despite the difficulty of these conversations, patients are reassured knowing that their doctor has made a personal judgment.\n\n【24】These caring gestures probably assume greater importance in pandemic circumstances. The common fear of “bothering the doctor” is magnified amid images of doctors risking their lives on the front lines. Even Ms. C., the woman with inflammatory breast cancer, felt guilty asking Winer, her oncologist, how Covid might affect her care. “I felt very selfish bringing it up,” she told me. “The whole world is going through this crisis, and here I am thinking about my own situation. But I am also facing life and death.” Yet despite not knowing whether her mastectomy will proceed, Ms. C. feels as cared for as ever. She trusts Winer. He articulated a clear rationale for alternative therapies, and he and his nurse practitioner leave her feeling as if, for her, they have all the time in the world.\n\n【25】Perhaps the greatest challenge, then, is an invisible one: How do we help people who are afraid to seek care to begin with? To date, much public health messaging regarding Covid has focused on social distancing, hand hygiene, PPE for health care workers, and the need for increased testing. Yet as we begin to observe fewer admissions for common emergencies such as heart attack and stroke, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> the need for vigilance about viral transmission need not detract from an equally important message: Covid or no Covid, we are still here to care for you.\n\n【26】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【27】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【28】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on April 17, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【29】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Rosenbaum is a national correspondent for the _Journal_ .</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 150KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【33】参考删除-1:<u>References _(4)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【34】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

A barium swallow revealed narrowing of the pharynx and upper esophagus and a pharyngolaryngeal fistula. The supraglottis was bathed in oropharyngeal secretions.\n\n【8】Other than mild essential hypertension that was treated with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the patient was healthy. Although he had mild dysphagia, his nutritional status was normal. He did not smoke. Serologic tests for cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus were negative, and his serum creatinine concentration was normal. With the exception of the tracheal stoma and the aforementioned laryngeal, tracheal, and pharyngeal abnormalities, the results of a physical examination were normal.\n\n【9】After surgery was proposed, the patient was interviewed once by a psychiatrist and four times by members of the surgical team and a speech pathologist. All those involved agreed that the patient understood the risks and agreed that his motivation was appropriate. The procedure was approved by the institutional review board of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and the patient gave written informed consent.\n\n【10】A donor larynx was found after a six-month search. The donor, a 40-year-old man who had died from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, had had no coexisting illnesses and had not smoked. Serologic tests for cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus were negative. HLA matching between the donor and the recipient was complete. The donor had been intubated for less than 48 hours before his death.\n\n【11】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Transplantation of the Pharyngolaryngeal and Tracheal Complex.\n\n【12】The upper left panel shows the tissues obtained from the donor, including a portion of the trachea, the thyroid gland, the pharynx, the larynx, both superior laryngeal nerves, both superior thyroid arteries, both recurrent laryngeal nerves, a segment of the right jugular vein with contributions from the larynx and the pharynx, and the middle thyroid vein. The upper right panel shows the tissues removed from the patient (purple areas). The thyroid gland was split in the midline and retracted laterally. The lower left panel shows the pharynx and upper esophagus of the transplant split posteriorly in the midline, with the right superior thyroid artery anastomosed to that of the patient and the right jugular vein anastomosed to the patient's right common facial vein. The lower right panel shows the donor tissues after transplantation in the patient. The tracheal stoma is permanent and self-sustaining. Three circumferential sutures secure the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone, elevating the larynx. The midline suture also includes the epiglottis and pulls it anteriorly. Both superior thyroid arteries and superior laryngeal nerves are juxtaposed. The transplanted left middle thyroid is anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to the patient's left jugular vein.\n\n【13】The entire pharyngolaryngeal complex, including six tracheal rings and the thyroid and parathyroid glands, was removed; most of the associated vasculature remained intact 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The left internal jugular vein was injured during removal, limiting subsequent anastomosis on the left side to the middle thyroid vein. The larynx was stored in University of Wisconsin solution and ice until implantation 10 hours later. The duration of ischemia was thus well within the acceptable 20-hour window. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Surgical Procedure\n------------------\n\n【15】Before surgery, the patient received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and methylprednisolone. During surgery, his laryngeal vasculature and innervation were delineated. The strap muscles, hyoid bone, and preepiglottic fat were removed from the donor's larynx, and perfusion was established before the recipient's larynx was removed 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. We anastomosed the donor's right superior thyroid artery to that of the patient and the proximal end of the donor's right internal jugular vein to the end of the patient's relatively large common facial vein. The distal end of the donor's jugular vein was oversewn. Blood flow through the transplant — including the transplanted thyroid gland, the six tracheal rings, the larynx, and the pharynx — was seen within 30 minutes after clamp release.\n\n【16】We then performed a narrow-field laryngectomy and removed the portion of the patient's trachea above the upper half of the tracheal stoma. We split the patient's thyroid and repositioned the segments laterally. We left the patient's hyoid bone in place to ensure that the tongue base and laryngeal elevation were relatively normal. The pharynx had two midlevel strictures and one stricture at the esophageal inlet. Believing that a tight suture line would increase the risk of a fistula, we widened the patient's pharynx substantially by including in the transplant 75 percent of the donor's pharynx. We placed three permanent sutures, 1 cm apart, between the patient's hyoid bone and the donor's thyroid cartilage and then elevated and fixed the larynx to the hyoid bone 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The central suture incorporated the epiglottis to prevent prolapse.\n\n【17】Five tracheal rings were needed to reach the patient's tracheal stoma. The back of the tracheal wall was sutured to that of the donor, and the stoma was recreated superiorly. The left superior thyroid arteries were anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion. The left middle thyroid vein of the transplant was anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to the patient's left internal jugular vein. Both superior laryngeal nerves and the right recurrent laryngeal nerve of the transplant were sutured to those of the patient. The patient's left recurrent laryngeal nerve was not identified.\n\n【18】Postoperative Course\n--------------------\n\n【19】The tracheostomy tube and operative drains were removed the day after surgery. We prepared for the possibility of aspiration because all the motor and sensory nerves in the pharynx had been transected. Glycopyrrolate and atropine were administered to reduce salivary secretion. The patient was fed through a gastrostomy tube for 14 weeks, after which time he was able to swallow adequately. During the first week after surgery, he was given muromonab-CD3 (5 mg per day), cyclosporine (500 mg per day), methylprednisolone (50 mg per day, with the dose decreased to 20 mg per day by postoperative day 4), and mycophenolate mofetil (1 g twice daily).\n\n【20】Subsequently, the patient received cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone in progressively decreasing doses, with his responses monitored by measurements of plasma drug concentrations and biopsies of the transplanted tracheal mucosa. None of the tracheal biopsy specimens revealed signs of rejection. At one month, the transplanted trachea was normal both on endoscopic examination and on microscopical examination of the biopsy specimens. Cyclosporine was given in doses needed to maintain trough plasma concentrations of 400 ng per milliliter. Six months after surgery, the patient's blood pressure and serum creatinine concentration had increased. Administration of additional antihypertensive drugs and a reduction in the dose of cyclosporine resulted in the resolution of these symptoms within six months.\n\n【21】The patient had one episode of rejection 15 months after transplantation. The quality of his voice declined over a period of several days until he became aphonic, at which time he sought treatment. His larynx was edematous. High doses of prednisone were administered, and his larynx returned to normal within three days. Tacrolimus was then substituted for cyclosporine, and he has had no further rejection episodes. He currently takes 7.5 mg of prednisone per day, 1 g of mycophenolate mofetil daily, and 4 mg of tacrolimus twice daily. His blood pressure and renal function are stable.\n\n【22】Results\n-------\n\n【23】Voice Quality\n-------------\n\n【24】On the third postoperative day, the patient uttered his first laryngeal speech in 20 years (the word “hello”). At one month, both vocal folds were lateral, creating a voice that was breathy with vibration generated by the aryepiglottic folds. At four months the right vocal fold was midline, and at six months the left vocal fold was just adjacent to the midline. We believe that the left recurrent laryngeal nerve of the transplant was reinnervated by the patient's small regional motor nerves. Electromyography confirmed that both vocal folds and the cricothyroid muscles had been reinnervated.\n\n【25】Subjective and objective measures of phonation improved steadily and became stable at normal or near-normal levels 16 months after transplantation. These measures included pitch, jitter (vocal quality), intensity (loudness), maximal phonation time, respiratory volume, and airflow (a measure of the efficiency of phonation). At 16 months, the pitch of the patient's voice changed, increasing its natural quality, as confirmed by a trained listener. At 36 months, the characteristics of his speech were all within the normal range. His voice sounded normal, and it served all his verbal communication needs. He was very pleased with the results and reported that his quality of life had improved “immeasurably.” Unemployed before the transplantation, he has since become a motivational speaker.\n\n【26】Respiration and Swallowing\n--------------------------\n\n【27】We initially planned to close the tracheal stoma one year after laser cordotomy of the left vocal fold. Closure would leave a serviceable airway without markedly affecting voice quality. The procedure is currently being actively considered. Attempts to provide a self-closing external valve at the site of the tracheal stoma were not successful. At 40 months, the stoma was self-sustaining, and it has not become crusted or granulated during 34 months of follow-up. Stimulation of the right side of the upper trachea through the stoma with a flexible laryngoscope elicited a sensation of touch but no cough, whereas there was no response on the left side.\n\n【28】Three months after transplantation, the supraglottis and vocal folds were sensitive to touch, which initiated a severe cough. Purposeful swallowing returned soon thereafter, and full oral alimentation was possible. A barium swallow revealed no aspiration of solids or liquids. The patient's sense of taste and smell returned.\n\n【29】Infection\n---------\n\n【30】The patient had a mild case of oropharyngeal thrush three weeks after transplantation, which subsided with decreasing doses of atropine and oral nystatin. He subsequently had three episodes of tracheobronchitis, at 16 and 18 weeks and at 15 months, that were successfully treated with oral amoxicillin clavulanate. Examinations with a fiberoptic laryngoscope through the stoma during each episode of tracheobronchitis suggested that infection, rather than aspiration, was the cause. During the first episode, the patient inexplicably stopped taking the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole given routinely after transplantation and had _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia, which cleared rapidly with intravenous antibiotic therapy.\n\n【31】Thyroid Effects\n---------------\n\n【32】We also transplanted the donor's thyroid and parathyroid glands. The patient's serum calcium, phosphate, and thyroid hormone concentrations remained normal. Four months after transplantation, the four-hour uptake of iodine-123 by the thyroid was 5 percent (normal range, 5 to 15 percent). Imaging revealed that 83 percent of the activity was in the transplanted thyroid lobes and that 17 percent was in the patient's thyroid lobes. It is unlikely that the donor's parathyroid glands were functional after a 10-hour period of ischemia. Therefore, we think that the patient's own parathyroid glands were functioning normally.\n\n【33】Discussion\n----------\n\n【34】This patient underwent transplantation of the larynx, trachea, pharynx, and thyroid and parathyroid glands, and the transplant has remained viable for 40 months. He has a human-sounding voice with inflection, range, and qualities unique to him, and he can swallow normally. Transplanting 75 percent of the donor pharynx did not compromise swallowing. Thus, when transplantation is a reconstructive procedure, a constricted pharynx can be widened without impairing swallowing, as long as sensation is restored.\n\n【35】The results in this patient show that laryngeal transplantation is feasible. We propose that potential candidates for transplantation include aphonic patients with laryngeal trauma, patients with large benign chondromas requiring laryngectomy, and patients who have undergone laryngectomy for cancer and who remain disease-free after five years.\n\n【36】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【37】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.</u>\n\n【38】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to the many staff members of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who contributed to this patient's care and to Mr. Tom Lang for critical appraisal and editing services.</u>\n\n【39】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【40】参考删除-1:<u>From the Departments of Otolaryngology (M.S., J.S., R.E., D.H., R.R.L., I.E.), Nephrology and Hypertension (W.B.), and Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (R.Y.), Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland; and Lifelink Transplant Institute, Tampa, Fla.

Genomic DNA was extracted from 39 tumor specimens obtained by thoracotomy and was examined for activating point mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 of the H- _ras_ , K- _ras_ , and N- _ras_ genes. A novel, highly sensitive assay based on oligonucleotide hybridization following an in vitro amplification step was employed.\n\n【2】The K- _ras_ gene was found to be activated by point mutations in codon 12 in 5 of 10 adenocarcinomas. Two of these tumors were less than 2 cm in size and had not metastasized. No _ras_ gene mutations were observed in 15 squamous-cell carcinomas, 10 large-cell carcinomas, 1 carcinoid, 2 metastatic adenocarcinomas from primary tumors outside the lung, and 1 small-cell carcinoma. An approximately 20-fold amplification of the unmutated K- _ras_ gene was observed in a tumor that proved to be a solitary lung metastasis of a rectal carcinoma.\n\n【3】We conclude that mutational K- _ras_ activation may be an important early event in the pathogenesis of adenocarcinoma of the lung but that amplification of ras genes or mutational activation of H- _ras_ or N- _ras_ does not play a major part in non-small-cell lung cancer. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1987; 317:929–35.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

He had a history of heart failure requiring five-vessel cardiac bypass surgery. He had polydipsia and polyuria, which became markedly aggravated after an overseas trip; on the patient's return, his primary care physician diagnosed diabetes mellitus (serum glucose level, 21.8 mmol per liter \\[393 mg per deciliter\\]; glycosylated hemoglobin level, 17.5 percent). Metformin (at a dose of 750 mg twice daily) reduced the serum glucose level to 14.6 mmol per liter (263 mg per deciliter) within four days and at a higher dose (850 mg twice daily) reduced the serum glucose level to 8.7 mmol per liter (157 mg per deciliter) over the ensuing week.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. “Sugar Cracks” (Lens Damage) due to Glucose Regulation.\n\n【4】Sugar cracks in the right eye (Panel A) and left eye (Panel B) and their spontaneous disappearance within four months (Panels C and D, right eye and left eye, respectively) are shown with the use of Scheimpflug slit-lamp lens photography.\n\n【5】The patient distinctly remembered the sudden onset of blurry vision two days after the initiation of metformin therapy. Blurred vision led to his referral to our service two weeks after onset. At that time, the best corrected visual acuity was 20/80 in the right eye and 20/33 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure (17 to 19 mm Hg) was normal. Slit-lamp examination revealed multiple bilateral, crack-shaped lines traversing the lens 删除2:<u>( Figures 1A and 1B )</u>. These cracks were located primarily in the central part of the lens (nucleus), running more or less parallel to the nuclear curvature. In addition, a larger crack continued as a fairly straight band near both ends of the equator, seemingly traversing the nuclear lens fibers tangentially. These cracks had the same optical density as the aqueous in the anterior chamber, suggesting the presence of fluid-filled cavities within the lens. Other ophthalmic findings were unremarkable. Funduscopy revealed no signs of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n【6】Three months after the initiation of metformin therapy, the lens cracks had vanished spontaneously and visual acuity had improved (right eye, 20/40; left eye, 20/25). At the three-month mark, a trace subcapsular cataract was noted. Over the next two months, visual acuity was recovered (20/20 in both eyes), and no observable lens cracks or opacifications remained 删除2:<u>( Figures 1C and 1D )</u>. During follow-up, no changes were found in the anterior lens radius or refraction; serum glucose levels remained between 6 and 8 mmol per liter.\n\n【7】The lens findings, which we designated “sugar cracks,” appeared to be directly related to the decrease in extracellular glucose levels. A toxic effect of metformin would seem to be unlikely. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The optical density and the reversible nature of the lesions suggest that they were fluid-filled cavities within the interstitium of the lens nucleus, presumably caused by cell-volume regulation in response to hypotonic extracellular fluid. It seems far less likely that the lesions were caused by a rupture in the lens fiber as a result of osmotic swelling. The location of the lesions within the nucleus may be related to the interstitial circulation within the lens. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> This case suggests that adequate cell-volume regulation in the human lens, which has been shown to occur in the cortex, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> may also be present in the nuclear region.\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Gijsbrecht J.M.

We performed coronary arteriography to study the frequency of total coronary occlusion and of angiographically visible collateral vessels in 341 patients within one week of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. In this cross-sectional study, 192, 94, and 55 patients underwent coronary arteriography within 24 hours of peak symptoms, between 24 and 72 hours after peak symptoms, and between 72 hours and seven days after peak symptoms, respectively. In the three groups, total occlusion of the infarct-related vessel was found in 26 percent (49 of 192), 37 percent (35 of 94), and 42 percent (23 of 55) of the patients, respectively (P<0.05). The presence of visible collateral vessels increased in parallel: 27 percent (52 of 192), 34 percent (32 of 94), and 42 percent (23 of 55), respectively (P<0.05). The frequency of subtotal occlusion (i.e., ≥90 percent stenosis) decreased inversely: 34 percent (65 of 192), 25.5 percent (24 of 94), and 18 percent (10 of 55), respectively (P<0.05).\n\n【2】Thus, in contrast to Q-wave infarction, total coronary occlusion of the infarct-related vessel is infrequently observed in the early hours of non-Q-wave infarction, but it increases moderately in frequency over the next several days. These cross-sectional data suggest that non-Q-wave infarction may be related to a preserved but marginal blood supply, which sufficiently disrupts the relation between the supply of and the demand for myocardial oxygen to cause tissue necrosis. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1986; 315:417–23.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

(March 25 issue) 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> found that treatment with intravenous lorazepam is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent seizures related to alcohol. They studied patients with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who presented to the emergency departments of two hospitals in Boston after a witnessed, generalized seizure.\n\n【3】My first shock (of many) was that the patients were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam or a saline placebo, even though it was recognized that without treatment a much higher rate of seizures was expected. I was anticipating a dose–response study or a comparison with another antiepileptic medication.\n\n【4】In explaining the need for their study, the authors stated: “Prevention of recurrent seizures related to alcohol use is important.” So why was it acceptable to withhold treatment from some patients? Furthermore, two of the studies cited by the authors 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> document the efficacy of lorazepam for this indication. Indeed, D'Onofrio et al. stated in the Methods section that lorazepam is an accepted treatment. Why was it necessary to perform this study at all?\n\n【5】My next shock came when I read that “consent was initially waived for any patients who were unable to give informed consent at presentation because of intoxication or postictal phenomena.” If patients are unable to give true informed consent for entry into an important study, it should be obtained from a relative or guardian; otherwise, such patients should not be enrolled under any circumstances, even for a short period. It is important to prevent the mistreatment of patients who cannot protect themselves.\n\n【6】It is hard for me to believe that any patient who had a seizure would consent to participate in a study in which effective treatment might be withheld if the patient understood that this might happen and also understood that he or she was likely to have more seizures. The patients could not have been aware of the dubious value of this study. Therefore, it seems unlikely that true informed consent was obtained from any of the participants.\n\n【7】If lorazepam or another effective antiepileptic medication had been administered to the patients in the control group instead of saline, approximately 18 patients would not have suffered from recurrent seizures within six hours, 11 would not have needed to be hospitalized, and 6 would not have needed to return to the emergency department. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> This was the cost in human suffering that was needed to demonstrate that lorazepam is superior to saline for the prevention of recurrent alcohol-related seizures. It was a high price to pay for a trivial result.\n\n【8】Mitchel B. Sosis, M.D., Ph.D.  \n5804 Parade Field Way, Lansdale, PA 19446\n\n【9】3 References\n\n【10】1.  1\\.

What criteria determined the admission of 42 percent of the placebo group and 29 percent of the lorazepam group to the hospital? Since delirium tremens may develop more than 48 hours after a withdrawal seizure, why was the 48-hour period chosen as the means of determining whether the patients returned to the emergency department with a recurrent seizure?\n\n【16】Since most clinicians would consider a withdrawal seizure a complication of withdrawal and a risk factor for progression to the more serious withdrawal syndrome of delirium tremens (which still carries a considerable mortality rate), how did the authors determine that these patients could or should be released with or without medication rather than be admitted for observation and controlled detoxification?\n\n【17】Robert Matz, M.D.  \nMount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10029-6574\n\n【18】Response\n--------\n\n【19】The authors reply:\n\n【20】_To the Editor:_ We refer Dr. Sosis to our article, which clearly states that at the time of the study, the standard of care at both institutions for patients who presented with a recurrent seizure related to alcohol was similar to that at most urban emergency departments in the United States and included supportive care only. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Therefore, at no time did we withhold an accepted treatment.\n\n【21】For years, we as well as other researchers have sought to improve the care of patients with recurrent seizures related to alcohol. In the 1980s and early 1990s, we exclusively used the anticonvulsant phenytoin without success. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> At the time of this study, it was not recognized that treatment with lorazepam would reduce the rate of recurrent seizures related to alcohol, since no previous randomized, controlled trial had addressed the issue. The study cited by Dr. Sosis included patients who were admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation center and observed for five days for primary prevention of any signs of alcohol withdrawal. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】We believe that Dr. Sosis is confusing two very separate issues: the care of the patient presenting to an emergency department with a recurrent seizure related to alcohol and the primary prevention of withdrawal symptoms, which include seizures, in a controlled inpatient setting. In the first situation, the patient is more likely to refuse a referral to a detoxification program and resume alcohol consumption on discharge. The risks and benefits of the administration of lorazepam in this setting had not been identified. The second scenario involves the monitoring of patients in an inpatient setting for signs of withdrawal. The evidence in this situation suggests therapy with benzodiazepines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【23】In response to Dr. Matz: Patients who had signs and symptoms of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal during the study period were treated with benzodiazepines, as we described. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Patients were not given oral medications on discharge from the emergency department unless they were admitted to the hospital or a detoxification unit. The criteria for admission to the hospital included the presence of recurrent seizure, the progression of withdrawal symptoms to moderate or severe intensity, and the presence of coexisting illness requiring admission.\n\n【24】A 48-hour interval for follow-up was chosen because seizures related to alcohol withdrawal typically occur within this period after the cessation of drinking. Delirium tremens is often a later complication of withdrawal. Extended follow-up could have been confounded by repeated cycles of drinking and abstinence.\n\n【25】We agree that seizures are a serious complication of alcohol withdrawal. Therefore, we offered treatment for substance abuse to every patient. Unfortunately, most of the patients refused these services. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【26】Finally, in the abstract and in the Results section of our article we incorrectly reported the odds ratio for hospital admission in the placebo group as compared with the lorazepam group as 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.0; P=0.02). The correct odds ratio is 1.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.92 to 3.2; P=0.09).

As a quaternary amine, methylnaltrexone, a μ-opioid–receptor antagonist, has restricted ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. We investigated the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone for treating opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】A total of 133 patients who had received opioids for 2 or more weeks and who had received stable doses of opioids and laxatives for 3 or more days without relief of opioid-induced constipation were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (at a dose of 0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo every other day for 2 weeks. Coprimary outcomes were laxation (defecation) within 4 hours after the first dose of the study drug and laxation within 4 hours after two or more of the first four doses. Patients who completed this phase were eligible to enter a 3-month, open-label extension trial.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the methylnaltrexone group, 48% of patients had laxation within 4 hours after the first study dose, as compared with 15% in the placebo group, and 52% had laxation without the use of a rescue laxative within 4 hours after two or more of the first four doses, as compared with 8% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The response rate remained consistent throughout the extension trial. The median time to laxation was significantly shorter in the methylnaltrexone group than in the placebo group. Evidence of withdrawal mediated by central nervous system opioid receptors or changes in pain scores was not observed. Abdominal pain and flatulence were the most common adverse events.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Subcutaneous methylnaltrexone rapidly induced laxation in patients with advanced illness and opioid-induced constipation. Treatment did not appear to affect central analgesia or precipitate opioid withdrawal. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00402038 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Clinicians often use opioids to treat moderate-to-severe pain; however, opioids frequently induce or aggravate constipation. Empirically, laxative therapy may be burdensome and ineffective and result in temporally unpredictable responses. In addition, severe opioid-induced constipation may limit opioid therapy, worsening analgesia. These drawbacks can substantially compromise the quality of life, especially in patients with advanced illness.\n\n【12】Opioid-induced constipation is predominantly mediated by gastrointestinal μ-opioid receptors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Selective blockade of these peripheral receptors might relieve constipation without compromising centrally mediated effects of opioid analgesia or precipitating withdrawal. N-methylation of the uncharged systemic opioid antagonist, naltrexone, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> results in a charged derivative, methylnaltrexone, which has restricted ability to cross the blood–brain barrier in humans because of its polarity and low lipid solubility. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】In healthy volunteers, methylnaltrexone reversed the morphine-induced delay in both gastric emptying and oral–cecal transit time without affecting analgesia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8 </a></sup></u> A small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving long-term methadone users also showed that methylnaltrexone induced laxation (defecation). 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Our randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone, as compared with placebo, in relieving opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness. An open-label extension trial provided additional data on the use of methylnaltrexone for up to 3 months.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Patients\n--------\n\n【17】From February 28, 2004, to October 16, 2005, we conducted both a 2-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase and a subsequent 3-month, open-label extension phase at 27 U.S. and Canadian nursing homes, hospice sites, and palliative care centers. Patients who were 18 years of age or older and had advanced illness, which was defined as a terminal disease (incurable cancer or other end-stage disease) with a life expectancy of 1 month or more, were eligible. Qualifying patients received opioids for analgesia for 2 weeks or more and a stable regimen of opioids and laxatives for 3 or more days before study entry. Patients also had opioid-induced constipation with either fewer than three laxations during the preceding week and no clinically meaningful laxation (as determined by the investigator) within 24 hours before the first study dose or no clinically meaningful laxation within 48 hours before the first study dose. Women of childbearing potential had negative pregnancy tests.\n\n【18】Exclusion criteria were constipation that was not primarily caused by opioids (as determined by the investigator), mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, an indwelling peritoneal catheter, clinically active diverticular disease, fecal impaction, acute surgical abdomen, and fecal ostomy. On completion of the double-blind phase of the study, patients could enroll in the open-label phase 删除2:<u>(Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u>.\n\n【19】In collaboration with the principal academic investigators, Progenics Pharmaceuticals designed the protocol and collected and analyzed the data. All authors had independent access to the primary data and vouch for the data's integrity and completeness. The decision to publish was made by the academic investigators. In addition, a consultant who was paid by the sponsor participated in the writing and editing of the manuscript.\n\n【20】The study was approved by either a central or a local institutional review board and followed Good Clinical Practice and Declaration of Helsinki principles. Each patient provided written informed consent before enrollment in the study.\n\n【21】Study Design\n------------\n\n【22】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.\n\n【23】By day 8 of the double-blind phase of the study, if patients had had fewer than three rescue-free laxations, the initial volume of the study drug could be doubled (from 0.15 to 0.30 mg of methylnaltrexone per kilogram of body weight or an equivalent volume of placebo) at the investigator's discretion.\n\n【24】In the double-blind phase, a computer-generated randomization schedule, blocked according to study center, was used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to methylnaltrexone (at a dose of 0.15 mg per kilogram of body weight) or an equal volume of placebo administered subcutaneously on alternate days for 2 weeks. Patients could continue their baseline laxative regimen throughout the study and take rescue laxatives as needed, though not within 4 hours before or after receiving a dose of the study drug. The study drugs (40 mg of methylnaltrexone per milliliter or placebo) were provided in identically appearing vials. Study staff administered the first dose. Trained caregivers administered subsequent doses. By day 8, if patients had had fewer than three rescue-free laxations (defined as laxation without the use of a rescue laxative, such as an enema or a suppository, after receipt of the study drug), the initial volume of the study drug could be doubled (to 0.30 mg of methylnaltrexone per kilogram) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【25】In the open-label extension trial, patients received subcutaneous methylnaltrexone as needed up to every 24 hours for up to 3 months. The first open-label extension dose (0.15 mg per kilogram) was administered more than 14 days after the first double-blind dose and more than 24 hours after the last double-blind dose. Subsequent doses could be increased to 0.30 mg per kilogram if no laxation occurred within 4 hours or could be decreased to 0.075 mg per kilogram if drug-related adverse events occurred. Safety follow-up was scheduled 30 days after the last study dose.\n\n【26】Evaluations\n-----------\n\n【27】Patients were assessed daily for laxation, including consistency (with six categories, ranging from watery to very hard) and difficulty (with five categories, ranging from no difficulty to great difficulty); concomitant medications; and adverse events. We report adverse events occurring at any time after the administration of the first dose of the study drug. The severity of adverse events was assessed with the use of the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), version 2.0. Constipation-related distress (rated on a scale from “none” to “very much”) was assessed on days 1, 7, and 14. Patients and investigators completed the Global Clinical Impression of Change (a scale ranging from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating better bowel function) on days 7 and 14 and monthly to assess any change in bowel status. Opioid doses were compared by converting doses to oral morphine equivalents with the use of standard formulas. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-17</a></sup></u>\n\n【28】A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic measurements were obtained at screening, on days 7 and 14, and monthly during the open-label extension, and all tests were performed by a central laboratory. Vital signs were monitored before and after the administration of the study drug on day 1 and for patients with a dose escalation on day 9. Patients rated their current pain and worst pain in the preceding 24 hours (on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity) on days 1, 7, and 14.\n\n【29】Patients also used the Modified Himmelsbach Withdrawal Scale (on which scores range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms) for each of seven symptoms of opioid withdrawal: yawning, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, perspiration, tremor, piloerection, and restlessness. The total withdrawal score was the sum of the ratings, ranging from 7 to 28. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【30】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【31】The coprimary outcomes of the double-blind phase were the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after the first dose of the study drug and the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after two or more of the first four doses. Additional efficacy outcomes included the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after four or more of seven doses, the proportion of patients with rescue-free laxation within 4 or 24 hours after each dose, the proportion of patients with three or more laxations per week, the time to laxation, overall pain scores, and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. There was no primary outcome for the open-label extension trial, given its intent.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The primary statistical analysis evaluated rescue-free laxation in the intention-to-treat population (i.e., all patients who underwent randomization and who received one or more doses of the study drug). Missing values were imputed from the last observation carried forward. Primary outcomes in the study groups were compared with the use of the chi-square test after the confirmation of nonsignificant interaction according to center with the use of the Breslow–Day test within a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel analysis. The chi-square test was also used to analyze the laxation response for each of the seven doses and the proportion of patients with three or more laxations per week. After adjustment for the planned interim analyses of efficacy, an alpha level of 0.0249 for each comparison of the coprimary outcomes in the two study groups was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【34】The number of patients needed for the study was based on the results of a previous phase 2 study. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Using a chi-square test with a two-sided alpha of 0.025 and a power (1−beta) of 0.9 and with various assumptions regarding study-group responses, we estimated that the enrollment of 65 patients in each study group (a total of 130 patients) would allow us to detect a difference of 30 to 35% in the proportion of patients who had a laxation response.\n\n【35】Secondary outcomes were considered to be exploratory, and no correction for multiplicity of testing was made. Post hoc analyses were performed with the use of a logistic-regression model to explore the effects of baseline characteristics on the rescue-free laxation response within 4 hours after the first dose in the double-blind phase of the study. The logistic-regression model included age and baseline opioid dose (oral morphine equivalent) as continuous variables and performance status (World Health Organization class 1 or 2 vs. class 3 or 4) and primary diagnosis (cancer vs. noncancer) as categorical variables.\n\n【36】Since the extension phase was not designed to assess efficacy definitively, no inferential data analyses were performed. All data are presented with the use of summary statistics and frequency distributions. Baseline values were obtained before the administration of the first dose of a study drug in the double-blind phase. Adverse events, laboratory data, and vital signs were summarized after the first exposure to the study drug.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Double-Blind Phase\n------------------\n\n【39】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【40】In the double-blind phase of the study, 134 patients completed screening and received a study drug. One patient received methylnaltrexone in an unblinded fashion and was included only in the safety analysis. Thus, the efficacy analysis included 133 patients (71 in the placebo group and 62 in the methylnaltrexone group) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. There were no major differences between the two study groups in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics and performance-status ratings 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. At baseline, the median oral morphine-equivalent dose was 150 mg per day in the methylnaltrexone group and 100 mg per day in the placebo group. In both groups, the median number of laxative drug classes used was two.\n\n【41】### _Efficacy_\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Primary Outcomes, Response at 13 Days, and the Time to Response.\n\n【43】Panel A shows the results of the primary efficacy outcomes — laxation within 4 hours after the first dose of the study drug and laxation within the first 4 hours after two or more of the first four doses — in the methylnaltrexone group and the placebo group. P<0.001 for both comparisons between the methylnaltrexone group and the placebo group. Panel B shows rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after each dose during a 13-day period. P<0.005 for all comparisons. On days 9, 11, and 13, variations in doses were permitted on the basis of efficacy and adverse events. Panel C shows Kaplan–Meier curves for the time to laxation within 4 hours after the first dose of the study drug in the two groups (P<0.001).\n\n【44】The proportion of patients who had rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after receiving the first dose of the study drug was 48% in the methylnaltrexone group, as compared with 15% in the placebo group; similarly, significantly more patients in the methylnaltrexone group had rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after two or more of the first four doses, as compared with the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. Results remained significant for observed responses rather than last observation carried forward. The differences between the study groups remained significant for both outcomes after adjustment for characteristics of the baseline opioid dose (P<0.001).\n\n【45】In the methylnaltrexone group, 24 patients (39%) had rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after four or more of seven doses during a 13-day period, as compared with 4 patients in the placebo group (6%) (P<0.001); after doses 2 through 7, 37 to 47% of the methylnaltrexone group had rescue-free laxation, as compared with 7 to 14% of the placebo group 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. Differences between the study groups were significant for each of the seven doses (P<0.005 for all comparisons). During the double-blind study, 79% of the methylnaltrexone group and 46% of the placebo group had a laxation response within 4 hours after one or more doses.\n\n【46】Rescue-free laxation within 24 hours after each of the seven doses occurred in 55 to 66% of the methylnaltrexone group and in 29 to 39% of the placebo group. These differences were significant (P<0.05) for doses 1 through 4 but did not reach statistical significance for doses 5 through 7. In addition, the proportion of patients with three or more rescue-free laxations per week was significantly higher in the methylnaltrexone group than in the placebo group (68% vs. 45%, P=0.009). Among doses linked to rescue-free laxation within 4 hours, watery bowel movements occurred after 28 of 176 doses of methylnaltrexone (16%) and after 8 of 48 doses of placebo (17%).\n\n【47】Post hoc logistic-regression model analysis of data in the methylnaltrexone group showed that rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after the first dose did not vary according to age, functional status, a diagnosis of cancer (as compared with noncancer), or the baseline opioid dose (oral morphine equivalent) 删除2:<u>(Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【48】The time to laxation after the first dose was rapid 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>; among patients in the methylnaltrexone group who had a response within 4 hours, half had a response within 30 minutes. Among all patients, the median time to laxation after the first dose was 6.3 hours in the methylnaltrexone group and more than 48 hours in the placebo group (P<0.001). The shorter time to laxation in the methylnaltrexone group persisted for each of the seven doses (P<0.002 for all comparisons).\n\n【49】Forty-one patients had a dose escalation during the second week (20 who received 0.3 mg per kilogram in the methylnaltrexone group and 21 in the placebo group at an equivalent volume). In the methylnaltrexone subgroup that received a dose escalation, the rescue-free laxation response rate (percent of doses) was 15% within 4 hours at the previous dose of 0.15 mg per kilogram, whereas the rate was 24% after the dose was increased to 0.3 mg per kilogram. In contrast, in the placebo subgroup, the rates of rescue-free laxation were 8% in patients before a dose escalation and 7% in patients after a dose escalation.\n\n【50】Among patients with laxation within 24 hours after receiving a dose of the study drug, stool consistency improved from hard or very hard at baseline to slightly hard, firm, or soft or formed in similar percentages of patients in the two study groups. More patients in the methylnaltrexone group than in the placebo group had reductions in the difficulty of laxation and distress associated with constipation. Scores on the Global Clinical Impression of Change scale on days 7 and 14 showed that the majority of patients in the methylnaltrexone group considered that their bowel status had improved, but a majority of patients in the placebo group considered that their status was unchanged 删除2:<u>(Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【51】### _Pain Scores and Opioid Withdrawal_\n\n【52】Table 2.  Table 2. Mean Scores for Pain Assessment and Symptoms of Opioid Withdrawal.\n\n【53】Patients in the two study groups had similar mean pain scores at baseline and at each evaluation, with minimal changes over time 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Similarly, in both study groups, scores on the Modified Himmelsbach Withdrawal Scale remained stable throughout the study 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【54】### _Adverse Events_\n\n【55】Table 3.  Table 3. Incidence of Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 5% of Patients in Either Study Group during the Double-Blind Phase.\n\n【56】Similar percentages of patients in the two study groups had at least one adverse event. Of the adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients in either study group, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, increased body temperature, and dizziness occurred more frequently in the methylnaltrexone group, with an increase in incidence of 3 percentage points or more over that in the placebo group 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Adverse events that occurred more frequently in the placebo group than in the methylnaltrexone group included falls and hypotension. The pattern of adverse events in patients who had a dose escalation to 0.3 mg per kilogram during the second week showed no meaningful differences between groups. Reactions at the injection site did not differ between the study groups, with three patients in each group reporting such effects.\n\n【57】Investigators rated most adverse events as mild or moderate. Severe adverse events (grade 3 on the CTC scale) occurred in 8% of patients in the methylnaltrexone group and 13% of those in the placebo group. Life-threatening adverse events (grade 4) occurred in 16% of patients in the methylnaltrexone group and 15% of those in the placebo group. All grade 4 adverse events were judged to be related to the primary illness (e.g., progression of an underlying cancer).\n\n【58】Serious adverse events occurred in 17% of patients in the methylnaltrexone group and 28% of those in the placebo group 删除2:<u>(Table 4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The most commonly reported serious adverse event in both study groups was the progression of a malignant neoplasm (in 11% of patients in the methylnaltrexone group and 17% of those in the placebo group). A majority of the remaining serious adverse events also reflected underlying disease progression. Investigators deemed that all serious adverse events were either not related or unlikely to be related to the study drug. Discontinuations that were associated with adverse events occurred in 6% of patients in the methylnaltrexone group and 7% of those in the placebo group.\n\n【59】There were 10 deaths (16%) in the methylnaltrexone group and 16 (23%) in the placebo group. Five deaths in the methylnaltrexone group and 12 in the placebo group occurred during the 30-day follow-up after administration of the last study dose. During the double-blind phase, the investigators considered all deaths to be related to underlying disease progression and none to a study drug. Most laboratory measures were similar in the two study groups at baseline and at each subsequent evaluation. No laboratory measure showed clinically relevant changes from baseline.\n\n【60】Open-Label Extension\n--------------------\n\n【61】Table 4.  Table 4. Rate of Rescue-free Laxation during the Open-Label Extension Phase, According to Study-Group Assignment in the Double-Blind Phase.\n\n【62】Eighty-nine patients who completed the 2-week double-blind study entered the open-label extension phase, and 82 patients (42 who had previously received methylnaltrexone and 40 who had previous received placebo) received at least one dose of methylnaltrexone during the extension phase. Table 4 shows the laxation response during the open-label phase. Among patients who had received methylnaltrexone during the double-blind phase, the rates of rescue-free laxation during the open-label phase in months 1 through 3 for all doses were 45 to 58%. For patients who had received placebo during the double-blind phase, the response rates were 48 to 52%. Among patients who had rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after receiving a dose of open-label methylnaltrexone, the median times to laxation for each individual dose were all less than 45 minutes.\n\n【63】During the extension phase, the most common adverse events were abdominal pain (30%), progression of malignant neoplasm (24%), nausea (21%), and vomiting (20%). Serious adverse events occurred in 36 patients (44%); most of the events were consistent with underlying disease progression. Serious adverse events that were deemed to be related to the study drug were muscle spasms (in one patient) and abdominal pain and exacerbated pain (both in one patient). There were 32 deaths during the extension phase, including 8 during the 30-day follow-up. Investigators deemed that all deaths were consistent with underlying disease progression.\n\n【64】Discussion\n----------\n\n【65】In advanced illness, opioid-induced constipation can rival distress caused by pain. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> Current laxative therapy for opioid-induced constipation, even optimally titrated, may be burdensome or ineffective for some patients. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> can cross the blood–brain barrier, resulting in pain and opioid withdrawal. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23-25 </a></sup></u> In contrast, methylnaltrexone belongs to a new drug class with selective antagonism of peripheral μ-opioid receptors and might help relieve opioid-induced constipation but maintain analgesia. As a charged naltrexone derivative, methylnaltrexone does not affect the central nervous system in humans. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> Previous studies showed methylnaltrexone reversal in opioid-induced delay in the oral–cecal transit time in both healthy subjects and patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,8,9,27 </a></sup></u> Moreover, because methylnaltrexone induced laxation in a pilot study involving long-term methadone users 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> and in a phase 2 trial involving patients with advanced illness and opioid-induced constipation, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> the drug may reverse opioid-induced constipation without affecting analgesia or triggering opioid withdrawal mediated by central nervous system receptors.\n\n【66】Patients with advanced illness in our study were receiving a median opioid dose of about 100 mg of oral morphine equivalent and were constipated at baseline, despite receiving a median of two classes of laxatives. Patients may have had a response to adjustment of their baseline laxatives; therefore, the study population cannot be described as one in which optimal therapy was a failure. However, this population represents a clinically relevant group of patients who do not have a response to a reasonable laxative regimen and either may continue to have constipation while laxatives are adjusted or may be subjected to invasive rectal interventions. In this population, subcutaneous methylnaltrexone induced laxation within 4 hours after administration in a significantly higher proportion of patients than did placebo, a benefit that persisted during the administration of all seven double-blind doses. Overall, the rate of a laxation response persisted throughout the 2-week double-blind phase and the 3-month open-label extension.\n\n【67】The response to methylnaltrexone was rapid; among patients who had a response within 4 hours after receiving a dose, half had laxation within 30 minutes, and most had laxation within 1 hour. This rapid onset of action may be a desirable feature for both patients and caregivers, considering that other laxatives often have a longer or unpredictable onset of action.\n\n【68】Approximately half the patients did not have a response to the first methylnaltrexone dose. It is unlikely that this nonresponse was explained by the antagonist–agonist ratio, because the laxation response did not vary over a large range of opioid doses, and there was a weak dose–response relationship. Another placebo-controlled trial showed that subcutaneous injections of methylnaltrexone in doses of 0.15 mg or 0.3 mg per kilogram were equally effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> Furthermore, some patients may have opioid-induced constipation mediated by central μ receptors. However, intravenous methylnaltrexone induced laxation in 100% of patients who were long-term users of methadone and who had opioid-induced constipation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> This finding suggests that peripheral μ receptors largely mediate opioid-induced constipation. Patients with advanced illness may have other causes of constipation, including immobility, decreased oral intake, a low-fiber diet, metabolic and endocrine imbalances, neurologic disorders, concomitant drug side effects, inadequate toileting arrangements, sedation, depression, and advanced age. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> In our study, logistic-regression analysis showed no correlation between laxation response and age, functional status, or cancer versus a noncancer diagnosis. Thus, the lack of response in a subgroup of patients remains unexplained. Nevertheless, the response to methylnaltrexone suggests that even in our study population of patients with advanced illness, peripheral μ-receptor activity was a major factor in constipation, whether as a result of exogenous or endogenous opioids.\n\n【69】In our study, methylnaltrexone did not increase pain or trigger opioid withdrawal, findings that are supportive of the peripheral action of methylnaltrexone. Although oral naloxone, in the absence of systemic withdrawal, triggered diarrhea that was hypothesized to be a manifestation of local withdrawal in the gastrointestinal tract, 删除3:<u><sup><a>30,31 </a></sup></u> methylnaltrexone did not increase the incidence of watery stools. It is not known whether this observation reflects a difference in the mechanism of action between methylnaltrexone and naloxone or is related to the ratio between the dose of methylnaltrexone and the opioid dose.\n\n【70】Abdominal pain and flatulence were the most common adverse events in the methylnaltrexone group during the double-blind phase of our study. All methylnaltrexone-treated patients reported that such symptoms were mild or moderate. The overall incidence of adverse events and treatment discontinuations that were associated with adverse events were similar in the two study groups. As expected in patients who are seriously ill, many serious adverse events and deaths occurred. However, the incidence of such events was similar in the two groups, and all deaths were related to underlying disease progression.\n\n【71】Opioid-induced constipation is an important problem for patients with advanced illness and poses therapeutic challenges for clinicians. Our study showed that in this population methylnaltrexone rapidly induced laxation without compromising analgesia. Methylnaltrexone may represent an important therapeutic option for patients with advanced illness who are suffering from opioid-induced constipation.\n\n【72】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【73】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Progenics Pharmaceuticals.</u>\n\n【74】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

The primary outcome was a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (defined by the use of vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal-replacement therapy) on day 28.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 872 patients underwent randomization (435 to the vitamin C group and 437 to the control group).

The protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) has been described previously 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> and was approved by the ethics committee at each participating trial site.\n\n【19】The trial was funded by the Lotte and John Hecht Memorial Foundation. Nova Biomedical Canada provided glucometers, testing strips, and control solutions (StatStrip Express) to trial sites that requested them. Without input from the funder, the authors were responsible for the design, planning, and coordination of the trial and for the analysis of the data; all the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Site investigators, research personnel, or trained delegates assessed the eligibility of potential patients, and research personnel collected the data. Informed consent was provided by the patients or their legal representatives; after approval by local authorities, consent could be obtained by telephone or patients could be enrolled with deferred consent, followed by informed consent as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n【20】The corresponding authors wrote the first draft of the manuscript. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【21】Patients\n--------\n\n【22】Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years of age) who had been in the ICU for no longer than 24 hours, who had proven or suspected infection as the main diagnosis, and who were receiving a vasopressor. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to vitamin C therapy, receipt of open-label vitamin C, or expected death or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy within 48 hours. Details regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org.\n\n【23】Randomization and Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【24】We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vitamin C or placebo, stratified according to site by means of a centralized Web-based system using permuted blocks of variable, undisclosed size. Patients, clinicians, and trial personnel and statisticians were unaware of trial-group assignments.\n\n【25】Patients in the intervention group received intravenous vitamin C in a bolus dose of 50 mg per kilogram mixed in a 50-ml solution of either dextrose 5% in water or normal saline. Doses were administered over 30 to 60 minutes every 6 hours for 96 hours (i.e., 200 mg per kilogram per day, with a maximum of 16 doses) as long as patients remained in the ICU. In the control group, patients received a matching placebo infusion (dextrose 5% in water or normal saline). At each site, pharmacists who were not involved in the patients’ clinical care prepared the respective infusions in an unblinded manner.\n\n【26】All other aspects of care, including the administration of glucocorticoids (including agents with mineralocorticoid effects) and thiamine, were performed at the discretion of the treating teams. Local research staff members collected data on inpatient outcomes, and the central management team conducted telephone interviews with patients or their representatives 6 months after randomization. If patients had been discharged from the hospital before day 28, ascertainment of the primary outcome was completed at the time of the 6-month follow-up interview.\n\n【27】Trial Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【28】The primary outcome was a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction (defined as receipt of vasopressors, invasive mechanical ventilation, or new renal-replacement therapy) 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> on trial day 28. Secondary outcomes were the number of days without organ dysfunction in the ICU up to day 28; mortality at 28 days and 6 months; quality of life at 6 months; organ failure at days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28; and biomarkers of global tissue dysoxia (lactate), inflammation (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor α), and endothelial injury (thrombomodulin and angiopoietin-2) at days 3 and 7. Quality of life was assessed with the use of the European Quality of Life–5 Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> which evaluates mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression and categorizes each of these dimensions into five levels that range from no problems to extreme problems. Organ failure was measured by means of the score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> which grades the function of six organ systems on the basis of blood pressure and vasopressor requirements, oxygenation, platelet count, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and the score on the Glasgow Coma Scale. We evaluated the patients’ disease severity on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, with scores that range from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating an increased risk of death.\n\n【29】On the basis of potential adverse effects reportedly associated with vitamin C therapy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-20 </a></sup></u> we recorded the incidence of stage 3 acute kidney injury, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> acute hemolysis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and hypoglycemia 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> as safety outcomes. All unexpected serious adverse events (i.e., those neither prespecified nor included as outcomes) that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to a trial procedure were reported to the trial coordinating center within 24 hours and were subsequently investigated and reported to the data and safety monitoring board and to Health Canada, the governmental department responsible for Canadian health policy.\n\n【30】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【31】On the basis of the results of a clinical trial involving a similar population, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> we anticipated that the risk of death at 28 days or persistent organ dysfunction in the control group would be approximately 50%. Thus, the enrollment of 385 patients per group would provide the trial with 80% power to detect an absolute between-group difference of 10 percentage points in the risk of this outcome with a two-sided type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05. To account for withdrawal of consent and loss to follow-up, we planned to enroll 400 patients per group. On April 23, 2020, the steering committee notified the data and safety monitoring board and Health Canada that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who fulfilled the eligibility criteria would be offered participation in the trial. We inflated the sample size to ensure that the trial included the originally intended number of patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【32】The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population to assess the superiority of vitamin C over placebo, according to the assigned trial group. We estimated the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval for the primary outcome in a generalized linear mixed model with binomial distribution and a log-link function, with trial site considered as a random effect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> In a secondary analysis of the primary outcome, we adjusted for prespecified baseline characteristics (age, sex, APACHE II score, 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> baseline receipt of glucocorticoids, and time from ICU admission to randomization) using generalized estimating equations.\n\n【33】In other prespecified secondary analyses, we compared mortality at 28 days in unadjusted and adjusted models by applying the same variables that were used in analyzing the primary outcome. We compared 6-month survival using a Cox model and compared the number of days free of organ dysfunction in the ICU up to day 28 using a cumulative distribution function, with death at 28 days coded as minus one. In addition, we compared SOFA scores during the first 7 days using a linear mixed model that included time, group interaction, and biomarkers according to constrained longitudinal data analysis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> For SOFA scores after day 7, we evaluated between-group differences in means and imputed scores for patients who had died or had been discharged before day 7. For safety outcomes, we reported the number of each prespecified safety outcome (after adjudication in the case of hemolysis) and unexpected serious adverse events in each trial group. We report treatment-effect estimates as risk ratios or differences in means or medians as appropriate, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.\n\n【34】Analyses excluded one patient for whom outcome data were missing after withdrawal of consent for follow-up. We conducted best case–worst case unadjusted sensitivity analyses of death as a component of the primary outcome and as a secondary outcome.\n\n【35】The data and safety monitoring board reviewed the results of two planned interim analyses (after 248 and 525 patients had completed follow-up for the primary outcome) and recommended continuation of the trial. Details regarding all statistical analyses are provided in the protocol 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> and the Supplementary Appendix ). At the time of this report, all the trial investigators remained unaware of the results of the interim analyses.\n\n【36】We prespecified the subgroup analyses of the primary outcome according to age (<65 years or ≥65 years), sex, frailty (according to a score on the Clinical Frailty Scale 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> of 1 to 4 or ≥5), severity of illness (the quartile of predicted risk of death on the basis of the baseline APACHE II score), presence of septic shock (defined as the use of a vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥65 mm Hg and the presence of a lactate level of ≥2 mmol per liter 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> vs. the use of vasopressor infusion alone), and the quartile of the baseline vitamin C level (as measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry). We hypothesized that vitamin C would be more beneficial in elderly patients, in those with greater frailty and illness severity at baseline, in those who met strict criteria for septic shock, and in those with a lower baseline vitamin C level. After modifying the protocol to permit the enrollment of patients with SARS-CoV-2, we added a subgroup analysis comparing the effect of vitamin C in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 that was based on the hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect. In addition, we assessed the credibility of apparent subgroup effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26</a></sup></u>\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Patients\n--------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Randomization.\n\n【40】Immediately after randomization but before receiving any dose of either vitamin C or placebo, 8 patients were found to be ineligible and were removed from the trial after blinded adjudication by two steering-committee members. Of these patients, 1 underwent randomization under deferred consent but regained sufficient capacity to decline consent; 5 patients had surrogate decision makers who initially gave and then withdrew consent, 1 patient was found to be allergic to vitamin C, and 1 patient was enrolled in error in a different study using the same randomization system. In addition, 1 patient withdrew consent after receiving the trial infusion. This patient remained part of the trial population according to the intention-to-treat principle. G6PD denotes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ICU intensive care unit, and IV intravenous.\n\n【41】From November 14, 2018, to July 19, 2021, we enrolled 872 patients; of these patients, 8 underwent randomization in error and 1 withdrew consent, which left 863 patients in the primary analysis population (429 in the vitamin C group and 434 in the placebo group) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【42】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【43】The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Overall, 96.7% of the patients received at least 90% of the scheduled doses of vitamin C or placebo 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. The patients’ median stay was 6 days (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 3 to 12) in the ICU and 16 days (IQR, 8 to 32) in the hospital. The use and duration of cointerventions and life-sustaining therapies during the course of the ICU stay were similar in the two groups (Tables S3 and S4). The groups had similar urine output and fluid balance during the first 7 days in the ICU 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>.\n\n【44】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【45】Table 2.  Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes.\n\n【46】At day 28, 191 of 429 patients (44.5%) in the vitamin C group had died or had persistent organ dysfunction, as compared with 167 of 434 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.04 to 1.40; P=0.01) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. In the analysis performed after adjustment for prespecified baseline characteristics, the risk ratio for the primary comparison was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.47) 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. In the best case–worst case sensitivity analyses that accounted for the single patient with unknown status regarding the primary outcome, the results were similar to those in the primary analysis.\n\n【47】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【48】Figure 2.

The median number of days without organ dysfunction at day 28 was 17 in the vitamin C group and 19.5 in the placebo group (median difference, −2.43 days; 95% CI, −7.23 to 2.37) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S1)</u>. We observed no material differences between groups in SOFA scores (Fig. S2), biomarkers 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>, 6-month survival 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>, or health-related quality of life 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【51】Safety Outcomes and Subgroup Analyses\n-------------------------------------\n\n【52】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Subgroup Analyses.\n\n【53】Shown is a forest plot of the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups. Risk ratios are based on generalized linear mixed models after adjustment for trial site, assigned group, subgroup, and the interaction between subgroup and assigned group. For the subgroup with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a generalized estimating equation was used because the generalized linear mixed model did not converge. The score on the Clinical Frailty Scale was missing for one patient in the placebo group. Statistical tests for interaction appear in Table S9. Confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity and inferences drawn from the intervals may not be reproducible. The predicted risk of death was estimated on the basis of the patient’s score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, on which higher scores indicate an increased risk of death. Higher scores on the Clinical Frailty Scale indicate more severe frailty. Sepsis-3 denotes the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock.\n\n【54】We observed no material between-group differences in the prespecified safety outcomes 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There were 4 adverse events in the vitamin C group and 1 in the placebo group 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>. In the vitamin C group, 1 patient had a serious adverse event of anaphylaxis and another had a severe hypoglycemic episode 删除3:<u><sup><a>27 </a></sup></u> that triggered a protocol amendment requiring modifications in blood-glucose monitoring in many centers. There was no evidence of credible subgroup effects 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 and Table S9)</u>.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In this international, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving adults with sepsis who were receiving vasopressor infusions in the ICU, the composite primary outcome (death or persistent organ dysfunction at trial day 28) occurred more frequently in patients who had received intravenous vitamin C than in those who had received placebo. This was an unexpected finding, and the secondary analyses — which included the evaluation of five biomarkers of tissue dysoxia, inflammation, and endothelial injury measured up to day 7 — did not determine a putative mechanism for harm.\n\n【57】Our findings differ from those of recent meta-analyses of vitamin C monotherapy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,11 </a></sup></u> which included two smaller randomized trials evaluating the same vitamin C regimen as was used in our trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,28 </a></sup></u> The first of these was a dose-finding trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> involving 24 patients with severe sepsis who were randomly assigned to receive vitamin C at a dose of either 12.5 mg or 50 mg per kilogram or placebo every 6 hours for 4 days. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> The higher-dose vitamin C regimen was associated with a reduction in SOFA scores during a 96-hour period. In the second trial (Vitamin C Infusion for Treatment in Sepsis Induced Acute Lung Injury \\[CITRIS-ALI\\]), 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> 167 patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome were randomly assigned to receive vitamin C (50 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 6 hours for 4 days. SOFA scores during a 96-hour period were similar in the two groups without accounting for the competing risk of death, but 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the vitamin C group. As in our trial, in the CITRIS-ALI trial, patients had undergone randomization within 24 hours after eligibility had been confirmed. However, in our trial, patients did not need to have severe respiratory failure and may have been recruited earlier relative to the onset of sepsis and peak oxidative stress than were the patients in the CITRIS-ALI trial. In our trial, vitamin C was administered within 4 hours after randomization, as compared with 6 hours in the CITRIS-ALI trial.\n\n【58】One plausible explanation for the divergent findings regarding mortality is that large effect estimates from smaller trials may occur by chance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> Differences in baseline characteristics, such as the presence of respiratory failure or receipt of vasopressors, may also explain such differences. Such knowledge gaps may be addressed in ongoing trials of vitamin C in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers NCT02735707 . opens in new tab and NCT04401150 . opens in new tab ) and in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome 删除4:<u>(EudraCT number, 2020-003923-40 . opens in new tab )</u>.\n\n【59】The primary outcome in our trial, a composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction, included death to address the competing-risk issue. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> Vitamin C had a consistent effect across all elements of the composite outcome and on 6-month mortality. These factors, in addition to increased statistical efficiency, mitigate the disadvantages of using a composite outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>30,31 </a></sup></u> Other strengths of our analyses include blinding to limit ascertainment bias, a median enrollment time of approximately 12 hours after ICU admission, high protocol adherence, ascertainment of the renal-replacement therapy component of the primary outcome in patients who were discharged from the hospital before day 28, and assessment of biomarkers and baseline vitamin C levels.\n\n【60】However, the trial also has several limitations. Nine patients who had undergone randomization did not contribute data to the primary analysis; of these patients, eight had not received either vitamin C or placebo and had met the prespecified criteria for exclusion after randomization. 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> Only one patient who withdrew consent could not be included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Given the high number of events that were recorded in each group, the effect of these exclusions is probably small. Information regarding specific pathogens and the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy was not collected; however, systematic differences in postrandomization care are less likely in blinded trials. Information to ascertain the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome at baseline was not collected, so it remains unclear whether this subgroup had a different response to vitamin C. Although the patients were representative of those with sepsis being treated in the ICU in many high-income countries, the trial population differs substantially from patients in many low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence of sepsis and the associated case fatality rate are highest 删除2:<u>(Table S10)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】In adults with sepsis who were receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU, the receipt of intravenous vitamin C resulted in a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days than the receipt of placebo.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Lotte and John Hecht Memorial Foundation .

The dose of erythropoietin (50 to 150 units per kilogram of body weight) was adjusted according to the hematocrit response.\n\n【2】In all 17 patients the anemia responded to erythropoietin. The median hematocrit increased from 0.27 to 0.37. The rate of the response depended on the initial erythropoietin dose and was similar to that observed in patients who were on dialysis. Hypertension was present in 14 patients before therapy, developed during therapy in 2 of the normotensive patients, and worsened in 9 patients, who required additional antihypertensive medications. The rate of the decline in renal function, as measured by serial determination of the reciprocal of the serum creatinine level, did not change significantly as the hematocrit rose (P = 0.78 by the paired t-test) during erythropoietin therapy.

Fluorescent peak controls for the donor and the recipient before stem-cell transplantation were obtained from whole peripheral-blood cells. At the onset of ATL after stem-cell transplantation, enriched CD3-positive cells, which were obtained with a purity of more than 95 percent, showed typical morphologic features of ATL cells on blood smears, and most of them expressed both CD4 and CD25, as assessed by flow cytometry.

The conditioning regimen included intravenous cyclophosphamide (120 mg per kilogram of body weight) and total-body irradiation (12 Gy). Cyclosporine and a short course of methotrexate were given as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). On day 26, low-dose prednisone was instituted because of GVHD-associated fever. With stable hematopoietic engraftment, complete donor chimerism was confirmed in a T-cell fraction on day 20 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.

In September 2004, hematologic and blood chemical values of the donor were almost normal, although the white-cell count included 1 percent atypical lymphocytes.

Estimating the chance that blood will be donated during this period is an effective way to define the risk of HIV infection from transfusion. Using this approach, and employing data from over 17 million American Red Cross blood donations, we estimate that during 1987 the most likely number of units of blood infected with undetected HIV that were transfused was 131 (range, 67 to 227). For a patient, the odds of contracting HIV infection were 1:153,000 per unit transfused. A patient who received the average transfusion (5.4 units) had odds of 1:28,000. The risk has been decreasing by more than 30 percent a year. We estimate that donor-recruitment practices plus careful education and screening are eliminating 49 of every 50 donors likely to be HIV-positive and that testing is 92 to 97 percent effective, for a combined effectiveness of 99.9 percent. The risk of undetected infectious units can probably be further reduced by transfusing fewer units and units from fewer donors, recruiting more women and fewer men as new donors, and encouraging more frequent donations from donors who have been tested repeatedly. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1989; 321: 941–6.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

The MSA achieved important public health objectives, including substantially reduced smoking rates and lives saved. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Given its success, the agreement has enormous promise as a model for similar litigation or settlements that could hold industries accountable when they knowingly deceive and injure consumers with their products.\n\n【5】Several of the most serious public health problems in the United States could be targets for AGs, including the opioid epidemic, firearm violence, excessive consumption of fast food and sugar-sweetened beverages, alcohol use, and climate change. Collectively, obesity, the misuse of alcohol and opioids, and firearm violence cause approximately 374,000 deaths each year in the United States. Data on U.S. deaths related to climate change are not systematically collected.\n\n【6】State AGs are responsible for protecting the public and can intervene individually or collectively by means of lawsuits or negotiation when public health is threatened. AG-led efforts are particularly important when other officials and government entities at the local, state, and federal levels are disinclined to pursue action or when laws and regulations that protect health are rescinded. AGs may be viewed as the “actors of last resort” when an industry with substantial legislative influence is harming the public. The tobacco settlement is a key example of one such effort; the MSA was successfully negotiated after federal legislative efforts collapsed. AGs can use and have used a range of state laws to protect health — most important, consumer-protection laws, but also public-nuisance, antitrust, and conspiracy laws, tort liability, state statutes equivalent to the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, and financial and securities-fraud statutes.\n\n【7】AGs are motivated to pursue action against an industry by a complex mix of factors. First and foremost, the chance of winning a given case, based on the proof of harm and unlawful behavior, is crucial. Second, public opinion about the industry and its behavior and the perceived trade-offs involved in pursuing an action must be considered. AGs must determine, for example, whether they can be successfully targeted by the industry in an upcoming election (a common strategy used by the National Rifle Association and the tobacco industry). Third, AGs — and U.S. politicians in general — are often reluctant to appear to dictate how Americans should lead their lives. For this reason, it is politically easier to pursue cases in which children are the targets of false and predatory advertising than those in which adults are harmed because of their own behavior. Companies often target young people to establish brand loyalty and ensure future profits. This tactic was common among tobacco brands and is also used by alcohol, firearm, sugar-sweetened–beverage, fast-food, opioid, and oil companies. Finally, AGs need the resources to pursue such actions, and few have sufficient funding to assume the lead role on these cases.\n\n【8】Currently, 41 AGs are suing or are poised to sue companies that manufacture, distribute, and sell opioids, relying mostly on public-nuisance claims. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> More than 400 complaints have been filed in multiple jurisdictions, and confidential settlement talks are under way in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The AGs claim that the companies violated state and federal laws by making false claims about opioids’ addictiveness and safe dosing levels, diverting drugs and failing to monitor or report excessive deliveries to individual distributors and retailers, and allowing fraudulent prescriptions to be filled. The consumer-fraud, public-nuisance, and other charges include those against manufacturers for their collective efforts to mislead the public and health care providers into believing that opioids were generally not addictive and were formulated to be addiction-proof; that there was no ceiling on dosing levels; and that signs of addiction were probably “pseudoaddiction,” a fictitious condition invented by the vice president of Purdue Pharma’s policy office. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【9】The New York, Massachusetts, and U.S. Virgin Islands AGs have also filed actions against ExxonMobil on the grounds that it knew for decades that carbon release was causing global warming but denied its own and other research findings in virtually all public communications. The company is charged with violating New York’s Martin Act by engaging in deceptive financial disclosures, as well as violating Massachusetts public-nuisance laws. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> There is, however, no pending mass litigation by AGs against other industries that contribute to major public health problems.\n\n【10】AGs are responsible for upholding state laws, and all states have laws protecting the public from corporate fraud and associated physical harm. Some consumer products, such as tobacco products and firearms, have a high probability of causing harm when used as directed — one reason that both industries have sought to escape meaningful regulation. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), for example, shields firearm manufacturers, distributors, and retailers from litigation in all but the most egregious cases of product flaws and negligence in the supply chain. Efforts to hold the industry accountable for shootings by using exceptions in the law have thus far been largely unsuccessful. Indemnifications in the PLCAA and additional legislation in 34 states give the firearm industry little motivation to negotiate with AGs to modify its practices and give AGs few avenues to pursue legal action. Still, a future Congress could rescind the PLCAA, which was passed by a firearms-friendly Congress that had just allowed a federal assault-weapons ban to expire.\n\n【11】Like tobacco, alcohol is an addictive drug, and most adults who abuse alcohol started drinking during adolescence. Eleven percent of all alcohol consumed in the United States is accounted for by people 12 to 20 years of age, and 5000 adolescent deaths occur each year because of alcohol consumption. AGs have been involved in various alcohol-related consumer issues, including successful efforts to end the production of alcoholic energy drinks. In 2008, some 13 AGs entered into an agreement with MillerCoors to discontinue the sale of Sparks, the best-selling energy drink containing alcohol. AGs have also worked to reduce adolescents’ access to alcohol, but no collective litigation or comprehensive settlement talks have been undertaken, despite the well-documented pattern of youth-focused advertising by the alcohol industry and the substantial role that drinking plays in morbidity and mortality among young people.\n\n【12】Similarly, adolescents consume large quantitates of fast food and sugar-sweetened beverages, and restaurant chains and beverage companies frequently market to young people. Studies have demonstrated that exposure to such advertising increases consumption, especially among low-income minorities. These products sow the seeds of obesity and diabetes and are associated with excess morbidity and mortality throughout the life course. An analysis of documents from the Sugar Research Foundation demonstrated that the sugar industry successfully sought to deflect the concerns of health-conscious consumers from sugar to fat. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Many countries have curtailed advertising aimed at young people by the food industry. Tax policies are increasingly being used to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in U.S. jurisdictions and elsewhere, but the American Beverage Association has vigorously opposed these efforts, including by supporting state preemption. A San Francisco policy that is currently being adjudicated would support the potential use of warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\n【13】 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement Provisions, Potential Provisions for Other Industries, and Evidence Supporting Action.\n\n【14】The table presents potential provisions that could result from litigation or voluntary settlements with these industries and provisions contained in the MSA. Combined with tobacco use, these epidemics (excluding climate change, for which U.S. data are unavailable) cause nearly one third of all U.S. deaths. The trajectory of these major public health problems could be altered by reducing industry manipulation of science and lobbying for policies against the public interest; compensating public coffers for money spent combating these epidemics and redirecting funds to prevention; and using public education, product warnings, and price increases to reduce use of harmful products. By using these strategies, state AGs could strengthen their consumer-protection roles as guardians of the health of the public.\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>From the New York University College of Global Public Health, New York.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 82KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

More people are using highly potent pot edibles and other items much more often, and the perception of harm for these products is plummeting. The gold standard in tobacco control has been de-normalization strategy and it has been virtually ignored by public health and government agencies for the past 20 years - as harm reductionist ideology has taken the place of preventionists.

Breath-holding followed single inspirations of 100, 50, 21 and 12 per cent oxygen and after breathing of 12 per cent oxygen for one minute. In the normal subjects, breath-holding time and alveolar carbon dioxide tension at the breaking point progressively decreased as alveolar oxygen tension decreased. In contrast, there was no change in alveolar carbon dioxide tension or breath-holding time until alveolar oxygen tension was reduced below 50 mm Hg in this patient group. Breath-holding time was twice that for the normal subjects at 50 mm Hg. These studies indicate that the carotid bodies are active chemoreceptors for oxygen through levels greater than 200 mm Hg, that interaction of carbon dioxide and oxygen on respiratory control occurs at the level of the carotid bodies in man, and that the carotid bodies contribute to the sensation of breathlessness that results in the break from breath-holding. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 290:819–822, 1974)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

There are limited data on the activity of ivermectin as a topical lousicide.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In two multisite, randomized, double-blind studies, we compared a single application of 0.5% ivermectin lotion with vehicle control for the elimination of infestations without nit combing in patients 6 months of age or older. A tube of topical ivermectin or vehicle control was dispensed on day 1, to be applied to dry hair, left for 10 minutes, then rinsed with water. The primary end point was the percentage of index patients (youngest household member with ≥3 live lice) in the intention-to-treat population who were louse-free 1 day after treatment (day 2) and remained so through days 8 and 15.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 765 patients completed the studies. In the intention-to-treat population, significantly more patients receiving ivermectin than patients receiving vehicle control were louse-free on day 2 (94.9% vs. 31.3%), day 8 (85.2% vs. 20.8%), and day 15 (73.8% vs. 17.6%) (P<0.001 for each comparison). The frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in the two groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】A single, 10-minute, at-home application of ivermectin was more effective than vehicle control in eliminating head-louse infestations at 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment.

Two reports suggested that a single topical application might have potential for treating infestations, but final assessments were inadequate to determine the degree of efficacy or the possibility of reinfestations from the hatching of louse eggs present at the time of application. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> We report on two parallel trials investigating the efficacy and safety of a single application of a new 0.5% ivermectin lotion formulation (Sklice, Sanofi Pasteur) as compared with vehicle control, an identical formulation without ivermectin, in patients with head-louse infestation.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Study Design\n------------\n\n【16】The two studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, two-group parallel trials. The studies were funded by Topaz Pharmaceuticals (now Sanofi Pasteur). The protocols, which were identical for the two studies, were designed by means of an iterative process among the authors, with guidance from the FDA. The final protocols , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, were reviewed by an investigational review board, and the studies were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and current International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The data were gathered by a contract research organization and analyzed by the third author. All the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and all vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analysis and for the fidelity of the studies to the protocols. Sanofi Pasteur provided funding for editorial support of the manuscript. All authors had full access to the data and provided substantial input to the manuscript, which was written primarily by the last author. Word Consulting Group provided copy editing support, assistance with charts, and verification of accuracy. No confidentiality arrangements limit the first and second authors from disclosing study data; the third and fourth authors were retained by the sponsor under consulting confidentiality agreements.\n\n【17】Written informed consent or assent for each patient was obtained after the nature of the study had been fully explained and before the performance of any study-related activity. Children of a specified age were administered an assent form that met Department of Health and Human Services regulations. The studies were conducted from March through July 2010 at eight separate sites per study: study A sites were in Arizona, California, Florida (two sites), Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia, and study B sites were in Arkansas (two sites), Florida (two sites), New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.\n\n【18】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【19】Eligible patients were healthy persons 6 months of age or older with head-louse infestation who agreed not to use any other louse treatment, comb out nits, or cut or chemically treat hair during the study. A list of all inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. All household members were asked to undergo head-louse assessment at the enrollment visit. To ensure that enrollment was based on established infestations, the criterion for active infestation was the finding of three or more live lice on the scalp or hair. This criterion has been used in recent clinical pediculicide investigations 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5,10,16 </a></sup></u> and is considered to be more reliable than the diagnostic standard of a single live head louse, which could represent a transient or waning infestation. The household index patient was the youngest member meeting our criterion for infestation. Once the index patient was identified, additional household members with one or more live lice on the scalp or hair were also enrolled in the study and were given the same study drug as the index patient. No household member was included unless he or she was found to be infested with at least one live louse.\n\n【20】Assessments and Study Drugs\n---------------------------\n\n【21】On day 1, index patients were randomly assigned to a study drug. Each enrolled patient received a single 4-oz tube containing either ivermectin or vehicle control, the same for all enrolled members in any household, to be applied at home on day 1 by the patient or a caregiver. Patients received written instructions to thoroughly coat dry hair and scalp with the lotion and leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing the hair with water. Written instructions regarding environmental hygiene measures to reduce the risk of reinfestation were also supplied. The final visit was to occur on day 15 (14 days after use of the study drug) or up to 2 days later. If any live lice were present at this visit, the study treatment was considered to have failed and the patient received rescue treatment with either a commercially available formulation of 1% permethrin or professional lice and nit combing undertaken at the study site. (For full details, see the study protocols.)\n\n【22】Adverse events were assessed at each site by the attending physician, who graded the severity of each event as mild, moderate, severe, or serious (life-threatening or requiring hospitalization) and gauged the likelihood that it was related to the study drug. Assessments of skin or scalp irritation, including pruritus, erythema, excoriation, and pyoderma, were made on days 1 (baseline), 2, 8, and 15; if present, irritation was scored as 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). The presence or absence of ocular irritation was assessed on days 1 and 2. A trained evaluator at each study site assessed efficacy (presence or absence of live lice) and safety on days 2, 8, and 15. Louse examination was conducted for 15 minutes or longer, unless any live lice were detected in less time. Whenever possible, the same evaluator performed each patient's examination at each visit. All evaluators were trained before the study in the technique for lice assessment (which included combing and detecting head lice in infested patients).\n\n【23】End Points\n----------\n\n【24】The primary efficacy end point was the number of index patients who were louse-free by day 2 and remained louse-free through days 8 and 15. The primary analysis examined the percentage of index patients (intention-to-treat population) who met this end point. The secondary efficacy analysis was the same assessment applied to the index patients plus all enrolled household members (extended intention-to-treat population). Safety was assessed on the basis of reported adverse events and evaluations for skin, scalp, and ocular irritation in all patients.\n\n【25】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【26】The target sample in each study (132 index patients, with 66 in each study group) was planned to provide more than 90% power (at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05) to detect a difference of 45 percentage points between ivermectin and vehicle control in the proportion of patients with louse-free status on days 2, 8, and 15. This sample was also sufficient to achieve a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of more than 30 percentage points, with an anticipated treatment effect of 45 percentage points.\n\n【27】For the primary end-point comparison, the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test with adjustment for study site was used, with use of the last-observation-carried-forward method of imputation for missing data; treatment-failure imputation for missing data was used as a sensitivity analysis. The chi-square test was also applied to the primary and secondary end points, and 95% confidence intervals for the difference between the success rates in the study groups were calculated.\n\n【28】Logistic-regression modeling was used to assess possible study-site effects and interactions between study drug and study site. The model used success versus failure as the dependent variable; fixed terms for treatment, study site, and treatment-by-study-site interaction were the independent variables. The model was reduced in a stepwise manner until only statistically significant (P≤0.05) terms or treatment remained.\n\n【29】Safety results, including adverse events and data on skin, scalp, and ocular irritation, were described for all patients and summarized according to study group. Individual changes from day 1 to each subsequent visit were calculated. Descriptive statistics (i.e., number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum values) were presented according to study-drug group. Differences between groups were assessed by means of an analysis of variance with study treatment as a factor.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Enrollment and Follow-up\n------------------------\n\n【32】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients in the Intention-to-Treat Population, Study A and Study B Combined.\n\n【33】Enrollments for the intention-to-treat populations were 145 patients in study A (extended intention-to-treat population, 410 patients) and 144 in study B (extended intention-to-treat population, 371 patients). Of the 781 patients in the extended intention-to-treat population, 780 were included in the safety population — 1 patient assigned to ivermectin was excluded from the safety population owing to a protocol violation (she did not use the study drug). Another 15 patients did not complete all scheduled visits: 7 in the ivermectin group (4 from one household) were lost to follow-up; 6 (1 in the ivermectin group and 5 in the vehicle-control group) withdrew consent; and 2 — a child and caregiver, both in the vehicle-control group — did not return for the day 2 visit because the child was vomiting (reported as an adverse event). Of the patients in the intention-to-treat population who were lost to follow-up, 3 patients in the ivermectin group and 1 in the vehicle-control group did not return after their initial visit; in all 4 patients, the study treatment was considered to have failed. In both studies, the demographic characteristics of the extended intention-to-treat population were similar to those of the intention-to-treat population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>, and there were no significant baseline differences between groups. In the intention-to-treat populations, viable nits were observed at baseline in all patients in study A and in more than 97% of patients in study B.\n\n【34】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Percentage of Head Louse–free Patients in the Intention-to-Treat Population in Study A and Study B.\n\n【36】Study drugs were applied on day 1. In study A (Panel A), the between-group difference in the proportion of patients who were louse-free on day 15 was 59.8 percentage points (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 45.5 to 74.2). In study B (Panel B), the between-group difference on day 15 was 52.5 percentage points (95% CI, 37.3 to 67.7). P<0.001 for the between-group difference at each time point in each study.Figure 2.  Figure 2. Percentage of Head Louse–free Patients in the Extended Intention-to-Treat Population, Study A and Study B Combined.\n\n【37】The extended intention-to-treat population comprised the intention-to-treat population plus all enrolled household members. Study drugs were applied on day 1. The between-group difference on day 15 was 56.2 percentage points (95% CI, 50.1 to 62.2). P<0.001 for the between-group difference at all three time points.\n\n【38】In the intention-to-treat population in each study and in the two studies combined, significantly more patients in the ivermectin group than in the vehicle-control group were free of live lice at the first post-application observation on day 2 (1 day after use of the study drug) and at the subsequent observations through day 15 (P<0.001 for each comparison) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. There were no significant treatment-by-study-site interactions. The combined intention-to-treat analysis showed that significantly more patients in the ivermectin group than in the vehicle-control group were louse-free on day 2 (131 of 138 \\[94.9%\\] vs. 46 of 147 \\[31.3%\\]) and day 8 (115 of 135 \\[85.2%\\] vs. 30 of 144 \\[20.8%\\]) and remained louse-free through day 15 (104 of 141 \\[73.8%\\] vs. 26 of 148 \\[17.6%\\]) (P<0.001 for each day). In both studies, the results were consistent when treatment-failure imputation was used for missing data and when data in the extended intention-to-treat populations were analyzed 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u> (P<0.001 for all comparisons), with no treatment-by-study-site interactions.\n\n【39】Safety\n------\n\n【40】Table 2.  Table 2. Adverse Events with an Incidence of More Than 1% in Either Group (Safety Population of Combined Studies).\n\n【41】Pruritus, excoriation, and erythema were the most common adverse events, occurring at a rate of more than 1% in the vehicle-control group and less than 1% in the ivermectin group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There was one severe adverse event (pain in an extremity with vehicle control) and no serious adverse events. All other adverse events were mild to moderate. The frequency and severity of adverse events were similar in the two study groups and across age groups (a full listing of adverse events is available in the Supplementary Appendix ). No events were considered to be definitely related to the study drug. Two were considered to be probably related to the study drug (eye irritation and skin-burning sensation). Ocular irritation was noted in 7 patients (2 of 379 patients in the ivermectin group \\[0.5%\\] and 5 of 401 in the vehicle-control group \\[1.2%\\]) on day 2; 4 of the 7 patients also had ocular irritation at baseline. All adverse events in patients 6 months to 4 years of age were considered to be unrelated to the study drug, with no age-related trends.\n\n【42】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Mean Change in Pruritus Score from Baseline to Day 2 in the Extended Intention-to-Treat Population, Study A and Study B Combined.\n\n【43】A score of 0 indicates no pruritus, 1 mild pruritus, 2 moderate pruritus, and 3 severe pruritus. The mean (±SD) score at baseline was 1.30±0.92 in the ivermectin group and 1.22±0.88 in the vehicle-control group. P values were derived by means of analysis of variance with study treatment as a factor, with values ranked before analysis of variance.\n\n【44】Pruritus was a baseline finding in 533 of 781 patients (68.2%) in the extended intention-to-treat population. In both studies combined, the ivermectin group had a significantly greater mean reduction in the pruritus score from baseline to day 2 (P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. In the combined intention-to-treat populations, on day 1, 77.3% of the patients in the ivermectin group and 76.4% of those in the vehicle-control group had pruritus. On day 2, pruritus was reduced in both groups, with significantly more patients in the ivermectin group than in the vehicle-control group free of pruritus (66.7% and 42.6%, respectively; P<0.001). The ratings of skin or scalp irritation in both studies were similar across age groups, with no age-related trends observed.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】The most frequent sign of pediculosis is pruritus; other common manifestations include excoriations, cervical adenopathy, and conjunctivitis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> Beyond physical manifestations, there are negative social effects and potential economic effects on households. We found that 94.9% of ivermectin-treated patients were louse-free 1 day after application, a finding that parallels the report of 92.4% efficacy 1 day after administration of oral ivermectin (at a dose of 400 μg per kilogram). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> In that study, 82.4% of malathion-treated patients were free of lice the day after application.\n\n【47】Pruritus in pediculosis is attributed to sensitization to louse saliva injected at the time of feeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> In our study, the significant reduction in pruritus between day 1 and day 2 in the ivermectin group, as compared with the vehicle-control group, may have been due to the antipruritic effect of louse eradication. However, the rapid response in both groups with regard to the severity of pruritus and the number of patients having an absence of pruritus was unexpected, particularly in patients receiving the vehicle control. This finding may reflect an emollient effect of the formulation, which warrants further investigation.\n\n【48】The proportion of head louse–free patients in the ivermectin group was 85.2% on day 8 and 73.8% on day 15. These outcomes are similar to those achieved 2 weeks after the second of two applications of benzyl alcohol lotion or after one or two applications of spinosad suspension. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> The increasing proportion of louse-infested patients with increasing time from the point of application is consistent with other assessments of pediculicide activity and may be attributed to a number of factors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> These include improper product application; inadequate exposure of ivermectin to louse eggs, which subsequently hatch and produce viable nymphs; and reinfestations as patients continue to be exposed to head lice within or outside their households.\n\n【49】The continued efficacy of treatment with topical ivermectin through the final assessment 2 weeks after a single treatment suggests that this formulation has activity against louse eggs, although systemic ivermectin appears to have no such activity. The activity of topical treatment is probably due to the direct exposure of eggs to ivermectin that occurs with topical application. A recent report described laboratory studies in which ivermectin was applied to head louse ova; although the ova subsequently hatched, all the released nymphs quickly died. The nymphal mortality was attributed to ivermectin-induced mouthpart paralysis, which severely limited or completely prevented feeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【50】Ivermectin primarily targets glutamate-gated chloride ion channels, whereas the easily available permethrin and pyrethrins act by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels. Widespread resistance to permethrin has been reported, and even with adjunctive nit combing, it has failed to achieve an efficacy of 50%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,16 </a></sup></u> In contrast, ivermectin has been shown under laboratory conditions to be active against permethrin-resistant head lice. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The results of the two studies reported here indicate that ivermectin is a treatment option when permethrin or pyrethrins have failed or when there is a desire to reduce the need for nit combing and increase the probability of success with a single application.\n\n【51】In our two studies, the minimum age of the patients was 0.8 years and 1.0 years, and the minimum weight was 8 kg and 10 kg, respectively. We identified no safety or adverse event concerns, and there were no age-related trends in ratings of skin or scalp irritation, findings that are consistent with the results of an earlier study in which ivermectin was applied to 30 children with head-louse infestation who were 6 months to 3 years of age. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】In conclusion, ivermectin has a well-established safety profile, on the basis of extensive oral use, and a novel mode of action. Topical ivermectin showed high efficacy within 24 hours, with most treated patients remaining louse-free through the final assessment 2 weeks after a single treatment, without the need for nit combing.\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Topaz Pharmaceuticals, which provided the study medications.</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Ms. Bell reports receiving consulting fees from Topaz Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi Pasteur.

My father's Thesis to obtain his Medical Degree was \"Typhoid fever and exanthematic tifus\". He also, in1947, prepared.in Colombia Typhoid Fever vaccine. He was upset with his daughter fever. He performed febrile antígens test and his surprise was that the fever's cause was exanthematic tifus cought in París. Really Ivermectin is a very good solution not only for lice but for scabies that is also a very important public health problem.

We prospectively studied 173 patients — 111 in atrial fibrillation and 62 in atrial flutter. The anterolateral paddles used were either two standard-size (8.5-cm diameter) paddles or one 13-cm diameter anterior paddle with one standard-size lateral paddle. The anteroposterior paddles used were either a standard-size or a 13-cm anterior paddle with a 12-cm posterior paddle. Overall cardioversion success rates with either paddle position were similar (>90 per cent). The larger paddles did not significantly reduce energy requirements for cardioversion of either arrhythmia. We conclude that anterolateral paddles are as effective as anteroposterior paddles for the elective cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias, and that there is no demonstrable advantage to using paddles that are larger than the standard size in either position. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med. 1981; 305:658–62.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Different TR isoforms are generated by the genes thyroid hormone receptor alpha ( _THRA_ ) and thyroid hormone receptor beta ( _THRB_ ). Mutations in _THRB_ cause resistance to the action of thyroid hormone. This resistance is characterized by elevated serum levels of thyroid hormone, the absence of suppression of thyrotropin, and a variable phenotype. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Here we report on two Greek patients (the index patient and her father) who have a _THRA_ mutation.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Clinical Phenotype of the Index Patient and Molecular Analysis of _THRA_ .\n\n【4】Panel A shows the changes in serum levels of free thyroxine (T <sub>4 </sub> ), _triiodothyronine_ (T <sub>3 </sub> ), and thyrotropin in the index patient from birth through 11 years of age (shaded areas in the vertical axis indicate reference ranges). Also shown are the doses of levothyroxine and growth hormone (GH) the patient received since the age of 6 years and 8 years, respectively. Panel B shows changes in height and in growth velocity (insert). The growth curve of the index patient (dots) is compared with the normal range in the Greek population. In Panel C, sequence profiles for part of exon 9 in _THRA_ show the insertion of thymine (T) at codon 397 in the index patient and her father but not her mother. The mutation results in a frameshift, with an early stop at codon 406 (F397fs406X) instead of the natural stop at codon 411. In Panel D, functional tests of wild-type (WT) _TRα1_ and the F397fs406X mutant show that the latter does not respond to activation by T <sub>3 </sub> . When cotransfected at equal amounts, the mutant exerts a strong dominant-negative effect over the wild type. The expression of firefly luciferase (Luc) is under the control of a nuclear-receptor (TR)–dependent promoter, and the expression of renilla luciferase (Ren) is under the control of a TR-independent promoter. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity to adjust for transfection efficiency (for further details, see the Supplementary Appendix ). To convert the values for free T <sub>4 </sub> to nanograms per deciliter, divide by 12.87. To convert the values for T <sub>3 </sub> to nanograms per deciliter, divide by 0.0154. T bars indicate standard deviations.\n\n【5】In the first 3 years of life, the index patient had macroglossia, omphalocele, congenital hip dislocation, no hip ossification centers, delayed closure of skull sutures, delayed tooth eruption, delayed motor development, and macrocephaly (with head size 1.65 SD above normal). Serum levels of free thyroxine (T <sub>4 </sub> ) were low, levels of T <sub>3 </sub> were high, and levels of thyrotropin were normal 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>. At 6 years of age, she was evaluated for short stature, and bone age was clearly delayed 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B , and Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org)</u>. In addition to the finding of abnormal levels of thyroid hormone, laboratory testing revealed serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the lower end of the normal range and high levels of cholesterol. The patient had clinically determined hypothyroidism, with dry skin, slow tendon reflexes, slow reactions, and drowsiness. Treatment with levothyroxine resulted in initial catch-up growth and decreases in serum levels of thyrotropin and cholesterol. At 8.5 years of age, her height remained 2 SD below normal. Therapy with growth hormone was started and had little effect on growth 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. At her most recent examination, performed when the patient was 11 years of age, her bone age was 9 years and her height 1.81 SD below normal. She has mild cognitive deficits (IQ, 90).\n\n【6】The clinical characteristics of her father are very similar — including short stature (3.77 SD below normal), levels of free T <sub>4 </sub> in the lower end of the normal range, high levels of T <sub>3 </sub> , and normal levels of thyrotropin — as are his responses to treatment with levothyroxine (75 μg per day) and his high cholesterol levels, levels of IGF-1 in the lower end of the normal range, suppressed growth hormone stimulation, and mild cognitive deficits (IQ, 85). Both father and daughter have constipation, having stools every 2 to 4 days when not receiving levothyroxine and every day when receiving it.\n\n【7】Given the symptoms of hypothyroidism and delayed bone development — despite high levels of T <sub>3 </sub> — we hypothesized that there was a defect in the functioning of TRα1. Genomic sequencing revealed that father and daughter were heterozygous for the insertion of thymine at codon 397 in _THRA,_ which resulted in a frameshift and an early stop at codon 406 (F397fs406X) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>. This mutation was detected neither in more than 300 white controls nor in public databases. Mutations in _MCT8, MCT10,_ _DIO1, DIO2, DIO3,_ and _THRB_ in the patient and her father were excluded by sequence analysis.\n\n【8】The analysis of cells cotransfected with a TR-dependent promoter–reporter construct showed marked T <sub>3 </sub> stimulation of wild-type TRα1, but no effect on the mutant receptor could be detected 删除2:<u>( Figure 1D )</u>. Furthermore, the mutant had a strong dominant negative effect on wild-type TRα1.\n\n【9】The delayed bone development in the index patient and her father is very similar to that recently reported by Bochukova et al. in another patient with a similar TRα1 mutant, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> which suggests that TRα1 plays a major role in bone development. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> In addition, mice with a similar TRα1 mutant showed reduced endochondral and intramembranous ossification, severe postnatal growth retardation, and delayed closure of skull sutures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> The transient delay in motor development and the mild cognitive deficits in our patients are consistent with the important role of TRα1 in brain development. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【10】In conclusion, our findings and those of Bochukova et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> indicate that mutant TRα1 is associated with abnormal levels of thyroid hormone but normal levels of thyrotropin as well as growth retardation, and mildly delayed motor and cognitive development 删除2:<u>(Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Alies van Mullem, M.D.  \nRamona van Heerebeek, M.Sc.  \nErasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>Dionisios Chrysis, M.D., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Patras, Patras, Greece</u>\n\n【13】参考删除-2:<u>Edward Visser, M.D., Ph.D.  \nMarco Medici, M.D.  \nErasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands</u>\n\n【14】参考删除-2:<u>Maria Andrikoula, M.D.  \nAgathocles Tsatsoulis, M.D., Ph.D.  \nUniversity of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-2:<u>Robin Peeters, M.D., Ph.D.  \nTheo J.

The anticoagulant effect of these drugs is monitored by means of regular measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> A subtherapeutic INR is associated with an increased risk of stroke or thromboembolism, whereas a supratherapeutic INR is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Several factors influence the stability of the INR and the required coumarin dose. These factors include age, height, weight, sex, concomitant medication use, and diet, but genetic factors also play an important role. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Polymorphisms in two genes — _VKORC1_ (encoding the target enzyme of the drug, vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1) and _CYP2C9_ (encoding the main metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P-450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9) — together explain approximately one third of the variation in the dose requirement. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> Therefore, dosing algorithms that use this genetic information may improve the prediction of the required coumarin dose and thereby increase the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.\n\n【13】The use of an algorithm that does not include genetic information but does include factors such as age, height, and weight may also improve the prediction of the required dose. Therefore, it is important to compare a dosing algorithm that includes genetic information with a dosing algorithm that does not include genetic information. This approach has been investigated in small or nonrandomized clinical trials with warfarin, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> but it has not been studied with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon. As part of the European Pharmacogenetics of Anticoagulant Therapy (EU-PACT) consortium, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of an algorithm including _VKORC1_ and _CYP2C9_ genotypes and clinical factors, as compared with an algorithm including only clinical factors, for the initiation of dosing with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Study Design\n------------\n\n【16】The acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon components of the EU-PACT study were originally designed as two separate multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled trials. The acenocoumarol trial was conducted in the Netherlands and in Greece, and the phenprocoumon trial was conducted in the Netherlands. The two trials (one with acenocoumarol and the other with phenprocoumon) compared the effect of a genotype-guided dosing algorithm with the effect of a dosing algorithm based solely on clinical factors (control). The design of the two trials is described in detail elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Because of low power resulting from low enrollment, the trials were combined for analysis.\n\n【17】The trials were designed by the members of the EU-PACT study group. Data were gathered by all the investigators and coinvestigators (for a full list, see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) and were analyzed by the first author and a statistician who is an author, who vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported. All the authors vouch for the adherence of the study to the protocols , which are available at NEJM.org. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author in close collaboration with the last author, with input from the other authors. The first two authors and the last two authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\n【18】The Leiden Medical Ethics Committee approved the study protocols in the Netherlands, and the Scientific Council and Ethics Committee of the Academic General Hospital of Alexandroupolis and the institutional review board of the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center approved the study protocol in Greece. An independent data and safety monitoring board periodically reviewed the efficacy and safety data. All medications were purchased. The trials were funded by the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme. LGC (formerly Laboratory of the Government Chemist) provided the point-of-care genotyping assay with funding from the European Union. The funder and LGC had no role in the collection and interpretation of the data or in the writing of the manuscript or the decision to submit it for publication.\n\n【19】Patients\n--------\n\n【20】Patients who had received a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism and for whom at least 12 weeks of acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon treatment was planned were asked to participate in the trials. The trials enrolled only patients who had not received coumarin therapy previously. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【21】Randomization and Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【22】Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the genotype-guided group or the control group. Block randomization was performed according to a computer-generated randomization list, with the use of a block size of 10, and was stratified according to study center and indication (atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism). Patients were unaware of the treatment assignment.\n\n【23】During the first 5 to 7 days of treatment (typically 6 days with 1 day of scheduling leeway), patients in the genotype-guided group were treated according to a dosing algorithm that included genotype information, and those in the control group were treated according to a dosing algorithm that included only clinical information. After the first 5 to 7 days, patients were treated on the basis of the INR and in accordance with local clinical practice. Details about the genotyping and the specific dosing algorithms are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Coumarin therapy was initiated on an outpatient basis in the Netherlands and on an inpatient basis in Greece.\n\n【24】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【25】The intended follow-up period for all patients was 12 weeks. Anticoagulation status was monitored by means of INR measurement, before the daily dose of the coumarin anticoagulant was administered, on days 1, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 57, and 85. The measurements planned on days 4 through 85 could be adjusted slightly to coincide with weekdays. Additional INR measurements were carried out if clinically relevant. On the day of INR measurement, the patients were also asked whether they had had any possible adverse events.\n\n【26】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【27】The primary outcome in both trials was the percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range (2.0 to 3.0) during the 12 weeks after the initiation of coumarin therapy. In the Netherlands, the usual therapeutic INR range is 2.0 to 3.5, but patients included in the trial were all treated with a target range of 2.0 to 3.0. The percentage of time in the therapeutic range was calculated with the useof linear interpolation according to the method of Rosendaal et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【28】Secondary outcomes included the number of patients with an INR of 4.0 or more, the percentage of time with an INR of 4.0 or more or with an INR of less than 2.0, the time it took to reach a therapeutic INR, the time it took to achieve a stable dose, and the percentage of patients with a stable dose within 12 weeks. Additional secondary outcomes were the number of minor and major bleeding events, the number of thromboembolic events, and the incidences of coumarin sensitivity and resistance. We also analyzed the percentage of time in the therapeutic range during the first 4 weeks, during weeks 5 through 8, and during weeks 9 through 12 separately. Definitions of the outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】We originally calculated that for each study to have 80% power to show a 5% improvement in the time in the therapeutic range with the genotype-guided dosing algorithm over the standard clinical algorithm, with a standard deviation of 26.5% and at a 5% significance level, we would need to enroll 442 patients in each group. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate after study entry, we planned to include 986 patients in each study.\n\n【31】We performed a revised power calculation after new data became available from a trial conducted by Anderson et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> We increased the estimate of the expected improvement in the time in the therapeutic range (on the basis of data from Anderson et al.) and used a new estimate of the expected standard deviation (derived from data collected in the EU-PACT trial up to the date of the revised power calculation). To detect a 7% improvement in the time in the therapeutic range, with a standard deviation of 23%, a two-sided significance level of 5%, and 80% power, we estimated that a sample of 200 patients in each group was necessary, assuming a withdrawal rate of 10%. As a consequence of low enrollment, the overall study coordinator and the national coordinators in Greece and the Netherlands ultimately decided, before data unblinding, to conclude the two trials before the revised enrollment goal was reached and to combine the trials for analysis.\n\n【32】Only patients with at least 10 weeks of follow-up were included in the analyses, with the exception of the time-to-event analyses and the separate analyses for the first 4 weeks and for weeks 5 through 8. To increase the power and reduce the risk of bias, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome that included data from patients with a follow-up of at least 2 weeks instead of 10 weeks. Per-protocol analyses were also performed.\n\n【33】Separate analyses were performed for acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon and for Greece and the Netherlands, followed by a pooled analysis of the acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon data. The primary outcome was calculated separately for both dosing-algorithm groups in the study, 95% confidence intervals were constructed for the difference in the mean time in the therapeutic INR range, and a two-sample t-test was carried out to determine whether the difference was significant. For the secondary outcomes, chi-square tests and time-to-event log-rank tests were used. A nominal two-sided P value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】Patients\n--------\n\n【36】A total of 1560 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 548 were enrolled in the two trials (381 patients treated with acenocoumarol and 167 treated with phenprocoumon). Of these, 273 patients were assigned to the genotype-guided group and 275 to the control group. Patient enrollment and treatment assignments are shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【37】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【38】The modified intention-to-treat population included 484 patients, which excluded 64 patients who did not have at least 10 weeks of the intended 12 weeks of follow-up. An additional 140 patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis for the reasons outlined in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix . The baseline characteristics of the patients in the two dosing-algorithm groups were similar 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【39】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【40】Table 2. Table 2. Percentage of Time in the Therapeutic Range for the International Normalized Ratio (INR) during 12 Weeks after the Initiation of Treatment. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Mean International Normalized Ratio (INR) and Time in the Therapeutic Range.\n\n【41】Panel A shows the difference in the mean INR between the genotype-guided group and the control group, and Panel B the percentage of time within the therapeutic INR range during the 12-week follow-up period. Data were included for all patients with at least 2 weeks of follow-up.\n\n【42】Among patients treated with acenocoumarol, the percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range during the 12-week study period was 62.3% in the genotype-guided group and 61.4% in the control group (difference \\[genotype-guided group minus control group\\], 0.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −4.3 to 6.1; P=0.74); among patients treated with phenprocoumon, the corresponding percentages of time were 60.1% and 57.6% (difference, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.5 to 9.4; P=0.49) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. When all the data were pooled, the time in the therapeutic range was 61.6% in the genotype-guided group and 60.2% in the control group (difference, 1.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.8 to 5.5; P=0.52). The sensitivity analysis that included data from all patients with a follow-up of at least 2 weeks yielded similar results 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The mean INR over time is shown for the two dosing-algorithm groups in Figure 1A , and the time in the therapeutic range is shown for these groups in Figure 1B .\n\n【43】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【44】Table 3.

Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Time to Reach a Therapeutic INR and the Time to Reach a Stable Dose.\n\n【45】Vertical lines indicate the censoring of data due to the occurrence of an event or loss to follow-up.\n\n【46】Most of the secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two dosing-algorithm groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The time in the therapeutic range during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment was higher among patients in the genotype-guided group, and this difference was significant in the combined analysis of acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon (52.8% vs. 47.5%; P=0.02). Figure 2 shows the time it took to reach a therapeutic INR and the time it took to achieve a stable dose in the two dosing-algorithm groups. Secondary outcomes according to country are shown in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix . A per-protocol analysis of the data yielded similar results (Tables S5 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【47】The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two dosing-algorithm groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There was only one major bleeding episode, which occurred in the control group. Thromboembolic events occurred in five patients in the genotype-guided group and in four in the control group.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】In the EU-PACT trials, we investigated the use of a dosing algorithm that included both pharmacogenetic and clinical factors, as compared with an algorithm that included only clinical factors, for the initiation of treatment with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome of time in the therapeutic INR range during the first 12 weeks of treatment. There were also no significant differences in most of the secondary outcomes, including the percentage of patients with an INR of 4.0 or more, the percentage of time with an INR of 4.0 or more or an INR of less than 2.0, the median time it took to reach a therapeutic INR, and the percentage of patients with a stable dose within 12 weeks.\n\n【50】We found a significant between-group difference in the time in the therapeutic range during the first 4 weeks of treatment. This observation must be interpreted cautiously. The division of the 12-week study into three 4-week intervals was not prespecified in the trial protocol, and it is only one of several secondary outcome measures. Because the P values in our study were not corrected for multiple testing, it is possible that the significant difference detected in the first 4 weeks is a chance finding.\n\n【51】However, it is biologically plausible that the benefit of pharmacogenetically guided dosing, if there is one, would be most likely to occur during the initiation of treatment. The trial algorithms were used to determine drug doses only during the first 5 to 7 days of treatment. Thereafter, in both groups, adjustments were based on the INR. The fact that we found an effect only in the first month of treatment is consistent with previous observational studies in which we found differences in over- and under-anticoagulation (i.e., supratherapeutic and subtherapeutic INRs) between the genotypes only in the first month. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】Anderson et al. found a significant difference in the percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range in the first month as well as in the first 3 months of warfarin treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Their study was a nonrandomized comparison with a parallel control group in which standard anticoagulation therapy was provided without a dosing algorithm. In our study, the patients in the control group received a dose that was based on a clinical algorithm, which was also expected to improve the time within the therapeutic range. In a smaller, randomized, controlled trial conducted by Burmester et al., no significant difference in the time in the therapeutic range during the first 14 days was shown between pharmacogenetically guided dosing and dosing based on a clinical algorithm. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Wang et al. found that the time to a stable warfarin dose was decreased in the group that received genotype-guided dosing. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> We did not observe this difference in our study. Wang and colleagues used a less strict definition of a stable dose (i.e., the dose at which the INR was in the range of 1.8 to 3.0 for at least 7 days) than we did, and therefore the time it took to reach a stable dose was longer in our study than in the study by Wang et al.\n\n【53】One important difference between all these previous studies and the current one is that the previous studies all evaluated pharmacogenetically guided dosing of warfarin rather than acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon. The CYP2C9 enzyme has much less influence on the pharmacokinetics of phenprocoumon than on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Thus, the effect on the determination of the appropriate dose and dose stability during therapy may be smaller with phenprocoumon than with warfarin, and the effect of the pharmacogenetically guided dosing on the time spent in the therapeutic INR range would also be expected to be less.\n\n【54】One limitation of our trial is the fact that the number of patients included was lower than the number required according to our power calculation. We were able to meet the requirements of our revised sample-size calculation only by pooling the data from the acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon groups. Another limitation was the high number of protocol violations, including incorrectly calculated doses, doses not prescribed according to the protocol, and missing data for dose calculations. However, these issues would also arise if genotyping were implemented in clinical practice.\n\n【55】The percentage of time spent in, below, and above the target INR range is a surrogate outcome used to investigate the quality of anticoagulation. For clinical practice, it is important to determine whether clinical outcomes such as bleeding and thromboembolic events are decreased when genotyping is used. Our study was not powered to detect clinically relevant differences with respect to these events. However, the risks of bleeding and thromboembolic events are lowest when the INR is within the target range. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> It is therefore plausible that an intervention that increases the percentage of time in the target range will be associated with a decreased risk of adverse events.\n\n【56】In conclusion, we investigated the use of a dosing algorithm that included both pharmacogenetic and clinical factors, as compared with an algorithm that included only clinical factors, for the initiation of treatment with acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon. There was no significant difference between the two dosing-algorithm groups in the primary outcome of time in the therapeutic INR range during the first 12 weeks of treatment.\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme 删除4:<u>(HEALTH F2 2009 223062)</u> and by funding from GlaxoSmithKline (to Dr. Maitland-van der Zee) and the Swedish Research Council (Medicine), the Swedish Heart–Lung Foundation, and Clinical Research Support at Uppsala University (to Dr. Wadelius).</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on November 19, 2013, and updated on November 21, 2013, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>We thank all the patients who participated in this trial and all the staff at the anticoagulant clinics and hospitals where recruiting was conducted.</u>\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>The authors' affiliations are listed in the Appendix.</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Maitland-van der Zee at Utrecht University, Faculty of Science, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, P.O.

Alexandria, Bombay, Buenos Aires, San Francisco, Saigon, and Sydney were all affected as part of the “third pandemic,” a global event that began in China but spread widely with the aid of long-distance steamships. Like the Justinian Plague of 542 c.e. and the Black Death of 1346 c.e. the third pandemic took millions of lives and disrupted societies. Although the disease eventually died out in some regions, enzootic foci established during the third pandemic persist in many areas, including the western United States and the central highlands of Madagascar.\n\n【3】Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_ , a gram-negative bacillus that is believed to have evolved relatively recently from _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ . The organism cycles in nature among rodents and their fleas, and it is generally susceptible to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Most human plague is of the bubonic form, characterized by fever and regional lymphadenitis, and results from percutaneous exposure through the bite of infected rodent fleas. Without treatment, infection can spread from regional lymph nodes to the lungs, causing a secondary pneumonia. Patients with secondary pneumonic plague can transmit the infection to others through respiratory droplets. Inhalation of these droplets produces a primary pneumonic infection. Primary pneumonic plague has a typical incubation period of 1 to 4 days, is rapidly progressive, and is nearly always fatal in the absence of prompt antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【4】Although many patients with pneumonic plague do not transmit the disease to anyone, one patient can — under the right circumstances — infect many people and thus initiate an outbreak. The current epidemic in Madagascar appears to have been triggered by such an event. In late August 2017, an ill 31-year-old man boarded a bush taxi in the central highlands, bound for the eastern city of Toamasina (also called Tamatave), by way of the capital city, Antananarivo. Details of his illness are not publicly available, but his symptoms worsened quickly, and he died in transit. Dozens of persons who had direct contact with the man or his contacts subsequently became ill. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】Since notice of this first cluster, cases of suspected plague have been reported from many areas of Madagascar. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2417 total cases had been identified between August 1 and November 26, including 1854 (77%) that were clinically identified as pneumonic plague. Among pneumonic cases, 390 (21%) have been classified as confirmed, 618 (33%) as probable, and the remaining 846 (46%) as suspect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In most instances, laboratory confirmation is based on detection of fraction 1 (F1) capsular antigen in specimens by a locally produced rapid diagnostic test, combined with detection of _Y. pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Unfortunately, information on the sensitivity and specificity of these assays for testing sputum is limited. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Cases in which samples test positive by only one of these two methods are considered probable, and those in which laboratory tests are negative or pending remain suspect. Many cases lack any apparent epidemiologic links to known cases. More than 80 health care workers have reportedly been infected, but none have died. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】National and international response to the outbreak has been substantial. The government of Madagascar has established a high-level workgroup, chaired by the prime minister, to provide strategic direction, while the Ministry of Public Health coordinates health activities in collaboration with various partner organizations. The WHO is providing direct technical and operational support through mobilization of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, drawing on resources from the region and from member nations, including the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and the International Federation of the Red Cross, Madagascar, along with other nongovernmental organizations, have been assisting with laboratory testing, surveillance, and patient care activities. As of November 24, governments, international agencies, and businesses had contributed more than $4 million in direct or in-kind aid to the response. Collectively, these efforts have been directed toward active case finding and treatment, comprehensive identification and prophylaxis of contacts, rodent and flea control, safe and dignified burials, and departure screening and preparedness to prevent spread to other countries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】Recent reports suggest that the outbreak is subsiding. This is encouraging news, but the epidemic will leave in its wake several important questions — first and foremost: How big was it really? Without diminishing the suffering of individual patients and their loved ones, it’s important to recognize that plague’s gruesome reputation can cloud short-term understanding of an outbreak. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> This tendency was amply demonstrated during the 1994 plague epidemic in India in which more than 6300 suspected cases were reported from 12 Indian states. When the dust finally settled, fewer than 300 clinically compatible cases were confirmed by laboratory testing, and even then only by methods of questionable specificity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】Reports of plague can create a positive feedback loop. Health care providers fearful of missing a case may suspect plague in any ill patient, thereby generating more suspected cases and a spiraling case count. Though this problem can be mitigated by adherence to specific case definitions and use of reliable laboratory testing, such requirements can be difficult to enforce during a plague epidemic. Current reports of more than 2000 cases in Madagascar are clearly cause for concern, but our worry should be tempered by the knowledge that only 33 culture-confirmed cases have been identified to date. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The true magnitude of the outbreak may take time to determine, but it probably lies somewhere between these extremes.\n\n【9】 Malagasy Education Poster Showing Bubonic and Pneumonic Forms of the Plague.\n\n【10】The poster instructs patients to seek immediate care at a health center if they have symptoms of bubonic or pneumonic plague, including fever, headache, fatigue, buboes, or cough and bloody sputum.\n\n【11】A second important issue will be identifying which components of the response actually helped and which did not. These assessments can be more difficult than one might imagine, especially since multiple measures were employed simultaneously. Acting through difficult-to-quantify mechanisms such as social distancing, simple public awareness may substantially reduce opportunities for person-to-person transmission and thus curtail an outbreak (see poster ). 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> On the other hand, tracing and prophylaxis of contacts of all persons with suspected cases can be costly and inefficient, especially if the criteria for a suspected case are lax. In the current response, thousands of contract tracers have been mobilized, yet few, if any, infected contacts have been identified. The situation can be aggravated by widespread use of point-of-care diagnostics for testing patients with a low prior probability of infection. In the absence of a highly specific test, such use can generate more false positive than true positive results.\n\n【12】Finally, it is worth considering how best to advance development and validation of better tests and treatments for plague. Fundamentally a disease of poverty, plague strikes communities with the least capacity to respond, and the unpredictable and episodic nature of the disease complicates efforts to conduct planned studies. The current standard for the treatment of plague in Madagascar is repeated intramuscular injections of streptomycin. The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved oral fluoroquinolones for the treatment of plague; however, this approval was based on animal models rather than on formal trials or extensive clinical experience. Advances in care will require sustained research in high-risk areas, or at least greater capacity to implement important studies promptly when outbreaks occur.\n\n【13】For much of the world, the public health importance of plague has waned substantially over the past century. Antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis have reduced morbidity and mortality, and improved living standards have reduced human contact with rodents and the fleas that transmit the disease. Barring a catastrophic global event, the likelihood of a plague pandemic comparable to the Black Death is extremely low.\n\n【14】Nevertheless, the disease continues to cycle quietly in discrete, enzootic foci in rural areas of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Inevitable eruptions, like the current outbreak in Madagascar, pose a pernicious challenge to the world’s medical and public health community. They also, however, provide important opportunities to improve medical care for infected persons and to enhance detection and response capabilities. The responses to these events should be judged not only by how quickly cases diminish, but also by how they advance the prevention and control of future outbreaks.\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the official position of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on December 20, 2017, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-1:<u>From the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO.</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 82KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【23】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

New techniques that are based on in vitro fertilization (IVF), including pronuclear and metaphase II spindle transfer, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> have the potential to prevent the transmission of serious mtDNA diseases. However, before these techniques are permitted in the United Kingdom, Parliament must agree to new regulations regarding enforcement of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990). Central to the debate about the use of these IVF techniques is estimating how many women could potentially benefit from these procedures. This calculation depends on the prevalence of clinically relevant pathogenic mtDNA mutations in the population and the fertility of women with pathogenic mtDNA mutations.\n\n【3】Using fertility data regarding live births per 1000 person-years among women 15 years of age or older obtained from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Mitochondrial Disease Cohort U.K., we assessed whether fertility is affected in carriers of pathogenic mtDNA mutations, as compared with the general population (with data obtained from the U.K. Office for National Statistics). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> In addition, we estimated the national prevalence of women with potentially inheritable mtDNA mutations between the ages of 15 and 44 years and used these data together with the most recent national total fertility rates to estimate the number of affected live births per year in both the United Kingdom and the United States (with fertility rates of 1.85 in 2013 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and 1.88 in 2012, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> respectively).\n\n【4】Table 1.  Table 1. Fertility Rates in Women with Inherited Pathogenic Mitochondrial DNA Mutations, as Compared with Rates in the General Population.\n\n【5】We identified 154 women with inherited mtDNA mutations in the MRC Mitochondrial Disease U.K. Cohort 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org)</u> and found that pathogenic mtDNA mutations had no significant effect on the female fertility rate 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Carriers of mtDNA mutations had a rate of 63.2 live births per 1000 person-years, as compared with 67.2 live births per 1000 women in the general population (P=0.36). In addition, there was no significant difference in fertility rates between the most severely affected carriers (those with the top decile of scores on the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale below the age of 30 years) and a comparable weighted group of the general population, with a rate of 50.6 live births (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 21.9 to 99.8) per 1000 person-years and 52.6 live births per 1000 women, respectively (P=1.00).\n\n【6】In 2011 in the United Kingdom, 4.08% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 years were living in North East England (506,100 of 12,391,000 women), resulting in an extrapolation factor of 24.48 for the entire United Kingdom. In North East England, we identified 101 women of childbearing age who are symptomatic carriers or are at risk for transmitting mtDNA disease (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix ). On the basis of the extrapolation factor, we estimated that 2473 women 删除4:<u>(95% CI, 2019 to 3246)</u> are at risk for transmitting mtDNA disease nationally. In the United States, using midyear 2012 data for women in the same age group (totaling 62,246,000) and the same extrapolation methodology, we estimated that 12,423 women (95% CI, 10,146 to 15,064) are at risk for transmitting mtDNA disease nationally.\n\n【7】Using national fertility rates for the United Kingdom and the United States, we estimated that these women will give birth 4574 and 23,354 times, respectively, over a 30-year period. Thus, the average number of births per year among women at risk for transmitting mtDNA disease is 152 (95% CI, 125 to 200) in the United Kingdom and 778 (95% CI, 636 to 944) in the United States.\n\n【8】There are several implicit assumptions in these calculations; in particular, we have not considered possible effects of differing age profiles or ethnic diversity of women in the fertile period in comparing North East England with the national and international profile. These factors almost certainly affect the accuracy of the extrapolated estimates. However, our findings have considerable implications for all countries that are considering the use of IVF techniques to prevent the transmission of serious mtDNA diseases, although we accept that access to these techniques will vary widely. In the United Kingdom, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Mitochondrial Donation) Regulations 2015, if passed by Parliament, would enable the licensing of clinics to perform these IVF procedures to the potential benefit of about 150 births per year if all women opted for the procedure.\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Gráinne S.

Three forms of the disease can be distinguished according to severity and the age at onset: late infantile (1 to 2 years), juvenile (3 to 16), and adult (>16).\n\n【4】Methods and Results.\n--------------------\n\n【5】To understand the molecular basis of the different forms of the disease, we analyzed arylsulfatase A alleles associated with metachromatic leukodystrophy. Two alleles (termed I and A) were Identified and accounted for about half of all arylsulfatase A alleles among 68 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy whom we examined. Sufficient information was available for 66 of the patients to allow classification of their disease. Of the six instances of homozygosity for allele I, all were associated with the late-infantile form of the disease; of the eight instances of homozygosity for allele A, five were associated with the adult form and three with the juvenile form. When both alleles were present, the juvenile form resulted (seven of seven instances). Heterozygosity for allele I (with the other allele unknown) is usually associated with late-infantile disease, and heterozygosity for allele A with a later onset of the disease. The clinical variability can be explained by the different levels of residual arylsulfatase A activity associated with these genotypes.\n\n【6】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【7】Like many lysosomal storage disorders, metachromatic leukodystrophy shows clinical heterogeneity that seems to reflect genetic heterogeneity. One of the known alleles (allele I) is associated with earlier and more severe disease than the other (allele A). 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1991;324:18–22.)</u>\n\n【8】Introduction\n------------\n\n【9】ARYLSULFATASE A is a lysosomal enzyme inL volved in the degradation of cerebroside sulfate, a polar glycolipid that is found mainly as a component of the myelin sheaths of the nervous system. Deficiency of arylsulfatase A results in metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the accumulation of cerebroside sulfate. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The storage of sulfatide mainly affects the nervous system, where it is associated with progressive demyelination and loss of white matter. Clinically, there may be neurologic symptoms, such as weakness, ataxia, progressive spastic tetraparesis, optic atrophy, and dementia. In older patients psychiatric symptoms may precede the neurologic manifestations. The age of onset ranges from less than two years to the third or fourth decade of life. Three forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy can be distinguished according to the age at onset: late infantile (1 to 2 years), juvenile (3 to 16), and adult (>16). The late-infantile form is fatal within a few years, whereas the course of the juvenile and adult forms is more protracted. The incidence of metachromatic leukodystrophy among whites is estimated to be 1 in 40,000, suggesting a frequency of 0.5 percent for metachromatic leukodystrophy alleles. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Approximately 0.5 percent 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> to 2 percent 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> of the population has very low levels of residual arylsulfatase A activity but is asymptomatic. This condition has been called arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency and is in most cases caused by homozygosity for the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele. Estimates of the frequency of this allele range from 7.3 percent3 to 15 percent. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> We recently analyzed the mutations in this allele 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> and found that the low residual activity is due to reduced synthesis of arylsulfatase A, which can be explained by the loss of a polyadenylation signal. However, at least in those who are homozygous for the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele, enough arylsulfatase A is synthesized to prevent clinically apparent disease.\n\n【10】In this report we describe four genotypes that are combinations of two arylsulfatase A alleles that cause metachromatic leukodystrophy and the pseudodeficiency allele. These genotypes are associated with different levels of residual arylsulfatase A activity —from 0 to approximately 10 percent — and represent the clinical spectrum from the most severely affected children to apparently healthy adults.\n\n【11】Methods\n-------\n\n【12】Amplification of Fragments from Genomic DNA\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Mutations in the Arylsulfatase A Gene.\n\n【14】Boxes indicate exons; solid parts represent translated and hatched parts untranslated regions. Lines depict introns, and triangles potential sites of _N_ \\-glycosylation. ATG and TGA are the initiation codon and termination codon, respectively. A, C, and D are the fragments that were amplified: A and C for allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, and C and D for subcloning and sequencing. ON 1 through 5 indicate the binding sites of the oligonucleotides (ON) used for the amplification of DNA (see Methods). Arrows show the location of the mutations. The mutations and the codons in which they occur are shown. Adjacent sequences are shown for the splice-site mutation.\n\n【15】Procedures used lor the amplification of DNA fragments have been described elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> For the amplification of fragment D, the elongation time was increased to five minutes. The sequences of oligonucleotides used to amplify the fragments shown in Figure 1 were as follows: for fragment A, oligonucleotide 1 sequence 5′TCGAATTCTGCTGGAGCCAAGTAGCCCT3′ and oligonucleotide 3 sequence 5′GAAAGACTGGAGTTAGCACT3′; for fragment C, oligonucleotide 4 sequence 5′CGGAATTCTTGATGGGGAACTGAGTGAC3′ and oligonucleotide 5 sequence 5′GCGAAGCTTCCTCATTGGTACCACAGG3′; and for fragment D, the sequence of oligonucleotide 1 was the same as that in fragment A and oligonucleotide 2 sequence 5′GAGGATCCCAGTGCAGGAGGCACTGAGG3′. The fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 and M13mp19 and sequenced according to standard techniques. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7</a></sup></u>\n\n【16】Hybridization of Allele-Specific Oligonucleotides\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The genotype of the patients was determined by hybridization of allele-specific oligonucleotides. Fragments A and C ( Fig. 1 ) were amplified, blotted onto nylon filters, and hybridized to oligonucleotides end-labeled with \\[ 删除3:<u><sup>32 </sup></u> P\\]ATP and T <sub>4 </sub> kinase. The methods used have been described elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The sequence of oligonucleotides used to detect the splice-site mutation of allele I was 5′TGGTTCCTACCTGGTCGT3′ (57°C) for the normal allele and 5′TGGTTCCTATCTGGTCGT3′ (57°C) for the mutant allele. The sequence of oligonucleotides used to detect the exchange of leucine for proline at position 426 in allele A was 5′CATAGAGCAGCGGGGGCT3′ (59°C) for the normal allele and 5′CATAGAGCAGCAGGGGCT3′ (59°C) for the mutant allele.

To identify the molecular defects in metachromatic leukodystrophy, we amplified the arylsulfatase A gene of a patient with juvenile onset of the disease. The amplified fragments were subcloned into M13mp18 and M13mp19 and sequenced in both directions.\n\n【23】Two different metachromatic leukodystrophy alleles were identified in this patient. One allele — designated allele I — differed in three positions from the published gene sequence for arylsulfatase A: a G → T transversion changing tryptophan at position 193 to cysteine, a C → G transversion changing threonine at position 391 to serine, and a G → A transition destroying the splice donor site of exon 2 by changing the classic exon-intron boundary consensus sequence AG gt。 to AG at。 The exchange of serine for threonine at position 391 is a polymorphism that was found in the DNA of four of eight healthy controls (unpublished data).\n\n【24】The exchange of cysteine for tryptophan at position 193 was introduced into the arylsulfatase A cDNA 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> by site-directed mutagenesis, and a mutated cDNA was transiently expressed in baby-hamster kidney cells after transfection. The arylsulfatase A activity measured in the transfected cells was comparable to that in cells transfected with wild-type cDNA, indicating that the exchange of cysteine for tryptophan at position 193 is functionally silent. Of the three changes found in allele I, only the loss of the splice donor site was considered to be of relevance for metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n\n【25】The second metachromatic leukodystrophy allele —designated allele A — differed from the published arylsulfatase A sequence in one position: a C → T transition causing the change of proline at position 426 to leucine. The introduction of this mutation into the arylsulfatase A cDNA and its expression in baby-hamster kidney cells led to a small increase in the activity of arylsulfatase A in the transfected cells. Three independent transfection experiments showed that this increase was only 3 percent (range, 2 to 5) of that observed in cells transfected with the normal arylsulfatase A cDNA. Metachromatic leukodystrophy allele A thus codes for low residual arylsulfatase A activity.\n\n【26】Frequencies of Alleles I and A among Patients with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Fragments A and C ( Fig. 1 ) were amplified from the DNA of 68 patients affected with different clinical forms of the disease, and the frequencies of alleles I and A were determined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Of the 68 patients, 50 carried at least one of the two metachromatic leukodystrophy alleles (I or A). Twenty-three patients were homozygous for either allele I or allele A or heterozygous for both alleles. In 18 patients neither allele I nor allele A was found. In total, 37 I alleles and 36 A alleles were found. Thus, the two alleles accounted for about half of all arylsulfatase A alleles in this fairly typical selection of patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n\n【28】Distribution of Alleles I and A among Patients with Different Clinical Forms of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Table 1.  Table 1. Genotypes and Clinical Form of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy in 68 Patients.\n\n【30】Sufficient information was available for 66 of the patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy to allow classification of their disease as late infantile, juvenile, or adult. Table 1 shows the correlation between the genotype and the clinical form of the disease. All six patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy who were homozygous for allele I (loss of the splice donor site of exon 2) had the late-infantile form, whereas five of the patients who were homozygous for allele A (substitution of leucine for proline at position 426) had the adult form and three had the juvenile form. Among the patients with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, seven had both allele I and allele A. The I allele was found in combination with an unidentified allele in 14 patients with the late-infantile form, 2 with the juvenile form, and 1 with the adult form of the disease. The A allele was found in combination with an unidentified metachromatic leukodystrophy allele in 10 patients with either the adult or the juvenile form of the disease.\n\n【31】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Arylsulfatase A Genotype and Age at Onset of Metachromatic Leukodystrophy.\n\n【32】The arylsulfatase A genotype was plotted against the age at onset of the clinical symptoms in 19 patients for whom such data were available.\n\n【33】These results suggest that homozygosity for allele I predisposes patients to the late-infantile form of metachromatic leukodystrophy, homozygosity for allele A to the adult form, and compound heterozygosity of both alleles to the juvenile form. This is supported by the correlation of the age at onset with the genotype ( Fig. 2 ). The age at onset of the disease was known for 19 patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy who had a fully identifiable genotype. In patients who were homozygous for allele I, the disease started around the age of 2 years; in patients who were homozygous for allele A, the onset was between 8 and 22 years (mean, 17.3); and in patients carrying both alleles, the onset was between 4 and 7 years (mean, 5.8).\n\n【34】More complete clinical information was available for five of the six patients with the late-infantile form who were homozygous for allele I. In all cases the initial symptoms were gait disturbances due to muscular hypotonia. In the older patients the first symptoms were either neurologic or psychiatric. A summary of the clinical data for most of the patients with the lateonset form shown in Figure 2 has been presented elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【35】Biochemical Characterization of Patients Homozygous for Allele I or Allele A\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Patients homozygous for allele I who had late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy were characterized biochemically by the absence of arylsulfatase A polypeptides after metabolic labeling of fibroblasts with \\[ 删除3:<u><sup>35 </sup></u> S\\]methionine (data not shown). Fibroblasts contain three forms of arylsulfatase A RNA; the smallest, a 2.1-kilobase (kb) species, is efficiently polyadenylated and appears to be the predominant form of messenger RNA used for translation, whereas the two larger forms (3.7 kb and 4.8 kb) are poorly polyadenylated. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> We have previously reported that the 2.1-kb species was not detectable and levels of the two larger forms were severely diminished in measurements of total RNA in a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy who was homozygous for allele I. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> We conclude that the deficiency of the splice donor site of exon 2 renders the three forms of arylsulfatase A RNA unstable and that the presence of allele I does not lead to the synthesis of detectable amounts of polypeptides that cross-react with arylsulfatase A.\n\n【37】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Molecular Phenotype of Mutant Arylsulfatase A Alleles.\n\n【38】Homogenates from cultured fibroblasts of a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy who was homozygous for allele A (the substitution of leucine for proline at position 426) underwent Western blot analysis. Lane 1 shows a Western blot of homogenates from untreated fibroblasts, and lane 2 from fibroblasts treated for 14 days with a cysteine proteinase inhibitor (0.8 μmol of carbobenzoxy-Phe-Ala diazomethylketone per liter). 删除3:<u><sup>5 </sup></u> The band specific for arylsulfatase A is indicated by an arrow.\n\n【39】The biochemical phenotype of two patients with the adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy who proved to be homozygous for allele A in this study was reported earlier. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Incubation of fibroblasts from these patients with inhibitors of cysteine proteinases partially restored the arylsulfatase A activity. The deficiency was thought to result from an increased susceptibility of the mutant arylsulfatase A polypeptides to lysosomal cysteine proteinases. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The accumulation of arylsulfatase A polypeptides in fibroblasts from a patient homozygous for allele A in response to incubation with a cysteine proteinase inhibitor is shown in Figure 3 . We conclude from these results that the exchange of leucine for proline at position 426 increases the susceptibility of arylsulfatase A to lysosomal cysteine proteinases and results in a severe reduction in the half-life of the mutant polypeptides.\n\n【40】Identification of Compound Heterozygotes for the Arylsulfatase A Pseudodeficiency Allele and Allele I We previously identified the mutations in the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> The gene frequency of this allele is estimated to range from 7.3 to 15 percent, and persons who are homozygous for the pseudodeficiency allele are clinically healthy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> We have identified two persons with compound heterozygosity for the pseudodeficiency allele and the metachromatic leukodystrophy allele I. The combination of these alleles is expected to reduce arylsulfatase A activity to about 10 percent 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> of normal. Both persons are in their third decade of life and so far have no symptoms characteristic of metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n\n【41】Discussion\n----------\n\n【42】It is apparent from this study that a clear correlation exists between the arylsulfatase A genotype and the clinical phenotype. The most severe type of metachromatic leukodystrophy, the late-infantile form, is associated with homozygosity for allele I, which does not encode for functional arylsulfatase A polypeptides. One copy of allele A, which encodes for an unstable but active arylsulfatase A, is sufficient to mitigate the clinical course and produce the juvenile form, whereas two copies of this allele allow for the mildest course of the disease, the adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy. One copy of the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele is sufficient to sustain a normal phenotype. Although one cannot be certain that symptoms will not develop in these persons very late in life, it seems that the critical threshold is approximately 10 percent residual arylsulfatase A activity. Small variations in residual arylsulfatase A activity may greatly influence the accumulation of its substrates and its clinical manifestation.\n\n【43】Bone marrow transplantation has been proposed as a treatment for metachromatic leukodystrophy. Improvement of the clinical symptoms was recently reported in a girl who had received a bone marrow transplant several years earlier. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Our data support the view that the low levels of enzyme delivered to the brain by the microglial cells derived from the donor's bone marrow may be sufficient to alter the course of the disease. Patients with the juvenile or adult form of metachromatic leukodystrophy should be better candidates for bone marrow transplantation than those with the late-infantile form, because their level of residual arylsulfatase A activity is higher and therefore less enzyme needs to be replaced.\n\n【44】Although the average age at onset is clearly different in the three forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy, there is a remarkable variability among the patients who are homozygous for allele A. This genotype can be found both among patients with the juvenile form and among those with the adult form of the disease. Such variability can occur within a single family10 and suggests the existence of additional loci that can influence the clinical phenotype of metachromatic leukodystrophy. For example, the pattern of expression and activity of lysosomal proteinases may differ from person to person, and this in turn may influence the half-life of the mutant arylsulfatase A protein and explain the variability of the clinical manifestations in adult patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【46】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Gi 155/2–1 ) and the Fond der Chemischen Industrie.</u>\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Biochemistry II.

You are all we have, and you come to us endangered.”_\n\n【3】So writes Ta-Nehisi Coates in _Between the World and Me_ , and for all my clinical training, it’s narratives such as his that have provided me with a shadow curriculum of racial affirmations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】Are you missing out on the latest research?\n\n【5】Stay up to date on newly published articles with the Weekly Table of Contents alert, your choice of 20 Specialty Updates, and more.\n\n【6】SIGN UP\n\n【7】As I complete dual fellowships in child and adolescent psychiatry and addiction medicine, honing my expertise in diagnosing and treating disorders of thinking, feeling, and behavior affecting children, adolescents, and their families, I have seen patients with a wide range of disorders. I have also consumed textbooks, attended conferences, and inquired endlessly about clinical cases and opinions during supervision. But it took the national attention now being paid to Black lives to make me consciously acknowledge that caring for Black boys and their families is one of the most rewarding and emotionally challenging endeavors I face.\n\n【8】When I interview parents of Black boys, I frequently come away with a similar narrative — a story in which normative behavior is characterized as aberrant, or behaviors classically associated with common diagnoses are misattributed.\n\n【9】The preschool version: A widowed mother of a 4-year-old Black boy sought consultation for what his teacher described as aggressive and noncompliant behaviors, including not sitting “Indian-style” during reading circle and overly aggressive play. When I spoke with the mother, she described a precious child interested in learning multiple languages, including the Kreyol spoken in his home. I spent 90 minutes interviewing and observing the boy and questioning him and his mother, but I saw no hint, let alone a pattern, of behavior warranting pharmacologic or even behavioral intervention.\n\n【10】When I pivoted to questions about his academic environment, the mother told me her son drew much attention as the only Black child in his parochial preschool. The mother, a diligent and strong academic who had begun to question her own parenting skills, showed me photos of her son in his classroom; indeed, he was not sitting cross-legged, but neither were several non-Black students. In the photo, the boy looked attentively at the book his teacher was holding and held his hands high, apparently waiting to ask a question.\n\n【11】Assessment: 4-year-old Black male child being a child. Plan: Share the growing evidence that educators, even in preschool, have biases toward viewing normative behaviors of Black boys as challenging, which partially explains the overrepresentation of Black boys among students suspended or expelled from school. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Validate mother’s decision to place the child in a more culturally diverse kindergarten in the fall, while cautioning that removing him from the school doesn’t remove the melanin from his skin. Schedule regular parent-guidance follow-up sessions, since the mother appreciated the opportunity to talk with someone who could assuage her anxieties about her child, validate concerns about structural racism in education, and discuss normative behavioral development.\n\n【12】_“I was a curious boy, but the schools were not concerned with curiosity. They were concerned with compliance. I loved a few of my teachers. But I cannot say that I truly believed any of them.”_ 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】When I speak to elementary school teachers, I’m often asked about behavioral compliance and Black boys: “What am I supposed to do when they just don’t listen?” I walk them through my clinical thought process, acknowledging that children exist within dynamic tapestries of complex social, psychological, and biologic diversity. I encourage teachers to see their Black male students as individuals and to find strategies that allow for their individuality.\n\n【14】The grade-school version: I met an 8-year-old Black boy and his parents after he’d been suspended from school four times in 4 months. As I read his chart and talked with his teachers and school counselors, I was prepared to encounter not a boy but an “aggressive, out-of-control” force of nature who would “intimidate” me. His school record indicated that he had difficulty “letting go” during classroom transitions. His parents told me he’d received early-intervention language services but aged out at 3 years old; they recognized that he had relatively few friends, since “he can be intense, wanting to play with them every day.”\n\n【15】The child I met was neither aggressive nor intimidating, but he showed classic atypical social reciprocity and a strikingly keen interest in Legos and maps. Rather than forcibly fitting him into my scripted questions, I sat awkwardly with him on the floor and attempted to enter his world, which he welcomed without tantrum or rage. I recognized his difficulty in letting things go as cognitive rigidity, not defiant behavior.\n\n【16】Assessment: 8-year-old Black boy, concern for an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental condition — autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with or without intellectual impairment, level 1. Plan: Provide psychoeducation about ASD. Share evidence about children of color and missed diagnoses. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Refer for neuropsychological evaluation so that an Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule is completed and a report written. Encourage parents to apply for developmental services from the state and to seek support of their child at home and in the community while preventing placement in a more restrictive setting.\n\n【17】_“You exist. You matter. You have value. You have every right to wear your hoodie, to play your music as loud as you want. You have every right to be you. And no one should deter you from being you. You have to be you. And you can never be afraid to be you.”_ 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【18】The high school version: A 16-year-old Black boy whose records are full of pronouncements that he is “not motivated” comes to see me with his mother. We discuss his life, including scholastic pursuits, and he acknowledges that he doesn’t always give his best effort — not unusual for a teenager — but tells me candidly, “It’s not that I don’t care, but I don’t feel like _they_ care.” Sensing that boys like him need a holding space during a period of identity formation, I generally seek to provide supportive and cognitive behavioral therapy, rather than strictly psychopharmacologic management. With such patients, I delve into and process thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and provide space where they can feel anxious, frustrated, or embarrassed or laugh without pretense. Much to others’ surprise, communication with these teenagers gradually improves and accusations of apathy fade. But I’m not offering a unique cure — just validated and evidence-informed therapy. I educate the parents about the worrisome frequency with which Black boys are mislabeled with behavioral disorders 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> when they simply have emotions like everyone else.\n\n【19】_“So I feared not just the violence of this world but the rules designed to protect you from it, the rules that would have you contort your body to address the block, and contort again to be taken seriously by colleagues, and contort again so as not to give the police a reason.”_ 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【20】When it comes to Black boys, I’m often primed to encounter frightening caricatures — creatures who are at least rough around the edges, possibly hostile. Yet when I sit still, focused on being present and listening to their thoughts and feeling their emotions, I don’t feel angst or hear distortions of their reality. Instead, I see reflections, of both myself and society. I see individual boys navigating a society that often has negative conceptions of who they are. And I think, “He’s just a boy — must he be more responsible for his actions in a way that others cannot know?” The reality is, in our country…yes, he must.\n\n【21】When parents, colleagues, and friends ask, “How should I talk to my Black son?” or “How do I talk about racial tensions?” I aim to provide answers based on the best evidence — the lived experiences of patients and the history of Black men’s lives and deaths in America. I hope I’ll be ready to bear the weight of expectations, as I remind myself and others of philosopher Paulo Freire’s words: “No one can be authentically human while he prevents others from being so.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】For I, too, am a Black man.\n\n【23】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【25】参考删除-1:<u>Identifying details have been changed to protect the patients’ privacy.</u>\n\n【26】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【27】参考删除-1:<u>From Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School — both in Boston.</u>\n\n【28】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 147KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【30】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【31】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause within 13 to 17 days after surgery. Secondary efficacy outcomes included major venous thromboembolism (i.e., proximal deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death related to venous thromboembolism) and symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 79 of 824 patients (9.6%) who received rivaroxaban and in 166 of 878 (18.9%) who received enoxaparin (absolute risk reduction, 9.2%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 5.9 to 12.4; P<0.001). Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 9 of 908 patients (1.0%) given rivaroxaban and 24 of 925 (2.6%) given enoxaparin (absolute risk reduction, 1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.8; P=0.01). Symptomatic events occurred less frequently with rivaroxaban than with enoxaparin (P=0.005). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and 0.5% of patients in the enoxaparin group. The incidence of drug-related adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal, was 12.0% in the rivaroxaban group and 13.0% in the enoxaparin group.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total knee arthroplasty, with similar rates of bleeding. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00361894 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Venous thromboembolism is a major, potentially fatal complication after major orthopedic surgery such as total knee arthroplasty. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Anticoagulants that are currently used for thromboprophylaxis require parenteral administration or have unpredictable pharmacodynamic properties that require monitoring. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Several anticoagulants currently in development target individual coagulation factors, including thrombin and activated factor X (factor Xa). The efficacy of the parenterally administered indirect factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux for thromboprophylaxis encouraged the development of direct factor Xa inhibitors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Bayer HealthCare) is an orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Phase 2 studies showed that rivaroxaban was potentially safe and effective for thromboprophylaxis after major orthopedic surgery across a wide range of doses. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8 </a></sup></u> Total daily doses of 5 to 20 mg of rivaroxaban had efficacy and safety similar to those of enoxaparin after total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> A subsequent study indicated that rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg once daily had sufficient efficacy and safety to merit further investigation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Here, we describe a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial that compared the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, administered postoperatively, with those of enoxaparin, 40 mg given subcutaneously once daily, administered preoperatively, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Patients\n--------\n\n【16】Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18 years of age or older and were scheduled for total knee arthroplasty. We excluded patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding that contraindicated the use of low-molecular-weight heparin and patients with any contraindication to the use of enoxaparin or with any contraindication necessitating adjustment of its dose. Other exclusion criteria included conditions preventing bilateral venography, clinically significant liver disease, concomitant use of protease inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus or fibrinolytic agents, planned intermittent pneumatic compression, requirement of ongoing anticoagulant therapy, and pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n\n【17】Study Design and Medications\n----------------------------\n\n【18】On a double-blind and double-dummy basis, before surgery, patients were randomly assigned through a central telephone system to receive once-daily oral rivaroxaban (Bayer HealthCare), in a 10-mg tablet, or a once-daily injection of enoxaparin sodium (Clexane or Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis), in a 40-mg dose. Enoxaparin was initiated 12 hours before surgery and was given again 6 to 8 hours after wound closure. Rivaroxaban was initiated 6 to 8 hours after wound closure. Thereafter, the study medication was administered every 24 hours.\n\n【19】The day of surgery was defined as day 1, and study medications were continued until at least day 10 and up to day 14. Patients underwent mandatory, bilateral venography between day 11 and day 15. No further study medication was given after venography; further thromboprophylaxis was given at the investigator's discretion, according to the local practice. Patients were followed for 30 to 35 days after the last dose of study medication.\n\n【20】The trial was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee or institutional review board of each center, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before randomization.\n\n【21】The study was designed and supervised by the Regulation of Coagulation in Orthopedic Surgery to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (RECORD3) Steering Committee (see the Appendix). Data were collected and analyzed by the study sponsors. The Steering Committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript and made the decision to publish. All authors contributed to writing the manuscript, had full access to the data and analyses, and vouch for the report's accuracy and completeness.\n\n【22】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【23】All outcomes were assessed by central, independent adjudication committees who were unaware of the treatment assignments. The primary outcome was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause within 13 to 17 days after surgery. The main secondary efficacy outcome was major venous thromboembolism (i.e., proximal deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death related to venous thromboembolism). Other efficacy outcomes included the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (any, proximal, or distal), symptomatic venous thromboembolism occurring during the treatment period or follow-up period, and death during the follow-up period.\n\n【24】Deep-vein thrombosis was assessed between day 11 and day 15, or earlier if symptoms were present, by means of ascending, bilateral venography. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> In cases of suspected deep-vein thrombosis, ultrasonography or venography was used to confirm the diagnosis. In cases of suspected pulmonary embolism, ventilation–perfusion scintigraphy of the lung and chest radiography or spiral computed tomography were performed, or pulmonary angiography was performed. Autopsies were planned if a participant died.\n\n【25】The main safety outcome was the incidence of major bleeding occurring between intake of the first dose of study medication and 2 days after the last dose. Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was fatal, that involved a critical organ, or that required reoperation or clinically overt bleeding outside the surgical site that was associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of 2 g or more per deciliter or requiring infusion of 2 or more units of blood. Other safety outcomes included any bleeding or major bleeding occurring between intake of the first dose of study medication and 2 days after the last dose, nonmajor bleeding including hemorrhagic wound complications (excessive wound hematoma or bleeding at the surgical site), other adverse events, and death. Laboratory variables and cardiovascular adverse events were monitored during the treatment and follow-up periods.\n\n【26】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【27】We aimed to determine whether the efficacy of rivaroxaban was noninferior to that of enoxaparin in the per-protocol population and, if so, to determine whether rivaroxaban had superior efficacy to enoxaparin in the modified intention-to-treat population. The modified intention-to-treat population included all patients who had undergone surgery, who took a study medication, and who had an adequate assessment for thromboembolism. These patients were included in the per-protocol analysis if their records showed no major protocol violations. The safety analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of a study medication.\n\n【28】For the primary efficacy analysis, we estimated the difference between the incidences in the rivaroxaban group and the enoxaparin group, after stratification on the basis of country of the center, using Mantel–Haenszel weighting; the corresponding asymptotic two-sided 95% confidence interval was also reported. Tests for noninferiority and superiority were both based on 95% confidence intervals. For the primary efficacy outcome, the threshold for the noninferiority test was an absolute difference between the two groups of 4%. The superiority test for major venous thromboembolism was preceded by a noninferiority test (absolute margin, 1.5%). Unweighted exact methods were used to assess secondary outcomes that occurred infrequently (e.g., pulmonary embolism and death).\n\n【29】For the test of superiority, on the basis of an assumed event rate of 27% in the enoxaparin group, we calculated that 860 patients per treatment group would be sufficient to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% in the rivaroxaban group as compared with the enoxaparin group, with a statistical power of 90% and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. With the assumption of an inadequate assessment of venous thromboembolism in 25% of participants, the total number of patients was increased to 2300.\n\n【30】In the two-step statistical analysis we performed, a noninferiority test (based on a noninferiority limit of 4 percentage points) preceding the superiority test had a statistical power of 91% if we assumed an absolute risk reduction of 3% (corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 11%) in the rivaroxaban group as compared with the enoxaparin group. If the absolute risk reduction was assumed to be only 2% (corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 7%), a statistical power of 80% would be maintained.\n\n【31】The difference in the incidence of major bleeding between the rivaroxaban group and the enoxaparin group was analyzed with the same methods for efficacy; other safety outcomes were analyzed by means of appropriate descriptive methods. Sex and race were analyzed with the use of a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusted for country. Age, weight, and body-mass index were analyzed by means of two-way analysis of variance, with treatment group and country as fixed effects. All other variables were analyzed descriptively, and statistical tests were performed with the use of a two-sided type I error rate of 5%.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Study Populations\n-----------------\n\n【34】Figure 1.

Rivaroxaban was noninferior to enoxaparin (P<0.001 for the noninferiority analysis; data not shown).\n\n【40】Major venous thromboembolism occurred in 9 of 908 patients (1.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and 24 of 925 (2.6%) in the enoxaparin group (weighted absolute risk reduction, 1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.8; P=0.01; relative risk reduction, 62%; 95% CI, 18 to 82; P=0.02) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【41】Among the 2418 patients who were validated for the safety analysis and who underwent surgery, the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events was lower in the rivaroxaban group 删除4:<u>(8 of 1201 patients \\[0.7%\\])</u> than in the enoxaparin group (24 of 1217 patients \\[2.0%\\]; weighted absolute risk reduction, 1.3%; 95% CI, 0.4 to 2.2; P=0.005; relative risk reduction, 66%; 95% CI, 25 to 85; P=0.008) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the follow-up period was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. During the treatment period, there were no deaths or known pulmonary emboli in the rivaroxaban group and two unexplained deaths and four known pulmonary emboli in the enoxaparin group; during the follow-up period, there were four unexplained deaths in the enoxaparin group.\n\n【42】Safety\n------\n\n【43】Table 4.  Table 4. Safety Outcomes.\n\n【44】Major bleeding occurred in 7 of 1220 patients (0.6%) who received rivaroxaban and 6 of 1239 (0.5%) who received enoxaparin (weighted absolute risk increase, 0.1%; P=0.77) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. No episodes of fatal bleeding occurred. There were three cases of hemorrhagic spinal puncture without neurologic signs or symptoms of compression: one occurred in the rivaroxaban group before the first dose was administered, and two occurred in the enoxaparin group. The combined incidence of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events was similar in the two groups (40 of 1220 patients \\[3.3%\\] in the rivaroxaban group and 34 of 1239 patients \\[2.7%\\] in the enoxaparin group, P=0.44). There was no significant difference between the two groups in postoperative drainage or transfusion requirement 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>.\n\n【45】The adverse-event profiles of rivaroxaban and enoxaparin were similar 删除2:<u>( Table 4 and the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u>; the most commonly reported events in both groups included nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The incidences of serious events and serious drug-related events were also similar in the two groups during treatment. There were six deaths (0.5%) during the entire study, all in the enoxaparin group. Alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated to three times the upper limit of the normal range in 20 of 1150 patients (1.7%) who were receiving rivaroxaban and in 20 of 1156 patients (1.7%) who were receiving enoxaparin; two of these patients in the rivaroxaban group also had serum bilirubin levels that were more than twice the upper limit of the normal range. In all these patients, the increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin returned to normal with continued treatment. The incidence of adverse cardiovascular events during therapy was low and was similar between the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. During the follow-up period, there were no cardiovascular events in the rivaroxaban group and seven events in six patients receiving enoxaparin.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】In this trial of thromboprophylaxis after total knee arthroplasty, we found that rivaroxaban, an orally active direct inhibitor of factor Xa, was more effective than enoxaparin in preventing venous thrombosis, with similar rates of bleeding. Rivaroxaban reduced the absolute risk of the composite of deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and death from any cause by 9.2%, and the risk of major venous thromboembolism by 1.6%, as compared with enoxaparin. The absolute risk reduction in the incidence of clinically important, symptomatic venous thromboembolic events was also greater with rivaroxaban than enoxaparin (absolute risk reduction, 1.3%). There were no pulmonary emboli or deaths in patients receiving rivaroxaban; in the enoxaparin group, four patients had a pulmonary embolus and an additional two died.\n\n【48】Rivaroxaban and enoxaparin had similar safety profiles. There were no clinically significant differences in the incidence of bleeding or other safety outcomes between the two groups. Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 0.5% of patients in the enoxaparin group. These rates are in line with the rates found in similar trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> Bleeding was defined in this trial as bleeding occurring after the intake of the first blinded dose of study medication. In the rivaroxaban group, bleeding that occurred during or shortly after surgery was included (1 major bleeding event and 10 nonmajor bleeding events), even though rivaroxaban had not been administered. This design resulted in a conservative estimate of the incidence of bleeding with rivaroxaban. Elevations of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, found in less than 2% of patients in both groups, were transient and returned to normal during treatment, as has been found in other trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-8,12</a></sup></u>\n\n【49】There is a risk of reactivation of coagulation on cessation of anticoagulant treatment, which may manifest as an increase in adverse cardiovascular events. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Such events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unexplained death) were specifically monitored and centrally adjudicated as a safety outcome. None occurred after cessation of treatment with rivaroxaban (with seven such events occurring in the enoxaparin group).\n\n【50】The strengths of this trial include the number of patients enrolled — more than in similar trials conducted with fondaparinux or ximelagatran. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11,14 </a></sup></u> The large number of nonwhite patients enrolled and the low number of excluded concomitant medications allow these findings to be applied widely. The incidence of deep-vein thrombosis in the enoxaparin group (18.2%) was consistent with the incidence in contemporary clinical trials of the direct factor Xa inhibitors razaxaban (15.9% of patients given enoxaparin) 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> and apixaban (15.6% of patients given enoxaparin). 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> The incidence of major venous thromboembolism (the composite of proximal deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death related to venous thromboembolism) among patients receiving enoxaparin was 2.2% 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> and 3.1%, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> in studies investigating dabigatran and ximelagatran, respectively, as compared with 2.6% in this trial — suggesting that enoxaparin performed well in this trial.\n\n【51】In agreement with other phase 3 studies of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, the population used for the efficacy analysis did not include patients with an inadequate venographic assessment for the presence or absence of deep-vein thrombosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> In our study, 67% of patients who underwent randomization were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. However, because the number of valid venograms was lower than expected, the steering committee (which was unaware of the treatment assignments) increased recruitment from the planned 2300 patients to more than 2500 to maintain the statistical power of the trial. To support the findings for the primary efficacy outcome, several sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure that missing data did not bias the outcome. All these analyses support the main finding of the study: a significant reduction in the incidence of the primary outcome with rivaroxaban, as compared with enoxaparin, with the exception of the most conservative assumption (i.e., that all patients with an inadequate assessment of thromboembolism were assumed to have had an event).\n\n【52】However, all patients were followed clinically and were included in the evaluation of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (see the Supplementary Appendix ). All adjudicated events — positive venograms, symptomatic events, and deaths — and all venograms that could be evaluated and that were adjudicated to show no deep-vein thrombosis were considered, irrespective of whether they occurred outside the predefined time windows. The weighted absolute risk reduction for the primary outcome with rivaroxaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was 8.9% (95% CI, 5.6 to 12.2). Moreover, when all assessments by investigators that could be evaluated (when the assessment by the central adjudication committee could not be) were also included in the analysis, the weighted absolute risk reduction was 8.1%, in favor of rivaroxaban (95% CI, 4.9 to 11.2).\n\n【53】The optimal absolute risk margin for noninferiority studies is still debated. The margin has to be viewed in relation to the expected efficacy rate in the comparison group and to the clinical implication. Given the efficacy data from the phase 2 studies of rivaroxaban and the contemporary data on the comparison group, we found that a margin of 4 percentage points was acceptable. In this study, rivaroxaban was superior to enoxaparin, making the question of noninferiority moot.\n\n【54】We conducted our trial using the enoxaparin dose and regimen (40 mg once daily) approved for use in Europe, not the regimen (30 mg twice daily) approved for use after total knee arthroplasty in the United States. However, a trial is being conducted to compare rivaroxaban with the 30-mg, twice-daily dose of enoxaparin given before surgery in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【55】In conclusion, this trial of thromboprophylaxis after total knee replacement found that rivaroxaban, an orally effective direct factor Xa inhibitor, given in a fixed, unmonitored, once-daily dose, was superior to enoxaparin in preventing venous thrombosis, with similar rates of bleeding. Rivaroxaban merits further investigation for its ability to prevent venous thrombosis.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Bayer HealthCare and Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>All the authors report receiving honoraria from Bayer HealthCare as members of the RECORD3 steering committee and consulting fees from Bayer HealthCare; Drs.

The genetic relationship of primary malignant melanoma and rhabdomyosarcoma in lymph-node metastasis was proved by the presence of identical genetic alterations (green and red bands) as seen on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (Panels A and B, white arrowheads). Small areas with rhabdoid-like features show overlapping immunoreactivity to markers of melanoma (S100 and MART1) and rhabdomyosarcoma (desmin and myogenin) (Panel C).\n\n【4】We report on the case of a 41-year-old man with a 2.1-cm primary malignant melanoma of the skin, located on the crown of the head. The tumor was stage pT4 (with invasion of contiguous structures), Clark level V, and 6 mm in thickness, with classic morphologic and immunohistochemical features, including strong positivity for the malignant melanoma–specific immunomarkers S100 and MART1 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>.\n\n【5】Three months after complete resection of the tumor, multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes developed, with the complete morphologic and immunohistochemical phenotype of a rhabdomyosarcoma, including characteristic rhabdomyoblasts that were strongly positive for desmin and myogenin and up-regulation of fetal acetylcholine receptor; the latter was shown to be specific for rhabdomyosarcoma 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. In serial sections of the primary tumor, we found small nests of rhabdomyoblasts with overlapping immunoreactivity for both melanoma and rhabdomyosarcoma markers 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>, in addition to shared genetic alterations (loss of chromosome 1q31, amplification of 1q32, and gain of 12q23-qter), which were detected with the use of comparative genomic hybridization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A and 1B )</u>.\n\n【6】In spite of intensive radiochemotherapy (56 Gy of cobalt-60 gamma rays and one cycle of dacarbazine \\[DITC\\]), the patient died from generalized spread of rhabdomyosarcoma 6 months after primary diagnosis. The metastases involved the lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs with malignant ascites.\n\n【7】In previous studies of primary and metastatic melanoma with rhabdoidlike features, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> neither the morphologic nor the genetic relationship of a primary melanoma with a rhabdoid transdifferentiation in metastasis could be demonstrated. In our patient, the primary lesion had intratumorous rhabdoidlike features and subsequent complete metastatic rhabdomyosarcomatoid transdifferentiation, as shown by morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis and comparative genomic hybridization.\n\n【8】Although the genetic pathways involved in such transdifferentiation still remain unknown, the expression of the mesenchymal and neuroectodermal stem-cell markers CD166, CD133, and nestin 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and of melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) protein 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> on differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells highlights the mesenchymal and myogenic potential of melanoma stem cells. These interactions may be a part of the genetic program that is responsible for rhabdoid transdifferentiation in malignant melanoma.\n\n【9】Moreover, since the rhabdoid phenotype is highly associated with a poor prognosis, and since neoplasms with complete rhabdomyosarcomatoid transdifferentiation are not responsive to conventional chemotherapy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> alternative treatments for these advanced-stage diseases must be considered. Such therapies could include immunotherapeutic regimens with the use of chimeric T cells or immunotoxins that target the fetal acetylcholine receptor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Stefan Gattenlöhner, M.D.  \nEva-Bettina Brocker, M.D.  \nHans-Konrad Muller-Hermelink, M.D.  \nUniversity of Würzburg, 97080 Würzburg, Germany  \nstefan.  gattenloehner@mail.  uni-wuerzburg.  de</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Supported by the Wilhelm Sander Foundation and the Help in the Fight against Cancer Foundation.</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>5 References</u>\n\n【13】参考删除-2:<u>1.  1\\.

The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure, diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury, and thereby increase the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free from mechanical ventilation).\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We randomly assigned 1000 adult patients who were anticipated to require mechanical ventilation beyond the day after recruitment in the ICU to receive conservative or usual oxygen therapy. In the two groups, the default lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp o <sub>2 </sub> ) was 90%. In the conservative-oxygen group, the upper limit of the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> alarm was set to sound when the level reached 97%, and the F io <sub>2 </sub> was decreased to 0.21 if the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> was above the acceptable lower limit. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the F io <sub>2 </sub> or the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> . The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days from randomization until day 28.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the conservative-oxygen group and the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2), respectively, for an absolute difference of −0.3 days (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −2.1 to 1.6; P=0.80). The conservative-oxygen group spent more time in the ICU with an F io <sub>2 </sub> of 0.21 than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95% CI, 22 to 34); the conservative-oxygen group spent less time with an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> exceeding 96%, with a duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95% CI, 14 to 30). At 180 days, mortality was 35.7% in the conservative-oxygen group and 34.5% in the usual-oxygen group, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.37).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In adults undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU, the use of conservative oxygen therapy, as compared with usual oxygen therapy, did not significantly affect the number of ventilator-free days.

Since supplemental oxygen is commonly used, such findings suggest that establishing regimens for limiting oxygen use could be of value. Despite this need, there is a lack of good clinically directive data regarding strategies for oxygen administration in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Accordingly, we conducted the multicenter, binational ICU-ROX (Intensive Care Unit Randomized Trial Comparing Two Approaches to Oxygen Therapy) to test the hypothesis that conservative oxygen therapy would result in more ventilator-free days than usual oxygen therapy in adults who were expected to undergo mechanical ventilation in the ICU beyond the day after recruitment.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【17】ICU-ROX was an investigator-initiated, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. The management committee designed the trial, which was endorsed by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group. The Medical Research Institute of New Zealand and the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre managed the trial and monitored the data quality. The trial began with a 100-patient pilot phase, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> which led to minor changes to the protocol for the subsequent 900 patients. (These changes are described in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) An independent data and safety monitoring committee oversaw the trial and reviewed the planned interim analyses after 100 and 500 patients had reached 28 days of follow-up. No commercial support was provided for this trial.\n\n【18】The protocol (available at NEJM.org), which was reported before enrollment had been completed, 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> was approved by the ethics committee for each participating institution. Written informed consent for enrollment or consent to continue and to use patient data was obtained from each patient or from a legal surrogate. If a patient died before providing consent, data were included if allowed by local regulations and approved by the relevant ethics committee. The members of the writing committee vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses, and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【19】Patients\n--------\n\n【20】All adults (≥18 years of age) who were expected to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU beyond the day after recruitment were eligible for inclusion in the trial. The exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Enrollment was restricted to patients who had received less than 2 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation in the ICU. Eligible patients who were not enrolled within the 2-hour time window were categorized as missed, rather than excluded, for the purposes of describing the enrollment of patients.\n\n【21】Randomization and Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【22】We randomly assigned patients to receive conservative oxygen therapy or usual oxygen therapy using a secure, centralized, Internet-based interface. The trial statistician generated the assignment sequence using computer-generated random numbers with variable-block randomization in a 1:1 ratio and stratification according to trial center.\n\n【23】In the two groups, the acceptable lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp o <sub>2 </sub> ) was monitored with an alarm set at a level of 90%. This alarm limit could be altered at the discretion of the treating clinician. If an arterial blood gas showed a Pa o <sub>2 </sub> of less than 60 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation (Sa o <sub>2 </sub> ) lower than the acceptable Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , the F io <sub>2 </sub> could be increased, regardless of the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , at the discretion of the treating clinician.\n\n【24】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Treatment Administered to Patients Receiving Conservative Oxygen Therapy or Usual Oxygen Therapy.\n\n【25】In the two groups, the acceptable lower limit for oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Sp o <sub>2 </sub> ) was monitored with an alarm set at a level of 90%. This alarm limit could be altered at the discretion of the treating clinician. If a measurement of arterial blood gas showed a partial pressure of oxygen (Pa o <sub>2 </sub> ) of less than 60 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation (Sa o <sub>2 </sub> ) lower than the acceptable Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , the fraction of inspired oxygen (F io <sub>2 </sub> ) could be increased at the discretion of the treating clinician.\n\n【26】In the conservative-oxygen group, the F io <sub>2 </sub> was decreased to 0.21 and supplemental oxygen was discontinued in patients who had been extubated if the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> was above the acceptable lower limit. In this group, we sought to minimize exposure to an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of 97% or higher by mandating the use of an alarm that was set to sound when the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> was 97% whenever supplemental oxygen was administered in the ICU. In the usual-oxygen group, there were no specific measures limiting the F io <sub>2 </sub> or the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , and use of upper alarm limits for the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> was prohibited by the protocol. In this group, the use of an F io <sub>2 </sub> of less than 0.3 during invasive ventilation was discouraged 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】In the two groups, the use of a high F io <sub>2 </sub> , regardless of the Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , was permitted in some specific circumstances (see the Supplementary Appendix ). Other aspects of care, including ventilator weaning and extubation practices, were at the discretion of the treating clinician.\n\n【28】Patients received the assigned oxygen-therapy strategy until discharge from the ICU or 28 days after randomization, whichever was earlier. The trial-group assignment was known to clinical staff members but was not disclosed to the patients or their families.\n\n【29】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【30】The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days from randomization to day 28. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> We defined ventilator-free days as the total number of calendar days or portions of calendar days of unassisted breathing during the first 28 days after randomization. All the patients who had died by day 28 were considered to have had no ventilator-free days.\n\n【31】Key secondary outcomes were death from any cause at day 90 and day 180 after randomization, the duration of survival, the proportion of patients in paid employment at baseline who were unemployed at day 180, and cognitive function and health-related quality of life at day 180. Cause-specific mortality was also recorded. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【32】Cognitive function was assessed with the use of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) questionnaire; scores on this questionnaire range from 0 to 41, with a higher number indicating a better outcome. Categories of cognitive function based on the TICS score were severe impairment (a score of ≤20), mild impairment (a score of 21 to 25), ambiguous impairment (a score of 26 to 32), and no impairment (a score of >32). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【33】The patients’ quality of life was assessed with the use of the five-level EuroQol five dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire; this scale evaluates mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety and depression, with categorization of each of these dimensions into five levels that range from no problems to extreme problems. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> For patients with acute brain disease at randomization, we used the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale to assess functional outcome at day 180; this scale ranges from 1 to 8, with a higher number indicating a better outcome. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> Centralized assessors who were unaware of trial-group assignments assessed cognitive status, quality of life, and function at day 180. Additional details regarding trial outcomes and subgroups are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【34】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【35】The statistical analysis plan was reported before the completion of enrollment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> We assumed a mean (±SD) number of 16.4±11.3 ventilator-free days in the usual-oxygen group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,17 </a></sup></u> Allowing for a 15% inflation in the sample size to account for rank-based testing 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> and an additional inflation of 80 patients to account for withdrawals and interim analyses, we determined that a sample size of 1000 patients would provide the trial with a power of 90% to detect an absolute between-group difference of 2.6 ventilator-free days at day 28 after randomization with a two-sided type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8</a></sup></u>\n\n【36】All the analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had undergone randomization with the exception of those who had withdrawn consent for the use of their data. We did not impute missing values.\n\n【37】For the primary analysis, we used a Wilcoxon rank-sum test with differences between medians calculated by means of quantile regression using a simplex algorithm, with the inversion method 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> used to calculate 95% confidence intervals after adjustment for the trial site. We also analyzed the primary end point using quantile regression after adjustment for site, age, sex, and risk of death, as assessed by means of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> and performed an unadjusted analysis.\n\n【38】We report 90-day and 180-day all-cause mortality as the proportion of patients in each treatment group, along with a risk difference and 95% confidence interval and with a corresponding odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. We compared survival times using log-rank tests and present these data as Kaplan–Meier curves and used a Cox proportional-hazards model to calculate hazard ratios for survival. (Odds ratios were calculated to describe the ratio of deaths in each treatment group and hazard ratios to describe mortality over time.)\n\n【39】For prespecified subgroups, we performed quantile regression analysis and tested for heterogeneity between subgroups in the number of ventilator-free days by fitting an interaction between treatment and subgroup. Statistical significance was indicated by a P value of 0.05 and was determined with the use of a two-sided hypothesis test. We did not correct for multiple comparisons in the evaluation of secondary or other outcomes. Thus, such results are exploratory and are reported as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals. All the analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Additional details regarding the statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【42】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Screening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\n\n【43】All the analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had undergone randomization with the exception of those who withdrew consent for the ascertainment of the primary end point. ICU-ROX denotes Intensive Care Unit Randomized Trial Comparing Two Approaches to Oxygen Therapy.Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【44】From September 2015 through May 2018, we enrolled 1000 patients in 21 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Consent was withdrawn by 35 patients, which left an intention-to-treat population of 965, with 484 assigned to the conservative-oxygen group and 481 to the usual-oxygen group. A comparison of the characteristics of the 100 patients who were enrolled in the pilot phase of the trial and the subsequent 900 patients who were enrolled is provided in Table S2; a comparison of the characteristics of the patients who were eligible for enrollment but did not undergo randomization and those who underwent randomization is provided in Table S3. Data regarding the primary outcome were available for the entire intention-to-treat population. The trial groups had similar characteristics at baseline 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Tables S4 through S7)</u>.\n\n【45】Oxygenation and Process of Care\n-------------------------------\n\n【46】Patients in the conservative-oxygen group spent more time receiving an F io <sub>2 </sub> level of 0.21 than those in the usual-oxygen group, for a median duration of 29 hours (interquartile range, 5 to 78) and 1 hour (interquartile range, 0 to 17), respectively (absolute difference, 28 hours; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 22 to 34). The conservative-oxygen group also spent less time with an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of 97% or higher than the usual-oxygen group, with a median duration of 27 hours (interquartile range, 11 to 63.5) and 49 hours (interquartile range, 22 to 112), respectively (absolute difference, 22 hours; 95% CI, 14 to 30). The number and percentage of hours with an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of less than 91% and with an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of less than 88% were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>.\n\n【47】Table 2.  Table 2. Primary Outcome and Key Secondary Outcomes and Process Measures.\n\n【48】The mean F io <sub>2 </sub> during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation in the ICU and the lowest and highest F io <sub>2 </sub> values until day 28 are provided in Figure S1. Similarly, time-weighted mean Pa o <sub>2 </sub> values during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation in the ICU and the lowest and highest Pa o <sub>2 </sub> values until day 28 are provided in Figure S2. For these sets of measures, all the F io <sub>2 </sub> and Pa o <sub>2 </sub> values were lower in the conservative-oxygen group than in the usual-oxygen group. Additional physiological descriptors and process-of-care measures are provided in Table 2 and Table S9 and Figures S3 through S6.\n\n【49】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【50】At day 28, there was no significant between-group difference in the number of ventilator-free days, with a median of 21.3 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.3) in the conservative-oxygen group and 22.1 days (interquartile range, 0 to 26.2) in the usual-oxygen group (absolute difference, −0.3 days; 95% CI, −2.1 to 1.6; P=0.80) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S7)</u>.\n\n【51】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【52】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Survival.\n\n【53】In this secondary analysis at a median of 186 days after randomization, deaths were reported for 170 of 476 patients (35.7%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 164 of 475 patients (34.5%) in the usual-oxygen group.\n\n【54】The analyses of secondary outcomes were performed a median of 186 days (interquartile range, 181 to 197 days) after randomization. By day 180, deaths were reported for 170 of 476 patients (35.7%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 164 of 475 patients (34.5%) in the usual-oxygen group (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.37; hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.30) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 3 )</u>. Data regarding cause-specific mortality in the two groups are provided in Table S10.\n\n【55】Among the survivors, we found no evidence of a between-group difference in employment status among the patients who had been receiving pay for work at baseline, with paid employment reported in 77 of 112 patients (68.8%) in the conservative-oxygen group and in 66 of 108 (61.1%) in the usual-oxygen group 删除2:<u>(Table S11)</u>. Cognitive function was similar in the two groups, with severe cognitive impairment reported in 5 of 203 patients (2.5%) in the conservative-oxygen group and in 6 of 206 (2.9%) in the usual-oxygen group 删除2:<u>(Table S12)</u>. With respect to the mobility and personal-care components of the quality-of-life assessment, the patients in the conservative-oxygen group had a greater frequency of moderate problems and a lower frequency of severe problems than those in the usual-oxygen group. We found no evidence of differences in other domains of the quality-of-life assessment 删除2:<u>(Table S13)</u>.\n\n【56】Subgroup Analysis\n-----------------\n\n【57】There was substantial heterogeneity in the effect of conservative oxygen therapy on the number of ventilator-free days in patients with suspected hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy but not in other prespecified subgroups 删除2:<u>(Table S14)</u>. At day 28, among the patients with suspected hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, the median number of ventilator-free days was 21.1 (interquartile range, 0 to 26.1) in the conservative-oxygen group and none (interquartile range, 0 to 26) in the usual-oxygen group (absolute difference, 21.1 days; 95% CI, 10.4 to 28.0). In post hoc analyses of the subgroup with suspected hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy performed at 180 days, death was reported in 37 of 86 patients (43%) in the conservative-oxygen group and in 46 of 78 (59%) in the usual-oxygen group (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.03); among these patients, an unfavorable outcome on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale was reported in 43 of 78 patients (55%) and 49 of 72 (68%), respectively (relative risk, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.05). Details regarding other post hoc analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【58】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【59】One patient in the conservative-oxygen group had hypoxemia with a Pa o <sub>2 </sub> of 33.5 mm Hg, and a second patient had a low Sp o <sub>2 </sub> but the actual value was not recorded; both of these episodes were reported as adverse events. One patient in the usual-oxygen group had an ischemic stroke that was reported as an adverse event. Details regarding adverse events are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【60】Discussion\n----------\n\n【61】In this binational, multicenter, randomized clinical trial involving adults undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU, there was no significant difference in the number of ventilator-free days between those who received conservative oxygen therapy (as implemented in our trial) and those who received usual oxygen therapy. We did not find evidence of significant between-group differences in 90-day mortality, 180-day mortality, or survival.\n\n【62】Our findings are at variance with the results of a previous single-center trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> which was stopped early after an unplanned interim analysis. In that trial, conservative oxygen therapy in the ICU was associated with a greater number of ventilator-free days and a markedly lower rate of death than usual oxygen therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> In our trial, we prohibited the use of upper-limit Sp o <sub>2 </sub> alarms in the usual-care group but did not take specific measures to target high Sp o <sub>2 </sub> values. In the previous trial, a target Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of 97 to 100% was used in the control group, and a Pa o <sub>2 </sub> value of up to 150 mm Hg was allowed. In the usual-care group in our trial, the use of an F io <sub>2 </sub> of less than 0.3 during invasive ventilation was discouraged, whereas in the previous trial, an F io <sub>2 </sub> of more than 0.4 was suggested in the control group. Despite these differences, the observed exposure to oxygen as determined by the Pa o <sub>2 </sub> level was similar in the usual-care group in our trial and in the control group in the previous trial. In addition to these differences in approach, the enrollment in our trial was much larger and thus provided more precise and robust estimates of treatment effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21</a></sup></u>\n\n【63】In our trial, there was a clear separation in oxygen exposure between the two groups. Patients in the conservative-oxygen group had a markedly lower number of hours with an Sp o <sub>2 </sub> of 97% or more and more hours breathing 0.21 oxygen than those in the usual-care group.\n\n【64】Our data are suggestive of a possible benefit of conservative oxygen therapy in patients with suspected hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy. It is biologically plausible that conservative oxygen therapy reduces the incidence of secondary brain damage after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> and observational data suggest that exposure to hyperoxemia in such patients may be harmful. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> However, these findings should be considered hypothesis-generating.\n\n【65】Our trial has several limitations. Clinicians and research staff members were necessarily aware of trial-group assignments. However, to mitigate ascertainment bias, centralized assessors conducted the evaluations at day 180 in a blinded manner. Some outcome variables (e.g., employment status) were compared only among survivors. Because survival was a post-randomization event, such data are not randomized comparisons and may be subject to bias. Some data, particularly related to quality of life and cognition, were missing. These data may not be missing at random because patients with better (or worse) outcomes might have been harder to contact or less likely to complete interviews. Despite these caveats, since problems with mobility and personal care are common after critical illnesses, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25,26 </a></sup></u> our finding that relatively fewer survivors in the conservative-oxygen group had severe problems in these domains is potentially important. We compared the characteristics of trial patients with those of eligible patients who did not undergo randomization. Eligible patients who were not enrolled in the trial had less severe illness and lower rates of death than those who were enrolled. Accordingly, our findings may not apply to patients with less severe illness. Since we did not include mandates regarding weaning or extubation in the protocol, changes in the F io <sub>2 </sub> , Sp o <sub>2 </sub> , and Pa o <sub>2 </sub> that occurred because of treatment assignment may have affected clinicians’ decisions to wean and extubate particular patients. We allowed clinicians to increase oxygen in the two groups in some specific circumstances. This factor may have exposed patients in the two groups to hyperoxemia and thereby reduced our ability to detect a between-group difference in outcomes.\n\n【66】In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> investigators found that a conservative oxygen strategy was associated with a lower rate of death in acutely ill adults than a liberal oxygen strategy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> In the trials that were included in this meta-analysis, many of the liberal oxygen interventions were considerably more liberal than the oxygen regimen used in our usual-care group, and relatively few of the patients were critically ill. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Our trial does not preclude the possibility of benefit or harm with more liberal oxygen regimens than those used in our usual-oxygen group. Different results may also be found with different regimens for conservative oxygen therapy. Our findings decrease the probability that the use of our protocol for conservative oxygen therapy in this population would result in markedly lower mortality than the use of usual oxygen therapy. However, the confidence intervals around our mortality estimates are sufficiently wide that we cannot rule out important effects of our conservative oxygen regimen on mortality.\n\n【67】In conclusion, during the first 28 days in the ICU, conservative oxygen therapy, as compared with usual oxygen therapy, did not significantly affect the number of ventilator-free days among adults undergoing mechanical ventilation.\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Health Research Council of New Zealand .</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Beasley reports receiving grant support from Fisher and Paykel Healthcare; and Dr. Freebairn, receiving travel support from Hamilton Medical and IMT (Bellavista).

The same deficiency affected the patient's mother and 15 other relatives. The deficiency was shown to involve a dysfunction of the fifth component of complement (C5) by the fact that the phagocytosis-enhancing activity of the mother's serum was restored to normal by the addition of highly purified C5. Also, serum from mice with a genetic deficiency of C5 indicated poor enhancement of phagocytosis, and the addition of highly purified C5 to the Co-deficient mouse serum restored phagocytosis-enhancing activity. Finally, the addition of C5-deficient mouse serum to the mother's serum failed to improve the phagocytosis-enhancing effect of the maternal serum, whereas the addition of small amounts of normal mouse serum did.\n\n【2】In view of the patient's clinical susceptibility to primarily gram-negative bacteria, the in vitro dysfunction of C5 may be related to impaired in vivo inactivation of such organisms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 \\[95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42\\]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient.

Among contacts of persons with Covid-19, the percentage in whom new cases develop (secondary attack rate) has been estimated at 10 to 15%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-4 </a></sup></u> The current infection-control strategy is based on nonpharmacologic interventions, including hand hygiene, use of face masks, social distancing, and isolation of case patients and contacts. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> The effectiveness of isolation depends on the promptness of the intervention, the level of contact tracing, and the level of isolation adherence. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Unfortunately, real-world constraints for implementing full effective measures have resulted in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in many countries.\n\n【12】Postexposure prophylaxis of healthy contacts is among the measures used for outbreak control of several infectious diseases (e.g., pandemic influenza). 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> No agent is known to be effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19, but two aminoquinolines — hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine — are among the drugs that have shown antiviral activity in the laboratory. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> In vitro results showed that these drugs blocked SARS-CoV-2 viral spread in cell cultures 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-11 </a></sup></u> and that hydroxychloroquine was more effective at impairing SARS-CoV-2 viral replication than chloroquine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> The results of one randomized, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine for postexposure prophylaxis of Covid-19 have been reported. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> However, concerns have been raised about the trial design. Of the participants with confirmed or probable Covid-19 (primary outcome), fewer than 20% had a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for SARS-COV-2; the rest received a diagnosis on the basis of symptoms alone.\n\n【13】In the Barcelona Postexposure Prophylaxis Study against SARS-CoV-2 (BCN-PEP-CoV2), we investigated the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine to prevent secondary PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in contacts exposed to a PCR-positive case patient with Covid-19 during the early stages of the outbreak in Catalonia, the region with the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in Spain. (Even when not specified, symptomatic Covid-19 hereafter refers to PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19.)\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Participants\n------------\n\n【16】We included asymptomatic adults (≥18 years of age) who had a recent history of close-contact exposure to a PCR-confirmed case patient with Covid-19 (i.e., >15 minutes within 2 m, up to 7 days before enrollment), who had no Covid-19–like symptoms during the 2 weeks before enrollment, and who had an increased risk of infection (e.g., a health care worker, a household contact, a nursing-home worker, or a nursing-home resident). Trial candidates were tested by PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. We included candidates with either a negative or positive PCR test at baseline to assess the prophylactic and preemptive effect of hydroxychloroquine treatment, respectively. All eligibility criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix and the trial protocol , both available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】This was an open-label, phase 3, cluster-randomized trial conducted from March 17 to April 28, 2020, during the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, in three of nine health administrative regions in Catalonia, Spain (total target population, 4,206,440) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Trial candidates were screened with the use of the electronic registry of the national health information system. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】The trial was supported by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono ( www.yomecorono.com . opens in new tab ), Generalitat de Catalunya, Zurich Seguros, Synlab Diagnósticos, Laboratorios Rubió, and Laboratorios Gebro Pharma. Laboratorios Rubió donated and supplied the hydroxychloroquine (Dolquine). The sponsors had no role in the conduct of the trial, the analysis, or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The trial protocol and subsequent amendments were approved by the institutional review board at Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol and the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices. All the participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【20】Trial Procedures\n----------------\n\n【21】We defined trial clusters (called rings) of healthy persons (contacts) who were epidemiologically linked to a PCR-positive case patient with Covid-19 (index case patient). All the contacts in a ring simultaneously underwent cluster randomization (in a 1:1 ratio) to either the hydroxychloroquine group or the usual-care group. Contacts in the former group received hydroxychloroquine (Dolquine) at a dose of 800 mg on day 1, followed by 400 mg once daily for 6 days; the dosing regimen was based on pharmacokinetic simulations. Contacts in the usual-care group received no specific therapy. After cluster randomization, we verified the selection criteria of individual candidates, obtained informed consent, and revealed the trial-group assignments. In accordance with national guidelines, all the contacts were quarantined.\n\n【22】All the contacts were visited at home or in the workplace on day 1 (enrollment) and day 14 (final outcome measurement) for assessment of health status and collection of nasopharyngeal swabs. Symptoms were monitored by telephone on days 3 and 7. Contacts in whom symptoms developed at any time point were visited at home within 24 hours for assessment of health status and collection of nasopharyngeal swabs. Safety (i.e., frequency and severity of adverse events), medication adherence (i.e., treatment and number of doses taken), and crossover (i.e., unplanned conversion from usual care to hydroxychloroquine) were assessed with the use of contact reports collected in telephone interviews on days 3, 7, and 28.\n\n【23】All testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and analyses to determine viral load were performed by technicians who were unaware of previous PCR results, trial-group assignments, and response. PCR amplification was based on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT \\[reverse transcriptase\\]–PCR Diagnostic Panel guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> For quantification, a standard curve was built with the use of 1:5 serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 plasmid (with known concentration) and run in parallel with 300 study samples. The accuracy of the qualitative estimate (i.e., cycle threshold \\[Ct\\] values) was determined by correlation with the quantitative measure on 300 samples (Fig. S2). The coefficient of correlation between the two methods was 0.93, which permitted the use of qualitative Ct data to estimate viral load in contacts. Detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed by means of fingertip blood testing on the day 14 visit with the use of a rapid test (VivaDiag COVID-19). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【25】The primary outcome was the onset of a PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 episode, defined as symptomatic illness (at least one of the following symptoms: fever, cough, difficulty breathing, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory or taste disorder, or diarrhea) and a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was assessed in all asymptomatic contacts, irrespective of the baseline PCR result; in a post hoc analysis, we explored the outcome separately in contacts with a positive baseline PCR test and those with a negative baseline PCR test. The time until the primary event was defined as the number of days until the onset of symptomatic illness from the date of exposure and from the date of randomization.\n\n【26】The secondary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as either the RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal specimen or the presence of any of the aforementioned symptoms compatible with Covid-19. The rationale for this outcome was to encompass definitions of Covid-19 used elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,16 </a></sup></u> Contacts who were hospitalized or who died and whose hospital and vital records listed Covid-19 as the main diagnosis (including PCR confirmation) were also considered for the primary and secondary outcomes.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】With an enrollment target of 95 clusters per trial group 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> ― 15 contacts per cluster and intraclass correlation of 1.0 ― the initial design provided a power of 90% to detect a between-group difference of 10 percentage points in the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19, with an expected incidence of 5% in the hydroxychloroquine group and 15% in the usual-care group. Owing to the limited information available by March 2020 regarding the cluster size and the incidence of Covid-19 after exposure, the protocol prespecified a sample-size reestimation at the interim analysis. Reestimation was aimed at maintaining the ability (at 80% power) to detect a between-group difference of 3.5 percentage points in the incidence of primary-outcome events (3.0% in the hydroxychloroquine group and 6.5% in the usual-care group), yielding 320 clusters per trial group with 3.5 contacts per cluster, an intraclass correlation of 1.0, and no provision for crossover.\n\n【29】The primary efficacy analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population. Multiple imputation by chained equations was applied to account for missing data. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18,19 </a></sup></u> The assumption that unobserved values were missing at random was deemed to be appropriate because we could not find any pattern among the missing values. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> A complete-case analysis and a per-protocol analysis were conducted as sensitivity analyses. The cumulative incidence of trial outcomes was compared at the individual level with the use of a binomial regression model with robust sandwich standard errors to account for grouping within clusters. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> We defined a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and a log-link function to estimate the risk ratio as a measure of effect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> The analyses were adjusted for the baseline variables of age, sex, geographic region, and time of exposure. We performed additional prespecified analyses to assess the consistency of treatment effects in subgroups defined according to the viral load of the contact at baseline, viral load of the index case patient, place of exposure, and time of exposure to the index case patient. The reported confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons and cannot be used to infer effects. Survival curves according to trial group for time-to-event outcomes were compared with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards model with a cluster-level frailty term to adjust for clustering. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> The significance threshold was set at a two-sided alpha value of 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. All statistical analyses were conducted with R software, version 3.6.2. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Characteristics of the Trial Participants\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening and Randomization.\n\n【33】The safety population (2497 contacts; 1197 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 1300 in the usual-care group) included all those in the intention-to-treat population (except 28 in the hydroxychloroquine group who did not receive the trial medication) plus 40 (19 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 21 in the usual-care group) who were classified as having a screening failure. The intention-to-treat population (2485 contacts; 1206 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 1279 in the usual-care group) included 2314 who had data available for analysis of the primary outcome plus 171 (90 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 81 in the usual-care group) with no available polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay results at day 14 who had missing responses imputed.\n\n【34】Between March 17 and April 28, 2020, we assessed 754 index case patients with Covid-19 for eligibility; 672 of them were selected for defining the corresponding clusters, which included 4399 contacts 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. A total of 1874 contacts (42.6%) were not enrolled because they met exclusion criteria, including having Covid-19–like symptoms before enrollment (537 contacts). In addition, 40 of 2525 enrolled contacts (1.6%) were excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis because of screening failure, which resulted in an intention-to-treat population of 2485, of whom 171 (6.9%) had missing data imputed on outcome analysis. During follow-up, 64 contacts had a protocol deviation regarding the intervention 删除4:<u>(per-protocol population of 2250 contacts)</u>.\n\n【35】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Contacts and Their Clusters at Baseline.\n\n【36】The demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of the contacts at baseline were similar in the two trial groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The mean (±SD) age of the contacts was 48.6±19.0 years, and the PCR test at baseline was negative in 87.8% 删除4:<u>(2000 of 2279)</u>. Overall, 39.4% of the contacts 删除4:<u>(912 of 2314)</u> reported at least one chronic health condition. The median interval from exposure to enrollment was 4.0 days (interquartile range, 3.0 to 6.0). The size of the clusters was similar in the two groups (median, 2.0 contacts in the hydroxychloroquine group and 2.0 in the usual-care group). Exposure was predominantly from an index case patient with a moderate-to-high viral load (10 删除3:<u><sup>7 </sup></u> to 10 删除3:<u><sup>12 </sup></u> copies per milliliter), which was reported in 307 of 549 index case patients (55.9%) for whom viral-load data were available. Health care workers and nursing home workers accounted for 1395 of 2314 contacts (60.3%); 626 (27.1%) were household contacts, and 293 (12.7%) were nursing home residents. Overall, 1555 contacts (67.2%) reported routine use of masks at the time of exposure, and 144 contacts (6.2%) continued to sleep in the same room as the index case patient.\n\n【37】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes.\n\n【39】During the 14-day follow-up, 138 of 2314 contacts (6.0%) had a PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 episode. The results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine group 删除4:<u>(64 of 1116; 5.7%)</u> and the usual-care group 删除4:<u>(74 of 1198; 6.2%)</u> (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.52 to 1.42) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>, with the use of multiple-imputation techniques to account for 171 missing values. The complete-case analysis 删除2:<u>(Table S1)</u> and per-protocol analysis 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u> showed results that were similar to those in the primary analysis. The incidence of each of the components of the primary outcome did not differ substantially between the groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】Overall, the incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 was higher among contacts who had a positive PCR test at baseline than among those who had a negative test (20.4% \\[64 of 314 contacts\\] vs. 3.7% \\[74 of 2000\\]) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 both in contacts with a positive PCR test at baseline and in those with a negative test.\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Outcome, According to Epidemiologic Risk Factors (Intention-to-Treat Population).\n\n【42】The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 within 14 days.\n\n【43】We observed an overall increased risk of symptomatic Covid-19 with increasing viral load of the contact at baseline (Fig. S3A) and increasing viral load of the index case patient (Fig. S3B). The viral load of contacts who went on to have symptomatic Covid-19 increased 4 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per milliliter throughout the follow-up, whereas that of contacts without Covid-19 remained unchanged (Fig. S3C). Prespecified subgroup analysis of the primary outcome did not reveal substantial between-group differences in the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 according to the viral load of the contact at baseline, the viral load of the index case patient, the duration of exposure, or the type of contact 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The survival analysis of the time to a primary-outcome event showed similar patterns in the two groups regarding symptomatic Covid-19 onset from enrollment (median, 4.0 days in the hydroxychloroquine group and 5.0 days in the usual-care group; hazard ratio, 0.9 \\[95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5\\]) and from exposure (median, 8.0 days and 8.0 days in the respective groups; hazard ratio, 1.0 \\[95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6\\]) (Fig. S4).\n\n【44】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【45】Of the 2000 contacts who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the baseline PCR test, 364 (18.2%) either became PCR-positive or had symptoms compatible with Covid-19 during the follow-up period 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>, without a substantial difference between the trial groups (18.7% \\[179 of 958\\] with hydroxychloroquine and 17.8% \\[185 of 1042\\] with usual care; risk ratio, 1.03 \\[95% CI, 0.77 to 1.38\\]). Positivity for virus-specific IgG or IgM antibodies was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group 删除4:<u>(14.3% \\[137 of 958\\] vs. 8.7% \\[91 of 1042\\])</u>. Of 125 contacts who became PCR-positive during follow-up, 30 (24.0%) were seropositive on day 14 (Fig. S5).\n\n【46】Adherence and Safety\n--------------------\n\n【47】Table 3.  Table 3. Adverse Events (Safety Population).\n\n【48】Full adherence to the trial intervention was 95.1% 删除4:<u>(1138 of 1197)</u> in the hydroxychloroquine group and 97.5% 删除4:<u>(1268 of 1300)</u> in the usual-care group. In the safety population, 671 of 1197 contacts (56.1%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 77 of 1300 (5.9%) in the usual-care group had at least one adverse event during 14 days of follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events among contacts given hydroxychloroquine were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain) and nervous system disorders (drowsiness and headache) 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. A total of 31 serious adverse events were reported, 14 in the hydroxychloroquine group and 17 in the usual-care group; none of these events were thought to be related to hydroxychloroquine or usual care by the independent pharmacovigilance consultants 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. Six adverse events of special interest were observed, including five episodes of self-limited heart palpitations potentially related to hydroxychloroquine 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>. Further safety data are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In our trial, postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in asymptomatic contacts exposed to a PCR-positive index case patient. The overall attack rate for PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 was 6.0%, excluding contacts who were not enrolled because they had symptoms before the baseline assessment. Contacts who received hydroxychloroquine and those who received usual care had a similar incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively). Our trial tested two possible effects of postexposure therapy: prophylaxis in contacts with a negative PCR test at baseline and preemptive therapy in contacts with a positive PCR test at baseline (i.e., to prevent progression of asymptomatic infection to disease). This dual scenario mirrors a real-life setting, in which the PCR result of contacts exposed to a known Covid-19 index case is usually not immediately available. Hydroxychloroquine showed no efficacy as prophylactic therapy for contacts who were PCR-negative at baseline. Similarly, among the contacts who were PCR-positive at baseline (13.6%), hydroxychloroquine had no apparent efficacy as early preemptive therapy. A baseline positive PCR test increased the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 in our cohort, but a high percentage of the contacts with this laboratory result (79.6%) did not go on to have symptomatic disease, thus reinforcing the need to quarantine or to increase testing of contacts even if they are asymptomatic. In addition, of importance to public health decision making is that the higher the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an index case patient was, the greater was the risk of transmission to contacts.\n\n【51】Hydroxychloroquine also did not reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (18.7%, as compared with 17.8% with usual care) or the incidence of seropositivity. It is notable that the overlap of a positive PCR test and a positive serologic test was low, which could be related to the reported low sensitivity of the rapid test for IgM and IgG antibodies within 10 days after symptom onset, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> the low incidence of seroconversion among asymptomatic contacts, 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> or the higher risk of a false negative PCR result during the initial stage of infection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> With respect to safety, we observed a higher incidence of adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group, albeit with low severity. In this open-label trial, the psychological components in the treated group cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, whereas only 5 of 1479 events (0.3%) in the hydroxychloroquine group were considered to be heart-related; therefore, our data do not corroborate previously published data on the increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> The safety results need to be interpreted on the basis of the dose used, length of treatment, and lack of electrocardiographic monitoring in the trial.\n\n【52】The strengths of this trial are the use of a PCR test and viral-load quantification at baseline, at day 14, and potentially when the contact was ill, and the measurement of viral load of the index case patient to estimate the risk of transmission. In addition, we included very elderly persons (e.g., >90 years of age) in nursing homes. The trial has some limitations. Unlike the common procedure in clinical trials, the signing of the informed-consent form took place after cluster randomization. Nevertheless, trial-group assignments were revealed to contacts after consent was obtained; therefore, we believe that the strategy for concealing trial-group assignments was appropriate to prevent contacts from choosing to participate or not to participate. Because of the urgency of the pandemic, we did not include a placebo group in the trial, which may have affected the reporting of adverse events. However, the laboratory staff who performed PCR tests remained unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【53】Despite the promising in vitro results that placed hydroxychloroquine among the leading candidates for Covid-19 treatment and prophylaxis, 删除3:<u><sup><a>27-29 </a></sup></u> there are no compelling data to suggest that hydroxychloroquine is effective. We provide evidence on the lack of efficacy of postexposure prophylaxis therapy with hydroxychloroquine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19.\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono ( www.yomecorono.com/ . opens in new tab ), Generalitat de Catalunya , Zurich Seguros , Synlab Diagnósticos , Laboratorios Rubió , and Laboratorios Gebro Pharma .

All 13 patients had histologically confirmed metastatic carcinoid disease. In seven patients the primary carcinoid tumor, which was in the gut in all seven, had been removed. The results of the scanning procedure in one of these patients have been described elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> In addition, we studied nine patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors (four men and five women; mean age, 62 years \\[range, 45 to 81\\]). In all nine patients the diagnosis was histologically confirmed after the removal of the primary tumor; in seven of them preoperative hormonal examinations suggested the presence of the tumor. In both the patients with metastatic carcinoid disease and those with pancreatic endocrine tumors, the spread of the disease had been investigated by CT scanning of the abdomen and ultrasonography. In five of the patients the results of scanning with 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide have been described elsewhere. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Twenty patients with paragangliomas (10 men and 10 women; mean age, 51 years \\[range, 16 to 83\\]) were also studied. In all of them the presence of at least one paraganglioma was suspected, because of earlier arteriography. AH the patients gave informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital.\n\n【14】Materials\n---------\n\n【15】The somatostatin analogues octreotide (Sandostatin, SMS 201–995) and Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide (204–090) were obtained from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland). The Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide was labeled with 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I with use of chloramine-T. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> As a final preparatory step the radiopharmaceutical agent was passed through a low protein—binding 0.22-μm Millex-GV filter (Millipore, Milford, Mass.) in order to sterilize it. Depending on the results of the labeling procedure, the interval between injection and scintigraphy, and whether single-photon-emission CT (SPECT) was also performed, the doses of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide ranged from 37 to 555 MBq, given as a bolus intravenous injection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> There were no side effects of the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide.\n\n【16】Scanning\n--------\n\n【17】Planar and SPECT images were obtained with a large-field-of-view gamma camera 删除4:<u>(Counterbalance 3700, Siemens Gammasonics, Erlangen, Germany)</u> equipped with a 190-KeV parallel-hole collimator. Generally, the field of view when the Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide was injected covered the abdomen and some of the thorax. Starting at the time of the injection, digital images were recorded with a Gamma-II computer (Nuclear Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden) every 3 seconds for 2 minutes, then every 60 seconds for 28 minutes. In this 30-minute period analogue images were also obtained regularly. Thirty minutes after the injection, the patients underwent anterior and posterior whole-body static scintigraphy and, if indicated, SPECT. Static images, both analogue and digital, were obtained about 30 minutes and 2, 4, 24, and sometimes 48 hours after injection. Subtraction scintigraphy with albumin microcolloid labeled with technetium-99m (56 MBq; Albu-Res, Solco, Birsfelden, Switzerland) was performed in normal liver tissue.\n\n【18】We used a simple yes-or-no system to define the tumors as visualized during this scanning procedure, but always at a time when the surrounding organs were virtually devoid of radioactivity. Depending on the type and location of the tumor we chose different standard times and techniques of visualization. The best time for obtaining optimal gamma-camera pictures, as well as SPECT scans, is discussed below.\n\n【19】Results\n-------\n\n【20】Patients with Carcinoid Tumors\n------------------------------\n\n【21】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Primary Tumor and Metastases in a Patient with Metastatic Carcinoid Disease.\n\n【22】Panel A shows a gamma-camera picture of the liver 24 hours after the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide. Note the tumor deposits positive for somatostatin receptors, mainly in the right lobe of the liver. Panel B shows a <sup>99m </sup> Tc-labeled colloid scan of the liver in the same patient 20 minutes after injection. Most of the left lobe appears intact, whereas the liver tissue containing tumor is not visualized. Note the enlargement of the liver in both scans. Panel C shows carcinoid metastases in a supraclavicular lymph node on the left side (SC), in the retromediastinum (RM), and in the pleura (P) 30 minutes after the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide (anterior view) (×2).\n\n【23】Among the patients with metastatic carcinoid disease, 10 had undergone surgery and in 7 the primary carcinoid tumor had been removed. In the six whose primary carcinoid tumors had not been removed, the tumor was visualized; in all six the primary tumor was located in the small intestine. In 11 of the 13 patients liver metastases were detected; in 1 patient only peritoneal metastases were visualized, and in 1 no uptake of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide was seen. The best gamma-camera pictures showing the metastases were obtained within 2 minutes after the injection of the isotope (when normal liver tissue had not yet been fully visualized) or after 24 to 48 hours (when the normal liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts no longer contained appreciable amounts of radioactivity). The 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide liver scan and the <sup>99m </sup> Tc-labeled colloid scan of one of these patients are shown in Figures 1 A and 1 B. The tumor tissue visualized in the Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide scan was localized mainly in the right lobe of the liver ( Fig. 1 A), whereas the <sup>99m </sup> Tc-labeled colloid was localized mainly in the left lobe ( Fig. 1 B). The two scans show a greatly enlarged liver. Extrahepatic metastases ( Fig. 1 C) were found in lymph nodes on the left side of the neck in seven patients, and in bone (ribs, vertebrae, skull, or pelvis) in eight; in five there was evidence of peritoneal or intraabdominal metastases (or both). None of the 13 patients were known on the basis of symptoms, physical examination, or other imaging studies to have such extensive disease. In particular, the lymph nodes containing tumor in the left side of the neck had been detected on physical examination in only two of the patients who had abnormal scans in this region, but they were palpated in three other patients after the results of the Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide scan were known. In the first four patients studied, the presence of carcinoid-tumor tissue in the lymph nodes in the neck, liver, or both and in the peritoneum was confirmed by needle biopsy. The one patient with no abnormality on the Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide scan had extensive carcinoid tumor in the liver, abdomen, and thorax.\n\n【24】All 13 patients were subsequently treated with octreotide, given subcutaneously in divided doses varying from 150 to 600 μg per day. In 10 of the 11 patients who had episodes of flushing, the number per day decreased by 50 percent or more; in 8 of the 9 who had diarrhea, it decreased by 50 percent or more; and in all 4 with abdominal or bone pain (or both) the pain virtually disappeared. After three days of octreotide therapy, urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid decreased by 22 to 85 percent (mean, 36) in the six patients in whom it was measured. The patient whose carcinoid tumor was not visualized with 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide had no decrease in flushing episodes and diarrhea during two weeks of therapy with octreotide in doses of up to 1500 μg per day.\n\n【25】Patients with Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【26】In seven patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors, the primary tumors were visualized after the injection of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide. Three patients had gastrinomas, two insulinomas, one a somatostatinoma, and one an undifferentiated endocrine pancreatic tumor. The size of the primary tumors in these patients ranged from 2 to 14 cm in diameter. Metastases were visualized in four of the seven patients. In none of these four patients had the metastases (in lymph nodes in the neck in two, bone in one, and liver in two) been detected earlier. In five patients a single subcutaneous dose of 50 μg of octreotide substantially decreased the secretion of hormone by the tumor from two to six hours after administration. In the patient with an undifferentiated endocrine pancreatic tumor in whom no hormonal hypersecretion was detected, long-term therapy with octreotide (300 μg a day for six months) resulted in a decrease in upper abdominal pain, but no change in tumor size as evaluated by CT scanning. In four of the patients with positive scans, in vitro autoradiography confirmed the presence of large numbers of high-affinity 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide binding sites. In two patients the tumors were not visualized after the administration of Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide. Both patients had an insulinoma, and neither tumor bound any 删除3:<u><sup>125 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide in vitro.\n\n【27】Patients with Paragangliomas\n----------------------------\n\n【28】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Gamma-Camera Picture Four Hours after the Administration of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-Labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-Octreotide in a Patient with Multiple Paragangliomas, Showing Bilateral Carotid Paragangliomas and One Vagal Paraganglioma (Anterior View).\n\n【29】In all 20 patients with paragangliomas, the tumors were visualized after the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide. Ten of the 11 temporal tumors (tympanic or jugular), 9 of the 10 carotid tumors, and all 10 vagal tumors were visualized ( Fig. 2 ). Two tumors were not visualized in these 20 patients; one patient had a small (less than 5 mm) tympanic-nerve paraganglioma, and another patient had a small (3 mm) carotid tumor. Eight patients had more than one tumor deposit. The smallest tumors visualized were about 1 cm in diameter. The specificity of our findings was confirmed by pathological examination of the tumors in 15 patients and by arteriography, CT, or both in the other 5.\n\n【30】Discussion\n----------\n\n【31】Octreotide is currently used to treat patients with metastatic carcinoid and pancreatic endocrine tumors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Its administration results in a remarkable improvement in the clinical condition of most patients, mainly through the suppression of hormonal hypersecretion. We have previously found that most such tumors, especially those in patients with a good response to octreotide therapy, contain large numbers of octreotide receptors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> The relative affinity of the somatostatin receptors on most human tumors for natural somatostatin-14, its precursor somatostatin-28, and Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide varies; in most instances the affinity for Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide is slightly higher than that for somatostatin-14 or somatostatin-28. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【32】In 12 of 13 patients with metastatic carcinoid disease and in 7 of 9 patients with pancreatic endocrine tumors, the in vivo imaging procedure using 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide provided information concerning the localization of the primary tumors, the secondary spread of the disease, or both. Virtually all the patients had previously undetected metastases. The identification of tumor tissue in lymph nodes on the left side of the neck in seven patients with carcinoid tumors and two with endocrine pancreatic tumors underlines the value of a thorough examination in such patients. In one patient with carcinoid disease in whom the scan was negative, long-term octreotide therapy had no beneficial clinical effect, suggesting that the patient's tumor had no receptors. Similarly, no receptors could be detected on the insulinoma tissue of the two patients in whom the in vivo scan was negative.\n\n【33】The 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide imaging technique was also used successfully in the localization of paragangliomas. Such tumors are often difficult to localize, and in most patients arteriography is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Of considerable importance was the localization of multiple paragangliomas in eight patients.\n\n【34】We found that tumors in the abdomen were well visualized within 30 minutes after the administration of the isotope, before the surrounding background activity in the liver, biliary tract, and gastrointestinal tract was so considerable that it became difficult to distinguish between tumor and physiologic uptake. Additional scans were possible 24 hours later, when the organs again contained little radioactivity. SPECT proved to be of great value in localizing the site of Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide uptake in tumors, especially when the tumors were located close to sites with physiologic uptake of radioactivity. Tumors positive for somatostatin receptors in the chest, neck, and skull, however, can be readily visualized at any time 30 to 240 minutes after the administration of the isotope because the background level of radioactivity is very low by that time.\n\n【35】We did not correlate the degree of radionuclide uptake in these tumors with the extent of the biochemical response or the clinical responsiveness to short-term or long-term octreotide. Uptake of 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide was found, however, in all tumors with a clinical or biochemical response to a single dose of octreotide or to long-term administration. Thus, 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide imaging may be useful in predicting responsiveness to octreotide therapy.\n\n【36】We conclude that 删除3:<u><sup>123 </sup></u> I-labeled Tyr 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> \\-octreotide imaging is a quick and safe way to identify tumors that have somatostatin receptors, and tumors as small as 1 cm in diameter (e.g., paragangliomas) can be detected. We found this technique to be valuable in locating not only primary but also secondary deposits of these tumors, which may be very difficult to localize with current diagnostic techniques. Although these results are encouraging, the sensitivity and specificity of this scanning procedure in the localization of such tumors must be confirmed by studies of larger numbers of patients.\n\n【37】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【38】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Dutch Cancer Foundation and a special grant from the University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam.</u>\n\n【39】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【40】参考删除-1:<u>From the Departments of Medicine (S.W.J.L, E.P.K.) and Nuclear Medicine (W.H.B, E.P.K.), Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and Sandoz Research Institute, Bern, Switzerland (J.-C.R.).

The management of coronary-artery rupture is becoming an increasingly important issue in interventional cardiology as high-pressure balloon inflation is advocated to ensure maximal expansion and optimal deployment of a coronary stent, thereby minimizing the risk of subsequent tissue proliferation within the stent and restenosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】There are few reports of percutaneous techniques that have been used successfully to treat this complication. These techniques include vessel occlusion by microcoil and spring embolization and the use of stents covered with vascular graft or synthetic material to seal the rupture site. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> The recently introduced Jostent consists of two coaxially aligned stainless-steel stents welded at both ends with a sleeve-like polytetrafluoroethylene membrane sandwiched between the two along their entire length.\n\n【4】Figure 1.

We performed angioplasty of the right coronary artery through the right femoral artery, with 10,000 units of heparin given at the outset, which is our standard practice. The occlusion was crossed with a guide wire, and a 24-by-3.0-mm stent was deployed at an inflation pressure of 12 atmospheres, with an additional, 30-by-3.5-mm, stent placed proximally at an inflation pressure of 14 atmospheres. On angiographic assessment, the proximal stent appeared to be underdeployed and was reinflated to 20 atmospheres. At this point, there was evidence of extravasation of contrast material, which was followed by a major coronary rupture 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. An occlusive balloon was immediately inflated at the point of leakage, and a 16-by-3.5-mm polytetrafluoroethylene-coated Jostent was then deployed to seal the rupture 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>. There was a small pericardial effusion but no evidence of tamponade on transthoracic echocardiography, and it was not necessary to reverse the effect of heparin with protamine after the procedure. Despite a moderate elevation of the creatine kinase level, to 188 U per liter, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home four days later.\n\n【7】The polytetrafluoroethylene-coated stent provided a safe and effective means of sealing a major coronary-artery rupture and avoiding cardiac surgery.

Assessing 24-hour urinary excretion over a period of multiple days is considered to be an accurate method.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We included individual-participant data from six prospective cohorts of generally healthy adults; sodium and potassium excretion was assessed with the use of at least two 24-hour urine samples per participant. The primary outcome was a cardiovascular event (coronary revascularization or fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke). We analyzed each cohort using consistent methods and combined the results using a random-effects meta-analysis.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among 10,709 participants, who had a mean (±SD) age of 51.5±12.6 years and of whom 54.2% were women, 571 cardiovascular events were ascertained during a median study follow-up of 8.8 years 删除4:<u>(incidence rate, 5.9 per 1000 person-years)</u>. The median 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 3270 mg 删除4:<u>(10th to 90th percentile, 2099 to 4899)</u>. Higher sodium excretion, lower potassium excretion, and a higher sodium-to-potassium ratio were all associated with a higher cardiovascular risk in analyses that were controlled for confounding factors (P≤0.005 for all comparisons). In analyses that compared quartile 4 of the urinary biomarker (highest) with quartile 1 (lowest), the hazard ratios were 1.60 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.19 to 2.14) for sodium excretion, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.91) for potassium excretion, and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.25 to 2.10) for the sodium-to-potassium ratio. Each daily increment of 1000 mg in sodium excretion was associated with an 18% increase in cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.29), and each daily increment of 1000 mg in potassium excretion was associated with an 18% decrease in risk (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Higher sodium and lower potassium intakes, as measured in multiple 24-hour urine samples, were associated in a dose–response manner with a higher cardiovascular risk. These findings may support reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake from current levels. (Funded by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health.)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】High sodium consumption, a major cause of hypertension, is considered to be a leading dietary risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Population-wide reduction in sodium intake has been suggested as a cost-effective strategy to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> However, several cohort studies have linked both estimated lower (e.g., <3000 mg per day) and higher (e.g., >6000 mg per day) sodium intakes, assessed mainly with the use of spot urine samples, to increased cardiovascular risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8 </a></sup></u> Methodologic limitations, including inaccurate estimates of individual sodium intakes and reverse causation related to coexisting conditions or changes in health status, may play a major part in these controversial findings. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Accumulating evidence suggests that daily sodium intake as estimated from spot urine samples leads to a spuriously increased cardiovascular risk at lower estimated sodium intake levels because of inherent systematic error in the estimation formulas and is also subject to substantial random error. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-11 </a></sup></u> Furthermore, a single 24-hour urine sample is not sufficiently representative of a participant’s usual sodium intake owing to the large day-to-day variations in sodium intake. In addition, participants may reduce sodium intake because of preexisting illness or frail status preceding major diseases and still be at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, resulting in a spurious association between low sodium intake and increased disease risk (i.e., reverse causation). 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Given the interrelationship of sodium and potassium, it is also important to consider their associations jointly. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> We investigated the relation between sodium and potassium intakes and cardiovascular risk by combining individual-level data from studies in healthy populations in which multiple 24-hour urine samples, the most accurate method for assessing sodium intake, were obtained for each participant.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【15】This study combined individual data from six cohorts: the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study, and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP I and TOHP II) Follow-up Studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13-18 </a></sup></u> More details on the study design are provided in Sections S1 and S2 and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【16】The HPFS, NHS, and NHS II are ongoing prospective cohort studies involving health professionals and registered nurses in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> A subgroup of 2282 participants collected two 24-hour urine samples between 2003 and 2007, and an additional subgroup of 1217 participants collected four 24-hour urine samples between 2010 and 2013. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> The occurrence of cardiovascular disease was tracked through January 2016 in the HPFS and through June 2017 in the NHS and NHS II; death was tracked through June 2020.\n\n【17】The PREVEND study was a prospective, population-based cohort of 8592 adults, in which participants collected two consecutive 24-hour urine samples between 1997 and 1998 and another two consecutive 24-hour urine samples between 2001 and 2003. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> The occurrences of cardiovascular events and death during the study were tracked through January 2011 and January 2017, respectively. Our study excluded 1908 participants in the PREVEND study who had preexisting chronic kidney disease.\n\n【18】The TOHP Follow-up Studies are observational follow-up extensions of TOHP I and TOHP II, in which the effects of dietary supplements and lifestyle interventions, including weight loss and reduction in sodium intake, were evaluated among 2182 participants in TOHP I and among 2382 participants in TOHP II. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> A total of five to seven 24-hour urine samples were obtained per participant in TOHP I 删除4:<u>(between 1987 and 1990)</u> and three to five 24-hour urine samples per participant in TOHP II 删除4:<u>(between 1990 and 1995)</u>. In the TOHP I and II Follow-up Studies, participants were followed from the end of each trial through early 2005 for cardiovascular events and through December 2013 for death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Participants who had been randomly assigned to the sodium-reduction groups in these two trials 删除4:<u>(327 participants in TOHP I and 1191 in TOHP II)</u> were excluded from our current analysis.\n\n【19】For all these studies, baseline was defined as the period during which the prespecified numbers of 24-hour urine samples were obtained. The primary analysis excluded the first year of follow-up because dietary information that was collected close to the occurrence of a cardiovascular event or death may not reflect habitual sodium intake. Among 11,435 participants who had at least two eligible 24-hour urine samples at baseline, 626 (5.5%) did not respond to the follow-up regarding cardiovascular events, and another 100 participants (0.9%) had less than 1 year of follow-up. Therefore, 10,709 participants were included in the primary analysis. All the studies obtained institutional review board approval and written or oral informed consent from all the participants. The first and last authors of the current study vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of this study to the protocol.\n\n【20】24-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Our primary exposure measures were the participants’ sodium and potassium excretions, which were assessed by averaging the excretions in all available 24-hour urine samples per participant. To reduce measurement error that might arise from the undercollection or overcollection of 24-hour urine samples, we excluded samples that met at least one of the following criteria: the volume of the 24-hour urine sample was less than 500 ml or more than 5000 ml; the duration was less than 20 hours or was more than 28 hours, when the start and end times of urine collection were available; or the volume loss was more than 100 ml if the estimated volume lost was reported. Alternative exclusion criteria were used in the sensitivity analyses.\n\n【22】Outcome Ascertainment\n---------------------\n\n【23】The primary outcome of our study was a cardiovascular event, which was defined as a composite of coronary revascularization (coronary-artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention), fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Other deaths due to cardiovascular causes were reported in the TOHP I and II Follow-up Studies. Secondary outcomes were stroke, death from any cause, and a composite of coronary revascularization or myocardial infarction. The criteria that were used to ascertain these outcomes have shown high validity in the individual studies (Section S3).\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】Our primary analysis evaluated the associations of continuous urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the sodium-to-potassium ratio with subsequent risk of a cardiovascular event. We assessed the relations in each study independently using consistent analytic methods and then synthesized the results from each study using a random-effects meta-analysis (i.e., two-stage pooled analyses). For each study, hazard ratios were estimated by Cox proportional-hazards models, with adjustment for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, and race or ethnic group in a partially adjusted model (model 1). The fully adjusted model, which was the primary analytic model (model 2), included additional adjustment for educational level, height, baseline body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol status, and family history of cardiovascular disease, as well as the 24-hour urinary potassium excretion (for sodium as the exposure) and sodium excretion (for potassium as the exposure). Details on the model specifications are provided in Section S4.\n\n【26】Missing covariate values (which occurred in <1% of the participants) were handled with the use of missing indicators. Person-time was calculated from 1 year after all the prespecified 24-hour urine collections were obtained until the occurrence of a cardiovascular event or death or the end of follow-up, whichever occurred first. The proportional-hazard assumptions were tested and verified by the inclusion of an interaction term with time in the model. Results from individual studies were pooled with the use of a random-effects meta-analysis to account for the design differences among these studies. Between-study heterogeneity was statistically assessed with the use of _I_ 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> . Our primary analyses were based on a priori hypotheses, but in order to account for the hypothesis tests for three exposures, we present P values that were corrected for multiple comparisons with the use of the Holm–Bonferroni procedure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> All the 95% confidence intervals that are presented for the secondary outcomes and sensitivity analyses have not been corrected for multiplicity and should not be used to infer statistical significance.\n\n【27】In the secondary analyses, we repeated the analyses for study-specific quartile-based categorical exposures. We also investigated the associations by combining all the individual-level data in the same models with stratification according to study (i.e., simple pooled analysis). To assess the deviation from linearity of the associations, we used penalized splines for the exposures in the simple pooled analysis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> We also conducted prespecified stratified analyses and assessed the association of urinary sodium and potassium excretion with secondary outcomes, including total coronary heart disease, total stroke, and death from any cause, separately. The stratified analyses and analyses for components of the primary outcome (i.e., coronary heart disease and stroke) were conducted with the use of a simple pooled analysis owing to small sample sizes in the individual studies. In a post hoc analysis, we used a simple pooled analysis to assess the association of urinary sodium excretion with death from cardiovascular causes and death from noncardiovascular causes separately. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the effect of measurement error, other potential confounding factors, missing covariate values, nonresponse, and competing events on the association.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【30】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population.\n\n【31】The characteristics of the 10,709 participants are presented according to cohort in Table 1 and according to study-specific quartiles of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion in Table S1. Overall, the median 24-hour sodium excretion as assessed in the 37,896 urine samples was 3270 mg 删除4:<u>(10th to 90th percentile, 2099 to 4899)</u>. Under the assumption of nonrenal losses of 7% for sodium 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> and 23% for potassium, 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> the estimated overall daily sodium intake was 3516 mg 删除4:<u>(10th to 90th percentile, 2257 to 5268)</u> and the estimated overall daily potassium intake was 3292 mg 删除4:<u>(10th to 90th percentile, 2162 to 4700)</u>.\n\n【32】During a median follow-up of 8.8 years (interquartile range, 7.6 to 10.9), there were a total of 571 cardiovascular events 删除4:<u>(incidence rate, 5.9 events per 1000 person-years)</u>, including 445 coronary heart disease events (232 myocardial infarctions and 213 coronary revascularizations), 136 stroke events (of which 22 also involved coronary heart disease), and 12 additional deaths from cardiovascular causes (as reported in the TOHP I and II Follow-up Studies). A total of 1100 deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 14.8 years (interquartile range, 13.7 to 16.7).\n\n【33】Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Cardiovascular Risk\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Table 2. Table 2. Association of Sodium and Potassium Excretion with Cardiovascular Risk. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Forest Plots for the Associations of 24-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio with Cardiovascular Risk.\n\n【35】In two-stage pooled analyses that combined individual-participant data from six studies, each additional 1000 mg of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (Panel A) was associated with an 18% increase in cardiovascular risk, and each additional 1000 mg of 24-hour urinary potassium excretion (Panel B) was associated with an 18% decrease in cardiovascular risk. The sodium-to-potassium ratio (Panel C) was assessed on the basis of the sodium and potassium excretion measured in millimoles. Data from six studies — the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study, and the Trial of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) I and II Follow-up Studies — are shown. Hazard ratios have been adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, race, educational level, height, body-mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol status, family history of cardiovascular disease, 24-hour urinary potassium excretion (for sodium as the exposure) and 24-hour sodium excretion (for potassium as the exposure), and total energy intake and the modified DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet quality score for the HPFS, NHS, and NHS II. In each graph, the size of the squares indicates the weight given to the study, and the width of the diamond indicates the 95% confidence interval for the overall association estimate. Arrows indicate that the 95% confidence interval extends beyond the scale shown. Between-study heterogeneity was statistically assessed with the use of _I_ 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> .Figure 2.  Figure 2. Spline Plots for the Associations of 24-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio with Cardiovascular Risk.\n\n【36】The spline analysis of pooled data supported a linear association over the range of sodium excretion 删除4:<u>(Panel A; 5th to 95th percentile, 1846 to 5520 mg)</u> and potassium excretion 删除4:<u>(Panel B; 5th to 95th percentile, 1462 to 3961 mg)</u> within the overall study population. The sodium-to-potassium ratio (Panel C) was assessed on the basis of the sodium and potassium excretion measured in millimoles. Hazard ratios were estimated from Cox models stratified according to study cohort with adjustment for age, sex, race, educational level, height, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol status, family history of cardiovascular disease, and mutual adjustment for 24-hour urinary potassium and sodium excretions. Shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals, and the dashed line at 1.0 indicates the reference. Box plots at the bottom of the graphs show the distributions of the urinary biomarker. The vertical bar indicates the median, and the ends of the box the interquartile range; the whiskers (dashed lines) extend to values no farther than 1.5 times the interquartile range (which may be past the graphed area), and dots indicate values that are farther than 1.5 times the interquartile range. The 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles (P5, P25, P50, P75, and P95, respectively) are shown at the bottom of each graph.\n\n【37】Table 2 shows a graded association between sodium excretion and cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio for quartile 4 of the urinary biomarker \\[highest\\] vs. quartile 1 \\[lowest\\] in the fully adjusted model, 1.60; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.19 to 2.14). Each additional 1000 mg of daily sodium excretion was associated with an 18% increase in cardiovascular risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.29) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The spline analysis with pooled data further supported a linear association over the range of sodium excretion within this population (P<0.001 for linearity) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>.\n\n【38】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Subgroup Analyses for the Associations of 24-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio with Cardiovascular Risk.\n\n【39】Normal weight was defined as a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 18.5 to 24.9. Overweight or obesity was defined as a BMI of 25 or higher. In the subgroup analyses that were stratified according to the length of study follow-up, events that were censored within the first year of follow-up (which were excluded in the primary analysis) were included. Hazard ratios were estimated from Cox models with stratification according to study cohort with adjustment for age, sex (except for the analyses stratified according to sex), race, educational level, height, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status, physical activity, history of diabetes and elevated cholesterol status, family history of cardiovascular disease, and mutual adjustment for 24-hour urinary potassium and sodium excretions. The sodium-to-potassium ratio was assessed on the basis of the sodium and potassium excretion measured in millimoles.\n\n【40】Higher potassium excretion was associated with lower cardiovascular risk in the comparison of quartile 4 with quartile 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.91) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Each additional 1000 mg of daily potassium excretion was associated with an 18% lower cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The spline plot also showed a linear trend 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. There was a 24% increase in cardiovascular risk for each unit increase in the sodium-to-potassium ratio, which was calculated on the basis of sodium and potassium excretion measured in millimoles (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.37). The associations were consistent across subgroups defined according to age, sex, baseline hypertension, weight status, and years of follow-up 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Sex-specific associations are presented in Figure S2.\n\n【41】Secondary Analyses\n------------------\n\n【42】Similar associations with sodium and potassium excretion and the sodium-to-potassium ratio were also observed for coronary heart disease 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. The estimates for stroke showed a similar linear trend but with wider confidence intervals, probably owing to the small number of cases 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. The secondary analysis with simple pooled analyses yielded estimates that were almost identical to those from the two-stage pooled analysis for cardiovascular events 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>. Sodium excretion was not associated with death from any cause 删除4:<u>(hazard ratio per 1000-mg increase, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.10)</u>, but both higher potassium excretion and a lower sodium-to-potassium ratio were associated with a lower risk of death from any cause 删除2:<u>(Table S5 and Fig. S3)</u>. The linear trend of the association of sodium excretion with death from cardiovascular causes (which accounted for 22% of the deaths from any cause) was consistent with the results regarding the incidence of cardiovascular events 删除2:<u>(Table S6 and Fig. S4)</u>.\n\n【43】Sensitivity Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【44】The association of sodium excretion with cardiovascular risk was attenuated 删除4:<u>(hazard ratio per daily 1000-mg increase, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.17)</u> when only one 24-hour urine sample per participant was used, although the association was attenuated to a lesser degree after the exclusion of urine samples that met the prespecified exclusion criteria 删除2:<u>(Table S7)</u>. The linear association of sodium excretion with cardiovascular risk remained essentially unchanged in the following sensitivity analyses: analyses with additional adjustment for baseline hypertension status, urinary creatinine excretion, other dietary factors, and neighborhood socioeconomic status separately; analyses that excluded participants who had diabetes or were underweight or that excluded coronary revascularization from the study end points regarding cardiovascular events; analyses for which data for missing covariates were imputed with the use of multiple imputation; analyses that accounted for nonresponse to follow-up with the use of inverse probability weighting; and analyses that assessed competing risk of death with the use of subdistribution hazard models 删除2:<u>(Table S8)</u>. The results of the sensitivity analyses for potassium excretion and the sodium-to-potassium ratio were similar to those from the primary results (Tables S9 and 10).\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】In a study involving 10,709 adults whose data were pooled from six prospective cohort studies across the United States and Europe, with a median follow-up of 8.8 years, we found that higher sodium intake, measured by multiple 24-hour urine samples, was significantly associated with higher cardiovascular risk in a dose–response manner with a daily sodium intake of approximately 2000 to 6000 mg. Lower potassium intake and higher sodium-to-potassium ratio were also associated with higher cardiovascular risks.\n\n【47】Several meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies and randomized trials have shown a linear relationship between sodium intake and cardiovascular risk, 删除3:<u><sup><a>24-28 </a></sup></u> whereas a few other meta-analyses and more recent cohort studies have shown that both low and high sodium intakes were associated with higher risk (i.e., a J-shaped association). 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8,29 </a></sup></u> A key limitation of previous studies is the assessment of sodium intake by methods that are prone to measurement errors, such as questionnaires, spot urine samples, and single 24-hour urine samples. 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> The J-shaped association is probably due to confounding variables that were used in the equations to estimate the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from spot urine samples (e.g., age, sex, body weight, and urinary creatinine concentration), all of which are related to cardiovascular risk and may contribute in part to the increased cardiovascular risk that has been associated with lower sodium intake in observational studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> Another methodologic issue of previous studies is the inclusion of participants with existing chronic diseases such as heart failure, 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> which resulted in the potential for reverse-causation bias.\n\n【48】To overcome these limitations, we combined data from six prospective cohorts involving generally healthy participant populations for which multiple 24-hour urine samples were available from the participants. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the results across individual studies, although the estimates were weaker in the PREVEND study than in the other studies. The participants in the PREVEND study had lower sodium and higher potassium intakes than those in other cohorts. In addition, the proportion of participants with albuminuria was high in the PREVEND study; in our study, we excluded participants with chronic kidney disease. Although we found a strong and consistent association of sodium excretion with cardiovascular events and the association with death from cardiovascular causes showed a consistent linear trend, sodium excretion was not associated with death from any cause, which we speculate may be due to the occurrence of deaths from noncardiovascular causes diluting the relation between sodium intake and mortality. In contrast, the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS) 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> showed that use of a salt substitute that contained reduced sodium and increased potassium led to significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause in a high-risk population in China, in which death from cardiovascular causes accounted for nearly 60% of the deaths; in our study, 22% of the deaths were from cardiovascular disease.\n\n【49】Our study offers new insights concerning current methodologic challenges in sodium assessment. For example, when a single 24-hour urine sample per participant was used, the magnitude of the linear association with cardiovascular risk was attenuated, a finding that is consistent with results of a previous report. 删除3:<u><sup><a>34 </a></sup></u> A single measurement is not sufficient to reflect a person’s usual sodium intake owing to large day-to-day variations in sodium consumption and excretion. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,35 </a></sup></u> When sodium and potassium were considered together, higher sodium excretion and lower potassium excretion were associated with a higher cardiovascular risk, which suggests an additive role of higher sodium intake and lower potassium intake in increasing cardiovascular risk. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> By combining individual-level data from cohort studies with multiple 24-hour urine samples, our study constitutes a large study on cardiovascular risk and sodium intake as assessed by a very reliable method. By studying generally healthy populations, we also reduced confounding and potential reverse-causation bias. The use of individual-level data and the same methods for covariate adjustments and modeling renders our findings robust.\n\n【50】Our study has several limitations. First, although we were able to reduce the degree of heterogeneity by the use of consistent analytic approaches in individual studies, between-study heterogeneity that is inherent in the design of the original studies exists — for example, health profiles of participants, numbers and intervals of 24-hour urine samples, and available information on covariates. Second, this observational study does not allow us to rule out potential residual confounding, such as other dietary factors, energy intake, and socioeconomic status, for which data were available in only some of the included studies. Third, given within-participant variation in sodium excretion, the observed association may have underestimated the true association. Fourth, our study was based on study populations that comprised mainly generally healthy White participants 删除2:<u>(Table S11)</u>, so the generalizability of our results to other racial and ethnic groups and to other patients with specific conditions is not possible.\n\n【51】Our study showed a significant linear association between sodium intake, as measured with the use of multiple 24-hour urine samples, and cardiovascular risk in a dose–response manner with a daily sodium intake of approximately 2000 to 6000 mg. Higher potassium intake was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk. These findings may support reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake from current levels.\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (20POST35120057, to Dr. Ma) from the American Heart Association ( AHA ) and in part by a grant (K99AG071742, to Dr. Ma) from the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health ( NIH ).

In contrast, the rate of sympathetic-nerve activity in the patients with preeclampsia (33±3 bursts per minute) was more than three times as high as that in the normotensive pregnant women (P<0.05) and more than twice as high as in the group of nonpregnant women with hypertension (P<0.05). Hemodynamic and sympathetic-nerve responses to both reflex tests did not differ significantly among the four groups. Six patients with preeclampsia were studied again after delivery; mean sympathetic-nerve activity at that time had decreased significantly from the value during pregnancy (from 36±4 to 13±2 bursts per minute, P<0.01), as had mean arterial pressure (from 118±3 to 96±1 mm Hg, P<0.01).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Preeclampsia is a state of sympathetic overactivity, which reverts to normal after delivery. Our data indicate that the increases in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure that characterize this disorder are mediated, at least in part, by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of late pregnancy that resolves shortly after delivery. It occurs in up to 10 percent of all pregnancies and is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie this uniquely reversible form of human hypertension still remain to be elucidated, it is now clear that preeclampsia is characterized by a marked increase in peripheral vascular resistance, which, in turn, causes the increase in blood pressure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Studies in animals have suggested that endothelial dysfunction with an imbalance of vasodilating and vasoconstricting substances (nitric oxide deficiency) may account for this disorder. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> Recent clinical studies in humans, however, have conflicting results with regard to the role of nitric oxide in preeclampsia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-11</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Since vascular tone is largely determined by the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, we decided to examine whether an increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity may be an important mechanism in mediating the increase in peripheral vascular resistance in preeclampsia. We therefore measured postganglionic action potentials in sympathetic-nerve fibers innervating blood vessels in the skeletal muscle in patients with preeclampsia. Measurements in the hypertensive state were compared with those made after delivery, when blood pressure was again normal. Sympathetic-nerve activity was also measured in normotensive pregnant women and in nonpregnant women with and without hypertension.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Subjects\n--------\n\n【15】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Four Groups of Subjects.\n\n【16】We studied 30 white women: 9 women with preeclampsia; 8 normotensive pregnant women matched with the women who had preeclampsia for age, week of gestation, and body weight; 6 normotensive nonpregnant women of similar age; and 7 nonpregnant women of similar age who had hypertension 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Preeclampsia was defined according to the criteria of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. These criteria include no history of hypertension, cardiovascular, or renal disease before pregnancy and blood-pressure values exceeding 140/90 mm Hg after the 20th week of gestation, confirmed by two consecutive readings at least six hours apart, with blood pressure reverting to normal within 2 months after delivery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【17】Eight of the nine women with preeclampsia had proteinuria of >500 mg per day. One woman who did not have substantial proteinuria had other signs of preeclampsia, such as thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 98,000 per cubic millimeter; normal, >150,000 per cubic millimeter) and mild elevation of aminotransferase values (aspartate aminotransferase, 28 U per liter; normal, <15 U per liter; alanine aminotransferase, 25 U per liter; normal, <17 U per liter). Further characteristics of preeclampsia found in these patients were hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin, 3.0±0.2 g per deciliter; normal range, 3.5 to 5.0 g per deciliter), hyperuricemia (serum uric acid, 6.2±0.4 mg per deciliter \\[370±20 μmol per liter\\]; normal range, 2.4 to 5.7 mg per deciliter \\[140 to 340 μmol per liter\\]), and mild relative hemoconcentration (serum hematocrit, 42±1 percent; normal value in the third trimester, <38 percent).\n\n【18】The women with preeclampsia were recruited from the perinatal ward of the Nuremberg community hospital, where they were hospitalized because of an increase in blood pressure in the third trimester. The patients with preeclampsia and the control subjects were following no special diet, and there was no restriction of salt intake. All patients were examined within one to two days after hospitalization.\n\n【19】Five of the nine patients with preeclampsia received the vasodilator drug dihydralazine (Nepresol, Ciba; 25 mg taken orally) as antihypertensive medication on admission. No other antihypertensive drugs were given, and none of the patients were receiving antihypertensive medication before their hospitalization. Three of these five women received one tablet shortly after hospitalization and were studied with microneurography within the next 12 to 24 hours. Two of the five patients were studied 48 hours after hospitalization. These patients had received a total dose of three tablets of dihydralazine within the first 36 hours after admission. Thus, the interval between the intake of the last tablet of dihydralazine and the microneurographic study was at least 12 hours for each patient, or three times the elimination half-life of dihydralazine. The remaining four patients with preeclampsia received no antihypertensive medication before the study.\n\n【20】The normotensive pregnant controls were also hospitalized because of obstetrical complications at the time of the study but were otherwise healthy; they remained normotensive throughout their pregnancies. None of these women were taking medications other than iron or vitamins. The nonpregnant normotensive controls were members of the medical and laboratory staff. The nonpregnant control women with hypertension were recruited from among patients at our hypertension clinic. These patients were selected because they were taking antihypertensive drugs similar to those received by the women with preeclampsia (dihydralazine or other vasodilators such as dihydropyridine calcium antagonists), which were discontinued 12 to 24 hours before the study. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board on Human Investigation of the University of Erlangen–Nürnberg, and all the women provided written informed consent.\n\n【21】General Procedures\n------------------\n\n【22】All the women were studied between 9 a.m. and noon without sedation in the postabsorptive state (i.e., at least 90 minutes after the ingestion of a light breakfast). The studies were performed with all pregnant subjects lying in a 30-degree left lateral position. A direct-writing multichannel physiologic recorder (Gould Instruments) was used to make simultaneous recordings of blood pressure (measured noninvasively beat to beat by a photoplethysmographic finger device; Finapres, Ohmeda), heart rate (measured by electrocardiography), respiratory excursions (measured with a pneumograph), and efferent sympathetic-nerve activity to the vasculature of the leg muscles. Respiratory excursions were monitored to detect the inadvertent performance of a Valsalva maneuver or prolonged expiration, since these respiratory maneuvers stimulate sympathetic outflow. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【23】Recordings of Sympathetic-Nerve Activity\n----------------------------------------\n\n【24】Multiunit recordings of postganglionic sympathetic-nerve activity were obtained with unipolar tungsten microelectrodes inserted selectively into muscle-nerve fascicles of the peroneal nerve posterior to the fibular head by the microneurographic technique of Vallbo et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The electrodes were connected to a preamplifier, and the nerve signal was fed through a bandpass filter and routed through an amplitude discriminator to a storage oscilloscope and loudspeaker.\n\n【25】For recording and analysis, the filtered neurogram was fed through a resistance–capacitance integrating network to obtain a display of the mean voltage of the neural activity. A recording of sympathetic activity was considered acceptable when the neurogram revealed spontaneous, pulse-synchronous bursts of neural activity, with the largest bursts showing a minimal signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. In each study, we also confirmed that we were recording the sympathetic outflow to skeletal muscle rather than sympathetic discharge to skin by demonstrating that the neural activity did not change in response to arousal stimuli or a pinch of the skin but showed a characteristically biphasic response to the Valsalva maneuver. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【26】For analysis, sympathetic bursts were identified by inspection of the filtered and mean-voltage neurograms. The rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge was expressed as the number of bursts per minute. Sympathetic activity was also corrected for heart rate and expressed as bursts per 100 heartbeats. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> All nerve recordings were analyzed by two investigators who were unaware of the group assignment of the subjects. The data on sympathetic-nerve activity given in the text and figures of this article represent the mean for the two observers. Results and conclusions did not differ significantly between observers. As in earlier studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> the intraobserver variation in identifying bursts was 5 percent, and the interobserver variation was less than 10 percent.\n\n【27】Study Protocol\n--------------\n\n【28】To ensure that the base-line values were stable, all subjects rested quietly for 30 minutes after the nerve electrode had been inserted and the other monitoring devices had been applied. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory excursions, and sympathetic-nerve activity at rest were then recorded continuously for at least 20 minutes. The reported values for these variables represent the means for this period. After registration of the base-line data, two cardiovascular-reflex tests were performed to assess the autonomic neural control of the circulation.\n\n【29】We compared the responses of the heart rate and muscle sympathetic-nerve activity during performance of the Valsalva maneuver, which is a standard noninvasive test to assess baroreflex function. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> This maneuver was performed by instructing subjects to exhale into a manometer with an expiratory pressure of 40 mm Hg for 15 seconds. In each subject we determined the Valsalva ratio, which was calculated as the ratio of the longest R-R interval shortly after exhalation to the shortest R-R interval during the exhalation, and the increase in sympathetic-nerve activity during the maneuver.\n\n【30】A cold pressor test was used as a non–baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitatory stimulus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> In the test, one of the subject's hands was immersed up to the wrist in ice water for two minutes. Control and recovery periods for the cold pressor test were also two minutes in duration. The average response during each period of control, intervention, and recovery was determined.\n\n【31】In six of the nine patients with preeclampsia, measurements were repeated one to three months after delivery, when the blood pressure was normal again, to determine whether the changes in blood pressure were accompanied by similar changes in sympathetic activity.\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】The differences in the mean base-line values as well as the responses to the Valsalva maneuver and the cold pressor test among the four groups were compared by analysis of variance with Fisher's test for the least significant difference in comparisons between pairs of groups. Paired t-tests (two-tailed) were used for the comparisons of sympathetic activity and mean arterial blood pressure before and after delivery within the group with preeclampsia. Statistical significance was considered indicated by a P value of less than 0.05. Values are presented as means ±SE.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Representative Recordings of Sympathetic-Nerve Activity in a Normotensive Nonpregnant Woman, a Hypertensive Nonpregnant Woman, a Normotensive Pregnant Woman, and a Woman with Preeclampsia (before and after Delivery).\n\n【36】The rate of sympathetic-nerve discharge was similar in the two nonpregnant women and the normotensive pregnant woman, but it was much higher in the patient with preeclampsia. After delivery, blood pressure and sympathetic activity returned to normal in this patient.Figure 2.  Figure 2. Mean Arterial Pressure and Sympathetic-Nerve Activity in Six Normotensive Nonpregnant Women (NN), Seven Hypertensive Nonpregnant Women (HN), Eight Normotensive Pregnant Women (NP), and Nine Women with Preeclampsia (PE).\n\n【37】The solid circles are individual values, and the open circles and bars are the group means ±SE. Mean arterial pressure was similarly elevated in the patients with preeclampsia and the nonpregnant women with hypertension, as compared with the two normotensive groups (P<0.05 for each comparison). Sympathetic-nerve activity, however, was markedly increased in the patients with preeclampsia but not in the nonpregnant women with hypertension (P<0.05 for the comparison of the women with preeclampsia with all other groups).\n\n【38】The characteristics of the four study groups are shown in Table 1 , and representative recordings of sympathetic-nerve activity in each group are shown in Figure 1 . The rate of sympathetic discharge in the normotensive pregnant women did not differ significantly from that in the nonpregnant normotensive women or the nonpregnant women with hypertension (10±1 vs. 12±2 and 15±3 bursts per minute, respectively; P not significant for the comparisons among groups) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and Figure 2 )</u>. In contrast, with a mean value of 33±3 bursts per minute, sympathetic activity was more than three times as high in the patients with preeclampsia as in the normotensive pregnant women (P<0.05), and more than twice as high as in the group of age-matched nonpregnant women with hypertension (P<0.05) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Because of the matching procedure, the group with preeclampsia did not differ significantly from the group of normotensive pregnant women with regard to age, week of gestation, or body-mass index 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【39】The heart rate was similarly elevated in both groups of pregnant women (82±2 bpm in the patients with preeclampsia and 82±3 in the normotensive pregnant women), as compared with the normotensive nonpregnant control group (70±4 beats per minute, P<0.05 for each comparison), and it tended to be higher in the two groups of pregnant women than in the nonpregnant women with hypertension (76±4 beats per minute, P not significant). Therefore, the marked increase in sympathetic-nerve firing in women with preeclampsia, as compared with normotensive pregnant women, cannot be explained by differences in the heart rate. This is also reflected in the fact that the mean value for sympathetic-nerve activity corrected for heart rate was much higher in the group with preeclampsia (41±3 bursts per 100 heartbeats) than in the normotensive pregnant group (13±1 bursts per 100 heartbeats, P<0.05). The values for the normotensive and the hypertensive nonpregnant women (17±4 and 20±4 bursts per 100 heartbeats, respectively) were also significantly lower than that for the patients with preeclampsia (P<0.05 for each comparison) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【40】As was expected, mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the patients with preeclampsia (121±3 mm Hg) than in the normotensive pregnant women (92±3 mm Hg, P<0.05) or the normotensive nonpregnant women (96±3 mm Hg, P<0.05). The nonpregnant women with hypertension had mean arterial pressures that were very similar to those of the women with preeclampsia (119±5 mm Hg, P not significant) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】The responses of the heart rate and muscle sympathetic-nerve activity to the Valsalva maneuver did not differ significantly among the four groups. This was reflected in similar values for the Valsalva ratio (women with preeclampsia, 1.5±0.2; normotensive pregnant women, 1.6±0.1; normotensive nonpregnant women, 1.6±0.1; nonpregnant women with hypertension, 1.5±0.1; P not significant for the comparisons between groups), and similar increases in sympathetic-nerve activity during the Valsalva maneuver in the four groups (9±2, 11±2, 12±3, and 10±2 bursts per minute, respectively; P not significant).\n\n【42】Similarly, increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic-nerve activity during the cold pressor test did not differ significantly among the patients with preeclampsia (13±1 mm Hg, 4±2 beats per minute, and 9±3 bursts per minute, respectively), the normotensive pregnant women (15±3 mm Hg, 5±2 beats per minute, and 12±4 bursts per minute), the normotensive nonpregnant women (13±3 mm Hg, 3±1 beats per minute, and 13±4 bursts per minute), and the nonpregnant women with hypertension (16±4 mm Hg, 5±2 beats per minute, and 10±3 bursts per minute; P not significant for all comparisons among the four groups).\n\n【43】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Mean Arterial Pressure and Sympathetic-Nerve Activity in Six Women with Preeclampsia, Measured before and after Delivery.\n\n【44】The patients had nearly parallel decreases in blood pressure and sympathetic-nerve activity after delivery. The open circles and bars are the mean values ±SE. The mean values before and after delivery differed significantly (P<0.01).\n\n【45】Figure 3 compares the data on mean arterial pressure and sympathetic-nerve activity before and after delivery (range, 1 to 3 months) in six patients with preeclampsia. Group values for mean arterial pressure normalized; they fell from 118±3 mm Hg to 96±1 mm Hg (P<0.01) after delivery in these patients. The decrease in blood pressure was accompanied by a significant decrease in the mean sympathetic discharge, from 36±4 to 13±2 bursts per minute (P<0.01) and from 43±5 to 17±2 bursts per 100 heartbeats (P<0.01). The responses in each patient show almost parallel decreases in mean arterial pressure and sympathetic-nerve activity. Figure 1 shows this decrease in sympathetic activity after delivery in a patient with preeclampsia.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】We found that sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge to skeletal muscle was markedly elevated in patients with preeclampsia but was normal in normotensive pregnant subjects. Shortly after delivery, furthermore, both blood pressure and sympathetic activity normalized in the women with preeclampsia. These findings suggest that the increase in peripheral vascular resistance seen in preeclampsia is mediated at least partly by a substantial increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity.\n\n【48】Previous attempts to study the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the development of hypertension in pregnancy focused mainly on plasma and urinary catecholamine concentrations, which ranged from increased to decreased. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18-20 </a></sup></u> These conflicting results may be explained by the now well-accepted fact that plasma and urinary catecholamine levels are insensitive measures of sympathetic activity that are influenced by many factors, such as efferent neural activity, synaptic transmitter release, reuptake mechanisms, and regional blood flow. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> Pregnancy may lead to changes in catecholamine metabolism and clearance. In contrast, the microneurographic technique for obtaining direct intraneural recordings of postganglionic sympathetic-nerve activity allows a precise, quantitative, and reproducible assessment of sympathetic neural vasoconstrictor activity.\n\n【49】Our results obtained with this method indicate that preeclampsia is a state of sympathetic overactivity that reverts to normal after delivery. The finding of almost parallel decreases in sympathetic activity and blood pressure after delivery is highly suggestive of a neurogenic component in preeclampsia. This increase in sympathetic activity was a robust finding and was unrelated to the women's age, week of gestation, or body-mass index or to changes in heart rate. Furthermore, this sympathetic overactivity seems to be specific to the disease and is probably not a secondary finding caused by high blood pressure, since age-matched nonpregnant subjects with hypertension did not have significant increases in sympathetic activity.\n\n【50】At least three potential mechanisms may account for this sympathetic activation. The increase in sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity could be due either to a decrease in baroreceptor-mediated inhibitory restraint on central sympathetic outflow or to central neural mechanisms. Alternatively, it is possible that humoral or paracrine factors could act in the central nervous system to enhance sympathetic-nerve activity. The literature provides some limited evidence of these suggested mechanisms. Ekholm and colleagues, 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> studying the changes in blood pressure and heart rate during noninvasive cardiovascular-reflex testing, found some changes in autonomic baroreflex-mediated circulatory control in patients with preeclampsia; however, other investigators 删除3:<u><sup><a>23,24 </a></sup></u> reported conflicting results.\n\n【51】In this study, we assessed baroreflex-mediated control of the heart rate and sympathetic-nerve activity by performing a Valsalva maneuver; we also examined the hemodynamic and sympathetic-nerve responses to a cold pressor test, a non–baroreflex-mediated sympathoexcitatory stimulus. Since responses to these cardiovascular-reflex tests were not significantly different in the group with preeclampsia and the control groups, the marked increase in basal sympathetic outflow to muscle in patients with preeclampsia does not seem to be due to an impairment of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic-nerve control or to a nonspecific change in general reflex responsiveness. Passloer 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> suggested that a defect in central conflict-processing systems may mediate an increase in catecholamine levels, which not only provokes somatic and affective symptoms of anxiety and hostility but also leads to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure.\n\n【52】The precise mechanisms underlying the increased sympathetic-nerve activity cannot be determined from our study. Another limitation of the study is the fact that sympathetic outflow to skeletal muscle may not reflect sympathetic activity in other organs, including the heart and kidneys.\n\n【53】Indirect evidence of a sympathetically mediated increase in blood pressure in patients with preeclampsia is provided by the well-known clinical effectiveness of sympatholytic therapy. Thus, methyldopa, which acts by reducing central sympathetic outflow, is the treatment of choice for long-term control of blood pressure in patients with this disorder. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】In conclusion, the fundamental hemodynamic characteristic of preeclampsia is a marked increase in peripheral vascular resistance. Our studies suggest that augmented sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity is one important mechanism producing this increase in vascular resistance.\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Dr. Allyn L.

In contrast, gastric bypass surgery leaves a 15-ml pouch near the esophagogastric junction and excludes the major curvature, thus isolating the fundus — the richest source of ghrelin production 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> — from direct contact with food. We hypothesized that circulating ghrelin concentrations in patients undergoing bariatric surgery depend on the degree to which the procedure excludes the fundus and the subsequent isolation of ghrelin-producing cells from direct stimuli. To avoid the potential confounding effect of long-term weight loss, we focused on the changes occurring 24 hours after the intervention.\n\n【3】Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients before Surgery. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Hormonal Changes Associated with the Three Surgical Procedures.\n\n【4】Panel A shows changes in fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and ghrelin 24 hours after Nissen fundoplication, adjustable gastric banding, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Panel B shows changes from preoperative to postoperative ghrelin plasma concentrations in patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication, adjustable gastric banding, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The arrowheads indicate the average values before and 24 hours after surgery. The asterisks indicate P<0.001 for the comparison with Nissen fundoplication and adjustable gastric banding, by one-factor analysis of variance followed by Scheffé's pairwise comparisons; the dagger P<0.01 for the comparison with preoperative values, by two-tailed paired t-tests; the double dagger P<0.05 for the comparison with preoperative values, by two-tailed paired t-tests; and the section mark P<0.001 for the comparison with preoperative values, by two-tailed paired t-tests.\n\n【5】Thirty-eight matched obese white patients undergoing adjustable gastric banding, gastric bypass surgery, or Nissen fundoplication by the laparoscopic approach were studied. To avoid potential confounding influences due to diurnal variation, blood was withdrawn at 8 a.m. before surgery and at 8 a.m. the day after surgery. Patients in the three groups had similar clinical, biochemical, and hormonal characteristics 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. As would be expected from the long fasting period, glucose and insulin concentrations fell in all the patients 24 hours after surgery, without significant changes in body weight. The decrease in glucose and insulin concentrations from the preoperative measurement to the postoperative measurement was statistically significant within each surgical group (P<0.01), whereas no significant differences were observed among the groups 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Twenty-four hours after the surgical intervention, ghrelin concentrations had significantly increased in the groups that underwent Nissen fundoplication (P=0.01) or adjustable gastric banding (P=0.02) but had decreased in the group that underwent gastric bypass surgery (P<0.001). Our data provide evidence that fundus functionality after surgery determines ghrelin concentrations. This finding is in agreement with the significantly low ghrelin concentrations previously observed in patients 30 minutes after gastrectomy and over the long term. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】参考删除-2:<u>Gema Frühbeck, M.D., Ph.D.  \nAlberto Diez Caballero, M.D., Ph.D.  \nMaria J.

In the first trial, 905 patients were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The primary outcome was response, defined by a decrease in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 70 points, at week 10. In the second trial, 339 patients who had a response to natalizumab in the first trial were randomly reassigned to receive 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo every four weeks through week 56. The primary outcome was a sustained response through week 36. A secondary outcome in both trials was disease remission (a CDAI score of less than 150).\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】In the first trial, the natalizumab and placebo groups had similar rates of response (56 percent and 49 percent, respectively; P=0.05) and remission (37 percent and 30 percent, respectively; P=0.12) at 10 weeks. Continuing natalizumab in the second trial resulted in higher rates of sustained response (61 percent vs. 28 percent, P<0.001) and remission (44 percent vs. 26 percent, P=0.003) through week 36 than did switching to placebo. Serious adverse events occurred in 7 percent of each group in the first trial and in 10 percent of the placebo group and 8 percent of the natalizumab group in the second trial. In an open-label extension study, a patient treated with natalizumab died from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, associated with the JC virus, a human polyomavirus.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Induction therapy with natalizumab for Crohn's disease resulted in small, nonsignificant improvements in response and remission rates. Patients who had a response had significantly increased rates of sustained response and remission if natalizumab was continued every four weeks. The benefit of natalizumab will need to be weighed against the risk of serious adverse events, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00032786 . opens in new tab and NCT00032799 . opens in new tab .)\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease involves persistent recruitment of leukocytes into gut tissue, with resultant inflammation. Natalizumab (Tysabri, Elan Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec), a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the adhesion and subsequent migration of leukocytes into the gut by binding α <sub>4 </sub> integrin, is a member of a new class of molecules referred to as selective adhesion-molecule inhibitors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Previous studies have suggested that natalizumab may be effective for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Furthermore, natalizumab has been shown to be effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, another chronic inflammatory disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> Therefore, we conducted a 12-week induction trial of natalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Patients who had a response to natalizumab were eligible to enroll in a 48-week maintenance trial.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Members of the steering committees of the Efficacy of Natalizumab as Active Crohn's Therapy (ENACT-1) induction trial and the Evaluation of Natalizumab as Continuous Therapy (ENACT-2) maintenance trial and the sponsors designed the studies. The authors had access to all data, participated in the analysis and interpretation of the data, and were members of the publication committee. The academic authors vouch for the completeness and veracity of the data and data analyses.\n\n【14】Patients\n--------\n\n【15】The ENACT-1 and ENACT-2 trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted at 142 centers between December 2001 and March 2004. The protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each center. All patients gave written informed consent.\n\n【16】The ENACT-1 trial included patients 18 years of age or older who for at least six months had had Crohn's disease that was moderately to severely active as defined by a baseline Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> score of 220 to 450 points (scores range from 0 to 600, with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity). Radiologic or endoscopic evidence was required within 36 months before enrollment and after surgical resection to confirm the presence of active disease. Concurrent therapies, including stable doses of 5-aminosalicylates, prednisolone (25 mg per day or less) or equivalent, budesonide (6 mg per day or less), azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and antibiotics, were permitted. Patients with the short-bowel syndrome, a stricture with obstructive symptoms, a draining fistula, or an abdominal abscess; those who had undergone ostomy; and those who had received therapy against tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) within the preceding three months were excluded. Patients who had a response, as defined below, in the ENACT-1 trial were eligible for the ENACT-2 trial.\n\n【17】Study Design\n------------\n\n【18】Patients who were eligible for the ENACT-1 trial were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive an intravenous infusion of either 300 mg of natalizumab or placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and were then followed through week 12. Treatment allocation was prospectively stratified according to disease activity (a CDAI score of less than 330 points vs. a score of at least 330 points) and the use of corticosteroids. The primary efficacy end point of the ENACT-1 trial was the proportion of patients with a response at the prespecified time of week 10. A response was defined as a reduction in the CDAI score of at least 70 points from week 0, whereas remission was defined as a CDAI score of less than 150 points. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】Patients with a CDAI score of 0 to 220 at week 12 who had had a response at both weeks 10 and 12 without the need for intervention were eligible for the ENACT-2 trial. Eligible patients were randomly reassigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an infusion of either placebo or 300 mg of natalizumab every four weeks from weeks 12 through 56 and were followed until week 60. Treatment allocation was prospectively stratified according to disease activity (remission vs. mildly active disease) and the use of corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy. The primary efficacy end point of the ENACT-2 study was the proportion of patients treated with natalizumab who had a clinical response in the ENACT-1 study, who were randomly reassigned in the ENACT-2 trial, and who had a sustained response through the prespecified time of week 36. Loss of response was defined by an increase in the CDAI score of at least 70 points after week 12 and by an absolute score of at least 220 or the need for intervention after week 12. Loss of remission was defined as an increase in the CDAI score to at least 150 points or the need for intervention among patients in remission at week 12. Patients receiving placebo in the ENACT-1 study who were enrolled in the ENACT-2 study were also assessed in exploratory analyses.\n\n【20】Both trials were centrally randomized. Patients and investigators were unaware of treatment assignments.\n\n【21】The doses of all concurrent medications, except corticosteroids, remained constant. Patients receiving concomitant corticosteroids were required to attempt discontinuation according to a fixed tapering regimen. After week 10, the daily dose of prednisolone or equivalent was reduced by 5 mg weekly until a dose of 10 mg was reached. Thereafter, the dose was reduced by 2.5 mg each week until the drug was discontinued. After week 10, the daily dose of budesonide was decreased by 3 mg every three weeks until the drug was discontinued.\n\n【22】Efficacy and Safety Evaluations\n-------------------------------\n\n【23】Patients were assessed two weeks before randomized treatment was begun, on day 0, and every two weeks thereafter through week 12 in the ENACT-1 trial. In the ENACT-2 study, patients were assessed every four weeks through week 60. The CDAI score was determined at each visit, adverse events and concomitant medications were recorded, and samples were collected for laboratory evaluations. Safety evaluations included assessment of vital signs, physical examination, hematologic analysis, serum biochemical analysis, and urinalysis.\n\n【24】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】We estimated that a minimum of 845 patients would be needed for the ENACT-1 study to have a statistical power of 90 percent to detect an absolute difference in response rates of 15 percent between the natalizumab and placebo groups, assuming a 55 percent rate of response to natalizumab, a 40 percent rate of response to placebo, and a 10 percent rate of responses that could not be evaluated. We anticipated that 380 patients who were treated with natalizumab in the ENACT-1 study would have a response, of whom at least 285 would elect to enroll in the ENACT-2 study. We estimated that 285 patients would need to undergo rerandomization for the ENACT-2 study to have a statistical power of 90 percent to detect an absolute difference of 21 percent in the rates of a sustained response, given a 65 percent rate of sustained response to natalizumab, a 44 percent rate for placebo, and a 10 percent rate of responses that could not be evaluated.\n\n【26】Logistic regression was used to analyze differences in the primary outcome measures, after adjustment for disease activity and corticosteroid use at week 0 in the ENACT-1 study and for the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants at week 0 as well as the rates of remission at week 12 in the ENACT-2 trial. Fisher's exact tests were used for analyses of adverse events. The primary analyses had an α level of 0.05 and used two-sided tests. Data from the ENACT-1 trial were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Efficacy analyses in the ENACT-2 trial excluded patients who underwent randomization despite the lack of a clinical response or remission in the ENACT-1 study. For continuous outcomes, efficacy data collected after intervention or early discontinuation were replaced by the last available value. For the calculation of induction and maintenance of clinical response or remission and corticosteroid-withdrawal end points, patients who required rescue therapy or those with missing data were classified as having no response to treatment.\n\n【27】Logistic regression and log-rank tests were used as appropriate to provide nominal P values for secondary end points. The time to clinical response and time to remission were evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier method and a Cox proportional-hazards model. For the ENACT-1 study, post hoc analyses were also performed to explore the effect of natalizumab in subpopulations with objectively determined active inflammation and chronic disease despite the use of conventional therapies (patients with an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein, those receiving immunosuppressants, and those who had previously received therapy against TNF-α). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Treatment.\n\n【31】Not all patients who were classified by investigators as having a response to induction therapy actually met the prespecified definition of a response (i.e., they were not eligible for the ENACT-2 trial owing to missing assessments or the use of rescue medications during the ENACT-1 trial that were not documented by the investigator before the patient entered the maintenance study). One of the nine patients assigned to placebo maintenance in the ENACT-2 trial who could not be evaluated entered remission but did not meet the criteria for a response.Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients in the ENACT-1 Trial and the Patients Who Had a Response to Natalizumab or Remission at the Time of Randomization in the ENACT-2 Trial.\n\n【32】Figure 1 summarizes the disposition of patients. In both trials, the baseline characteristics of the patients were generally similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In the ENACT-2 trial, there were significant but clinically unimportant differences between groups in the percentages of men enrolled, CDAI scores, and smoking status.\n\n【33】Efficacy in the ENACT-1 Trial\n-----------------------------\n\n【34】Figure 2.

Remission was defined as a decrease in the CDAI score to less than 150 points. Significant differences between the treatment groups are shown.\n\n【36】At week 10, 49 percent of patients in the placebo group had had a response (88 of 181), as compared with 56 percent of patients in the natalizumab group (408 of 724, P=0.05) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. Similarly, 30 percent of patients in the placebo group were in remission at week 10 (55 of 181), as compared with 37 percent of patients in the natalizumab group (267 of 724, P=0.12) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. The differences between the natalizumab and placebo groups were significant at week 10 with the use of the more stringent definition of response as a 100-point decrease in the CDAI score. The rates of response and remission were higher in the natalizumab group at all times, but the majority of these differences were not significant 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A and Figure 2B )</u>. The results among patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline were similar to those overall.\n\n【37】In contrast, the efficacy of natalizumab was demonstrated in the subgroups of 660 patients with an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein at baseline (upper limit of normal, 2.87 mg per liter), 300 patients with active disease despite the use of immunosuppressants, and 358 patients who had previously received anti–TNF-α therapy. Each subgroup was significantly more likely to have either a response or a remission after treatment with natalizumab than after receiving placebo 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C and Figure 2D )</u>. The rates of response and remission were also higher, but not significantly so, among natalizumab-treated patients in the subgroup who had not previously received anti–TNF-α therapy and the subgroup with active disease and no concomitant use of immunosuppressants but not in the subgroup without an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein at baseline 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C and Figure 2D )</u>. The dose of natalizumab (in milligrams per kilogram of body weight) had no significant effect on the rates of response or remission.\n\n【38】The ENACT-2 Trial\n-----------------\n\n【39】### _Efficacy among Patients with a Response to Natalizumab in the ENACT-1 Trial_\n\n【40】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Percentage of Patients in the ENACT-2 Trial with a Sustained Response (Panel A) and Sustained Remission (Panel B) at Each Visit, Percentage of Patients with a Response or Remission at Weeks 36 and 60 (Panel C), and Percentage of Patients Taking Oral Corticosteroids at Randomization in the ENACT-1 Trial Who Were No Longer Taking Oral Corticosteroids While Remaining in Remission during the ENACT-2 Trial (Panel D).\n\n【41】In Panel A, the analysis was limited to patients with a response to natalizumab in the ENACT-1 trial who met the eligibility criteria for the ENACT-2 trial at randomization. In Panel B, the analysis was limited to patients with a response to natalizumab in the ENACT-1 trial who met the eligibility criteria for remission at the time of randomization for the ENACT-2 trial. Loss of response was defined as an increase in the CDAI score after week 12 of at least 70 points to an absolute score of at least 220 or the use of rescue intervention. Loss of remission was defined as in increase in the CDAI score to at least 150 points or the need for intervention in patients in remission at week 12. Significant differences between the treatment groups are shown.\n\n【42】In the ENACT-2 trial, 28 percent of patients randomly reassigned to placebo had a sustained response through week 36 (48 of 170), as compared with 61 percent of patients randomly reassigned to natalizumab (103 of 168, P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>. Regression analyses demonstrated that adjustment for sex, baseline CDAI scores, smoking status, C-reactive protein concentration (at week 0 or 12), the use of prior anti–TNF-α therapy, and the dose of natalizumab did not influence the results. Overall, 26 percent of patients in the placebo group had a sustained remission through week 36 (31 of 120), as compared with 44 percent of patients in the natalizumab group (57 of 130, P=0.003) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. The rates of sustained response and remission were significantly higher in the natalizumab group at every point beginning at week 20 and continuing through week 60 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A and Figure 3B )</u>. The natalizumab group also had significantly higher rates of response and remission rates when the results were assessed at prespecified points (weeks 36 and 60) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3C )</u>.\n\n【43】The median time to the loss of response was 86 days in the placebo group and more than 336 days in the natalizumab group (P<0.001). Among patients who entered remission after induction therapy with natalizumab, the median time to the loss of remission was 59 days in the placebo group and 137 days in the natalizumab group (P<0.001).\n\n【44】Forty-two percent of patients who had a response to induction therapy with natalizumab (143 of 339) had received oral corticosteroids or budesonide at baseline. Among patients who completed week 36 of the ENACT-2 study, 28 percent of those randomly reassigned to placebo were no longer taking corticosteroids, as compared with 58 percent of patients randomly reassigned to natalizumab (P<0.001); the results were similar at week 60 (P<0.001). At week 36, 22 percent of patients in the placebo group who received corticosteroid therapy at baseline were in remission and had discontinued corticosteroids, as compared with 45 percent of patients in the natalizumab group (P=0.01); the results were similar at week 60 (P=0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3D )</u>.\n\n【45】### _Efficacy among Patients with a Response to Placebo in the ENACT-1 Trial_\n\n【46】Among the patients who had a response to induction therapy with placebo at the time of randomization, 55 percent of patients who were randomly reassigned to placebo maintained a response through week 36 (18 of 33), as compared with 54 percent of patients who were randomly reassigned to natalizumab (19 of 35, P=0.58). Similarly, 36 percent of patients who were randomly reassigned to placebo maintained a response through week 60 (12 of 33), as compared with 49 percent of patients who were randomly reassigned to natalizumab (17 of 35, P=0.16).\n\n【47】Safety\n------\n\n【48】Table 2.  Table 2. Summary of Safety and Immunogenicity Analyses of All Randomized Patients to Week 12 in the ENACT-1 Trial and to Week 60 in the ENACT-2 Trial.\n\n【49】Table 2 shows the overall incidence of adverse events. Two patients treated with natalizumab died during or after participation in the ENACT-1 study. The first patient died of asphyxiation resulting from an occupational accident, as determined by a subsequent government investigation. The second patient died from complications of surgery for a severe exacerbation of Crohn's disease 28 weeks after completing the study. No deaths occurred during the ENACT-2 study. No hematologic cancers occurred during either study. Basal-cell carcinoma of the skin developed in one patient in each group during the ENACT-2 study. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values in either treatment group in either trial. Natalizumab-treated patients had moderate and sustained elevations in the median absolute circulating lymphocyte count (not above the upper limit of normal; 2900 and 2800 cells per cubic millimeter at weeks 10 and 36, respectively), as compared with baseline (1600 cells per cubic millimeter), a predicted pharmacologic effect, reversible on cessation of treatment with natalizumab.\n\n【50】Table 2 shows the overall incidence of infections. Influenza and influenza-like illness occurred more frequently in the natalizumab group than in the placebo group in the ENACT-2 trial. Specific types of serious infections observed in each group are shown in Table 2 . During the ENACT-2 trial, there was one report each of varicella pneumonia (after exposure to a child who had varicella–zoster) and cytomegalovirus hepatitis judged by the investigator not to be serious, both in natalizumab-treated patients. Both resolved with appropriate medical therapy, and there were no sequelae. In addition, one patient who received three doses of natalizumab in combination with azathioprine during the ENACT-1 study, nine doses of placebo in combination with azathioprine during the ENACT-2 study, and five doses of natalizumab without azathioprine during an open-label extension study after early discontinuation from the ENACT-2 study died from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with the JC virus, a human polyomavirus.\n\n【51】During the ENACT-1 study, acute infusion reactions (any adverse event occurring within 120 minutes after the initiation of an infusion) occurred in 8 percent of patients in the placebo group and 11 percent of those who received natalizumab; the corresponding rates for the ENACT-2 study were 8 percent and 7 percent 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Hypersensitivity-like reactions occurred in 2 percent of patients in the placebo group and 5 percent of those in the natalizumab group in the ENACT-1 study; the corresponding rates in the ENACT-2 study were 1 percent and 3 percent 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【52】Immunogenicity\n--------------\n\n【53】Of the patients exposed to natalizumab during either study, 8 percent in the ENACT-1 study (53 of 650) and 9 percent in the ENACT-2 study (36 of 390) tested positive for antibodies against natalizumab (a positive test was defined as a concentration of at least 0.5 μg per milliliter at any time on at least one occasion). During the ENACT-2 study, patients were further classified as having persistent antibodies against natalizumab (defined as two positive antibody tests occurring at least six weeks apart or a single positive test at the last measurement) or transient antibodies (defined as antibody-positive but not meeting the definition of persistent antibodies). Patients in the ENACT-1 study could not be further classified because testing for antibodies was not performed until week 12. Six percent of patients in the ENACT-2 study were persistently positive for antibodies against natalizumab (23 of 390), and 3 percent were transiently positive (13 of 390). Testing was performed every 12 weeks during the ENACT-2 study. Concomitant immunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapy appeared to be moderately protective against the formation of antibodies against natalizumab in both trials, but the low overall rates of immunogenicity precluded statistical comparisons 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【54】Acute infusion reactions occurred in 45 percent of patients who tested positive for antibodies against natalizumab in the ENACT-1 trial (24 of 53), as compared with 9 percent of patients who tested negative for antibodies (54 of 597, P<0.001). Of 650 patients in the ENACT-1 study who were tested, 5 had a serious hypersensitivity-like reaction, 3 of whom were positive for antibodies against natalizumab. In the ENACT-2 safety population, 19 percent of patients who tested positive for antibodies against natalizumab (7 of 36, all of whom had persistent antibodies) had either an acute infusion reaction (3 patients) or a hypersensitivity-like reaction (4 patients), as compared with 7 percent of patients who tested negative for antibodies (26 of 354, P=0.02). Of 390 patients (2 percent) in the ENACT-2 study who were tested, 8 had a hypersensitivity-like reaction, 4 of whom were persistently positive for antibodies against natalizumab. Although the incidence of acute infusion and hypersensitivity-like reactions was low, these events occurred more frequently among patients with persistent, but not transient, antibodies against natalizumab.\n\n【55】In the ENACT-1 study, of the 8 percent of patients who were treated with natalizumab and who were positive for antibodies against natalizumab, 53 percent (28 of 53) had a response at week 12, as compared with 62 percent of patients who tested negative for antibodies (371 of 597, P=0.18). In the ENACT-2 study, 7 percent of patients who had a response to induction therapy with natalizumab and who were randomly reassigned to natalizumab (11 of 168) tested positive for antibodies against natalizumab (7 of these 11 patients had persistent antibodies). None of these patients with persistent antibodies maintained a response through week 60, as compared with 3 of 4 patients with transient antibodies (75 percent) and 87 of 156 patients who tested negative for antibodies (56 percent). In addition, median lymphocyte counts over time in the seven patients with persistent antibodies were similar to those in patients receiving placebo, whereas patients with transient antibodies continued to have the expected elevations in circulating lymphocyte counts.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】In patients with Crohn's disease, induction and sustained maintenance of response and remission (particularly in patients who have had no response to currently available agents), corticosteroid-sparing therapies, and improved drug safety constitute important unmet medical needs. Inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and migration to sites of inflamed tissue represents a unique mechanism of action for the treatment of Crohn's disease. Although the results of the ENACT-1 trial failed to demonstrate that induction treatment with natalizumab was superior to placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, the ENACT-2 trial showed that among the group of patients who had a response to natalizumab, response and remission were more likely to be sustained through 60 weeks if natalizumab treatment was continued rather than stopped after three treatments.\n\n【58】Data from two previous phase 2 induction trials suggested that natalizumab may be effective for the induction of a response and remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. The first double-blind, placebo-controlled study examined the efficacy of a single dose of natalizumab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The CDAI score decreased by a mean of 45 points among the 18 natalizumab-treated patients, although this reduction was not significantly different from the mean reduction among the 12 patients receiving placebo (11 points). 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The second double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study examined the efficacy of two doses of natalizumab (3 mg or 6 mg per kilogram) in 66 and 51 patients, one dose of natalizumab (3 mg per kilogram, followed by placebo) in 68 patients, or two doses of placebo in 63 patients. The findings of the prespecified primary analysis of remission at week 6 were not significant, but significant differences between natalizumab and placebo were observed at multiple times. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【59】The ENACT-1 trial failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of natalizumab for induction therapy. A similar phenomenon has been reported in other placebo-controlled trials of a variety of other biologic agents in patients with Crohn's disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9 </a></sup></u> Subgroup analyses of these other studies have demonstrated that a lower concentration of C-reactive protein was associated with a higher likelihood of a response to placebo. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of factors contributing to higher rates of a response to placebo in induction trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease demonstrated that the duration of the study (greater than eight weeks), the frequency of study visits (less than four weeks apart), and the CDAI score at entry (less than 200 points) were important predictors of the rate of remission in the placebo group, with the duration of the study as the most important independent predictor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】To better evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab as an induction agent, we analyzed subpopulations of patients from the ENACT-1 trial who had objectively confirmed active inflammation or chronically active disease despite conventional therapies. These analyses demonstrated significantly greater response and remission rates for natalizumab than for placebo in patients with elevated C-reactive protein concentrations, active disease despite the use of immunosuppressants, or prior receipt of anti–TNF-α therapy. The analyses of patients who did not have these markers of active inflammation showed numerically greater (but not significant) rates of response and remission for natalizumab than for placebo in all the subgroups except patients without an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein at baseline (these patients had numerically greater \\[but not significant\\] response and remission rates for placebo than for natalizumab).\n\n【61】In the ENACT-2 maintenance trial, patients who received natalizumab were more than twice as likely as those who received placebo to have a sustained clinical response and almost twice as likely to have a sustained remission. Furthermore, natalizumab treatment had significant corticosteroid-sparing effects; nearly half the natalizumab-treated patients who were receiving corticosteroids at baseline in the ENACT-1 trial were not taking corticosteroids by week 60 of the ENACT-2 study, and more than 40 percent were in remission and corticosteroid-free. An unexpectedly high percentage of patients with a response to placebo in the ENACT-1 trial maintained that clinical benefit in the ENACT-2 trial, whether randomly reassigned to natalizumab or placebo, suggesting that some of these patients may not have had active Crohn's disease during the studies.\n\n【62】The incidence of serious adverse events is an important consideration in assessing the risk–benefit ratio of induction and maintenance therapies. The safety profile observed in both studies was similar to those in previous natalizumab studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-5,11 </a></sup></u> All these trials lacked adequate statistical power to detect rare serious adverse events. Recently, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with the JC virus developed in two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> and in one patient with Crohn's disease (described above) 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> ; two of these patients died. Further evaluation of this serious adverse event in patients who have been treated with natalizumab for any indication is under way.\n\n【63】The incidences of antibodies against natalizumab after induction therapy and of persistent antibodies against natalizumab during maintenance therapy were low. Concomitant use of immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids, although not required for efficacy, may further reduce the formation of antibodies against natalizumab. When antibodies are persistently present, they appear to be associated with infusion reactions, hypersensitivity-like reactions, and loss of efficacy.\n\n【64】In conclusion, the response to induction therapy was nonsignificantly higher among patients treated with natalizumab than among patients who received placebo. Although the clinical benefit of therapy with natalizumab will ultimately need to be weighed against the potential risk of rare but serious adverse events, maintenance treatment with natalizumab in patients who had a response to natalizumab resulted in significantly higher rates of sustained response and remission and corticosteroid-sparing effects than withdrawal of treatment.\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a research grant from Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, Calif., and Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass., and by a grant (M01RR0058, to Dr. Sandborn) from the National Institutes of Health.</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Sandborn reports having served as a consultant and having received speaker's fees and grant support from Elan.

The obstetrical population presents a unique challenge during this pandemic, since these patients have multiple interactions with the health care system and eventually most are admitted to the hospital for delivery. We first diagnosed a case of Covid-19 in an obstetrical patient on March 13, 2020, and we previously reported our early experience with Covid-19 in pregnant women, including two initially asymptomatic women in whom symptoms developed and who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, after delivery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> After these two cases were identified, we implemented universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction test to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in women who were admitted for delivery.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Symptom Status and SARS-CoV-2 Test Results among 215 Obstetrical Patients Presenting for Delivery.\n\n【4】Between March 22 and April 4, 2020, a total of 215 pregnant women delivered infants at the New York–Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center . All the women were screened on admission for symptoms of Covid-19. Four women (1.9%) had fever or other symptoms of Covid-19 on admission, and all 4 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of the 211 women without symptoms, all were afebrile on admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 210 of the 211 women (99.5%) who did not have symptoms of Covid-19; of these women, 29 (13.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 29 of the 33 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission (87.9%) had no symptoms of Covid-19 at presentation.\n\n【5】Of the 29 women who had been asymptomatic but who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission, fever developed in 3 (10%) before postpartum discharge (median length of stay, 2 days). Two of these patients received antibiotics for presumed endomyometritis (although 1 patient did not have localizing symptoms), and 1 patient was presumed to be febrile due to Covid-19 and received supportive care. One patient with a swab that was negative for SARS-CoV-2 on admission became symptomatic postpartum; repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing 3 days after the initial test was positive.\n\n【6】Our use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all pregnant patients presenting for delivery revealed that at this point in the pandemic in New York City, most of the patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery were asymptomatic, and more than one in eight asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the labor and delivery unit were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although this prevalence has limited generalizability to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】The potential benefits of a universal testing approach include the ability to use Covid-19 status to determine hospital isolation practices and bed assignments, inform neonatal care, and guide the use of personal protective equipment. Access to such clinical data provides an important opportunity to protect mothers, babies, and health care teams during these challenging times.\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Desmond Sutton, M.D.  \nKarin Fuchs, M.D., M.H.A.  \nMary D’Alton, M.D.  \nDena Goffman, M.D.  \nColumbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY  \ndg2018@cumc.columbia.edu</u>\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>This letter was published on April 13, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>3 References</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>1.  1\\.

Initial laboratory studies revealed a pH of 7.2, a bicarbonate level of 8.8 mmol per liter, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 26 mm Hg, an anion gap of 15.4 mmol per liter, a lactate level of 6.9 mmol per liter, and a creatinine level of 1.8 mg per deciliter, with a normal blood sugar level and no ketones.\n\n【3】After four days of treatment, the patient's acidosis was worse (pH, 6.9; bicarbonate level, 6.2 mmol per liter; anion gap, 17.8 mmol per liter), despite a slow improvement in the lactate level (to 4.5 mmol per liter). The serum osmolality was 462 mOsm per liter with an osmolal gap of 165 mOsm per liter. Standard blood tests for methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol were negative. It was noted that the woman was being sedated with increasing doses of intravenous lorazepam (up to 30 mg per hour), which contained 0.18 ml of polyethylene glycol–400 (PEG-400) in propylene glycol with 2 percent benzyl alcohol per 2-mg vial. She had received 1696 mg of lorazepam in 78 hours, for a cumulative PEG-400 dose of 153 ml. Despite treatment with fomepizole, a polyethylene glycol antagonist that is administered intravenously, she required hemodialysis. After three hemodialysis sessions, the patient's pH and bicarbonate level had improved (7.37 and 26 mmol per liter, respectively), and her osmolal gap had decreased to 40 mOsm per liter. She was discharged after 26 days in the hospital. Her renal function was stable; the creatinine level was 1.7 mg per deciliter. It should be noted that our laboratory was unable to quantify the levels of PEG-400, its metabolites, or benzyl alcohol.\n\n【4】Polyethylene glycol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase to hydroxy acid and diacid metabolites, possibly contributing to the development of metabolic acidosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> In previous reports polyethylene glycol has been implicated in hyperosmolar states, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> acute renal failure, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> and mild metabolic acidosis 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> due to the topical or intravenous use of various drugs, including lorazepam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Although our patient had preexisting metabolic anion-gap acidosis, we believe that the large dose of intravenous lorazepam that she received contributed to the development of severe, hyperosmolar metabolic acidosis.\n\n【5】参考删除-2:<u>Jean Tayar, M.D.  \nGeorge Jabbour, M.D.  \nSubodh J.
