The fall in Pco <sub>2 </sub> with a rising blood pH during dialysis seemed to exert the major influence in increasing the protein-bound calcium and magnesium. The relation between dialysate and post-dialysis plasma calcium and magnesium at the normal pH may be expressed by the ratios 1:1.70 and 1:1.46 respectively.

We used a triple-crossover design and a composite of three outcomes (exacerbations, asthma-control days, and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second) to determine whether the frequency of a differential response to the step-up regimens was more than 25%.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A differential response occurred in 161 of 165 patients who were evaluated (P<0.001).

Higher scores on the Asthma Control Test before randomization (indicating better control at baseline) predicted a better response to LABA step-up (P=0.009).

LABA step-up was significantly more likely to provide the best response than either ICS or LTRA step-up. However, many children had a best response to ICS or LTRA step-up therapy, highlighting the need to regularly monitor and appropriately adjust each child's asthma therapy. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00395304 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Uncontrolled asthma occurs in many children who receive treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. In the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT), 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> administration of 100 μg of fluticasone twice daily was the most effective therapy, but uncontrolled asthma occurred in more than 50% of the children, and 39% of the children had at least one asthma exacerbation that was treated with oral corticosteroids during a 48-week period. The few data that are available to guide practitioners about how to treat children whose asthma is poorly controlled while they are receiving low-dose inhaled corticosteroids 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-8 </a></sup></u> are inconsistent. The discrepancies may be related to the choice of a single primary outcome measure (e.g., peak expiratory flow); to differences in the duration of treatment, eligibility criteria, or choice of comparison groups; and to evaluation of the responses of groups rather than of individual patients. Evidence from comparison studies is needed to establish which step-up therapy is best and whether there are phenotypic or genotypic characteristics that can be used to predict whether a child will have a better response to one particular step-up treatment than to another.\n\n【12】In this study, called the Best Add-on Therapy Giving Effective Responses (BADGER) trial, we assessed the frequency of differential responses to three blinded step-up treatments in children who had uncontrolled asthma while receiving low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. We used a three-way crossover design with a composite of outcomes (asthma exacerbations, asthma-control days, and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second \\[FEV <sub>1 </sub> \\]), which allowed us to determine the probability that a given treatment would produce the best response. We also determined whether specific baseline characteristics could be used to predict the response to step-up treatment.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【15】From March 2007 through July 2008, we recruited patients, 6 to 17 years of age, at Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network centers. Inclusion criteria were mild-to-moderate asthma diagnosed by a physician on the basis of criteria recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> an ability to perform reproducible spirometry, an FEV <sub>1 </sub> of at least 60% before bronchodilation, and an increase in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> of at least 12% (bronchodilator reversibility) or a methacholine provocation concentration causing a 20% fall (PC <sub>20 </sub> ) in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> of 12.5 mg per milliliter or less.\n\n【16】Each center's institutional review board approved the study, and parents or guardians provided written informed consent. In addition, children under 7 years of age provided oral assent, and older children provided written assent.\n\n【17】Study Protocol\n--------------\n\n【18】The protocol that we used to guide study procedures is provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Briefly, all patients were enrolled in a run-in period of 2 to 8 weeks to determine whether their asthma was poorly controlled while they were receiving 100 μg of fluticasone twice daily. The run-in period could be shortened by up to 1 week for safety reasons in case of a sudden worsening in symptoms. Patients or their parents or guardians recorded symptoms and peak-flow determinations in a diary each day. A patient became eligible for randomization after the documentation of uncontrolled asthma, which was defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following for more than 2 days per week on average during a 2-week period: diary-reported symptoms (coughing rated as moderate or severe or wheezing rated as mild, moderate, or severe), rescue use of an inhaled bronchodilator with two or more puffs per day, or peak flows under 80% of the predetermined reference value.\n\n【19】Patients then entered a randomized, double-blind, three-treatment, three-period crossover trial for a total of 48 weeks. During each 16-week period, patients received 250 μg of fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, GlaxoSmithKline) twice daily (inhaled-corticosteroid \\[ICS\\] step-up therapy), 100 μg of fluticasone plus 50 μg of the long-acting beta-agonist salmeterol (Advair Diskus, GlaxoSmithKline) twice daily (LABA step-up therapy), or 100 μg of fluticasone twice daily plus 5 or 10 mg of the leukotriene-receptor antagonist montelukast (Singulair, Merck) daily (LTRA step-up therapy). The drug assignments were masked with the use of placebo tablets and dummy disk devices that discharged powder without the active drug. The initial 4 weeks of the last two 16-week periods were considered to be the active washout from the previous period.\n\n【20】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes and Schedule of Evaluations.\n\n【21】Panel A shows the number of patients who enrolled in the study, underwent randomization, and completed the study. FEV <sub>1 </sub> denotes forced expiratory volume in 1 second, PC <sub>20 </sub> provocation concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV <sub>1 </sub> , and PFT pulmonary-function test. Panel B shows the schedule for various tests and procedures and the administration of the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire to assess asthma impairment at specific study visits. Visit 2a was the randomization visit. ACT denotes Asthma Control Test, BR4P bronchodilator response to four puffs of albuterol, c-ACT Childhood Asthma Control Test, FeNO fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, FO forced oscillometry, and QOL quality-of-life questionnaire.\n\n【22】Patients received an open-label metered-dose inhaler of albuterol (Ventolin HFA, GlaxoSmithKline), prednisone, and a customized written action plan to guide use. A standardized course of prednisone treatment was initiated for an asthma exacerbation if predetermined clinical criteria were met. Asthma characteristics were assessed by means of CARE Network procedures that have been described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Measurements of the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide and methacholine bronchoprovocation were performed as described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> We administered the validated Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> to assess patients' impairment from asthma, with scores ranging from 1 to 7 and higher scores indicating less impairment (with a minimally important difference \\[MID\\] of 0.5); the Asthma Control Test 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> (for children 12 years of age or older), with scores ranging from 5 to 25 and higher scores indicating greater control (with an MID of 3.0); and the Childhood Asthma Control Test 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> (for children between the ages of 4 and 11 years), with scores ranging from 0 to 27 and higher scores indicating greater control (with an undefined MID).\n\n【23】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【24】The primary outcome was the differential response to each of the three step-up therapies on the basis of fixed threshold criteria for the following three asthma-control measures: the need for treatment with oral prednisone for acute asthma exacerbations, the number of asthma-control days, and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> . One treatment period was ranked as better than another if the total amount of prednisone received during the period was at least 180 mg less, if the number of annualized asthma-control days during the final 12 weeks of the period was increased by at least 31 days, or if the FEV <sub>1 </sub> at the end of the period was at least 5% higher. If the prednisone threshold was met, then we ignored the number of asthma-control days and the FEV <sub>1 </sub> . If the threshold for asthma-control days was met, then we ignored the FEV <sub>1 </sub> . Otherwise, the order of response was determined by the FEV <sub>1 </sub> . If none of the thresholds were met, then we gave the same rank to each treatment period and the patient was considered not to have had a differential response. A patient was considered to have had a differential response if at least one treatment period was ranked as better than another.\n\n【25】Oral prednisone was administered according to a protocol that has been described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> An asthma-control day, as documented in each patient's diary, was a day during which there was no use of albuterol rescue (excluding the use of albuterol as preexercise treatment), no use of a nonstudy asthma medication, no daytime or nighttime asthma symptoms, no unscheduled visit to a health care provider for asthma, and no peak expiratory flow of less than 80% of the predetermined reference value. We calculated annualized asthma-control days as 365 times the proportion of asthma-control days during the final 12 weeks of the period, which were adjusted for seasonal differences.\n\n【26】Study Oversight\n---------------\n\n【27】Fluticasone and salmeterol were donated by the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, which also donated the albuterol that was provided to patients; montelukast was donated by Merck. The manufacturers had no role in the study design, the accrual or analyses of data, or the preparation of the manuscript. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】The primary analysis involved two stages: a one-sided exact test for binomial proportions to test the null hypothesis that the percentage of patients with a differential response (i.e., those for whom the three treatments were not ranked the same) would be less than or equal to 25% at the 0.01 significance level, and if there was a significant result in stage one, a rank-ordered logistic regression 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> to test whether four prespecified baseline covariates would predict distinct patterns of differential responses. Each covariate was tested at the 0.01 significance level so that the overall type I error rate for the primary analysis was 0.05. Secondary analyses tested the predictive values of other baseline covariates at the 0.05 significance level.\n\n【30】The number of patients who were enrolled in the study provided adequate power for both stages of the primary analysis. A total sample of 180 patients, with an assumed 15% loss to follow-up, would provide a power of 90% for the first stage if the true percentage of patients with a differential response was at least 40%, and would provide the same power for each of the four prespecified covariates in the second stage if the covariate predicted a change of more than 15% in the probability of a best response for each treatment.\n\n【31】We constructed rank-ordered logit models and calculated bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals with the use of Stata software, version 11. Classification analysis was used to examine the goodness of fit of the model. Model results are presented for dichotomized covariates to simplify interpretation of continuous predictors. Sensitivity analyses also modeled them as ordinal covariates (quartiles) and continuous covariates to confirm that dichotomization did not mask relationships. Sensitivity analyses assessed the possible influence of treatment carryover effects by testing for period effect and treatment-by-period interaction effect in the regression models.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【34】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【35】Of the 480 patients who were enrolled, 298 were excluded during the run-in phase. Thus, 182 patients underwent randomization, of whom 157 completed all three study periods 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. A total of 165 patients completed two study periods, permitting assessment of the differential response. Table 1 presents baseline demographic and physiological data, stratified according to age group. (Baseline data stratified according to the study-group assignment during period 1 are available in Table E1 in the Supplementary Appendix .) Patients completed 90% of the study visits and provided sufficient data in the symptom diaries to determine control status on 96% of study days. The rate of adherence to study medication was 84% for study tablets (as measured by an electronic monitor in the bottle cap) and 87% for study inhalers (as measured by a disk counter).\n\n【36】Differential Response to the Three Step-up Therapies\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】A differential response occurred in 161 of 165 patients (98%), a proportion that was significantly greater than the one-sided null hypothesis of 25% (P<0.001). The percentage of asthma-control days differed according to season in all study groups, ranging from 71% in winter months to 79% in summer months. Asthma exacerbations were most frequent during winter months. The average FEV <sub>1 </sub> (measured as a percentage of the predicted value) varied by less than 1% across seasons. Seasonal variation affected only 12% of patients for whom the number of annualized asthma-control days determined the differential response. Sensitivity analysis indicated that seasonal differences in the FEV <sub>1 </sub> had no significant effect on the results, whereas seasonal differences in exacerbations had a small effect that was neither statistically nor qualitatively significant.\n\n【38】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Pairwise Comparison of Three Step-up Therapies and the Overall Probability of Best Response.\n\n【39】Panel A shows pairwise comparisons of the three step-up therapies. The proportion of patients with a best response to a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) step-up was higher than the proportion with a best response to a leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA) step-up (52% vs. 34%, P=0.02) or an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) step-up (54% vs. 32%, P=0.004); the best-response results for LTRA step-up were similar to those for an ICS step-up. Panel B shows the pattern of differential response according to the probability that the best response to a treatment occurred during the period in which that treatment was received; LABA step-up was most likely to provide the best response. Covariate-adjusted estimates were obtained from rank-ordered logistic-regression models; I bars indicate bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【40】Subsequent analyses were performed to characterize the pattern of differential response. In pairwise comparisons, the proportion of patients who had a better response to LABA step-up was higher than the proportion with a better response to LTRA step-up (52% vs. 34%, P=0.02), and the proportion with a better response to LABA step-up was higher than the proportion with a better response to ICS step-up (54% vs. 32%, P=0.004), whereas the responses to LTRA and ICS step-up therapies were similar 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A )</u>. The primary outcome of the trial, a three-way comparison of step-up therapy with the use of rank-ordered logistic regression, predicted that the response to LABA step-up was significantly more likely to be the best response, as compared with the response to LTRA step-up (relative probability, 1.6; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.1 to 2.3; P=0.004) and the response to ICS step-up (relative probability, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4; P=0.002) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>.\n\n【41】Primary Analysis of Predictors of Differential Response\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Primary Predictors of a Differential Response to Step-up Therapy.\n\n【43】The four factors that are shown were preselected as potential predictors of a differential response among patients receiving step-up therapy with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), or a leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA). Three of these factors did not identify distinct patterns of differential response: the methacholine provocation concentration causing a 20% fall (PC <sub>20 </sub> ) in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (Panel A), the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (Panel B), and the genotype for the β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic receptor (Panel D). The fourth factor — the baseline score on the Asthma Control Test (for children 12 years of age or older, measured on a scale of 5 to 25) or the Childhood Asthma Control Test (for children between the ages of 4 and 11 years, measured on a scale from 0 to 27, with higher scores on both tests indicating greater control) — did identify distinct patterns of differential response (P=0.009), with scores of more than 19 predicting an increased likelihood of a best response to LABA step-up therapy (Panel C). Estimates were obtained from rank-ordered logistic-regression models; I bars indicate bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【44】The ability of the four preselected factors to predict patterns of differential response is shown in Figure 3 . Patterns of differential response were not predicted by methacholine PC <sub>20 </sub> values, either dichotomized at the median baseline value (P=0.2) or examined as a continuous covariate (P=0.37) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3A )</u>, or by the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, either dichotomized at the median baseline value (P=0.7) or examined as a continuous covariate (P=0.52) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3B )</u>. Baseline scores on the Asthma Control Test and the Childhood Asthma Control Test that were dichotomized at validated numerical scores indicative of acceptable control (>19) or unacceptable control (≤19) significantly predicted patterns of differential response (P=0.009), with higher scores predicting a greater probability that the best response would be to LABA step-up 删除2:<u>( Figure 3C )</u>. Finally, the genotype at position 16 of the β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic receptor did not predict patterns of response (P=0.49) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3D )</u>.\n\n【45】Secondary Analysis of Predictors of Differential Response\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【46】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Secondary Predictors of a Differential Response to Step-up Therapy.\n\n【47】Shown is the probability of a best response to step-up therapy with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), or a leukotriene-receptor antagonist (LTRA), according to race or ethnic group, age, and the presence or absence of eczema, factors that were evaluated in post hoc analysis. Race or ethnic group was a significant predictor (P=0.005), with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients most likely to have a best response to LABA step-up therapy and black patients equally likely to have a best response to LABA or ICS step-up and least likely to have a best response to LTRA step-up (Panel A). Age was not a significant predictor of a differential response (Panel B). Patients who did not have eczema were most likely to have a best response to LABA step-up therapy (P=0.006) (Panel C). Estimates were obtained from rank-ordered logistic-regression models; I bars indicate bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals. P values have not been corrected for multiple testing.\n\n【48】We evaluated other factors post hoc, including demographic and physiological characteristics and asthma history, as predictors of a differential response. Figure 4 shows the clinical relevance of three of these factors: race or ethnic group, the presence or absence of eczema, and age. Race or ethnic group significantly predicted patterns of differential response (P=0.005 without correction for multiple testing), with Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients most likely to have a best response to LABA step-up and least likely to have a best response to ICS step-up, and black patients equally likely to have a best response to LABA or ICS step-up therapy and less likely to have a best response to LTRA step-up 删除2:<u>( Figure 4A )</u>. There were no differences in the patterns of differential response according to age, whether age was examined as a dichotomous covariate (5 to 11 years or ≥12 years) or as a continuous covariate 删除2:<u>( Figure 4B )</u>. Finally, patients who did not have eczema were most likely to have a best response to LABA step-up (P=0.006 without correction for multiple testing) 删除2:<u>( Figure 4C )</u>.\n\n【49】Of the seven other factors examined post hoc to predict patterns of differential response, none were significant as either dichotomous or continuous covariates. Factors that were evaluated were sex (P=0.10), presence or absence of perennial allergen sensitization (P=0.16), baseline prebronchodilator FEV <sub>1 </sub> of 90% or less or more than 90% (P=0.70), bronchodilator reversibility (>10% vs. ≤10%) (P=0.08), previous use or nonuse of a controller medication (P=0.90), the baseline number of asthma-control days (P=0.08), and the number of recent asthma exacerbations (0 vs. ≥1) (P=0.90).\n\n【50】The rank-ordered logit model that included only the significant predictors correctly classified the observed ranks 68% of the time. The interaction between period and treatment according to period was not significant, indicating that it was unlikely that effects of treatment carryover could have biased the results.\n\n【51】Adverse Events\n--------------\n\n【52】There were seven serious adverse events, one during the run-in period (asthma exacerbation) and six during the treatment phase (five of which required hospitalization): two each in the LABA step-up group (asthma exacerbation and appendicitis), the LTRA step-up group (asthma exacerbation and need for tonsillectomy–adenoidectomy), and the ICS step-up group (asthma exacerbation and behavioral issues not requiring hospitalization). Thrush that was classified as probably related to the study drug was reported in one patient during treatment with LABA step-up and in two patients during treatment with ICS step-up. A total of 25 treatment failures occurred: 3 hospitalizations for asthma-related symptoms (1 during each study treatment) and 22 involving the need for a second prednisone burst (3 during treatment with LABA, 8 during treatment with ICS, and 11 during treatment with LTRA). A total of 120 prednisone bursts were prescribed for asthma exacerbations (30 during treatment with LABA, 47 during treatment with ICS, and 43 during treatment with LTRA) (for details, see Table E2 in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【53】Discussion\n----------\n\n【54】In this trial, we examined step-up strategies for children who had uncontrolled asthma while receiving low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. When the three step-up treatments were compared, 98% of the children had a differential response, with the best response during LABA step-up occurring significantly more frequently than during LTRA or ICS step-up. The direction of this best response should not have been biased by the entry criteria, because 20% of the children qualified for the study on the basis of bronchodilator reversibility alone, 58% qualified on the basis of methacholine hyperresponsiveness alone, and 22% met both criteria. Moreover, FEV <sub>1 </sub> values after bronchodilation were not significant predictors of the response to LABA step-up, providing further evidence against this bias.\n\n【55】Our findings suggest that there is a ceiling effect of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids in many, though not all, children. Our data show that to achieve improvements in asthma control, the addition of a different class of medication is often required. Furthermore, although LABA step-up therapy was most likely to provide the best response, some children had a best response to one of the other step-up therapies. For the most part, baseline characteristics did not predict the therapy most likely to be best for an individual patient. We found that baseline scores on the Asthma Control Test and the Childhood Asthma Control Test indicating better control were associated with a higher probability that LABA would be the best add-on therapy. The predictive value of other characteristics may have been limited by run-in treatment — for example, baseline values for the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide and PC <sub>20 </sub> were obtained after at least 2 weeks of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids, unlike the predictive value of these measures in children who had not received inhaled corticosteroids, as reported in PACT. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】In secondary analyses, findings regarding self-reported race or ethnic group were noteworthy. Black patients were equally likely to have a best response to LABA or ICS step-up therapy and were least likely to have a best response to LTRA step-up. In contrast, in white subjects, LABA step-up was clearly most likely to provide the best response. A number of studies have reported a differential response to asthma therapy on the basis of race or ethnic group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,18 </a></sup></u> These differences appear to primarily involve responsiveness to beta-agonists, which may be related to genetic variations 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and gene-by-gene interactions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】The observed best overall performance of LABA therapy should be weighed against the potential increased risks of such therapy that are cited in the Food and Drug Administration's approved labeling. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> Our study was not designed or powered to evaluate the long-term safety of LABA in children. Although we found that LABA step-up therapy was associated with the smallest number of treatment failures and exacerbations, the between-group differences were not significant, and we emphasize that the duration of our trial and the size of our sample preclude statements regarding long-term risks. Clinicians who prescribe LABAs (never to be used as monotherapy 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> ) in combination with inhaled corticosteroids should continue to evaluate risk–benefit ratios.\n\n【58】Despite step-up in daily therapy, 120 exacerbations requiring the use of oral corticosteroids occurred during the treatment periods. Day-to-day asthma control, as reflected by the number of asthma-control days, was quite good with all three step-up therapies. However, none of the step-up therapies completely prevented asthma exacerbations. These findings underscore the need for new therapies aimed at preventing exacerbations.\n\n【59】In summary, our study showed a clinically significant differential response in nearly all the children and identified several characteristics of the children that predicted the direction of differential responses, including race or ethnic group and two readily available clinical attributes: asthma control, as indicated by the score on the Asthma Control Test, and the presence or absence of eczema. More expensive and labor-intensive measures of physiological factors (e.g., methacholine PC <sub>20 </sub> ) and biomarkers (e.g., the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide) did not have predictive value. Although LABA step-up was significantly more likely to provide the best response than either ICS or LTRA step-up, many children had a best response to ICS or LTRA step-up, highlighting the need to regularly monitor and appropriately adjust each child's asthma therapy within this level of care before further step-up.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (HL064307, HL064288, HL064295, HL064287, HL064305, and HL064313), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (T32AI007635), and the Clinical Translational Science Award program of the National Center for Research Resources (UL1-RR025011 \\[Wisconsin\\], UL1-RR025780 \\[Colorado\\], and UL1-RR024992 \\[St. Louis\\]).

We measured plasma concentrations of circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (cachectin), interleukin-1β, and gamma interferon, together with physiologic and hormonal responses, in 13 healthy men after intravenous administration of _Escherichia coli_ endotoxin (4 ng per kilogram of body weight) and during a control period of saline administration. Eight additional subjects received ibuprofen before receiving endotoxin or saline.\n\n【2】Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor were generally less than 35 pg per milliliter throughout the control period, but increased 90 to 180 minutes after endotoxin administration to mean peak concentrations of 240±70 pg per milliliter, as compared with 35±5 pg per milliliter after saline administration. Host responses were temporally associated with the increase in circulating tumor necrosis factor at 90 minutes, and the extent of symptoms, changes in white-cell count, and production of ACTH were temporally related to the peak concentration of tumor necrosis factor. Ibuprofen pretreatment did not prevent the rise in circulating tumor necrosis factor (mean peak plasma level, 170±70 pg per milliliter) but greatly attenuated the symptoms and other responses after endotoxin administration.

Cryptosporidium oocysts were identified in the stools of 58 of 147 patients with gastroenteritis (39 percent) tested during the outbreak. Studies for bacterial, viral, and other parasitic pathogens failed to implicate any other agent. In a random telephone survey, 299 of 489 household members exposed to the public water supply (61 percent) reported gastrointestinal illness, as compared with 64 of 322 (20 percent) who were not exposed (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 3.9). The prevalence of IgG to cryptosporidium was significantly higher among exposed respondents to the survey who had become ill than among nonresident controls.\n\n【2】Cryptosporidium oocysts were identified in samples of treated public water with use of a monoclonal-antibody test. Although the sand-filtered and chlorinated water system met all regulatory-agency quality standards, sub-optimal flocculation and filtration probably allowed the parasite to pass into the drinking-water supply. Low-level cryptosporidium infection in cattle in the watershed and a sewage overflow were considered as possible contributors to the contamination of the surface-water supply.\n\n【3】We conclude that current standards for the treatment of public water supplies may not prevent the contamination of drinking water by cryptosporidium, with consequent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1989; 320:1372–6.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

The women were grouped according to smoking status, and serum levels of estrone and estradiol were measured before and after treatment.\n\n【2】The results showed reduced levels of both estrogens in smokers as compared with nonsmokers in all three dosage groups. This reduction was most pronounced in the high-dose group (4 mg of estradiol), in which the serum levels of estrone and estradiol in smokers were only 50 per cent of those in nonsmokers (P<0.001 and <0.05, respectively). In contrast, no significant changes could be demonstrated in the corresponding placebo groups. Moreover, it was possible to demonstrate significant inverse correlations between the number of cigarettes smoked daily and the changes in the levels of serum estrone and estradiol, respectively, (P<0.001).\n\n【3】This study suggests that an increased hepatic metabolism of estrogens results in lower estrogen levels among postmenopausal smokers.

This study aimed to determine whether treatment with intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) would improve symptoms in patients who had heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and iron deficiency, either with or without anemia.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We enrolled 459 patients with chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less (for patients with NYHA class II) or 45% or less (for NYHA class III), iron deficiency (ferritin level <100 μg per liter or between 100 and 299 μg per liter, if the transferrin saturation was <20%), and a hemoglobin level of 95 to 135 g per liter. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive 200 mg of intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) or saline (placebo). The primary end points were the self-reported Patient Global Assessment and NYHA functional class, both at week 24. Secondary end points included the distance walked in 6 minutes and the health-related quality of life.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose, 50% reported being much or moderately improved, as compared with 28% of patients receiving placebo, according to the Patient Global Assessment (odds ratio for improvement, 2.51; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.75 to 3.61). Among the patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose, 47% had an NYHA functional class I or II at week 24, as compared with 30% of patients assigned to placebo (odds ratio for improvement by one class, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.55 to 3.71). Results were similar in patients with anemia and those without anemia. Significant improvements were seen with ferric carboxymaltose in the distance on the 6-minute walk test and quality-of-life assessments. The rates of death, adverse events, and serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Treatment with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency, with or without anemia, improves symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life; the side-effect profile is acceptable. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00520780 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Recent developments in the management of chronic heart failure in patients with an impaired left ventricular ejection fraction have changed the natural history of this clinical syndrome and improved patients' outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> However, the normal daily activities of many patients with heart failure remain restricted; they report symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea that adversely affect their quality of life, leading to high morbidity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Therapeutic options to improve functional capacity in patients with heart failure are limited, and novel therapies are needed.\n\n【12】Numerous mechanisms unrelated to hemodynamic dysfunction may underlie impaired exercise tolerance in patients with chronic heart failure. Among them, inadequate oxygen supply and impaired oxygen use by skeletal muscle during exercise contribute to poor clinical status. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> In addition, anemia may aggravate symptoms in patients with heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Targeting these abnormalities may confer functional benefits to such patients.\n\n【13】Iron plays a key role in oxygen uptake, transport, and storage, as well as oxidative metabolism in the skeletal muscle; it also is involved in erythropoiesis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> Traditionally, iron deficiency has been considered to have clinical consequences only in the presence of anemia. Alternatively, a reduced hemoglobin level can be viewed as the end result of a process beginning with the gradual depletion of iron stores. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9,10 </a></sup></u> Iron deficiency in patients with or without anemia attenuates aerobic performance and is accompanied by reports of fatigue and exercise intolerance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> The repletion of iron in patients who have iron deficiency without heart failure improves cognitive, symptomatic, and exercise performance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Recently, it has been recognized that patients with heart failure may be prone to the development of iron deficiency as a consequence of a depletion of iron stores or defective iron absorption and the reduced availability of iron recycled in the reticuloendothelial system. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,15 </a></sup></u> Four small studies showed that the correction of iron deficiency with the use of intravenous iron in patients with chronic heart failure may result in clinical benefits. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-19 </a></sup></u> In one of these studies, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> the symptomatic benefit was similar in patients with anemia and those without anemia. We designed our randomized, double-blind study, called the Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) trial, to determine whether the correction of iron deficiency with the use of intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) confers symptomatic benefits in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】From June 25, 2007, through December 31, 2008, a total of 459 eligible patients were enrolled from 75 sites in 11 countries 删除2:<u>(Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. The study design has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating center, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local and national regulations. Written informed consent was provided by all patients before any study-related procedures were performed.\n\n【18】The trial was designed, implemented, and overseen by the FAIR-HF Executive Committee, together with representatives of the sponsor, Vifor Pharma (Glattbrugg, Switzerland). ClinStar (Moscow) was responsible for on-site monitoring of sites in Russia and Ukraine. Kendle (Munich, Germany) was responsible for on-site monitoring in other countries, in addition to data collection and data management. SOCAR Research (Nyon, Switzerland) was responsible for data analysis. Analyses were performed independently of the sponsor, according to a predefined plan of statistical analysis. The medical statistics unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine performed the same analyses, separately, with identical results. The manuscript was prepared and submitted for publication by the FAIR-HF Executive Committee. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed the safety data on an ongoing basis. The authors had access to the study data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and analyses.\n\n【19】Recruitment and Follow-up of Study Patients\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Eligible subjects included ambulatory patients who had chronic heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less (for patients in NYHA class II) or 45% or less (for patients in NYHA class III), a hemoglobin level at the screening visit between 95 and 135 g per liter, and iron deficiency. The presence or absence of iron deficiency was determined on the basis of results received from the central laboratory. Iron deficiency was diagnosed when the serum ferritin level was less than 100 μg per liter or was between 100 and 299 μg per liter when the transferrin saturation was less than 20%. Patients were excluded if they had uncontrolled hypertension, other clinically significant heart disease, inflammation, or clinically significantly impaired liver or renal function.\n\n【21】Randomization\n-------------\n\n【22】Before the iron-correction phase was begun, a clinical history, physical examination, 6-minute walk test results, and 12-lead electrocardiogram were obtained for each patient. We also performed assessments of the health-related quality of life in all patients. Using a central interactive voice-response system, we randomly assigned eligible patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either ferric carboxymaltose (provided by Vifor Pharma) or placebo (normal saline).\n\n【23】Study Therapy and Blinding\n--------------------------\n\n【24】The total iron dose required for iron repletion was calculated at baseline, according to Ganzoni's formula 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and the mean of the two hemoglobin values obtained during the screening period. The ferric carboxymaltose or saline was administered as an intravenous bolus injection of 4 ml (which is the amount of ferric carboxymaltose in a water solution for injection that is equivalent to 200 mg of iron). The dosing frequency was weekly until iron repletion was achieved (the correction phase) and then every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase, which started at week 8 or week 12, depending on the required iron-repletion dose.\n\n【25】Because ferric carboxymaltose is a dark-brown solution that is easily distinguishable from the saline placebo, study personnel responsible for the preparation and administration of the study drug (including at least one physician) were aware of the group assignments and therefore were not involved in any study assessments. To ensure that patients were unaware of the study drug they were receiving, black syringes were used to administer the study treatment and a curtain (or something similar) was used to shield the injection site from the patient's view.\n\n【26】The central laboratory sent results regarding measures of iron metabolism and hemoglobin only to the study personnel who were aware of the group assignments. These persons were responsible for evaluating for the presence of elevated iron-metabolism measurements or severe anemia and for implementing the following procedures, as defined in the protocol. If the ferritin level exceeded 800 μg per liter or was between 500 and 800 μg per liter with a transferrin saturation of more than 50%, or if the hemoglobin level was higher than 160 g per liter, ferric carboxymaltose was discontinued and placebo was given instead. In this case, the ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin levels were reassessed. After the ferritin level had dropped to less than 400 μg per liter, the transferrin saturation to under 45%, and the hemoglobin level to less than 160 g per liter, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose could be restarted. If severe anemia (hemoglobin level, ≤90 g per liter) developed, the study treatment was permanently discontinued. The follow-up of such patients continued, and further management of anemia was performed at the investigator's discretion.\n\n【27】In addition to the dosing visits, at weeks 4, 12, 24, and 26, patients were assessed for efficacy and safety.\n\n【28】Primary and Secondary End Points\n--------------------------------\n\n【29】The primary end points were the self-reported Patient Global Assessment 删除2:<u>(Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u> and NYHA functional class (adjusted for the class at baseline) at week 24. Secondary end points included the self-reported Patient Global Assessment and NYHA functional class at week 4 and week 12, as well as the distance on the 6-minute walk test and the overall score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> (on which the overall score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life) and the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> (on which the score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better health) at weeks 4, 12, and 24 (all adjusted for the baseline data).\n\n【30】Safety end points were serious and nonserious adverse events, hospitalization, and death, as assessed up to week 26. Standardized definitions for the causes of death and hospitalization were developed by members of the FAIR-HF Executive Committee and were supplied to all investigators. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】Data analysis for efficacy was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle for each assigned study group. The planned sample size of 402 patients — 268 in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 134 in the placebo group — was calculated on the basis of assumptions that the study would have a statistical power of 90% (with a two-sided alpha of 0.025) to detect a mean difference in the NYHA class of 0.50 and in the self-reported Patient Global Assessment ranking of 0.90 (the primary end points) between the two study groups. Assuming that 10% of patients would not complete the week 24 visit, the planned sample size was increased to 442. Both primary end points were compared between the two study groups by means of polytomous regression. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> For data on the NYHA class, the model was adjusted for the baseline value. The alpha value was adjusted according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【33】Missing data on the NYHA class and the self-reported Patient Global Assessment were imputed from data collected during the previous follow-up visit, according to the last–observation-carried-forward method, for patients who were known to be alive and not hospitalized at the time of the assessment. For hospitalized patients, a missing NYHA class was assigned as class IV and a missing self-reported Patient Global Assessment was assigned as “much worse.” For patients who had died, a missing NYHA class was assigned as class V and a missing self-reported Patient Global Assessment was assigned as “died.” The analysis regarding the primary end points was restricted to data for patients who had at least one valid self-reported Patient Global Assessment or NYHA value, respectively, during the follow-up period.\n\n【34】For the continuous variables, changes from the baseline value and values at weeks 4, 12, and 24 were compared between the ferric carboxymaltose group and the placebo group by comparing the means within each of the two study groups at each visit with the use of a model for repeated measures adjusted for baseline values. For categorical end points, differences in the distribution for each of the two study groups were tested by means of ordered polytomous regression. Tests for interaction were performed as part of the subgroup analysis regarding the primary end points by adding an interaction term to the ordered polytomous regression model. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios for safety outcomes on the basis of the treatment received. Event rates are reported per person-year at risk. All analyses were conducted with the use of SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute).\n\n【35】Results\n-------\n\n【36】Characteristics of the Study Patients\n-------------------------------------\n\n【37】Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Study Patients in the Intention-to-Treat Population, According to Study Group.\n\n【38】The clinical characteristics of 459 patients are presented in Table 1 . A total of 304 patients were randomly assigned to receive ferric carboxymaltose and 155 to receive placebo. The two groups were similar with respect to the baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics and the use of cardiovascular medications at the time of enrollment.\n\n【39】Follow-up\n---------\n\n【40】Of the 304 patients assigned to receive ferric carboxymaltose, 26 (8.6%) did not complete the 24 weeks of follow-up; of these 26, 5 had died and 21 had withdrawn 删除2:<u>(Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Of the 155 patients assigned to receive placebo, 20 (12.9%) did not complete the 24 weeks of follow-up; of these 20, 4 had died and 16 had withdrawn.\n\n【41】Primary End Points\n------------------\n\n【42】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Self-Reported Patient Global Assessment and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class at Week 24, According to Assigned Study Treatment.\n\n【43】Panel A shows the data regarding the self-reported Patient Global Assessment, and Panel B, data regarding the NYHA functional class. The odds ratio for an improvement in the self-reported Patient Global Assessment with ferric carboxymaltose as compared with placebo was 2.51 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.75 to 3.61; P<0.001). Data on the self-reported Patient Global Assessment were missing for 30 patients known to be alive and not in the hospital at week 24 (18 receiving ferric carboxymaltose and 12 receiving placebo); for these patients, the last available assessment was used as the assessment for week 24. The two patients who were hospitalized at 24 weeks (both receiving ferric carboxymaltose) were assigned an assessment of much worse. The 9 patients who died before week 24 (5 who had been receiving ferric carboxymaltose and 4 who had been receiving placebo) were categorized as dead. Panel A does not include 12 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 6 in the placebo group who were known to be alive at week 24 but who had no data on the self-reported Patient Global Assessment at any time during the study. The odds ratio for an improved NYHA class with ferric carboxymaltose as compared with placebo was 2.40 (95% CI, 1.55 to 3.71; P<0.001). Data on the NYHA class were missing for 28 patients known to be alive and not in the hospital at week 24 (16 receiving ferric carboxymaltose and 12 receiving placebo); for these patients, the last available NYHA classification was used as the classification for week 24. The 2 patients who were hospitalized at 24 weeks (both receiving ferric carboxymaltose) were considered to have NYHA class IV. The 9 patients who died before week 24 (5 who had been receiving ferric carboxymaltose and 4 who had been receiving placebo) were categorized as being dead (having NYHA class V). The data in Panel B do not include data for 10 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 5 in the placebo group who were known to be alive at week 24 but who had no data on the NYHA functional class at any time during the study. In both panels, percentages may not sum to 100 because of rounding.\n\n【44】The self-reported Patient Global Assessment at week 24 was improved in the ferric carboxymaltose group, with 50% of patients reporting that they were much or moderately improved, as compared with 28% of patients in the placebo group (odds ratio for being in a better rank, 2.51; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.75 to 3.61; P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>. Similarly, the NYHA functional class at week 24, after adjustment for the baseline value was improved in the ferric carboxymaltose group, with 47% having an NYHA functional class I or II, as compared with 30% in the placebo group (odds ratio for improvement by one class, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.55 to 3.71; P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>.\n\n【45】Secondary End Points\n--------------------\n\n【46】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Main Secondary Outcomes during the Study, According to Assigned Study Treatment.\n\n【47】Shown are data across the study period for the self-reported Patient Global Assessment (Panel A), the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (Panel B), change in distance on the 6-minute walk test (Panel C), the change in the score on the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (on which the score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health) (Panel D), and the change in the overall score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire (on which the overall score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better quality of life) (Panel E). The data in Panels A and B are odds ratios, for the ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) group as compared with the placebo group and shown on a log <sub>2 </sub> scale, of being in a better assessment category (Panel A) or NYHA functional class (Panel B). In both panels, for data on the self-reported Patient Global Assessment that were missing for patients known to be alive and not in the hospital at each time point, the last available assessment was used. Patients who were hospitalized at each time point were given an assessment of much worse (in Panel A) or an NYHA class of IV (in Panel B). Patients who died before week 24 were categorized as dead (in Panel B, corresponding to NYHA class V). Data were not included for patients who were known to be alive at the time point but had no previous data. For Panel A, the odds ratios at week 4 and week 12 are 3.44 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 2.34 to 5.07) and 3.19 (95% CI, 2.20 to 4.63). In Panel B, the odds ratios at week 4 and week 12 are 3.96 (95% CI, 1.98 to 7.93) and 3.42 (95% CI, 2.04 to 5.72). Panels C, D, and E show the mean (±SE) changes in the variable at weeks 4, 12, and 24. In those panels, the P values are for the comparison between the two study groups, and the I bars denote the standard error.\n\n【48】The use of ferric carboxymaltose, as compared with placebo, significantly improved the self-reported Patient Global Assessment and NYHA class at weeks 4 and 12 (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A and 2B , and Fig. 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Significant improvements were also seen in the distance on the 6-minute walk test and in the quality of life, as evaluated by the EQ-5D visual assessment score and the overall Kansas City Cardiomyopathy score, at weeks 4, 12, and 24 (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C, 2D, and 2E )</u>.\n\n【49】Subgroup Analyses\n-----------------\n\n【50】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Self-Reported Patient Global Assessment and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class in Predefined Subgroups, According to Assigned Study Treatment.\n\n【51】The number of patients in each subgroup for whom data were available is shown. The odds ratios are given for the ferric carboxymaltose group, as compared with the placebo group, on a log <sub>2 </sub> scale. For the results regarding the NYHA functional class in the subgroup of patients with heart failure of NYHA class II, one patient receiving ferric carboxymaltose had improvement to NYHA class I and two patients receiving placebo had a worsening to NYHA class III. The body-mass index (BMI) is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. CI denotes confidence interval, GFR glomerular filtration rate, and LV left ventricular.\n\n【52】A consistent benefit regarding the two primary end points was observed in all prespecified subgroups 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. The treatment effect was similar in patients with anemia and in those without anemia (prospectively defined as a hemoglobin level ≤120 g per liter at baseline).\n\n【53】Safety and Biochemical Analyses\n-------------------------------\n\n【54】Table 2.  Table 2. Safety End Points and Serious and Nonserious Adverse Events, According to Study Treatment Received.\n\n【55】Survival status was available for all patients through at least week 24. The rates of death, hospitalization, and serious and nonserious adverse events reported by the investigators were similar in the two study groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. There was a trend toward a lower rate of first hospitalization for any cardiovascular reason among patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose as compared with those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.09; P=0.08). The hazard ratio for death or first hospitalization for any cardiovascular reason among patients who received ferric carboxymaltose as compared with those who received placebo was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.18; P=0.14).\n\n【56】Data on serious and nonserious adverse events are also shown in Table 2 , and in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix . The study treatment was stopped prematurely in 16 (5.3%) of the 304 patients assigned to receive ferric carboxymaltose and in 14 (9.0%) of the 155 patients assigned to receive placebo. No severe allergic reactions related to the study treatment were reported. Of the patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose, injection-site discoloration was reported for four patients and injection-site pain for two patients.\n\n【57】Table 3.  Table 3. Levels of Iron-Metabolism Markers and Hemoglobin at Week 24 According to Study Treatment.\n\n【58】Laboratory values for ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin at week 24 were significantly different between the two study groups (P<0.001 for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The mean (±SE) difference in the ferritin level (adjusted for baseline) between patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose and those receiving placebo was 243±17 μg per liter at week 4, 188±15 μg per liter at week 12, and 246±20 μg per liter at week 24 (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The corresponding mean differences in the hemoglobin level were 6.6±1.1, 10.6±1.3, and 5.9±1.5 g per liter, respectively (P<0.001 for all comparisons), and the corresponding mean differences in the mean corpuscular volume of erythrocytes were 1.5±0.4, 2.4±0.5, and 2.7±0.7 μm 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> , respectively (all P<0.001). The mean difference in the hemoglobin level at week 24 (adjusted for baseline) between the ferric carboxymaltose group and the placebo group was not significant among patients who did not have anemia at baseline (2.4±2.0 g per liter, P=0.21) but was significant among patients who had anemia at baseline (9.1±2.2 g per liter, P<0.001). The mean difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate (adjusted for baseline) between patients receiving ferric carboxymaltose and those receiving placebo was 3.8±1.8 ml per minute (P=0.03). There were no significant differences between the two study groups with respect to adverse-event reporting based on chemical values and other hematologic laboratory test results.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose for 24 weeks in patients who had chronic heart failure and iron deficiency with or without anemia improved symptoms, functional capacity, and the quality of life. Our study also showed that treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was not associated with an unacceptable side-effect or adverse-event profile.\n\n【61】Our study showed improvement with ferric carboxymaltose in the two primary end points: the self-reported Patient Global Assessment and the NYHA class at 24 weeks. The benefit was evident after 4 weeks and was maintained throughout the study period. These results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups and were confirmed by the observed improvements in distance on the 6-minute walk test distance and in scores on the health-related quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\n【62】Our patient population was identified on the basis of laboratory biomarkers, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin. These variables were also used to calculate the iron-repletion dose and to guide decisions about continuation or interruption of ferric carboxymaltose. In that sense, the trial is a double-blind treatment trial that used guidance based on blood-sample data for study-treatment initiation and monitoring. The study results suggest that in the assessment of ambulatory patients with symptomatic heart failure and systolic dysfunction, laboratory investigations to detect iron deficiency may be useful in routine practice to decide whether symptom management, by means of treatment with intravenous iron, is indicated.\n\n【63】The dose needed to correct iron deficiency was calculated according to Ganzoni's formula 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> and was provided over a period between 3 and 7 weeks (a median of six injections) during the correction phase. We required that iron was given in doses of 200 mg per application and that the dosing frequency was weekly during the correction phase and monthly during the maintenance phase. The results of our study are applicable only to this dosing regimen. Treatment approaches involving higher doses and higher ferritin thresholds for the interruption of therapy are untested in patients with heart failure.\n\n【64】The treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was beneficial to both patients with anemia and those without anemia. This suggests that iron deficiency is a valid independent therapeutic target. Iron metabolism in patients with chronic illness merits a more detailed investigation to unravel the reasons why the correction of iron deficiency can result in symptomatic improvements even in the absence of a change in hemoglobin. Our results are consistent with those from four small studies that were performed with the use of a different preparation of intravenous iron. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16-19 </a></sup></u> One of these studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> recruited a subgroup of patients without anemia who had even higher hemoglobin levels than our patients (i.e., 125 to 145 g per liter). We do not know the limit of hemoglobin up to which iron deficiency is pathophysiologically important. On the basis of our current findings, we cannot recommend treatment with ferric carboxymaltose for patients who have chronic heart failure, iron deficiency, and a hemoglobin level above 135 g per liter, but such therapy is an area of interest for future research.\n\n【65】In conclusion, in stable, symptomatic, ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure, an impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, and iron deficiency, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose over a 24-week period improves symptoms, physical performance, and the quality of life and has acceptable side-effect and adverse-event profiles. The benefit was seen in patients with anemia and in those without anemia.\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【67】参考删除-1:<u>Sponsored by Vifor Pharma.</u>\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Anker reports receiving lecture fees from Roche Pharma and Teva; Drs.

The kindred studied originated from an isolated population in which considerable inbreeding has occurred for 140 years. Seven homozygotes had marked fasting chylomicronemia and triglyceridemia, and lacked detectable apolipoprotein C-II by several assay methods. Five homozygotes had experienced one to many attacks of pancreatitis from as early as six years of age. Obligate heterozygotes had apolipoprotein C-II concentrations about 30 to 50 per cent of normal values and had normal plasma triglyceride concentrations. This metabolic defect should be considered in patients with markedly elevated plasma triglycerides who have apparent lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and usually also have pancreatitis. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 299: 1421–1424, 1978)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

A total of 3973 persons below the age of 62 years were randomly assigned to fee-for-service health insurance plans with coinsurance rates of 0, 25, 50, or 95 per cent, subject to an income-related upper limit on out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n【2】Persons with no cost sharing had emergency department expenses that were 42 per cent higher than those for persons on the 95 per cent plan (P<0.01) and about 16 per cent higher than those for persons with smaller amounts of cost sharing. Without cost sharing, emergency department visits for less serious diagnoses (e.g., abrasions) increased three times as much as did visits for more serious diagnoses (e.g., lacerations). After control for insurance, persons in the lower third of the income distribution had emergency department expenses that were 64 per cent higher than those in the upper third (P<0.001 ) and received a greater proportion of their ambulatory care in the emergency department.\n\n【3】We conclude that the absence of cost sharing results in significantly greater emergency department use than does insurance with cost sharing. A disproportionate amount of the increased use involves less serious conditions. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1985; 313:484–90.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

In multiple myeloma, first-line regimens incorporating high-dose therapy yield higher remission rates than do conventional-dose treatments, but evidence that this translates into improved survival is limited.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In this multicenter study, the Medical Research Council Myeloma VII Trial, we randomly assigned 407 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who were younger than 65 years of age to receive either standard conventional-dose combination chemotherapy or high-dose therapy and an autologous stem-cell transplant.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Among the 401 patients who could be evaluated, the rates of complete response were higher in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (44 percent vs. 8 percent, P<0.001). The rates of partial response were similar (42 percent and 40 percent, respectively; P=0.72), and the rates of minimal response were lower in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (3 percent vs. 18 percent, P<0.001). Intention-to-treat analysis showed a higher rate of overall survival (P=0.04 by the log-rank test) and progression-free survival (P<0.001) in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group. As compared with standard therapy, intensive treatment increased median survival by almost 1 year (54.1 months \\[95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 65.2\\] vs. 42.3 months \\[95 percent confidence interval, 33.1 to 51.6\\]). There was a trend toward a greater survival benefit in the group of patients with a poor prognosis, as defined by a high beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin level (more than 8 mg per liter).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】High-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell rescue is an effective first-line treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who are younger than 65 years of age.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】In the controversial field of high-dose chemotherapy, multiple myeloma is one disease in which this approach may provide tangible benefits, but data from rigorous studies are limited. In randomized trials carried out by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom between 1964 and 1990, the most effective standard regimen of conventional-dose chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan and resulted in a median survival of 32 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Other conventional-dose regimens resulted in improved response rates, but not enduring remissions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Escalating the doses of melphalan to a level requiring autologous stem-cell rescue 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-8 </a></sup></u> resulted in even higher rates of remission, with a complete response in approximately 50 percent of patients. An approach involving conventional-dose chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy offered the prospect of a better outcome, but the evidence of a survival benefit has been inconclusive in nonrandomized 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-11 </a></sup></u> and randomized 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> studies. To investigate this strategy further, we initiated a phase 3 trial in which patients received either a standard regimen of doxorubicin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan or a regimen consisting of infusional combination chemotherapy followed by high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplantation. Both regimens included interferon alfa as maintenance therapy.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Patients\n--------\n\n【14】The Medical Research Council Myeloma VII Trial (ISRCTN66518389) was conducted from October 1993 to October 2000. All patients were previously untreated, fulfilled the Medical Research Council criteria for myeloma requiring treatment, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> were less than 65 years of age, and were suitable candidates for high-dose therapy. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Randomization was by telephone and used a minimization algorithm based on age (<55 years vs. ≥55 years), serum creatinine level (<1.7 mg per deciliter \\[150 μmol per liter\\] vs. ≥1.7 mg per deciliter), hemoglobin level (<9 vs. ≥9 g per deciliter) and, in the latter part of the trial, whether total-body irradiation was intended as part of the conditioning regimen for transplantation. The trial was approved by a multicenter research ethics committee and by local ethics committees.\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】### _Standard Therapy_\n\n【17】Standard therapy consisted of a short infusion of 30 mg of doxorubicin per square meter of body-surface area intravenously and 30 mg of carmustine per square meter intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter per day orally and 6 mg of melphalan per square meter per day orally on days 22, 23, 24, and 25. The cycle was repeated every six weeks until the maximal response was attained. A minimum of 4 cycles was given, and the maximum was 12 cycles. There were per-protocol dose reductions in the case of renal dysfunction, but patients who had treatment delays owing to myelosuppression received 300 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter intravenously each week plus 40 mg of prednisolone per square meter orally every other day for the first six weeks. The planned maintenance therapy was 3 million U of interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A) subcutaneously three times per week.\n\n【18】### _Intensive Therapy_\n\n【19】Intensive therapy consisted of a continuous infusion of 9 mg of doxorubicin per square meter per day and 0.4 mg of vincristine per day on days 1 through 4, 1 g of methylprednisolone per square meter per day intravenously or orally (maximum, 1.5 g) on days 1 through 5, and 500 mg of cyclophosphamide per day intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15. The cycle was repeated every 21 days until a maximal response was attained. A minimum of three cycles was given before stem cells were harvested. Patients with a serum creatinine level of more than 3.4 mg per deciliter (300 μmol per liter) did not receive cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide was omitted on day 8 or 15 (or both) in the event of undue myelosuppression. Peripheral-blood stem cells were typically mobilized by the administration of 2 to 4 g of cyclophosphamide per square meter intravenously with hydration and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on days 5 through 12. High-dose melphalan was given at a dose of 200 mg per square meter followed by the reinfusion of peripheral-blood stem cells 24 hours later. A bone marrow autograft and total-body irradiation plus melphalan (140 mg per square meter) were permissible options. Methylprednisolone (1.5 g per day) was given intravenously for four days after the administration of high-dose melphalan. The dose of melphalan was reduced according to the creatinine clearance. The planned maintenance therapy was 3 million U of interferon alfa-2a administered subcutaneously three times per week.\n\n【20】Assessment of Response\n----------------------\n\n【21】The response to treatment was monitored by means of serum and urine protein studies carried out centrally at the University of Birmingham. In the intensive-therapy group, the studies were conducted every three weeks during the chemotherapy regimen and every three months thereafter. In the standard-therapy group, the studies were conducted every three months. Bone marrow aspirates and trephine specimens were obtained as needed to determine the response to induction therapy, and also at three months and yearly after the completion of high-dose therapy and at relapse in the intensive-therapy group, and at the time of the maximal response and at progression in the standard-therapy group. The response criteria of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation – International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> were used. A complete response was defined by the absence of monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum (or light chains in urine) on immunofixation. Causes of death were recorded by the participating centers as attributable to myeloma, infection, a variety of other secondary causes, unrelated causes, or combinations of these if the cause of death was considered to be multifactorial.\n\n【22】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【23】Assuming the survival rate at four years to be 60 percent in the standard-therapy group, the study required 710 patients to have 80 percent power to detect an absolute improvement in survival of 10 percent in the intensive-therapy group. The recruitment target was 750 patients. The steering committee agreed to stop the trial in October 2000 when there was a total of 407 patients, in view of declining enrollment.\n\n【24】The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival. Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Data on patients who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the time of analysis were censored in the survival analysis on the last date they were known to be alive. Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of progression or death. Patients recorded as having died from multiple myeloma and for whom no prior date for progression was available were considered to have had progressive disease on the day of death. Data on patients who had not had progression were censored on the last date they were known to be alive and progression-free. Survival curves were constructed with the use of Kaplan–Meier estimates, and treatment groups were compared with the use of the log-rank test at a significance level of 5 percent. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to adjust survival analyses for minimization factors (age, serum creatinine level, and hemoglobin level) and to investigate the correlation of the beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin level with survival (which was specified in the statistical-analysis plan before any data were analyzed). A cutoff date of October 20, 2001, was used for survival analysis. The maximal response was compared in the treatment groups with the use of chi-square tests. The proportions of deaths recorded as solely or partly attributable to myeloma and solely or partly attributable to infection are reported, with 95 percent confidence intervals. All analyses were two-sided and carried out on an intention-to-treat basis with the use of SAS software (SAS Institute).\n\n【25】We used published data to conduct a meta-analysis of trials comparing conventional therapy with high-dose therapy in patients with myeloma. The resulting Forrest plot yielded an estimate of the odds ratio of the combined treatment effect, with 95 percent confidence intervals, with use of a fixed-effects approach. Analyses were performed with Review Manager software (version 4.1). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【26】Results\n-------\n\n【27】Characteristics of the Patients and Treatments\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Figure 1. Figure 1. Summary of Treatment Received. Table 1.  Table 1. Base-Line Characteristics of the Randomized Patients.\n\n【29】A total of 407 patients were enrolled from 83 centers in the United Kingdom and New Zealand over a seven-year period from 1993 to 2000. Six patients could not be included in any data summaries or analyses: five underwent randomization in error, and one patient withdrew consent 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. A total of 200 patients were randomly assigned to receive standard therapy and 201 to receive intensive therapy. The characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1 . The myeloma subtypes were as follows: IgG in 56 percent of patients, IgA in 22 percent, IgD in 2 percent, light chain in 13 percent, and nonsecretory in 4 percent; data on subtype were missing in 3 percent of cases. Figure 1 summarizes the treatment received. In the intensive-therapy group, 197 patients received a median of five cycles (range, one to nine) of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and methylprednisolone. In the standard-therapy group, 146 patients received a median of 6 cycles (range, 1 to 13) of doxorubicin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan; 47 received doxorubicin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan as well as cyclophosphamide weekly for a median of 4 cycles (range, 1 to 12); and 3 received cyclophosphamide weekly alone.\n\n【30】In the intensive-therapy group, 50 of 201 patients (25 percent) did not receive high-dose melphalan, as a result of death, early disease progression (i.e., during induction chemotherapy), poor performance status, or low CD34 counts or by choice, and thus did not receive a stem-cell transplant. Therapy with high-dose melphalan was usually supported by the reinfusion of peripheral-blood stem cells (138 patients \\[92 percent\\]); only 8 patients received bone marrow (5 percent), and 3 received both bone marrow and stem cells (2 percent; this information was unavailable for 1 patient). The dose of melphalan was reduced in 17 patients (11 percent), as a result of poor stem-cell harvests, renal failure, or poor performance status. Eight patients received total-body irradiation plus melphalan (140 mg per square meter). Two patients received a second autograft at relapse. Only 30 patients (15 percent) in the standard-therapy group went on to receive an autograft, and 4 (2 percent) an allograft, as part of off-protocol therapy. In the standard-therapy group, 84 patients (42 percent) received interferon alfa-2a for at least a month, as compared with 118 patients (59 percent) in the intensive-therapy group. Among these patients, the drug was stopped because of intolerance or adverse events in 14 (17 percent) and 39 (33 percent), respectively, and because of disease progression in 43 (51 percent) and 33 (28 percent), respectively.\n\n【31】Overall Survival\n----------------\n\n【32】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Overall Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【33】Overall, there was an improvement in median survival of 11.8 months in the intensive-therapy group (median survival, 54.1 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 65.2) as compared with the standard-therapy group (42.3 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 33.1 to 51.6; P=0.04 by the log-rank test and P=0.03 by the Wilcoxon test).\n\n【34】As of October 20, 2001, 206 of the 401 patients (51 percent) had died: 112 patients in the standard-therapy group and 94 in the intensive-therapy group. The median duration of follow-up among survivors was 42 months (range, 9 to 96), with an overall median survival of 48.5 months (95 percent confidence interval, 42.2 to 56.3). The median survival was 54.1 months (95 percent confidence interval, 44.9 to 65.2) in the intensive-therapy group and 42.3 months (95 percent confidence interval, 33.1 to 51.6) in the standard-therapy group (P=0.04 by the log-rank test and P=0.03 by the Wilcoxon test) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. A Cox model that adjusted for minimization factors showed that survival rates were higher among patients with a creatinine level of less than 1.7 mg per deciliter than among those with a level of 1.7 mg per deciliter or higher and among patients with a hemoglobin level of 9 g per deciliter or higher than among those with a level of less than 9 g per deciliter. A significant interaction between treatment group and the beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin level was seen (P=0.003 in the Cox model), indicating that the treatment effect varied depending on the level of beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin. Stratified log-rank analysis according to the serum levels of beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin — low (less than 4 mg per liter), intermediate (4 to 8 mg per liter), or high (more than 8 mg per liter) — defined in previous Medical Research Council studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> showed that within each stratum, the intensive-therapy group had a longer median survival than the standard-therapy group. This difference was greatest among those with base-line beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin levels of more than 8 mg per liter. In these patients median survival was 41.9 months (95 percent confidence interval, 31.3 to 65.2) in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with 13.1 months (95 percent confidence interval, 9.2 to 23.9) in the standard-therapy group.\n\n【35】Progression-Free Survival\n-------------------------\n\n【36】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Progression-free Survival.\n\n【37】A total of 395 patients could be evaluated. The median duration of progression-free survival was longer in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (31.6 months \\[95 percent confidence interval, 27.4 to 38.0\\] vs. 19.6 months \\[95 percent confidence interval, 16.2 to 21.8\\], P<0.001 by the log-rank or Wilcoxon test).\n\n【38】As of October 20, 2001, 288 of the 395 patients who could be evaluated for disease progression (73 percent) had evidence of progression; 36 in the standard-therapy group and 71 in the intensive-therapy group remained progression-free. Overall, the median duration of progression-free survival was 25.1 months (95 percent confidence interval, 21.4 to 27.8). After a median follow-up of 31.5 months in the standard-therapy group and 40.0 months in the intensive-therapy group, 160 patients had evidence of progression in the standard-therapy group and 128 in the intensive-therapy group. The median duration of progression-free survival was 31.6 months (95 percent confidence interval, 27.4 to 38.0) in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with 19.6 months (95 percent confidence interval, 16.2 to 21.8) in the standard-therapy group (P<0.001 by the log-rank or Wilcoxon test) 删除2:<u>( Figure 3 )</u>. Cox models showed that the serum creatinine level (P=0.001), hemoglobin level (P=0.07), and beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin level (P=0.08) were significant prognostic factors for progression-free survival.\n\n【39】Response\n--------\n\n【40】Table 2.  Table 2. Maximal Response to Treatment.\n\n【41】The maximal response to randomized treatment is summarized in Table 2 : the intensive-therapy group had a higher overall rate of response and a higher rate of complete remission than the standard-therapy group. Although no formal statistical tests were carried out, there was a trend toward improved survival in the intensive-therapy group as the extent of the response increased from minimal (25.6 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 7.0 to 31.3) to partial (39.8 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 33.8 to 61.4) to complete (88.6 months; lower 95 percent confidence limit, 61.4).\n\n【42】Causes of Death\n---------------\n\n【43】Of the 206 deaths, 183 (89 percent) were recorded as due to myeloma or related factors, including treatment. Multiple myeloma was cited as a causal factor in more patients in the standard-therapy group than in the intensive-therapy group (69 of 112 patients \\[62 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 53 to 71\\] vs. 46 of 94 patients \\[49 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 39 to 59\\]). Infection, as at least a contributory factor, was reported in 68 patients (33 percent) who died and was more frequent in the intensive-therapy group than in the standard-therapy group (35 patients \\[37 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 47\\] vs. 33 patients \\[29 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 38\\]). Six deaths occurred within 100 days after transplantation, five of which were due to sepsis. The rate of early death was not higher than expected in either group.\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】An approach involving high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue attempts to take advantage of the dose–response curve and often induces relatively high rates of tumor regression across a range of tumors, as compared with those achieved with conventional therapy. This has led to considerable enthusiasm for its use. It has increasingly been adopted as first-line treatment for multiple myeloma, despite the paucity of data from randomized trials providing convincing evidence of a survival benefit to support the routine use of this approach. Such studies are difficult and time-consuming to conduct, because of the technical complexity and, often, the strong beliefs about the effectiveness of one type of therapy or the other among clinicians and patients.\n\n【46】A systematic review of reports of trials comparing conventional with high-dose therapy 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> identified a number of randomized studies that clearly cannot be compared with our trial because of the timing of randomization (after response rather than at diagnosis), 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> the timing of transplantation (early vs. late), 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> use of higher-dose conventional therapy (so-called intermediate-dose melphalan), 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20 </a></sup></u> and the number of transplantations (single vs. double). 删除3:<u><sup><a>21-23 </a></sup></u> Only two similar randomized studies were identified. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> The Intergroupe Français du Myélome randomly assigned 200 patients to receive either conventional-dose combination chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy followed by melphalan (140 mg per square meter) with total-body irradiation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> Seventy-four patients in the intensive-therapy group underwent transplantation. The investigators reported a significant survival benefit with intensive therapy. In a recent update, the overall median duration of survival was 44 months in the standard-therapy group and 56 months in the intensive-therapy group (Attal M: personal communication). A second study, by the Groupe Myélome Autogreffe, compared conventional-dose combination chemotherapy with infusional chemotherapy (with vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) followed by melphalan at a dose of 200 mg per square meter or melphalan at a dose of 140 mg per square meter plus busulfan at a dose of 16 mg per square meter. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Of the 190 patients between the ages of 55 and 65 years who underwent randomization, 94 were assigned to the intensive-therapy group (25 percent of whom did not ultimately undergo transplantation). No significant survival benefit was seen with intensive treatment; the median overall duration of survival was 50.4 months in the conventional-chemotherapy group and 55.3 months in the intensive-therapy group. At the time of disease progression, patients in the conventional-chemotherapy group could cross over to receive high-dose therapy at their physicians' discretion.\n\n【47】Figure 4.  Figure 4. Forrest Plot Showing the Odds Ratios and 99 Percent Confidence Intervals (CIs) for the Current Study and Two Other Published Studies Comparing Conventional Treatment with High-Dose Treatment in Patients with Myeloma.\n\n【48】Data are from the current study, Attal et al. (the Intergroupe Français du Myélome trial), 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and Fermand et al. (the Groupe Myélome Autogreffe trial). 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> The size of each square, representing the estimated treatment effect, is proportional to the size of the study (i.e., larger squares provide more information and hence have narrower 99% confidence intervals). The odds ratio for all the studies combined suggests a beneficial effect of high-dose therapy (chi-square test for heterogeneity, 1.95 with 2 df; P=0.38; and test for overall effect, z=–2.45; P=0.01).\n\n【49】We calculated the odds ratios and 99 percent confidence intervals for our study as well as for the Intergroupe Français du Myélome trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and the Groupe Myélome Autogreffe trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>( Figure 4 )</u>. The two earlier studies together did not show a survival benefit. However, when our results were taken into account and the results of all three studies were combined, the estimated treatment effect was consistent with a significant survival benefit with intensive therapy, as compared with standard therapy (odds ratio, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.93; P=0.01).\n\n【50】The most important finding in our trial was the increase in median survival of approximately one year among patients in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with those in the standard-therapy group. Per-protocol analyses showed that this difference may be a conservative estimate of benefit, because 17 percent of the patients in the standard-therapy group crossed over to high-dose therapy, usually after disease progression. Although myeloma and infection were commonly recorded as causes of death, any differences in the frequency of these causes between the two groups in a multicenter study of this nature should be treated with caution, since death was often multifactorial. There were only six deaths within 100 days after transplantation.\n\n【51】In the Medical Research Council trials, three subgroups corresponding to a good, an intermediate, and a poor prognosis have been delineated, on the basis of serum beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin levels (less than 4 mg per liter, 4 to 8 mg per liter, and more than 8 mg per liter, respectively). 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,24 </a></sup></u> In our study the proportions of patients in these groups were 38 percent, 28 percent, and 24 percent, respectively. A trend for patients in the group with a poor prognosis to benefit most from intensive therapy was identified. Cytogenetic data were not generally available, but more recently, prognostic groups have been redefined by combining the serum beta <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin level with 13q– status. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25-27</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】We and others have previously shown a trend toward improved progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with undetectable myeloma protein in serum or urine (a complete response), as compared with those with a partial response. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27-29 </a></sup></u> In this study, we also identified a trend in the intensive-therapy group toward improved overall survival among patients who had a complete response. Further intensification of treatment through the use of multiple high-dose procedures to increase the rates of complete response remains under study. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21-23,27 </a></sup></u> Emerging biologic therapies may also offer a means of maintaining and enhancing such responses.\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by unrestricted educational grants from Roche Products and Chugai Pharma United Kingdom, and by grants from the Leukaemia Research Fund United Kingdom (to Dr. Morgan), Cancer Research United Kingdom (to Dr. Selby), the Department of Health (to Dr. Davies), and the Medical Research Council (to Dr. Drayson and the Clinical Trials Service Unit, Oxford).</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

ZIKV is transmitted to humans primarily by aedes mosquitoes. However, there is some evidence of sexual transmission. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Two studies have shown the presence of infectious ZIKV in semen. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> A recent article described detection of ZIKV RNA in semen 62 days after the onset of illness, but infectious virus was not cultured. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】We report a case of ZIKV infection in a previously healthy 24-year-old woman (Patient 1) who was living in Paris and in whom acute fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and pruritic rash developed on February 20, 2016. She was not receiving any medication, had not received any blood transfusions, and had never traveled to a region where Zika was epidemic or to tropical or subtropical areas. Her last trip outside France was to Okinawa, Japan, from December 21, 2015, to January 1, 2016. A clinical examination on February 23 showed a maculopapular rash on the patient’s abdomen, arms, and legs and a temperature of 36.6°C. The illness lasted approximately 7 days.\n\n【4】Patient 1 reported sexual contact between February 11 and February 20, 2016, with a man (Patient 2, the index patient) who had stayed in Brazil from December 11, 2015, through February 9, 2016. The sexual contact involved seven episodes of both vaginal sexual intercourse, without ejaculation and without the use of a condom, and oral sex with ejaculation.\n\n【5】Patient 2, a 46-year-old man, reported fever, asthenia, myalgia, chills, and a cutaneous rash that began on February 7, while he was in Rio de Janeiro. The symptoms had resolved on the day he arrived in France on February 10. The clinical examination of Patient 2 was normal on February 23 (details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\n\n【6】Populations of _Aedes aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes are not established in the city of Paris. Moreover, in France, the diapause period of aedes species extends from December to May.\n\n【7】Three days after the onset of her symptoms, on February 23, samples of urine and saliva were obtained from Patient 1. The urine sample tested positive for ZIKV RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a viral count of 3.5×10 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> copies per milliliter, and the saliva tested positive at a viral count of 2.1×10 删除3:<u><sup>4 </sup></u> copies per milliliter. A plasma sample tested negative for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR, but serum IgM antibodies to ZIKV were detected (see the Supplementary Appendix ). A vaginal swab obtained on March 1 was negative for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR.\n\n【8】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Clinical Events and Phylogenetic Analysis of Zika Virus in the Patients.\n\n【9】Panel A shows clinical timelines with the key dates of exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV), the onset of symptoms, the results of reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction tests of plasma, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal swab samples, and the results of ZIKV IgM from serum in Patient 1 and the index patient (Patient 2). Panel B shows the ZIKV strains (red dots) that were characterized directly from the semen (obtained from Patient 2) and saliva (obtained from Patient 1) at the top of a phylogenetic tree. Available sequence information regarding the virus GenBank number, strain name, country of isolation, and date of isolation is shown. Sequences of the Zika viruses identified in the semen and saliva samples are labeled beside the taxon names. The scale bar shows the nucleotide sequence divergence.\n\n【10】In Patient 2, a urine sample obtained 16 days after the onset of symptoms tested positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR with a viral count of 4×10 删除3:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> copies per milliliter, but plasma and saliva samples tested negative. The first and second urine stream samples obtained on day 24 were positive for ZIKV RNA with a viral count of 2.1×10 删除3:<u><sup>4 </sup></u> copies per milliliter. Semen samples tested positive for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR with a high viral load of 2.9×10 删除3:<u><sup>8 </sup></u> copies per milliliter in the sample obtained on day 18 and 3.5×10 删除3:<u><sup>7 </sup></u> copies per milliliter in the sample obtained on day 24. ZIKV was isolated by means of culture from semen samples on days 18 and 24. Timelines are shown in Figure 1A .\n\n【11】A complete ZIKV genome was sequenced from saliva samples obtained from Patient 1 and semen samples obtained from Patient 2 (see the Supplementary Appendix ). Only four mutations, all of them synonymous, differentiate the sequences of the two patients. The complete nucleotide coding sequences of ZIKV identified in these semen and saliva samples cluster together within the phylogenetic tree 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>.\n\n【12】These data support the hypothesis of sexual transmission (either oral or vaginal) of ZIKV from Patient 2 to Patient 1. We cannot rule out the possibility that transmission occurred not through semen but through other biologic fluids, such as pre-ejaculate secretions or saliva exchanged through deep kissing. The saliva of Patient 2 tested negative on day 10 after the onset of his symptoms, but it was not tested earlier. ZIKV has been detected in saliva, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> but, to our knowledge, no cases of transmission through saliva have been documented.\n\n【13】The current outbreaks of ZIKV infection should be an opportunity to conduct studies to understand the natural history of ZIKV. We need to better define recommendations to prevent transmission of the virus. In particular, guidelines regarding how long men who are returning from an area where active ZIKV transmission is occurring should continue to use condoms during sexual contact with pregnant women and those of child-bearing age are lacking. In addition, recommendations regarding the possibility of oral transmission of the virus through semen are needed.\n\n【14】参考删除-2:<u>Eric D’Ortenzio, M.D.  \nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-2:<u>Sophie Matheron, M.D.  \nHôpital Bichat Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-2:<u>Xavier de Lamballerie, M.D., Ph.D.  \nUniversité Aix-Marseille, Marseille, France</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-2:<u>Bruno Hubert, M.D.  \nInstitut de Veille Sanitaire, Saint Maurice, France</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-2:<u>Géraldine Piorkowski, Ph.D.  \nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-2:<u>Marianne Maquart, Ph.D.  \nFrench Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute, Marseille, France</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-2:<u>Diane Descamps, M.D., Ph.D.  \nFlorence Damond, Pharm.D., Ph.D.  \nYazdan Yazdanpanah, M.D., Ph.D.  \nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France  \nyazdan.yazdanpanah@aphp.fr</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-2:<u>Isabelle Leparc-Goffart, Ph.D.  \nFrench Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute, Marseille, France</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-2:<u>Supported in part by the European Virus Archive Goes Global project, which received a grant (653316) from the European Union Horizon 2020 Framework Program for Research and Innovation.</u>\n\n【23】参考删除-2:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-2:<u>Drs.

Of these 174 patients, 10 (6%) were classified as having extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. A patient's rate of drug resistance was calculated by dividing the number of drugs to which the patient's disease was resistant by the number of drugs tested. The median rate of drug resistance was 45% among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and 68% among patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (P<0.001 for the difference by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Age, sex, race or ethnic group, the number of patients treated with a fluoroquinolone, the length of time from the diagnosis of tuberculosis to the first visit to our center, the number of patients who underwent lung resection, and the number of drugs used previously did not differ significantly between the two groups (P≥0.19 for all comparisons, with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables).\n\n【5】Logistic-regression analysis yielded odds ratios for treatment success in the group of patients who had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, as compared with those who had extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, of 23.4 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 4.6 to 188.7) for the initial outcome (P<0.001) and 21.1 (95% CI, 4.2 to 106.8) for the long-term outcome (P<0.001); the length of time from the diagnosis of tuberculosis to the first visit to our center was used as a covariate. In proportional-hazards survival models adjusted for age, the hazard ratio for death from tuberculosis or surgery in the group with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, as compared with the group with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, was 7.9 (95% CI, 2.7 to 23.1; P<0.001), and the hazard ratio for death from any cause was 2.5 (95% CI, 0.9 to 6.5; P=0.07). Estimates were obtained from logistic-regression and survival models adjusted for an expanded set of covariates (surgery, the use or nonuse of fluoroquinolone, the number of drugs used previously, the rate of drug resistance, age, the length of time from the diagnosis of tuberculosis to the first visit to our center, the use or nonuse of a fluoroquinolone according to age, and the use or nonuse of a fluoroquinolone according to the rate of drug resistance). These estimates still showed better outcomes in the group with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis than in the group with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Odds ratios for short-term and long-term treatment success and the hazard ratio for death from tuberculosis or surgery remained significant (P<0.05), with a trend toward significance (P=0.15) for the hazard ratio for death from any cause.\n\n【6】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Survival Rates among Patients with Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Those with Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis.\n\n【7】Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier survival curves for patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. Estimates are based on the number of deaths from tuberculosis or surgery (P<0.001 by the log-rank test for the comparison of the two groups). In the MDR-tuberculosis group, there were 14 deaths from tuberculosis or surgery and 150 censored observations; in the XDR-tuberculosis group, there were 5 deaths from tuberculosis or surgery and 5 censored observations. Circles indicate times of censoring. Panel B shows Kaplan–Meier survival curves based on deaths from any cause (P=0.02 by the log-rank test for the comparison of MDR tuberculosis with XDR tuberculosis). In the MDR-tuberculosis group, there were 36 deaths and 128 censored observations; in the XDR-tuberculosis group, there were 5 deaths and 5 censored observations. Circles indicate times of censoring.\n\n【8】Figure 1 shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of survival based on the number of deaths from tuberculosis or surgery (Panel A) and the number of deaths from any cause (Panel B) among the patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. The rates of death from tuberculosis or surgery and from any cause were significantly higher among patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis than among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【9】Despite aggressive treatment at our referral center, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, as compared with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, was associated with a significantly poorer initial treatment response and long-term outcome and a significantly lower survival rate. These data underscore the critical importance of optimal management of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, lest they develop into extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Edward D.

Evidence comparing these systems has been based primarily on observational studies.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We conducted a noninferiority trial in which patients with an indication for an ICD but no indication for pacing were assigned to receive a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD. The primary end point was the composite of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks; the noninferiority margin for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio (subcutaneous ICD vs. transvenous ICD) was 1.45. A superiority analysis was prespecified if noninferiority was established. Secondary end points included death and appropriate shocks.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】A total of 849 patients (426 in the subcutaneous ICD group and 423 in the transvenous ICD group) were included in the analyses. At a median follow-up of 49.1 months, a primary end-point event occurred in 68 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 68 patients in the transvenous ICD group (48-month Kaplan–Meier estimated cumulative incidence, 15.1% and 15.7%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.71 to 1.39; P=0.01 for noninferiority; P=0.95 for superiority). Device-related complications occurred in 31 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 44 in the transvenous ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.09); inappropriate shocks occurred in 41 and 29 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30). Death occurred in 83 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 68 in the transvenous ICD group (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.70); appropriate shocks occurred in 83 and 57 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.12).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】In patients with an indication for an ICD but no indication for pacing, the subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to device-related complications and inappropriate shocks. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by Boston Scientific; PRAETORIAN ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01296022 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】 VISUAL ABSTRACT  \nSubcutaneous or Transvenous Defibrillator Therapy\n\n【12】Implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs) have been proven to be efficacious in the prevention of sudden cardiac death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> Transvenous lead placement for cardiac sensing and defibrillation has been the standard for ICD design for several decades. However, important limitations of the technique include complications related to lead insertion, such as pneumothorax and cardiac perforation, and long-term complications, such as lead endocarditis and lead dysfunction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> To avoid such complications, an entirely subcutaneous ICD was introduced as an alternative. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> The extrathoracic placement of the subcutaneous ICD circumvents the need to enter the heart and vasculature but makes it impossible for the device to deliver pacing therapy.\n\n【13】Class IIa recommendations for the subcutaneous ICD in U.S. and European guidelines for patients in whom pacing therapy for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronization, or antitachycardia pacing is not indicated are based on experience from observational studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6-9 </a></sup></u> The Prospective Randomized Comparison of Subcutaneous and Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Therapy (PRAETORIAN) trial evaluated whether the subcutaneous ICD would be noninferior to the transvenous ICD with regard to short-term and long-term device-related complications and inappropriate shocks.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【16】We conducted this investigator-initiated, international, randomized, noninferiority trial in the United States and Europe. The principal coordinating investigators were responsible for the design of the trial, which has been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The Academic Medical Center Amsterdam was responsible for site contracting, data collection, monitoring, and management. Trial design and execution were overseen by a steering committee, and the conduct of the trial and the safety of the patients were overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring board. The protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional review board at all participating centers.\n\n【17】This trial was funded by Boston Scientific, which had no role in the design of the trial, analysis of the data, or the drafting and submission of the manuscript. The principal investigators analyzed the data in accordance with the statistical analysis plan and prepared the manuscript. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\n\n【18】Trial Population\n----------------\n\n【19】Patients were eligible for entry into this trial if they were 18 years of age or older and had a class I or IIa indication for ICD therapy for primary or secondary prevention, according to the guidelines from the American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society or those from the European Society of Cardiology. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,8 </a></sup></u> Key exclusion criteria were previous ICD implantation, unsuitability for subcutaneous ICD therapy according to QRS-T–wave sensing analysis (see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org), and indications for either bradycardia pacing or biventricular pacing. We also excluded patients with known ventricular tachycardia at a rate below 170 beats per minute or with refractory recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that could not be managed with medication or ablation therapy because, for such patients, antitachycardia pacing was considered to be an especially important therapeutic option. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix . All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\n【20】Randomization and Procedures\n----------------------------\n\n【21】Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD, with stratification according to center. Block sizes ranging from two to eight were used to conceal treatment assignments. All subcutaneous ICDs were manufactured by Cameron Health–Boston Scientific. The choice of transvenous ICD manufacturer was at the discretion of the physician performing the implantation. All transvenous ICDs were single-chamber devices unless a dual-chamber device was deemed to be necessary for the discrimination of arrhythmia. The procedures regarding implantation, defibrillation testing, and hospital discharge followed local clinical practice. All the patients were seen at a follow-up visit within 4 months after implantation. Thereafter, ICDs were interrogated at least twice per year, and patients had at least one annual visit to the outpatient clinic.\n\n【22】ICD Programming\n---------------\n\n【23】Programming of the parameters for the detection of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and for therapeutic variables was standardized and based on the best available evidence at the time of protocol development. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Programming strategies were comparable between the two treatment groups. The cutoff for the fast ventricular tachycardia zone was set as close to 182 beats per minute as possible, given differences in manufacturer programming options, with one burst of antitachycardia pacing for the transvenous ICD. The cutoff for the ventricular fibrillation zone was 250 beats per minute. Deviation from the recommended device programming was allowed in order to fit the specific characteristics of the patient. Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【24】End Points\n----------\n\n【25】The composite primary end point of the trial consisted of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks. Complications included device infection that led to the extraction of the lead or generator; pocket hematoma that led to drainage, blood transfusion, or prolongation of hospitalization; device-related thrombotic events; pneumothorax or hemothorax that led to intervention or prolongation of hospitalization; cardiac perforation or tamponade; lead repositioning or replacement; and other complications related to the lead or generator that led to medical or surgical intervention. An ICD shock was classified as inappropriate when it was delivered for any rhythm other than ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Secondary end points included the individual components of the primary end point, death from any cause, appropriate ICD therapy (including antitachycardia pacing), major adverse cardiac events, hospitalization for heart failure, and crossover between the assigned devices.\n\n【26】A clinical-events committee consisting of three electrophysiologists who were not otherwise involved in the trial adjudicated all clinical and arrhythmic events. Shock therapy and other arrhythmic events that were derived from regular device interrogation were classified as being either appropriate or inappropriate according to the rhythm that initiated the therapy. Hence, shocks without electrograms were not adjudicated. A complete overview of trial end points and definitions is provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】The trial was designed to test the hypothesis of noninferiority of the subcutaneous ICD as compared with the transvenous ICD with respect to the time from device implantation to the first occurrence of a primary end-point event. The noninferiority margin for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio was set at 1.45. The estimation of cumulative incidence and sample-size justification have been reported previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> We estimated that the occurrence of a primary end-point event in the transvenous ICD group would be 17.2% at 48 months. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,11 </a></sup></u> Assuming that 5% of patients would discontinue the trial, we calculated that the enrollment of 425 patients in each group would provide the trial with 85% power to show noninferiority of the subcutaneous ICD at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. A superiority analysis was prespecified if noninferiority was established.\n\n【29】Analyses for all the end points were performed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included patients according to the group to which they had been randomly assigned, regardless of the device they received. Patients who did not receive either device after randomization or who underwent randomization in error were excluded from the analyses. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the as-treated population, which included patients according to the treatment that they first received. Additional sensitivity analyses included, among others, a competing-risks analysis to account for death and incomplete follow-up, an analysis to account for missing electrographic data from the device, and a multiple imputation analysis by fully conditional specification. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【30】For the time-to-event analyses, cumulative incidence curves were constructed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method, and hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by Cox proportional-hazards models. For these analyses, missing data were presumed to be missing at random, and data were censored for patients with incomplete follow-up on the last known event-free day. The confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiplicity and therefore should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. Prespecified subgroups that were defined according to age, sex, and body-mass index were analyzed for the occurrence of a primary end-point event. Additional information regarding the statistical analyses is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Statistical analyses were performed with the use of R software, version 3.6.2 (R Core Team).\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Patients and Implantations\n--------------------------\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Randomization, Implantation, and Follow-up of the Patients.\n\n【34】Screening details and the reasons for exclusion are presented in Figure S1 and Table S2, respectively. A total of 16 patients in the group that was assigned to receive the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD) and 11 patients in the group that was assigned to receive the transvenous ICD were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat analysis because they either did not undergo ICD implantation or had undergone randomization in error. A total of 4 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and 6 patients in the transvenous ICD group never underwent any attempt to implant the assigned device but instead received the alternate device. A total of 70 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and 56 patients in the transvenous ICD group died before having a composite primary end-point event (device-related complication or inappropriate shock).Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【35】From March 2011 through January 2017, a total of 876 patients were enrolled at 39 centers in Europe and the United States 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Information about patients who underwent screening and reasons for exclusion are provided in Figure S1 and Table S2. Of the 876 patients enrolled, 27 were excluded from the primary analysis; 18 did not undergo ICD implantation and 9 had undergone randomization in error. A total of 849 patients were included in the primary analysis; of these patients, 426 were randomly assigned to the subcutaneous ICD group and 423 to the transvenous ICD group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 55 to 70); 19.7% of the patients were women, and 69.1% had ischemic cardiomyopathy. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 30%.\n\n【36】Details of the initial implantation procedure are provided in Table S3. Of the patients in the transvenous ICD group, 48 (11.3%) received a dual-chamber device at initial implantation. A total of 10 patients crossed over to the other device without any attempt to implant the assigned device. Five additional patients crossed over shortly after initial implantation, and 14 patients crossed over during follow-up. Details of all the crossovers are provided in Table S4. Details of adherence to the device programming protocol are provided in Table S5.\n\n【37】Follow-up and Primary End Point\n-------------------------------\n\n【38】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Time-to-First-Event Curves for the Primary End Point and Its Components.\n\n【39】Shown is the cumulative incidence of the first occurrence of the composite primary end point (Panel A) and its components, the first device-related complication (Panel B) and the first inappropriate shock (Panel C). Hazard ratios were derived from Cox regressions and indicate the relative risk (subcutaneous ICD vs. transvenous ICD) of the end point. The 95% confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and therefore should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. Insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.Table 2.  Table 2. Primary Composite End Point.\n\n【40】Follow-up of the trial was completed on December 1, 2019. A total of 339 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and 346 patients in the transvenous ICD group had complete follow-up 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The median duration of follow-up was 49.1 months (48.0 months in the subcutaneous ICD group and 50.6 months in the transvenous ICD group). The primary end point occurred in 68 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 68 patients in the transvenous ICD group (48-month Kaplan–Meier estimated cumulative incidence, 15.1% and 15.7%, respectively). The hazard ratio for the primary end point was 0.99 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.71 to 1.39; noninferiority margin, 1.45; P=0.01 for noninferiority; P=0.95 for superiority) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2A and Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【41】Device-related complications occurred in 31 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 44 patients in the transvenous ICD group (cumulative incidence, 5.9% and 9.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.09) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2B )</u>. The incidence of complications within the first 30 days was 3.8% in the subcutaneous ICD group and 4.7% in the transvenous ICD group. The incidence of complications related to the ICD lead was lower in the subcutaneous ICD group than in the transvenous ICD group (1.4% vs. 6.6%) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【42】Inappropriate shocks occurred in 41 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 29 patients in the transvenous ICD group (cumulative incidence, 9.7% and 7.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2C )</u>. The first occurrences of inappropriate shocks in the subcutaneous ICD group were most frequently caused by cardiac oversensing (in 58.5% of the patients with an inappropriate shock), whereas inappropriate shocks in the transvenous ICD group were more commonly triggered by supraventricular arrhythmia (in 93.1%) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Deviations from the programming protocol at the time of first inappropriate shocks are described in the Supplementary Results section in the Supplementary Appendix ; the findings indicated that two episodes of inappropriate shocks in the transvenous ICD group may have been prevented if the prespecified programming had been used.\n\n【43】The findings of the primary analysis were consistent in the as-treated population 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. There were no between-group differences in the occurrence of the primary end point across prespecified subgroups 删除2:<u>(Fig. S4)</u>. Results of the competing-risks analyses, multivariable analyses, and sensitivity analyses that account for missing data are provided in Tables S6 through S11.\n\n【44】Secondary End Points\n--------------------\n\n【45】Table 3.  Table 3. Secondary End Points.\n\n【46】During the course of the trial, 83 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and 68 patients in the transvenous ICD group died (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.70) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Fig. S5)</u>. Causes of death are presented in Table S12. In each group, 18 patients died suddenly.\n\n【47】Appropriate ICD shocks were more frequent in patients in the subcutaneous ICD group than in those in the transvenous ICD group (19.2% vs. 11.5%; hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.12) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Fig. S6)</u> and included subcutaneous ICD shocks due to oversensing of ventricular tachycardia below the programmed therapy zone in 11 patients. Appropriate antitachycardia pacing was delivered in 12.9% of the patients in the transvenous ICD group and successfully terminated 55% of all treated episodes of ventricular tachycardia. A total of 5 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group underwent implantation of a transvenous device for pacing for the treatment of bradycardia. There were no between-group differences in the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events, hospitalization for heart failure, or total crossovers 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>, although there were numerically more crossovers during follow-up (shortly after the implantation attempt or later in follow-up) from the subcutaneous ICD to the transvenous ICD (14 patients) than vice versa (5 patients).\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】In this trial, we found that the subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to device-related complications or inappropriate shocks in patients with an indication for defibrillator therapy but with no indication for pacing. The results were consistent in several sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses. We observed equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the two groups, but there were numerically more deaths from other causes in the subcutaneous ICD group than in the transvenous ICD group.\n\n【50】With respect to the two components of the primary outcome, there was a higher cumulative incidence of device-related complications in the transvenous ICD group and a higher cumulative incidence of inappropriate shocks in the subcutaneous ICD group, although the trial was not powered for these comparisons. Perspectives may vary among physicians and patients about which component poses a heavier burden: whereas complications are associated primarily with physical distress, ICD shocks can have profound psychological implications. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13</a></sup></u>\n\n【51】The overall incidence of complications in this trial was as anticipated and was similar to that in previous studies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,14,15 </a></sup></u> Fewer lead-related complications (including infection, perforation, lead dislodgement, and lead dysfunction) and subsequent surgical reinterventions occurred in the subcutaneous ICD group than in the transvenous ICD group, but this effect was counterbalanced by more frequent pocket hematomas with the subcutaneous ICD. The use of general anesthesia and defibrillation testing was much greater with the subcutaneous ICD than with the transvenous ICD. Longer-term follow-up of this cohort will be important because the incidence of lead-related complications increases over time with the transvenous ICD 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> and because battery longevity is a limiting factor for the subcutaneous ICD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】Patients with a subcutaneous ICD had a higher risk of inappropriate shock than anticipated; the shocks were most frequently precipitated by oversensing of cardiac signals (predominantly T waves) and noncardiac signals. Although shocks on supraventricular arrhythmias can generally be managed with device reprogramming or medication, shocks caused by cardiac or noncardiac oversensing are less modifiable. However, a sensing filter that attenuates oversensing, which resulted in a 50% reduction of first inappropriate shocks in an earlier study, was introduced in a later stage of the trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> This filter was unavailable or not activated in the majority (78%) of patients with a subcutaneous ICD during their first inappropriate shock. Therefore, this trial could not assess the potential benefit of the sensing filter. Such changes to device technology may improve the future performance of the subcutaneous ICD.\n\n【53】We observed a higher cumulative incidence of appropriate shocks with the subcutaneous ICD than with the transvenous ICD, which was, for the most part, explained by the inability of the subcutaneous ICD to deliver antitachycardia pacing. Antitachycardia pacing terminated ventricular tachycardia in more than half the pacing attempts with the transvenous ICD. In addition, the sensing of the subcutaneous ICD, which is based on morphologic features, can result in double-counting of slow ventricular tachycardia occurring at a rate below the programmed therapy zone, thus causing the sensed rate (if both QRS complexes and T waves are counted) to exceed the therapy threshold. According to the end-point definition, which was based on earlier ICD trials, these shocks were classified as appropriate but — although occasionally clinically desirable — could be considered to be unnecessary. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,20</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】This trial has several limitations. First, the members of the clinical-events committee were aware of the trial-group assignments. Second, device technology evolved throughout the trial, and practitioners who performed the implantations had less experience with the subcutaneous ICD than with the transvenous ICD, which could have affected clinical outcomes. Third, screening data were incomplete, and thus selection bias could not be ruled out. Fourth, 27 patients were excluded before device implantation, 38 patients were lost to follow-up, and 126 patients died before having a primary end-point event. However, sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results. Fifth, it is debatable whether the magnitude of the possible between-group difference as reflected by the noninferiority margin is clinically acceptable. Finally, the median follow-up of 48 months was too limited to provide information on chronic complications. Long-term follow-up is therefore warranted and is ongoing.\n\n【55】The results of our trial showed that among patients with an indication for ICD therapy but not for pacing therapy, the subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to the cumulative incidence of the primary end point of device-related complications or inappropriate shocks.\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Boston Scientific .</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Knops reports receiving consulting fees from Boston Scientific, Abbott, and Medtronic; Dr. Delnoy, receiving grant support from Abbott, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Biotronik, MicroPort, and Cook Medical; Dr. Boersma, receiving grant support, paid to his institution, from Boston Scientific, serving as a primary investigator of the UNTOUCHED S-ICD (Understanding Outcomes with the EMBLEM S-ICD in Primary Prevention Patients with Low EF Study), and serving on a steering committee for the EMPOWER trial, the PRAETORIAN DFT (Prospective Randomized Comparative Trial of Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter–Defibrillator Implantation with and without Defibrillation Testing) trial, the ASE (Acute Feasibility Investigation of a New S-ICD Electrode Arrangement for Reduction of Defibrillation Energies) trial, and the EFFORTLESS S-ICD (Evaluation of Factors Impacting Clinical Outcome and Cost Effectiveness of the S-ICD) trial; Dr. Kuschyk, receiving consulting fees and lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. El-Chami, receiving consulting fees from Boston Scientific and Medtronic; Dr. Bonnemeier, receiving grant support from Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and Sorin Group; Dr. Behr, receiving grant support from Boston Scientific; Dr. Mittal, receiving consulting fees and advisory board fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Richter, receiving grant support, paid to Heart Center Leipzig–Leipzig Heart Institute, from Boston Scientific and grant support, paid to his institution, from Abbott and Biotronik; Dr. de Groot, receiving grant support from Abbott, AtriCure, and Boston Scientific, grant support and lecture fees from Medtronic, Bayer, and Daiichi Sankyo, consulting fees from Atrian Medical, Novartis, and Servier, and lecture fees from Johnson & Johnson; Ms. Kooiman, receiving consulting fees from Boston Scientific and Biotronik; Dr. Lambiase, receiving grant support and lecture fees from Boston Scientific, Abbott, and Medtronic; Dr. Vernooy, receiving grant support, paid to the Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, from Medtronic, Abbott, and Biotronik; Dr. Alings, receiving consulting fees from Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, Sanofi, and Portola Pharmaceuticals; Dr. Betts, receiving lecture fees from Boston Scientific; Dr. Burke, receiving grant support, consulting fees, and lecture fees from Boston Scientific and consulting fees from and equity in AtaCor Medical; and Dr. Wright, receiving grant support from Boston Scientific and consulting fees and lecture fees from Medtronic.

By tying the program eligibility of hospitals to their Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) adjustment percentage, which reflects the proportion of hospitalized patients who are low-income, the program is intended to expand resources for underserved populations but provides no direct incentives for hospitals to use financial gains to enhance care for low-income patients.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We used Medicare claims and a regression-discontinuity design, taking advantage of the threshold for program eligibility among general acute care hospitals (DSH percentage, >11.75%), to isolate the effects of the program on hospital–physician consolidation (i.e., acquisition of physician practices or employment of physicians by hospitals) and on the outpatient administration of parenteral drugs by hospital-owned facilities in three specialties in which parenteral drugs are frequently used. For low-income patients, we also assessed the effects of the program on the provision of care by hospitals and on mortality.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Hospital eligibility for the 340B Program was associated with 2.3 more hematologist–oncologists practicing in facilities owned by the hospital, or 230% more hematologist–oncologists than expected in the absence of the program (P=0.02), and with 0.9 (or 900%) more ophthalmologists per hospital (P=0.08) and 0.1 (or 33%) more rheumatologists per hospital (P=0.84). Program eligibility was associated with significantly higher numbers of parenteral drug claims billed by hospitals for Medicare patients in hematology–oncology (90% higher, P=0.001) and ophthalmology (177% higher, P=0.03) but not rheumatology (77% higher, P=0.12). Program eligibility was associated with lower proportions of low-income patients in hematology–oncology and ophthalmology and with no significant differences in hospital provision of safety-net or inpatient care for low-income groups or in mortality among low-income residents of the hospitals’ local service areas.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】The 340B Program has been associated with hospital–physician consolidation in hematology–oncology and with more hospital-based administration of parenteral drugs in hematology–oncology and ophthalmology. Financial gains for hospitals have not been associated with clear evidence of expanded care or lower mortality among low-income patients. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and others.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The federal 340B Drug Pricing Program allows qualifying hospitals to purchase outpatient drugs at substantial discounts and to dispense or administer them to patients while receiving standard reimbursements from insurers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The program was created in 1992, but few hospitals participated until eligibility was expanded for general acute care hospitals in 2003 and for other categories of hospitals in 2010. After 2003, the program grew rapidly, with 42% of general acute care hospitals participating by 2012.\n\n【12】The program is explicitly intended to encourage hospitals to dedicate resources generated from the discounts to expanding or improving care for vulnerable populations, particularly those served by safety-net providers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5 </a></sup></u> Accordingly, in assessing eligibility, the program favors hospitals that disproportionately serve low-income patients, but it does not require or provide incentives for hospitals to repurpose financial gains to enhance care for underserved patients. Rather, the discounts — which range from 20% to 50% — only strengthen the incentives for hospitals to supply drugs to patients who have generous insurance coverage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5,6 </a></sup></u> The extent to which hospitals support the mission of the program is subject to minimal oversight. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Thus, the program may not elicit the intended responses from hospitals — such as providing more care to low-income communities, investing in safety-net providers, or reducing health disparities — and may even have unintended consequences. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> In particular, the program may have induced provider consolidation. Particularly in the case of parenteral drugs that are infused or injected in clinical facilities (i.e., drugs reimbursed by Part B in Medicare), hospitals qualifying for the program have incentives to employ physicians and acquire or open practices with physicians who frequently order parenteral drugs, in order to increase referrals and expand capacity for outpatient drug administration. Hospitals are reimbursed for parenteral drugs when they are administered in hospital-owned facilities, including off-campus practices owned by hospitals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-11</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】The primary objective of this study was to assess the extent to which hospitals have followed program incentives by acquiring practices or employing more physicians in parenteral drug–intensive specialties, treating more patients in these specialties, and favoring high-income groups with more generous insurance when treating additional patients. The secondary objective was to test whether the program has been associated with expanded care or decreased mortality in low-income groups.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Study Design\n------------\n\n【17】To isolate the effects of the program, we used a regression-discontinuity design 删除3:<u><sup><a>12,13 </a></sup></u> that took advantage of the eligibility rules of the 340B Program for general acute care hospitals, which establish eligibility above a threshold of 11.75% in the Disproportionate Share Hospital adjustment percentage (DSH percentage) of each hospital. The DSH percentage, a federally defined measure that determines additional payments for uncompensated care, is largely based on the percentage of admissions at a hospital that are for Medicaid patients and low-income Medicare patients (see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【18】In the context of our study, a regression-discontinuity approach assumes that all determinants of hospital behavior for hospitals just above or just below the eligibility threshold were similar with the exception of exposure to the program. Equivalently, hospitals with minimally different DSH percentages within a sufficiently narrow range around the threshold are considered to be quasi-randomly assigned to program eligibility. In accordance with standard practice when there may be too few observations within such a range, we included hospitals from a broader range of DSH percentages and used regression to estimate threshold-related discontinuities (level shifts) in the cross-sectional relationship between hospital DSH percentages and each study outcome. This approach assumes that the relationship would have continued uninterrupted across the threshold in the absence of the program. Unlike comparisons of longitudinal changes (e.g., a difference-in-differences approach), our cross-sectional regression-discontinuity approach did not require hard-to-justify assumptions about how hospitals would have evolved in the absence of the program during a period of rapid hospital–physician consolidation.\n\n【19】Study Data and Population\n-------------------------\n\n【20】Our study included general acute care hospitals with 50 or more beds. We excluded for-profit hospitals because they are not eligible for the 340B Program and other categories of hospitals because they are subject to different eligibility criteria or payment systems. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> We further limited our analysis to hospitals with a DSH percentage within 10 percentage points of the 11.75% eligibility thresholds (i.e., 1.75% to 21.75%) and assessed the robustness of our results to narrower ranges in sensitivity analyses (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【21】For hospital-level analyses, we constructed hospital-level variables for each year from 2008 through 2012 using Medicare claims and enrollment data for a random 20% sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries and data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). For patient-level analyses of mortality in communities served by the hospitals in our study, we restricted the sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries to those living in ZIP Codes occupied by a single hospital (75% of the study hospitals fit this description).\n\n【22】Study Variables\n---------------\n\n【23】### _340B Program Participation and Eligibility_\n\n【24】Using data from the Health Resources and Services Administration, we categorized a hospital as a 340B Program participant in a given year if it was a registered participant at any point during the year. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> To assess the program eligibility of each hospital, we used the DSH percentage of the hospital from the previous year, as reported in the HCRIS, because eligibility is determined prospectively (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【25】### _Dependent Variables_\n\n【26】Our primary hospital-level analyses included several prespecified and closely related outcome measures, which are described in more detail in the Supplementary Appendix . For each hospital in each year, we adapted previously described methods, using Medicare outpatient and carrier claims to determine the number of physicians in hematology–oncology, ophthalmology, or rheumatology who were practicing in a facility owned by the hospital. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> We prespecified these three specialties because they account for the most Part B drug spending in Medicare and have the highest proportions of revenue attributable to parenteral drugs among all specialties. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,18 </a></sup></u> We focused on these specialties because of the emphasis of our study on parenteral drugs. However, the 340B Program may have accelerated hospital–physician integration in other specialties, too, because the discounts also apply to prescription drugs and may have encouraged hospital acquisitions of multispecialty groups. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【27】For each of the three specialties in each year and each hospital (including all outpatient practices and facilities owned by the hospital), we used Medicare claims and enrollment data to determine the number of Medicare patients served in outpatient facilities of the hospital by a physician in the specialty (see the Supplementary Appendix ), the number of these patients receiving Part B drugs from the hospital, the number of reimbursed Part B drug claims billed by the hospital for these patients (and associated Medicare revenue), and the proportion of these patients who were dually enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare or received state assistance for Medicare cost-sharing. These dually eligible beneficiaries have less generous coverage or coverage that reimburses hospitals at lower rates for Part B drugs and other services than do persons with private supplemental insurance.\n\n【28】For secondary hospital-level analyses assessing hospital investments in the safety net, we used HCRIS data to assess the following variables yearly for federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) integrated with each hospital: the number of health care professionals employed, the number of patient encounters, and Medicare spending for FQHC care. We also assessed from claims the number of inpatient admissions for low-income groups. For secondary patient-level analyses of Medicare beneficiaries in the ZIP Codes of the hospitals, we assessed annual mortality from Master Beneficiary Summary files.\n\n【29】### _Covariates_\n\n【30】As covariates for hospital-level and patient-level analyses, we assessed hospital teaching status, urban or rural classification, and Census region. As covariates for patient-level analyses of mortality, we additionally assessed the following patient characteristics: age, sex, race and ethnic group, whether disability was the original reason for Medicare enrollment, presence of end-stage renal disease, chronic conditions from the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse, and the Hierarchical Condition Category score.\n\n【31】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【32】For each hospital-level dependent variable, we fit the following model to estimate the eligibility threshold–related discontinuity in the relationship between the variable and the hospital DSH percentage:\n\n【33】E( _Y_ <sub><i>it </i></sub> ) = β <sub>0 </sub> +β <sub>1 </sub> 340BEligible <sub><i>it </i></sub> +β <sub>2 </sub> DSH <sub><i>it </i></sub> +β <sub>3 </sub> (340BEligible <sub><i>it </i></sub> ×DSH <sub><i>it </i></sub> )+γ X <sub><i>it </i></sub> +α <sub><i>t </i></sub> 删除3:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【34】where E( _Y_ <sub><i>it </i></sub> ) denotes the expected value of the outcome for hospital _i_ in year _t_ , 340BEligible <sub><i>it </i></sub> indicates whether the DSH percentage of the hospital exceeded the eligibility threshold, DSH <sub><i>it </i></sub> is the DSH percentage of the hospital, X <sub><i>it </i></sub> is a set of hospital-year level characteristics, and α <sub><i>t </i></sub> denotes fixed effects for year. The terms DSH <sub><i>it </i></sub> and (340BEligible <sub><i>it </i></sub> ×DSH <sub><i>it </i></sub> ) allow the slopes of the linear relationship between the hospital DSH percentage and outcome to differ on either side of the eligibility threshold.\n\n【35】The coefficient of interest, β <sub>1 </sub> , is the adjusted discontinuity, or the difference in the outcome between hospitals above versus below the program eligibility threshold after adjustment for covariates and the relationship between hospital DSH percentage and the outcome. This quantity represents the estimated effect of 340B eligibility on the outcome variable. Because some eligible hospitals do not enroll in the 340B Program, we used instrumental-variables methods to estimate discontinuities associated with program participation. To aid interpretation of the multiple tests in our primary analyses, we conducted post hoc significance tests using a modified Hochberg procedure 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> that accounted for the multiplicity of outcomes and the high degree of correlation among them. Additional details about these analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【36】For analyses of mortality in the local communities of hospitals, we estimated similar models at the patient level after restricting the sample to Medicare beneficiaries living in ZIP Codes occupied by a single hospital and assigning the DSH percentage of that hospital to all beneficiaries residing in its ZIP Code. In a supplemental analysis, we used a similar strategy to examine overall Part B drug use and spending among beneficiaries in the local communities of hospitals (see the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【37】In all analyses, we excluded hospitals with DSH percentages that were within 1 percentage point of the eligibility threshold in order to reduce measurement error introduced by misclassification of hospital eligibility among hospitals that were close to the threshold. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> This misclassification resulted from misalignment for some hospitals between annual periods for DSH reporting in the HCRIS and calendar-year periods used for determining eligibility. In hospital-level analyses, hospitals were weighted by their number of beds. All analyses used robust variance estimators to account for clustering at the hospital level. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u>\n\n【38】In sensitivity analyses, we tested the robustness of our estimates to adjustment for different specifications of the relationship between DSH percentage and outcomes. We also tested for eligibility-related discontinuities in hospital characteristics that should not be affected by the program and, for mortality analyses, in patient characteristics to test the assumption that potential confounders trended continuously across the eligibility threshold. We conducted additional analyses to assess the extent to which hospitals might have manipulated their DSH percentage to become eligible for the program, including analyses using the DSH percentages and hypothetical eligibility of hospitals in 2002 (before program expansion). In falsification tests, we repeated our hospital-level analyses among for-profit hospitals (which are not 340B-eligible) and among study hospitals in 2002 (when few were eligible), and we reestimated models using a range of alternate hypothetical eligibility thresholds.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】340B Program Eligibility and Participation\n------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Hospital participation in the 340B Program increased sharply at the DSH percentage threshold for eligibility, with some misclassification of program eligibility among hospitals close to the threshold, as expected 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. The eligibility of hospitals for the 340B Program was stable over short and long periods 删除2:<u>(Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. For example, hospitals that were eligible in 2008 and met inclusion criteria for analysis were eligible for 4.7 years of the 5-year study period, on average.\n\n【42】Hospital Response to 340B Program Incentives in Drug-Intensive Specialties\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Table 1. Table 1. Hospital–Physician Consolidation, Additional Patients Served in Hospital-Owned Settings, and Additional Hospital Drug Provision Associated with Eligibility for the 340B Program, According to Specialty. Figure 1.  Figure 1. 340B Program–Related Discontinuities in Hospital Ownership of Physician Practices and Part B Drug Administration per Year, According to Specialty.\n\n【44】For each specialty, the number of physicians in hospital-owned practices and the number of hospital Part B drug claims per year are plotted according to the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) adjustment percentage in the previous year, which determines 340B Program eligibility. Hospitals were categorized on the basis of their DSH percentage into 1-percentage-point bins, excluding hospitals within 1 percentage point of the eligibility threshold of 11.75%. Unadjusted bin means were calculated and plotted, with hospital size (in beds) used to weight hospital contributions to the mean. For illustrative purposes, a line of best fit to the bin means (darker blue lines) is shown to either side of the threshold, with 95% confidence intervals (lighter blue lines). The red vertical line denotes the threshold for 340B Program eligibility at a DSH percentage of 11.75%. Similar scatter plots of the numbers of patients served in hospital-owned practices and the proportion of patients served who were dually eligible by specialty across hospital DSH percentages are shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【45】Hospitals with DSH percentages that exceeded the program eligibility threshold had significantly more hematologist–oncologists practicing in hospital-owned facilities than did hospitals with percentages below the threshold 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Figure 1 )</u>. Specifically, the difference in the number of hematologist–oncologists between eligible and ineligible hospitals after adjustment for its relationship with hospital DSH percentage and hospital covariates (the adjusted discontinuity estimate) was 2.3 hematologist–oncologists per hospital (P=0.02). This translates to 230% more hematologist–oncologists per hospital than the expected mean in the absence of a discontinuity at the threshold (1.0 per hospital). Program eligibility was associated with an adjusted discontinuity of 0.9 (or 900%) more ophthalmologists per hospital (P=0.08) and 0.1 (or 33%) more rheumatologists per hospital (P=0.84). Program eligibility was also associated with significantly more patients receiving parenteral drugs and with significantly more Part B drug claims billed per year in hospital-owned facilities in hematology–oncology (90% more drug claims than the expected mean, P=0.001) and ophthalmology (177% more, P=0.03) but not in rheumatology (77% more, P=0.12). 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Figure 1 )</u>. In hospital-owned hematology–oncology and ophthalmology practices, program eligibility was associated with significantly lower percentages of patients who were dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【46】Instrumental-variables estimates of discontinuities associated with program participation (rather than eligibility) were substantially larger. We found no significant eligibility-related discontinuities in hospital characteristics. All significant estimates remained so after multiple outcomes were accounted for. Additional details of these analyses are provided in Tables S1, S2, and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【47】Care and Mortality in Low-Income Groups\n---------------------------------------\n\n【48】Table 2.  Table 2. Discontinuities in Hospital Care for Low-Income Groups and Mortality in Local Communities Associated with Eligibility for the 340B Program.\n\n【49】In hospital-level analyses, program eligibility was not associated with significant discontinuities in the number of health care professionals employed or patient encounters in integrated FQHCs or in the annual number of inpatient admissions for dually eligible Medicare beneficiaries, beneficiaries living in high-poverty areas, or beneficiaries served by safety-net providers 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. In patient-level analyses involving beneficiaries who were residing in ZIP Codes that had a single study hospital, program eligibility of the local hospital was associated with substantial discontinuities in shares of admissions and hospital outpatient spending attributable to 340B-eligible hospitals but was not associated with significant discontinuities in mortality for beneficiaries in the local communities of the hospitals (defined by hospital ZIP Codes), either overall or for low-income subgroups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Discontinuities in observed patient characteristics also were minimal 删除2:<u>(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【50】Sensitivity and Supplemental Analyses\n-------------------------------------\n\n【51】The results of all sensitivity analyses and falsification tests supported the conclusions of our main analyses, including analyses that were restricted to hospitals with DSH percentages that were within 3 percentage points of the eligibility threshold, which produced estimates that were similar to those from our main analyses and remained significant in all cases 删除2:<u>(Tables S5 through S14 and Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. In a supplemental patient-level discontinuity analysis examining whether the greater provision of parenteral drugs by hospitals that was associated with program eligibility was accompanied by higher total Part B drug spending in local communities for patients served by parenteral drug–intensive specialties, program exposure was associated with 10.2% higher spending on Part B drugs in hospital-owned settings (P=0.03) but with lower drug spending in the independent office setting. The net discontinuity in total drug spending (in either setting) was positive but not significant 删除2:<u>(Tables S15, S16, and S17 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【52】Discussion\n----------\n\n【53】Our findings suggest that in hematology–oncology and ophthalmology but not in rheumatology, hospitals that are eligible for the 340B Drug Pricing Program have responded to program incentives by increasing the outpatient provision of parenteral drugs and, in the case of hematology–oncology, by employing physicians or acquiring physician practices. Our findings also suggest the program prompted eligible hospitals to treat more Medicare patients who are more likely to have private supplemental insurance to cover the 20% of Part B drug costs that is not covered by Medicare. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> The finding that patients served by eligible hospitals were less likely to have Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals less generously than other forms of supplemental coverage, is consistent with the financial incentives of hospitals and with evidence that 340B-participating hospitals have increasingly affiliated with hematology–oncology practices serving affluent communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【54】The discontinuous increases in the provision of drugs in hospital-owned settings that were found in association with program eligibility in hospital-level analyses were evident in analyses of local communities of Medicare patients. However, local increases in the total use of Part B drugs that also included provision of drugs in independent office settings (and not just in hospital-owned settings) were not significant. These findings suggest that much of the increase in the use of hospital-provided drugs resulted from a shift in setting, a finding consistent with hospital acquisitions of physician practices and more frequent referrals to hospital-owned specialty practices and infusion sites. We could not reject, however, the possibility of a meaningful effect of the program on total parenteral drug use in communities served by eligible hospitals that our analysis was not adequately powered to detect.\n\n【55】We found no evidence of hospitals using the surplus monetary resources generated from administering discounted drugs to invest in safety-net providers, provide more inpatient care to low-income patients, or enhance care for low-income groups in ways that would reduce mortality. These results suggest hospital responses that are contrary to the goals of the program and have a number of important policy implications. In general, policies that are intended to improve or expand care for medically underserved populations may be ineffective if they rely on indirect mechanisms with weak incentives, such as the cross-subsidization that the 340B Program intends for hospitals to implement. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】Our findings suggest that the recent decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to lower drug reimbursements to hospitals participating in the 340B Program 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> could slow hospital–physician consolidation while not adversely affecting care for low-income patients served by general acute hospitals. This form of consolidation has increased prices and spending without ostensibly improving quality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17,25-28 </a></sup></u> Building on previous evidence, 删除3:<u><sup><a>29,30 </a></sup></u> our study more generally underscores the importance of differences in profitability between hospital-owned and independent outpatient settings in encouraging hospital–physician consolidation. Thus, our findings support broader proposals to make payments and discounts for care delivery setting-neutral. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】Our study had several limitations. First, we relied largely on Medicare data. We would expect, however, that major investments in clinical resources for low-income groups outside of Medicare, such as the uninsured, would also affect care for low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, we found no evidence of enhanced care for a subgroup of Medicare patients with supplemental insurance that is less generous or reimburses hospitals at lower rates than private supplemental insurance. In addition, measures of hospital investments in FQHCs were not specific to Medicare.\n\n【58】Second, program-related increases in hospital ownership of physician practices could have been overstated if practices owned by hospitals merely changed place-of-service codes to allow administration of discounted drugs. However, hospitals have strong incentives to encourage such coding practices, regardless of the program, because Medicare pays for services in hospital-owned settings at higher rates than in independent office settings. Third, our regression-discontinuity approach supported inferences about hospitals just above the eligibility thresholds. Hospitals with higher DSH percentages could have responded differently to program discounts. Fourth, our conclusions may not apply to categories of eligible hospitals we did not study, such as critical access hospitals.\n\n【59】In conclusion, the 340B Drug Pricing Program has been associated with hospital–physician consolidation in hematology–oncology and with more hospital-based administration of parenteral drugs in hematology–oncology and ophthalmology without clear evidence of expanded care or lower mortality among low-income patients.\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (U19HS024072) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (71408) and by the Marshall J.

We describe three siblings with profound muscle and heart glycogen deficiency caused by a homozygous stop mutation (R462→ter) in the muscle glycogen synthase gene. The oldest brother died from sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 10.5 years. Two years later, an 11-year-old brother showed muscle fatigability, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and an abnormal heart rate and blood pressure while exercising; a 2-year-old sister had no symptoms. In muscle-biopsy specimens obtained from the two younger siblings, there was lack of glycogen, predominance of oxidative fibers, and mitochondrial proliferation. Glucose tolerance was normal.\n\n【3】Introduction\n------------\n\n【4】Glycogen storage is essential for glucose homeostasis. The key enzymes of glycogen synthesis are muscle glycogen synthase and liver glycogen synthase, which are encoded by the glycogen synthase 1 gene ( _GYS1,_ Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man \\[OMIM\\] database number 138570) and glycogen synthase 2 gene ( _GYS2,_ OMIM number 138571). The liver-enzyme expression is restricted to the liver, whereas the muscle enzyme is ubiquitously expressed (UniGene accession numbers Hs.82614 and Hs.386225). Liver glycogen serves as a pool to maintain the blood glucose level during fasting, whereas muscle glycogen synthesis accounts for disposal of up to 90% of ingested glucose. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The role of muscle and heart glycogen is to provide critical energy during bursts of activity and sustained muscle work.\n\n【5】In liver glycogen storage disease type 0 (OMIM number 240600), which is caused by liver glycogen synthase deficiency, the main clinical finding is intolerance to fasting accompanied by hypoglycemia. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> We describe the findings in three siblings who were identified with profound muscle glycogen deficiency and homozygous stop mutations in _GYS1_ .\n\n【6】Case Reports\n------------\n\n【7】Patient 1\n---------\n\n【8】Patient 1 was the first child of healthy consanguineous parents of Syrian origin. Patients 2 and 3 were his younger siblings. A fourth sibling — an 8-year-old sister — had no symptoms. The mother's obstetric history included a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation and a stillbirth at 32 weeks. There was no muscle or early cardiac disease or diabetes mellitus in 22 investigated relatives and no occurrence of sudden death in the family. Patient 1 developed normally until the age of 4 years, when he had an episode of tonic–clonic seizures. Postictal electrocardiography showed a transiently prolonged corrected QT interval of 500 msec. Cardiac ultrasonography and a 3-day electrocardiographic recording showed no abnormalities. Brain imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance showed normal results. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed bilateral epileptogenic spikes in the parietal and occipital regions. Partial complex epilepsy was diagnosed, and he was treated with carbamazepine, which was changed to lamotrigine after 2 years. Gross motor performance was somewhat clumsy, and he tired easily and had difficulty keeping up with the physical activities of his peers. Three subsequent EEGs, including one video EEG recording, were normal.\n\n【9】At the age of 10.5 years, while playing outside his school, Patient 1 suddenly collapsed as the result of a cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. At autopsy, the heart weighed 200 g (normal range, 139 to 178). The thickness of the left ventricular wall was 1.7 cm (normal value, <0.9 cm). No other disease was found, and the cause of death was listed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\n【10】Patient 2\n---------\n\n【11】This 11-year-old boy was investigated 2 years after the death of his brother. After the age of 6 years, he was unable to keep up with the physical activities of his peers and had muscle symptoms similar to those of Patient 1. Two exercise tests showed very poor performance and a decrease in blood pressure, which prompted further investigation. Routine laboratory tests and a metabolic workup (which included measurement of plasma and urinary amino acids, serum carnitine, urinary organic acids, blood and spinal-fluid lactate, and pyruvate) revealed no abnormalities. Cardiac and neurologic examinations indicated cardiac and skeletal muscle disease. A skeletal-muscle biopsy for mitochondrial investigation was performed. After the diagnostic workup, the patient was treated with selective β <sub>1 </sub> \\-receptor blockade (bisoprolol) for cardiac protection.\n\n【12】Patient 3\n---------\n\n【13】The 2-year-old sister had no clinical symptoms and had normal psychomotor development. However, cardiac examination indicated cardiac involvement. A skeletal-muscle biopsy was performed, and she was started on cardioprotective medication with metoprolol.\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】Only clinically relevant investigations were performed. We obtained the parents' oral consent to reexamine medical records and autopsy material of Patient 1. Investigation of relatives and control subjects was performed after informed written consent was obtained. The investigation was approved by the regional ethical review board in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\n【16】Methods and Results\n-------------------\n\n【17】Cardiac Evaluation and Exercise Tests\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】Table 1.  Table 1. Results of Cardiac Evaluation in Patients 2 and 3 and Exercise Tests in Patient 2.\n\n【19】Details of cardiac evaluation (for Patients 2 and 3) and exercise tests (for Patient 2) are shown in Table 1 . Normal results were obtained on 24-hour Holter monitoring and on routine resting electrocardiography, except for T-wave flattening in Patient 2. There was mild generalized hypertrophy of the left ventricle of Patient 2. In both patients, there was left atrial enlargement and mildly impaired diastolic function at rest. In Patient 3, there was also subtly impaired systolic function at rest.\n\n【20】The exercise tests of Patient 2 showed poor performance, with a low maximal workload, a pathologic blood-pressure response, and a 30% decrease in stroke volume during exercise. The test duration was 3.5 minutes in a standard ramp protocol with a starting load of 30 W and 10-W increments per minute. To enable metabolic analyses during the test, a steady-state protocol with a starting load of 30 W and 3-minute increments of 5 W was chosen for the cardiorespiratory exercise test. With this protocol, Patient 2 exercised for 10.5 minutes, but there was a steady increase in heart rate for only the first 3 minutes. Both tests were terminated owing to leg fatigue and, in the latter test, a drop in blood pressure. The patient had no leg cramps or pain.\n\n【21】Neurologic Examination\n----------------------\n\n【22】Neurologic examination of Patient 2 showed no stigmata, and gross muscle mass appeared normal. Isometric muscle strength, measured with an electronic hand-held dynamometer, was decreased to 50 to 60% of normal in all tested muscle groups. His IQ was low but within the normal range (73, with a normal range >70), according to the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Patient 3 showed no stigmata, and gross muscle mass and function appeared normal. Fine motor skills and mental development were normal.\n\n【23】Glucose Tolerance\n-----------------\n\n【24】A tolerance test with intravenous glucose (0.5 g per kilogram of body weight) in Patient 2 showed a peak plasma glucose level (19.6 mmol per liter) 7 minutes after glucose administration and a peak serum insulin level (42 mU per liter) after 20 minutes. Normoglycemia was achieved within 40 minutes (rate constant, 2.55% per minute; normal 50th percentile, 2.27% per minute). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【25】Continuous glucose monitoring (Medtronic MiniMed Solutions) during a 24-hour period showed a normal pattern, with a glucose level between 3.9 and 5.6 mmol per liter. The glycated hemoglobin level was 4.6% (reference interval, 3.6 to 5.0).\n\n【26】Morphologic and Biochemical Analysis\n------------------------------------\n\n【27】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Histochemical Analysis and Electron Microscopy.\n\n【28】A muscle-biopsy specimen from Patient 2 shows severely reduced levels of glycogen in the muscle fibers (Panels A and C), as compared with normal muscle (Panels B and D, with arrows pointing at glycogen granules in Panel D), demonstrated by staining with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent (Panels A and B) and electron microscopy (Panels C and D). A muscle-biopsy specimen from Patient 2 shows a marked accumulation of mitochondria, especially in the subsarcolemmal region stained with the Gomori–Engel trichrome method (Panel E) and showing succinate dehydrogenase activity (Panel F). Electron microscopy (Panel G) shows enlarged mitochondria with inclusions in the intermembrane space (arrows). Sections from cardiac muscle (Panels H and I) and liver (Panels J and K) obtained from Patient 1 were stained with PAS before (Panels H and J) and after (Panels I and K) treatment with amylase to remove glycogen from the tissue. No glycogen is shown in cardiac muscle, whereas the identically handled liver shows apparently normal glycogen levels.\n\n【29】Patients 2 and 3 underwent open biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle. Isolation of mitochondria, polarographic and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain, morphologic and histochemical analysis of fresh-frozen muscle tissue, and electron microscopy were performed as described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Staining with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent and electron microscopy revealed profound deficiency of glycogen in all muscle fibers. In addition, there was a marked predominance of type 1 muscle fibers and mitochondrial proliferation in both patients 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Figure 1 , and Fig. 2 of the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u></u>.\n\n【30】Electron microscopy that was performed in the sample from Patient 2 revealed numerous mitochondria with inclusions in the intermembrane space. The biochemical workup of his muscle sample resulted in an extremely high yield of mitochondria (9.0 mg of protein per gram of muscle; reference interval, 2.5 to 4.8), whereas the respiratory rate was within normal limits for all added substrates.\n\n【31】In Patient 1, sections of paraffin-embedded specimens from the heart and liver that were prepared from paraformaldehyde-fixed postmortem samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and PAS. The cardiac-muscle specimen showed myocyte hypertrophy with enlarged nuclei but no myocyte disarray or fibrosis. No glycogen was detected in cardiomyocytes by PAS staining. In contrast, the liver, which had been subjected to an identical fixing procedure, contained a normal amount of glycogen.\n\n【32】Molecular Genetics\n------------------\n\n【33】Figure 2.  Figure 2. DNA, RNA, and Protein Analyses.\n\n【34】In Panel A, alignment of muscle glycogen synthase nucleotides in DNA from Patient 2 and a control shows the homozygous 1384C→T transition in exon 11 (arrow). The CGA codon for arginine is changed to a premature TGA termination codon. In Panel B, analysis of complementary DNA (cDNA) of β-actin shows _GYS1_ and _GYS2_ transcripts from muscle obtained from Patient 2, control muscle, and control liver. Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen skeletal muscle and liver tissue. In muscle, there was only a trace of the _GYS1_ transcript in Patient 2, as compared with the control, despite the similar levels of β-actin. The liver-specific _GYS2_ could not be amplified from cDNA obtained from muscle tissue from either Patient 2 or the control. _GYS2_ was amplified from cDNA only from the control liver sample. Transcripts of _GYS1_ were amplified from the liver cDNA, which supports the finding that muscle glycogen synthase is also expressed in the liver. In Panel C, analysis by restriction-fragment–length polymorphism shows amplified genomic DNA from the family members of Patients 1 and 2 and from a control. The amplified 313-bp fragment was digested with the endonuclease _Bgl_ I into two fragments of 202 and 111 bp in wild-type but not in mutant DNA. In the two affected boys (Patients 1 and 2), the digested fragments were not cleaved, indicating that only mutant DNA was present. The parents were carriers of both mutant and wild-type DNA. In Panel D, Western blot analysis of muscle tissue with polyclonal antibodies against glycogen synthase shows no detectable level of glycogen synthase in Patient 2, as compared with the control. Equal amounts of total protein extracted from skeletal muscle tissue from Patient 2 and the control were loaded and separated on 3 to 8% TRIS-acetate gels (Invitrogen), followed by electroblotting onto Invitrolon polyvinylidene difluoride filters. The membrane was incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit antihuman glycogen synthase antibodies, and Western Breeze (Invitrogen) was used for antibody detection. Coomassie blue staining of the myosin heavy-chain band served as the loading control.\n\n【35】Total DNA was extracted from fresh-frozen skeletal-muscle tissue from Patients 2 and 3, paraffin-embedded heart-muscle tissue from Patient 1, and blood from the parents, relatives, and control subjects, with the use of standard methods. The entire coding region with flanking intronic sequences of _GYS1_ (GenBank accession number NM\\_002103) was amplified by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Direct sequencing showed two homozygous changes in Patient 2, as compared with the reference sequence: 1206C→T in exon 7, which appeared to be a silent mutation, and a 1384C→T transition in exon 11, which changed a CGA, coding for arginine, to a TGA termination signal 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. This premature stop codon is predicted to result in truncation of muscle glycogen synthase at amino acid residue 462. Thus, the part of the enzyme harboring the active site 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> with the amino acid residues E510 and E518 is predicted to be lost. The same homozygous mutation was seen in Patients 1 and 3, whereas both parents were carriers.\n\n【36】PCR products from _GYS1_ complementary DNA (cDNA) of total muscle RNA were reduced in Patients 2 and 3 relative to the β-actin level, as compared with a control sample 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 , and Fig. 3 of the Supplementary Appendix )</u>, probably because of nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Sequencing and cleavage of the cDNA product revealed only mutant genotype (not shown). There was no detectable transcript amplified by liver-specific _GYS2_ primers either in muscle cDNA from the patients or in control muscle. Both _GYS1_ and _GYS2_ transcripts were readily amplified in a control liver sample 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The endonuclease _Bgl_ I (Promega) was used to digest genomic DNA and cDNA at the site of the nonsense mutation. Wild-type but not mutant DNA was cleaved 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Analysis of restriction-fragment–length polymorphism was used to confirm sequencing results and for analysis of relatives and control subjects.\n\n【37】The mutation occurred in the family as expected for a family in which a recessively inherited disorder has been identified. The maternal and paternal grandmothers and three additional relatives were carriers. The other family members were homozygous for the wild-type gene. The lod score in the pedigree was calculated to 2.5, which implies odds of less than 1 in 300 (P<0.003) that the association occurred by chance. The mutation was found in 1 of 200 alleles from an ethnically matched control group. Pedigree, primers, and detailed procedures are available in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【38】Protein Analysis\n----------------\n\n【39】_GYS1_ expression was analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal rabbit antihuman glycogen synthase antibodies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> A band corresponding to the 84-kD glycogen synthase protein was present only in the normal control lane 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 , and Fig. 3 of the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【40】Discussion\n----------\n\n【41】Our investigations identified patients with profound skeletal- and cardiac-muscle glycogen deficiency caused by mutations in the muscle glycogen synthase gene. We suggest that this entity be termed muscle glycogen storage disease 0 in analogy with the disease caused by liver glycogen synthase deficiency (OMIM number 240600). Several findings in the patients are in accordance with the findings in muscle glycogen synthase knockout (MGSKO) mice 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-10 </a></sup></u> (e.g., increased cardiac mass, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> an absence of muscle glycogen, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,10 </a></sup></u> predominance of oxidative muscle fibers, 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> and normal-to-improved glucose clearance). 删除3:<u><sup><a>10</a></sup></u>\n\n【42】The abnormal cardiac response to increased workload in Patient 2 indicates a critical role for an endogenous source of glucose in the heart. His heart was able to work normally at a high rate for only 3 to 4 minutes, after which time cardiac performance deteriorated. This pattern fits the glycogen-shunt hypothesis for rapid energy delivery, which proposes that glycogenolysis supplies energy within milliseconds for contraction and that between contractions of muscle fibers glycogenesis refills the pool. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Accordingly, our patient also had a severely reduced capacity for sustained muscle work.\n\n【43】An unexpected finding in Patient 2 (as well as in MGSKO mice) was a lack of impairment in glucose disposal after a glucose load. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> On the basis of studies using quantitative 删除3:<u><sup>13 </sup></u> C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, it has been concluded that muscle glycogen synthesis is the principal pathway for glucose disposal both in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes and that defects in such synthesis have a dominant role in insulin resistance in persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The fate of ingested glucose in Patient 2 and in MGSKO mice is not clear, but the preponderance of oxidative muscle fibers points to an increased capacity for complete oxidation of glucose in muscle tissue.\n\n【44】The finding of a severely reduced exercise capacity in Patient 2 supports the general view that glycogen and glycogenolysis are critical for energy supply during exercise, which is also true, for example, in McArdle disease (OMIM number 232600). However, in McArdle disease, the impairment is confined to muscle tissue, and an increased circulation and delivery of fuel may in part compensate for the defect. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> In MGSKO mice, exercise capacity did not differ from that of control mice. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> However, there is a fundamental difference in glycogen distribution in humans as compared with rodents. In rodents, 5 to 10 times as much glycogen is stored in the liver as in muscle; the opposite ratio occurs in humans. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Studies in rats suggest that rodents are more dependent on liver glycogen stores for exercise than are humans. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> It is also noteworthy that the basal blood glucose level in MGSKO mice during exercise experiments was about 2 mmol per liter higher than that in humans at the basal level. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> A higher blood glucose level is associated with an improvement in exercise performance in McArdle disease. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【45】Patient 1 had epilepsy, which may have been coincidental to the glycogen storage disease. Glycogen is stored in the normal brain, and one hypothesis is that the primary function of the cerebral glycogen pool is to help provide energy to support rapid glutamate neurotransmitter clearance by astrocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> This theory implies that deficiency in this function may result in an excess of excitatory neurotransmitters and uncontrolled excitation. Furthermore, a patient with complete muscle glycogen depletion and increased respiratory chain enzyme activity after status epilepticus might have primary muscle glycogen deficiency. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> Patient 2's low IQ might indicate that glycogenolysis is important for memory consolidation, as has been found in experiments in animals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16</a></sup></u>\n\n【46】In summary, we describe an inborn error of metabolism with zero muscle glycogen storage, which is easily revealed by routine histochemical investigation of muscle tissue. A sample of three siblings, of whom one may be too young to have symptoms, is too small for a complete delineation of the phenotype of this disease. The finding that there is 1 carrier of the mutation among 100 control subjects indicates that the disorder might occur at a frequency of the same magnitude as other rare metabolic disorders in this ethnic group. The findings in our patients indicate that such cases might be found by a wider use of exercise tests and screening for muscle disease in children and adolescents not only with obvious muscle symptoms but also with myocardial disease or epilepsy. Investigation of muscle tissue should also be included in the forensic investigations of sudden death from cardiovascular causes or other sudden death in children and adolescents with epilepsy.\n\n【47】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【48】参考删除-1:<u>Presented in part at the 42nd Annual Symposium of the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Paris, September 6–9, 2005, and at the 10th International Congress of the World Muscle Society, Iguassu Falls, Brazil, September 28–October 1, 2005.</u>\n\n【49】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (project number 7122, to Dr. Oldfors) from the Swedish Research Council.</u>\n\n【50】参考删除-1:<u>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>We thank Dr. Oluf Pedersen, who provided rabbit antihuman glycogen synthase antibodies; and the patients' family, their relatives, and the Assyrian community in Göthenburg for their support.</u>\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>From the Departments of Pathology (G.K., A.O.), Pediatrics (M.T., T.G., I.O.-S., G.F.), and Clinical Chemistry (E.H.), Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg; and the Department of Pediatrics, Västerås Hospital, Västerås (P.J.) — both in Sweden.</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Address reprint requests to Dr. Holme at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden, or at elisabeth.holme@clinchem.gu.se .</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Supplementary Appendix | PDF | 512KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>References _(16)_\n-----------------</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

We analyzed the economic costs associated with the transplantation of cadaveric kidneys with various numbers of HLA mismatches and examined the potential economic benefits of a local, as compared with a national, system designed to minimize HLA mismatches between donor and recipient in first cadaveric renal transplantations.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】All data were supplied by the U.S. Renal Data System. Data on all payments made by Medicare from 1991 through 1997 for the care of recipients of a first cadaveric renal transplant were analyzed according to the number of HLA-A, B, and DR mismatches between donor and recipient and the duration of cold ischemia before transplantation.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Average Medicare payments for renal-transplant recipients in the three years after transplantation increased from $60,436 per patient for fully HLA-matched kidneys (those with no HLA-A, B, or DR mismatches) to $80,807 for kidneys with six HLA mismatches between donor and recipient, a difference of 34 percent (P<0.001). By three years after transplantation, the average Medicare payments were $64,119 for transplantations of kidneys with less than 12 hours of cold-ischemia time and $74,997 for those with more than 36 hours (P<0.001). In simulations, the assignment of cadaveric kidneys to recipients by a method that minimized HLA mismatching within a local geographic area (i.e., within one of the approximately 50 organ-procurement organizations, which cover widely varying geographic areas) produced the largest cost savings ($4,290 per patient over a period of three years) and the largest improvements in the graft-survival rate (2.3 percent) when the potential costs of longer cold-ischemia time were considered.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Transplantation of better-matched cadaveric kidneys could have substantial economic advantages. In our simulations, HLA-based allocation of kidneys at the local level produced the largest estimated cost savings, when the duration of cold ischemia was taken into account. No additional savings were estimated to result from a national allocation program, because the additional costs of longer cold-ischemia time were greater than the advantages of optimizing HLA matching.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The debate about the value of HLA matching in renal transplantation continues. Large retrospective studies have shown the potential for clear improvements in graft survival as a result of better HLA matching. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-4 </a></sup></u> A prospective study of mandatory national assignment of cadaveric kidneys to recipients with no HLA antigen mismatches demonstrated benefits in terms of graft survival. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> An expanded policy of assigning cadaveric kidneys to recipients with whom there are no HLA mismatches (i.e., no HLA-A, B, or DR antigen mismatches), regardless of geographic region, has been implemented, but further expansion of the requirement for national assignment of kidneys to recipients with whom there is some degree of HLA mismatching has met strong resistance.\n\n【12】The current allocation policy of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) favors better matching of kidneys and recipients with some degree of HLA incompatibility on the local level (i.e., within one of the approximately 50 organ-procurement organizations, which cover widely varying geographic areas), but it does not directly discourage transplantation when the most donor–recipient mismatches are present — that is, mismatches of five or six HLA antigens. Only a national system of allocation could minimize HLA mismatches in all cases. The current national scheme for assigning cadaveric kidneys to recipients with whom there are no HLA mismatches, regardless of the geographic region, increases the duration of cold ischemia (the time from donation to transplantation). Increasing cold-ischemia time might decrease graft survival and increase costs if a national allocation system were implemented. In addition, strategies to minimize HLA mismatching might further skew the racial distribution of transplants toward whites and away from members of minority groups, thus raising questions about the ethics of such a system. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Throughout the debate and study of this issue, little information has been available on the economic implications of HLA matching. Gjertson et al. argued that a savings of approximately $1,000 per patient could be realized by five years after transplantation if cadaveric kidneys were allocated nationally on the basis of a hierarchical system designed to maximize HLA matches. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> However, their economic calculations were based on a model of the cost of return to dialysis, graft removal, and transportation of organs. Data on actual expenses for the care of transplant recipients were not available for their calculations.\n\n【14】We undertook an analysis of the actual medical expenses associated with different levels of HLA mismatching in cadaveric renal transplantation. These expenses include the cost of the transplantation, including the postoperative medical care and immunosuppression, and the cost of dialysis in patients whose grafts fail. Using UNOS registry data linked to Medicare claims and payment data, we calculated the average Medicare payments associated with various degrees of HLA mismatching between donor and recipient. Average Medicare payments associated with increasing cold-ischemia times were also calculated. These figures were combined in simulations to generate estimates of the economic ramifications of HLA-based methods of allocating cadaveric kidneys either locally or nationally.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Sources of Data\n---------------\n\n【17】All data were supplied by the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS), 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> a joint effort of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The system was designed to collect, analyze, and distribute descriptive data on end-stage renal disease in the United States, including prevalence, treatment methods, survival, and costs of care. The USRDS provided us with records for all transplantations performed in the United States and recorded in the UNOS renal-transplantation registry. The USRDS linked the UNOS registry to HCFA billing and payment records for the Medicare system. This linkage made possible the analysis both of the characteristics and outcomes of renal-transplant recipients and of the charges and payments for the medical services provided to them. Because 92.5 percent of all payments for medical services for patients with end-stage renal disease are from Medicare, payments from secondary insurance coverage, and patient copayments, 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> it was possible to examine the clinical outcomes associated with characteristics of donors, recipients, and protocols for nearly every renal transplantation performed in the United States and to determine the actual costs to Medicare associated with the outcomes. Changes in organ-allocation policy would presumably affect all recipients of cadaveric organs, regardless of their health care coverage. Therefore, no exclusions based on health care coverage were made. The economic analysis presented here focuses on the expected effect of a change in allocation policy on average costs to Medicare for all transplantations of cadaveric kidneys in the United States.\n\n【18】Determination of HLA Matching\n-----------------------------\n\n【19】The algorithm we used to calculate the number of HLA mismatches is that currently used by UNOS to determine the extent of HLA mismatching for organ allocation. An HLA mismatch exists when a donor's HLA-A, B, or DR antigen does not match the recipient's corresponding HLA-A, B, or DR antigen. Numbers of HLA mismatches were calculated on the basis of UNOS coding.\n\n【20】Theoretical Distribution of Organs\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】Estimates of the local and national distributions of cadaveric kidneys for transplantation according to the number of HLA mismatches that might result from a system designed to ensure minimal HLA mismatching were obtained from Takemoto et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> These two simulated distributions of organs were chosen because the estimated national proportion of kidneys allocated to recipients with no HLA mismatches agreed with the figures reported by UNOS for cadaveric kidney transplantations in 1996. UNOS reported that 14 percent of cadaveric renal transplantations in 1996 involved no HLA mismatches, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> and Takemoto et al. estimated that a rate of 14 percent would result from a policy of national allocation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】The simulated local distribution of organs was designed to represent allocation within an organ-procurement organization, which may cover an area from part of a large city to several states, and was based on a pool of 750 recipients. The pool for the simulated national distribution was made up of 5000 recipients. Although there are more than 40,000 patients on the waiting list for kidney transplants, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> a pool of 5000 was chosen, according to Takemoto et al., “to take into account the \\`friction' in a national waiting list wherein selected recipients are often unavailable for transplant.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【23】The simulations of Takemoto et al. showed the potential of a strategy of minimizing HLA mismatches at either the local or the national level to reduce the degree of mismatching from that which results from the current system. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> The current system of allocating kidneys grants points to a donor–recipient pair for certain combinations of two or fewer mismatches. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Points are also granted for other factors. The organ is assigned to the donor–recipient pair with the most total points. The strategy of minimizing mismatching that we used in our simulations involves first identifying the set of recipients with the fewest HLA mismatches with a given donor organ. For example, for a given organ, the fewest mismatches possible might be three, and there might be several possible recipients for that organ with three mismatches. The organ would then be assigned to one of these recipients on the basis of the factors other than HLA matching that are currently used in the point system. The current system considers HLA matching and other factors simultaneously. By emphasizing mismatches before other factors and by taking into account more than two HLA mismatches, a system based on minimal HLA mismatching could much more effectively avoid transplantations with high numbers of mismatches.\n\n【24】According to current policy regarding local and national allocations, kidneys were assumed to be assigned to recipients with no HLA mismatches throughout the nation. The proportion of transplantations that involved donor–recipient pairs with no HLA mismatches was determined by actual experience with the current national allocation policy. We made adjustments to the estimates of local distribution made by Takemoto et al. so as to incorporate the current rate of transplantation of kidneys with no HLA mismatches (14 percent) in 1996. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,8</a></sup></u>\n\n【25】Estimation of Costs\n-------------------\n\n【26】Average cumulative costs were calculated according to a generalization of the Kaplan–Meier method for continuous data, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> an information-preserving method that incorporates data on patients with incomplete follow-up by systematically accounting for the censoring of observations at the time of the last known follow-up. The incremental addition to cumulative costs on any given day is the average cost on that day for the patients followed up to that point. For example, the addition to average cumulative costs on day 365 is simply the average of the costs incurred on day 365 by patients with 365 days of follow-up. Sequentially summing these average daily costs produces estimates of the average cost of care over time while conserving all available information. Patients were included in the analysis from the day of transplantation to the last follow-up contact or death. Therefore, this method includes all costs to Medicare of medical care — including, for example, hospitalization for transplantation, acute rejection, or infection; return to dialysis; and retransplantation.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Measuring significance levels associated with average cumulative costs is difficult, because of the complex nature of the calculations involved. Mathematically derived standard errors are not available for the information measured in this case. Bootstrap methods produce very accurate estimates of error and confidence intervals by means of repeated random sampling from the original sample. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10,11 </a></sup></u> Statistics of interest generated by the resampling provide information about the distribution of the variable being estimated. It is often suggested that 1000 bootstrap replications are the minimum necessary to produce confidence intervals. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> We performed 2000 bootstrap replications for each analysis.\n\n【29】Graft survival was estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, with P values given for the log-rank test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Differences were considered significant at an alpha level of 0.05. All tests were two-tailed.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Patients\n--------\n\n【32】All patients recorded in the UNOS registry (distributed with the 1999 release of the USRDS data base 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> ) as undergoing renal transplantation from 1991 through 1997 were initially included in the analysis. We excluded recipients of transplants from living donors, those who received multiorgan transplants, and those with missing information on HLA matching. Patients who received first transplants before 1991 were also excluded. A total of 27,050 patients remained in the analysis of the effects of HLA matching. Among these patients, the duration of cold ischemia was recorded for 26,977.\n\n【33】HLA Matching\n------------\n\n【34】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Average Cumulative Medicare Payments for Patients Receiving Cadaveric Renal Transplants, According to the Number of HLA Mismatches.\n\n【35】The absence of HLA mismatches was associated with the lowest average Medicare payments ($60,436 at three years), and six HLA mismatches were associated with the highest average Medicare payments ($80,807 at three years, P<0.001 for the comparison between zero and six mismatches).Table 1.  Table 1. Actual and Theoretical Proportions of Transplantations Involving Various Numbers of HLA Mismatches, Graft-Survival Rates, and Average Medicare Payments at Three Years after Transplantation.\n\n【36】Average cumulative Medicare payments for patients receiving transplants with zero to six HLA mismatches are shown in Figure 1 . As expected, transplantations involving no HLA mismatches were associated with the lowest average Medicare payments ($60,436 at three years), and those involving six HLA mismatches with the highest payments ($80,807 at three years, P<0.001). Average Medicare payments through three years after transplantation and three-year graft-survival rates are presented in Table 1 . From zero to six HLA mismatches, the total cost increased by $20,371, or 34 percent.\n\n【37】The reduction in the graft-survival rate from transplantations involving no HLA mismatches to those involving six was 11 percent (P<0.001). The most pronounced effect of increased HLA mismatching on graft survival, a decrease of 4 percent, occurred from zero to one mismatch (P<0.001). However, the most pronounced economic effect of increased HLA mismatching was the 12 percent increase from five to six mismatches, representing an increase of $8,692 in cost (P<0.001). The difference in cost between five and six HLA mismatches accounts for 43 percent of the total difference between zero and six mismatches.\n\n【38】The percentages of transplantations involving various numbers of HLA mismatches are shown in Table 1 . The actual distribution of numbers of HLA mismatches is that reported by UNOS for 1996. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> The simulated local system for the allocation of organs shifted the number of mismatches involved in most transplantations from four, five, or six to one or two. The larger pool of recipients used for the simulated national allocation system generated further improvement in the distribution of HLA mismatches; the result was more transplantations involving one mismatch and fewer involving two or three mismatches, as compared with the simulated local distribution.\n\n【39】The average expected cost savings from a policy ensuring that transplantations involved the fewest possible HLA mismatches, assuming no effects due to differences in cold-ischemia time, was calculated as the difference between the weighted average cost of transplantations according to the actual distribution and that according to the simulated distributions. The average expected cost savings amounted to $4,290 for the simulated local distribution and $4,768 for the simulated national distribution. Similarly, the average expected increase in the rate of graft survival, assuming no effects due to differences in cold-ischemia time, was 2.3 percent for the simulated local distribution and 2.7 percent for the simulated national distribution.\n\n【40】Duration of Cold Ischemia\n-------------------------\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Average Cumulative Medicare Payments for Patients Receiving Cadaveric Renal Transplants, According to the Duration of Cold Ischemia.\n\n【42】By three years after transplantation, the average Medicare payments were $64,119 for transplantations involving less than 12 hours of cold ischemia and $74,997 for those involving more than 36 hours of cold ischemia (P<0.001).\n\n【43】Average cumulative Medicare payments through three years after transplantation are shown in Figure 2 according to the duration of cold ischemia. A regular increase in cost is apparent as cold-ischemia time increases. By three years after transplantation, the average Medicare payments were $64,119 for transplantations involving less than 12 hours of cold ischemia and $74,997 for those involving more than 36 hours of cold ischemia (P<0.001). The economic effect of the duration of cold ischemia was similar for transplantations involving different levels of HLA matching, including those with no HLA mismatches.\n\n【44】Table 2.  Table 2. Duration of Cold Ischemia, Average Medicare Payments, and Graft Survival Rates at Three Years after Transplantation.\n\n【45】The effects of the duration of cold ischemia on cost and graft survival at three years are presented in Table 2 . To calculate the average increase in Medicare payments for an increase of one hour in cold-ischemia time, the difference in average Medicare payments from one group of patients to another was divided by the difference in the average number of hours of cold ischemia. On the basis of these calculations, we then determined that the weighted average cost associated with an increase of one hour of cold ischemia through three years after transplantation was $290. Thus, an additional 10 hours of cold ischemia would be expected to raise the average cost of transplantation at three years by $2,900. On the basis of weighted averages, the effect of an increase of one hour of cold ischemia was a reduction of 0.3 percent in graft survival at three years.\n\n【46】Comparisons of Allocation Schemes\n---------------------------------\n\n【47】Table 3.  Table 3. Predicted Cost Savings to Medicare and Changes in Graft Survival with Revised National and Local Allocation Systems Based on Minimal HLA Mismatching, as Compared with the Current Allocation System.\n\n【48】The implications of the allocation of cadaveric renal kidneys according to the methods used in our simulations, in terms of average graft-survival rates and average cost savings to Medicare, are shown in Table 3 . The effects of such a system of allocation include both the potential benefits of reallocation in terms of better HLA matching and the additional cold-ischemia time necessitated by shipping kidneys to other regions of the country. The actual average recorded duration of cold ischemia for kidneys transplanted locally was 19 hours, as compared with 24 hours for kidneys transported on the basis of national allocation. The calculations of the potential effects of a national allocation system were based on the assumption that an average of five additional hours of cold ischemia would be required. Graft survival and cost with the national allocation scheme were also calculated for 0 and 10 additional hours of cold ischemia for comparative purposes. The potential effects of local allocation according to a system designed to minimize HLA mismatches were calculated, on the assumption that there would be no increase in cold ischemia. Although it is unlikely that reallocation at the local level would increase cold-ischemia time for the average transplantation, cost calculations were also made with one and two additional hours assumed, for comparative purposes. The results were calculated as the potential savings associated with a given allocation system minus the number of additional hours of cold ischemia multiplied by the average cost of one additional hour.\n\n【49】The results of our calculations suggest that a strategy of national allocation of cadaveric kidneys that was designed to minimize HLA mismatching would generate the largest improvement in graft survival and the largest cost savings if there were no effects on the duration of cold ischemia. However, longer preservation times would be necessary under a national allocation policy. Our model predicted that a policy of local allocation aimed at ensuring minimal HLA mismatching would generate the greatest improvement in graft survival and the greatest cost savings once cold-ischemia time was taken into account; the average graft-survival rate would increase by 2.3 percent, with average cost savings of $4,290 by three years after transplantation. National allocation according to this strategy would improve average graft survival by 1.2 percent and would save Medicare an average of $3,318 per transplant recipient by three years after transplantation, given the expected increase of five hours in the duration of cold ischemia. For purposes of comparison, the local system of allocation with minimal HLA mismatching would produce results similar to those of the national scheme if the local policy added an average of 3 1/2 hours to the duration of cold ischemia.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】The results of our simulations suggest that the extent of HLA mismatching is an important determinant of Medicare expenditures associated with renal transplantation. Much like the effect of HLA mismatching on graft survival, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> the effect of HLA mismatching on costs is not constant over the range from zero to six mismatches. The benefit of reduced HLA mismatching, in terms of graft survival, is most pronounced when there are no HLA-antigen mismatches; however, the effect of mismatching on costs is most pronounced when there are six mismatches. The economic effect of using kidneys with six as compared with five HLA mismatches accounts for 43 percent of the total difference in cost between transplantations involving zero mismatches and those involving six mismatches.\n\n【52】Although there is a clear potential to save money through better HLA matching, higher costs are also associated with increasing cold-ischemia time. The costs associated with longer preservation limit the likelihood that any national scheme for the allocation of cadaveric kidneys can realize the full benefits of better HLA matching. Although cost savings and better graft survival may result from any move to improve the degree of HLA matching, better local matching (within organ-procurement organizations) is likely to have better results than a national allocation scheme. Our simulations demonstrate that better matching at the local level would produce the largest cost savings and the greatest benefit in terms of graft survival when cold-ischemia time is taken into account. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that organizational and organ-transportation costs were excluded from the analysis presented here, which focused on direct medical costs. Gjertson et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> assumed that organizational and shipping costs in a national system of allocation would average approximately $1,000 per transplantation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The inclusion of estimated shipping costs in our calculations would have reduced further the relative economic benefit of national, as compared with local, allocation. Although the actual magnitude of these costs is uncertain, they would have to be considered before a national allocation system could be implemented.\n\n【53】The cost associated with longer cold ischemia times was a critical factor in this analysis. Ten hours of cold ischemia costs Medicare an average of $2,900 and reduces graft-survival rates by 3 percent at three years after transplantation. This observation has important implications for health care policy. Is it necessary to have average cold-ischemia times of 19 hours for transplants locally distributed and 24 hours for those shared nationally? Numerous strategies might be used to reduce the length of preservation, such as giving transplantation procedures priority in the assignment of operating rooms and other hospital resources and using chartered flights when organs are shipped. Approximately 8000 transplantations of cadaveric kidneys are performed each year in the United States; the annual savings to Medicare from every hour by which the average cold-ischemia time is reduced is therefore approximately $2.3 million.\n\n【54】The economic benefits of the local allocation of kidneys according to a system designed to minimize HLA mismatching result predominantly from avoiding transplantation involving the highest numbers of mismatches. By far the most expensive transplantations are those with six HLA mismatches, but transplantations involving four or five HLA mismatches are also markedly more expensive than those involving three or fewer HLA mismatches. Much of the economic benefit of a system of local allocation designed to minimize HLA mismatching could be achieved by a policy that limited transplantations of highly mismatched grafts.\n\n【55】Numerous issues remain to be addressed. If a redesign of the organ-allocation system is to be considered, it is important to consider equity in the resulting distribution of organs. Adjustments to the present scheme may alter the degree of preference currently given to children, highly immune-sensitized patients, patients with long waiting times, and patients who have served as donors for others. Excessive focus on HLA matching has been implicated in the apparent racial inequities in the current distribution of organs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】Another issue to be considered is who is to benefit from any cost savings that are generated. Considering that 8000 renal transplantations are performed each year in the United States, a local system of allocation of kidneys to ensure minimal HLA mismatching has the potential to save Medicare a total of $34 million through three years after transplantation. Our model projects that this sum will increase in later years. One potential use of the money saved would be to cover the cost of maintenance immunosuppression. Medicare coverage of immunosuppression ends three years after transplantation. If a new organ-allocation policy is implemented, a portion of any savings that is generated can be used to extend the duration of this coverage.\n\n【57】For many reasons, policy makers are moving toward a more national scheme of allocation. In this time of increasing financial pressure on our medical system, such a redesign should be undertaken with the understanding that — because of the detrimental effects of the longer cold-ischemia time that is likely in a national allocation scheme — the economic benefits resulting from greater HLA matching are most readily available at the local level. Ignoring this fact may make an already imperfect system worse.\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Ray R.

We hypothesized that the release or production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which regulates blood flow and inhibits platelet function, may differ in venous and arterial grafts. We therefore studied endothelium-dependent relaxation in internal mammary arteries, internal mammary veins, and saphenous veins obtained from 58 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.\n\n【2】Vascular rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers, and isometric tension was recorded. Acetylcholine (10–8 to 10–4 M), thrombin (1 U per milliliter), and adenosine diphosphate (10–7 to 10–4 M) evoked potent endothelium-dependent relaxation in the mammary artery but weak response in the saphenous vein (P<0.005; n = 6 to 27). In the mammary artery, relaxation was greatest in response to acetylcholine (86±4 percent reduction in norepinephrine-induced tension), followed by thrombin (44±7 percent) and adenosine diphosphate (39±8 percent). In the saphenous and mammary veins, relaxation was less than 25 percent.\n\n【3】Relaxation was unaffected by indomethacin but was inhibited by methylene blue and hemoglobin (P<0.005 and 0.01, respectively), which suggests that endothelium-derived relaxing factor was the mediator. Endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside was similar in arteries and veins.\n\n【4】We conclude that endothelium-dependent relaxation is greater in the mammary artery than in the saphenous vein. The possibility that this contributes to the higher patency rate among arterial grafts than among venous grafts will require further study. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1988; 319: 462–7.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Adverse events were rare and occurred with similar frequency in the two groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Fetal ECG ST-segment analysis used as an adjunct to conventional intrapartum electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring did not improve perinatal outcomes or decrease operative-delivery rates. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and Neoventa Medical; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01131260 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Continuous intrapartum fetal heart-rate monitoring has caused considerable controversy in obstetrics. Despite decades of use and an associated rise in cesarean-delivery rates based at least in part on nonreassuring fetal heart-rate patterns, evidence that such monitoring has reduced the rate of hypoxia-induced neonatal encephalopathy is lacking. In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted conditional approval of the STAN S31 device (Neoventa Medical) for use as an adjunct to conventional electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> This technology was designed to provide fetal electrocardiographic (ECG) information reflective of myocardial metabolism and acid–base balance. The rationale is that fetal acidemia is associated with fetal ECG ST-segment elevation and increased T-wave amplitude. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2-6 </a></sup></u> The monitor for fetal ECG ST-segment analysis uses proprietary software to detect these ECG changes and then issues a visual alert (“ST event”) when these changes occur.\n\n【12】Initial FDA approval was based primarily on European studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9 </a></sup></u> that suggested that fetal ST-segment analysis technology reduced the rates of neonatal encephalopathy, acidemia, and operative delivery. However, the relevance of these results to usual obstetrical practice is unclear, given inconsistent findings among published trials and questions about eligibility criteria, choice and definition of primary outcomes, and intrapartum management, as discussed by Øian and Blix 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> and Steer and Hvidman. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Moreover, there are substantive differences between U.S. and European practices. We designed a large, multi-institutional, randomized trial to assess the effects of using fetal ECG ST-segment analysis on perinatal outcomes.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【15】The study, which consisted of a pilot phase and the randomized trial, was conducted at 16 university-based clinical centers — each comprising 1 to 5 delivery hospitals (26 total) — in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal–Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each hospital and is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before participation. A small group of investigators (protocol subcommittee) provided oversight for the trial. The study was supported by the NICHD and by funding from the manufacturer (Neoventa Medical). Neoventa did not participate in the monitoring of the study; data collection, management, or analysis; or manuscript preparation. The first, second, third, and fifth authors take responsibility for the fidelity of the report to the study protocol and for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data.\n\n【16】Certification, Training, and Pilot Phase\n----------------------------------------\n\n【17】Table 1.  Table 1. Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) Classification System for Electrocardiographic ST-Segment Analysis and Management Guidelines.\n\n【18】All participating care providers and research personnel were trained and certified in the correct use of the fetal ECG ST-segment analysis system to a level exceeding FDA requirements. Each hospital participated in a pilot phase that consisted of enrollment and care of at least 50 patients monitored with fetal ECG ST-segment analysis, with central review of labor-management decisions and retraining as needed before approval of the hospital to start the trial. Details of the certification and monitoring process are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org; guidelines for the management of labor on the basis of fetal ECG analysis are summarized in Table 1 , and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【19】Once a hospital was approved to participate in the randomized trial, the independent data coordinating center sent a software card containing the encrypted randomization module to the designated local biomedical technician to be installed on the S31 monitors at that hospital. No other personnel had access to the software or were able to adjust the monitors. A separate randomization sequence was created for each monitor.\n\n【20】Trial Protocol\n--------------\n\n【21】Women with a singleton fetus at more than 36 weeks of gestation who were attempting vaginal delivery and had cervical dilation of 2 to 7 cm were invited to participate. The main exclusion criteria were noncephalic presentation, planned cesarean delivery, a need for immediate delivery, absent fetal heart-rate variability (amplitude range undetectable) or a sinusoidal pattern, minimal fetal heart-rate variability in the 20 minutes before randomization, or other fetal or maternal conditions that would preclude a trial of labor or the placement of a scalp electrode. The full eligibility criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【22】After spontaneous or artificial membrane rupture, a Goldtrace fetal scalp electrode (Neoventa Medical) was placed in each woman who consented to participate in the trial. If it was not possible to obtain or maintain an adequate fetal ECG signal after three attempts at electrode placement or if an ST-segment event occurred during the attempts to obtain an adequate signal, the woman was excluded from randomization. Immediately after successful electrode placement resulting in an adequate ST-segment analysis signal, a researcher activated the randomization module, which then automatically set the S31 monitor into “masked” or “open” mode according to the internal preassigned randomization scheme.\n\n【23】The masked S31 monitors functioned as conventional electronic fetal heart-rate monitors. The care of patients in the masked group was managed at the discretion of the attending physician or midwife. S31 monitors in the open mode displayed ECG ST-segment information intended for use when uncertain fetal heart-rate patterns were detected. Management of the labor and delivery for women in this group was dictated by the ST-segment analysis guidelines 删除2:<u>( Table 1 , and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. To monitor adherence to the guidelines, all tracings from fetuses of patients who subsequently had cesarean or operative vaginal (forceps or vacuum-assisted) deliveries and from fetuses who had ST-segment events or primary-outcome events, as well as tracings from fetuses of a sample of patients who subsequently had vaginal deliveries, were centrally reviewed by the protocol subcommittee, whose members were unaware of the outcome of the neonate. If the group determined that the guidelines for fetal ECG ST-segment analysis had not been followed, the provider received additional training.\n\n【24】Paired arterial and venous umbilical-cord blood gas measurements were obtained from all neonates. The base deficit was calculated with the use of measurements from the extracellular fluid and the modified Siggaard-Andersen curve. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> To be valid, the arterial pH had to be lower than the venous pH, and the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide had to be greater than the partial pressure of venous carbon dioxide. All enrolled women and their infants were followed until hospital discharge. Trained research staff collected maternal and perinatal data, including the interpretation by the clinical providers of the fetal heart-rate pattern (NICHD category 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> or fetal ECG ST-segment analysis category).\n\n【25】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【26】The primary outcome was a composite of intrapartum fetal death, neonatal death, an Apgar score of 3 or less at 5 minutes, neonatal seizure, an umbilical-artery blood pH of 7.05 or less with a base deficit of 12 mmol per liter or more, intubation for ventilation at delivery, or neonatal encephalopathy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> This composite outcome represents a cluster of neonatal outcomes that manifest early, that indicate that the fetus may have been compromised during labor, that are associated with a risk of long-term neurologic adverse outcomes, and that potentially could be avoided by more prompt delivery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The protocol subcommittee, whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments, conducted chart reviews of all pregnancies that were designated as having met the primary outcome criteria to confirm that they had met these criteria and also reviewed charts of a sample of neonates who had longer hospital stays or who required more-than-routine resuscitation at delivery.\n\n【27】Maternal secondary outcomes were cesarean delivery (with indication), forceps or vacuum-assisted delivery, chorioamnionitis, maternal blood transfusion, duration of labor after randomization, shoulder dystocia, postpartum endometritis, and length of hospital stay. Neonatal secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, Apgar score at 5 minutes, umbilical-artery blood gas results, and admission to the intermediate care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n【28】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】We calculated that a sample size of 11,000 patients would give the study more than 85% power to detect a 40% reduction in the primary outcome in the open group, assuming a rate of 1.75% in the masked group (derived from a previous MFMU Network randomized trial involving women in labor at term), at a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> We estimated that with the same power and type I error rate, our sample size would also be sufficient to detect a 10% reduction in the cesarean-delivery rate in the open group. Given a cesarean-delivery rate for nonreassuring fetal status as low as 5%, there was adequate power (88%) to detect a 25% reduction in cesarean delivery for this specific indication.\n\n【30】We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, in which patients were included in the group to which they had been randomly assigned, regardless of the completeness of ST-segment monitoring or provider adherence to the protocol. Categorical variables were compared with the use of the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Interaction tests in prespecified subgroups (category I vs. category II fetal heart-rate tracing at baseline, multiparous vs. nulliparous status, center, enrollment before vs. after the midpoint of recruitment for each site, and race or ethnic group) and in post hoc subgroups (induced vs. spontaneous labor and baseline cervical dilation of 2 to 5 cm vs. 6 to 7 cm) were conducted with the use of the Breslow–Day method for the following end points: primary outcome, cesarean delivery, and any operative delivery (cesarean and operative vaginal delivery combined). Continuous variables were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. An independent data and safety monitoring committee monitored the trial for safety and trial performance. The committee did not review interim data on the primary outcome; therefore, no adjustment to the type I error rate was necessary. For all secondary outcomes, a nominal P value of less than 0.05, without adjustment for multiple comparisons, was considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Recruitment and Characteristics of the Participants\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Enrollment and Outcomes.\n\n【34】ECG denotes electrocardiographic.\n\n【35】Recruitment to the pilot study started in April 2010; by April 2013, a total of 26 hospitals were authorized to start the randomized trial. Recruitment to the trial began in November 2010 and ended in March 2014. A total of 43,376 women were screened for inclusion, of whom 18,456 did not meet eligibility criteria, 13,812 declined participation, and 11,108 were randomly assigned to the open group (5532 women) or the masked group (5576 women) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. A total of 85 women discontinued open or masked ST-segment monitoring before delivery; however, outcome data were obtained for all women and their neonates.\n\n【36】Table 2.  Table 2. Characteristics of the Patients Enrolled in the Study.\n\n【37】There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Assessment of fetal heart rate immediately before randomization showed that 73% of fetal heart-rate tracings were NICHD category I (reassuring) and 27% were category II (indeterminate) 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Of the category II tracings, 43% had either recurrent late or recurrent variable decelerations.\n\n【38】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【39】Table 3.  Table 3. Primary Outcome and Components.\n\n【40】Valid umbilical-cord blood gas measurements were obtained for 96.5% of all neonates. The primary outcome occurred in 52 neonates (0.9%) of patients in the open group and in 40 neonates (0.7%) of patients in the masked group (relative risk, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.87 to 1.98; P=0.20) 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to the incidences of individual components of the primary outcome, with one exception: the frequency of an Apgar score of 3 or less at 5 minutes was higher among neonates of patients in the open group than among neonates of patients in the masked group (0.3% vs. 0.1%; P=0.02). However, most components of the primary outcome occurred in no more than 0.1% of neonates in either group.\n\n【41】Table 4.  Table 4. Maternal and Infant Outcomes.\n\n【42】There were no significant differences between the two groups in the overall rates of cesarean delivery (P=0.30) or any operative delivery (P=0.31). Overall, cesarean delivery because of fetal indications occurred in 287 women (5.2%) in the open group and 298 women (5.3%) in the masked group (P=0.48). There were no significant differences between groups in any secondary outcomes 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Adverse events related to the ST-segment monitoring were rare, and the rates of individual adverse events were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. There were no significant differences between any of the subgroups we assessed with respect to the effect of monitoring with ST-segment analysis on the primary outcome, cesarean delivery, and any operative delivery (P>0.05 for interaction for all comparisons) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3, S4, and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【43】Protocol Adherence\n------------------\n\n【44】The protocol subcommittee reviewed 43.9% of the tracings in the open group (2427 of 5532 tracings): 27.3% of the tracings of fetuses later delivered by spontaneous vaginal deliveries (1164 of 4269 tracings), 100% of the tracings of fetuses later delivered by operative vaginal deliveries (329 of 329 tracings), and 100% of the tracings of fetuses later delivered by cesarean deliveries (934 of 934 tracings) 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Among the 2427 women assigned to the open group whose fetus’ tracings were reviewed, 163 (6.7%) were determined not to have received care according to ST-segment analysis guidelines. In 95 cases (3.9%), expeditious delivery did not occur when recommended, and in 68 cases (2.8%), delivery was expedited when the guidelines indicated that continued observation was warranted. The primary outcome occurred in 5 of the 95 cases in which delivery did not occur as expeditiously as recommended and in 0 of the 68 in which delivery was expedited when not recommended. Even if the 5 cases were recoded as not associated with a primary outcome, there would be no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.43). Of the 5 patients, 2 had a cesarean delivery and 3 a spontaneous vaginal delivery. An as-treated analysis in which patients for whom ST-segment analysis guidelines were not followed were included with the masked group did not reveal any significant differences between the groups 删除2:<u>(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【45】Discussion\n----------\n\n【46】This large, randomized trial showed that in a U.S. population of pregnant women in whom labor and delivery were managed according to U.S. practices, ST-segment analysis as an adjunct to continuous electronic fetal monitoring neither improved neonatal outcomes nor reduced the rates of cesarean delivery or operative vaginal delivery. Although our findings differ from those of two randomized trials, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,9 </a></sup></u> they are in agreement with those of other randomized trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17-19 </a></sup></u> Our findings of no improvement in neonatal outcomes or reduction in cesarean-delivery rates are also consistent with the results of a meta-analysis of individual-patient data from ST-segment analysis trials, 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> which showed that electronic fetal monitoring with adjunctive ST-segment analysis, as compared with conventional electronic fetal monitoring alone, did not reduce the rates of neonatal metabolic acidosis, need for intubation, hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, a composite neonatal outcome, or cesarean delivery. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> However, that meta-analysis showed a reduction in the frequency of fetal blood sampling (which is not routine in the United States) and operative vaginal delivery among women who underwent electronic fetal monitoring and adjunctive ST-segment analysis, as compared with those who underwent electronic fetal monitoring alone. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【47】One possible explanation for our negative findings is that clinicians did not follow the guidelines correctly in all cases. In the open group, 5.9% of cesarean deliveries occurred when ST-segment analysis guidelines indicated that labor should continue 删除2:<u>(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Even if these 55 cases had resulted in a vaginal delivery, there would have been no significant difference in the cesarean-delivery rate. A similar result is true for operative vaginal delivery. Moreover, if we assumed that all the cases in which operative delivery was indicated had actually occurred in accordance with ST-segment analysis guidelines and that 5 cases of the primary outcome had been avoided, the incidence of the primary outcome would have remained similar in the two groups.\n\n【48】There could have been a Hawthorne effect (the tendency for some people to perform better when they believe that they are being watched) resulting in improved interpretation of fetal heart-rate patterns, consistent with the suggestion that a systematic approach to fetal monitoring, rather than ST-segment analysis itself, may be what is effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> It has also been suggested that there is a learning curve with ST-segment analysis. A reanalysis of the meta-analysis by Schuit et al. showed that labor management with the use of ST-segment analysis reduced metabolic acidosis and adverse neonatal outcomes in the second half of the trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21,22 </a></sup></u> We incorporated a pilot phase in our study; moreover, our preplanned analysis of the first 50% of randomly assigned women according to center as compared with the second 50% showed no significant differences.\n\n【49】The frequency of operative vaginal delivery in our trial was lower than the 13 to 14% frequency in the meta-analysis by Schuit et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Operative vaginal delivery is much more common in Europe than in the United States 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> where the current rate is approximately 3%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> In addition, two aspects of fetal heart-rate monitoring practice in Europe differ from the practice in the United States; in Europe, there is a slower horizontal scaling (1 cm per minute) on monitors (resulting in a compressed view that potentially affects the interpretation of heart-rate variability), and fetal blood sampling (for confirming or ruling out fetal acidosis) is more common. These differences could have influenced intrapartum care and may have contributed to differences between our results and those of European trials.\n\n【50】Our study had a lower-than-anticipated incidence of the primary outcome and, therefore, reduced power to show between-group differences. However, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the relative risk of the primary outcome was 0.87, implying at best a reduction of 13% in the open group. This is far lower than the hypothesized effect and may be of questionable clinical significance. Even with lower rates of cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery than expected (16.5% and 5.9%, respectively), the trial still had 80% power to detect relative differences of 11% and 15%, respectively, in these outcomes. To be eligible for ST-segment analysis, patients must have cervical dilatation of at least 2 cm and have ruptured membranes. These women are likely to have a lower cesarean-delivery rate than the overall rate in all women attempting vaginal delivery, some of whom are undergoing labor induction or in spontaneous labor at less than 2 cm. However, insofar as the clinical use of ST-segment analysis outside the trial would require the same eligibility criteria, we consider these results to be generalizable to clinical practice in the United States.\n\n【51】In conclusion, this large and closely monitored randomized, controlled trial showed no significant benefit of the adjunctive use of ST-segment analysis in reducing a composite of neonatal outcomes or in reducing cesarean or operative vaginal deliveries in a U.S. population undergoing conventional intrapartum continuous electronic fetal heart-rate monitoring.\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Presented in part at the 35th annual meeting of the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine, San Diego, CA, February 2–7, 2015.</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by grants (HD34208, HD53097, HD40545, HD40560, HD27869, HD40485, HD40512, HD27915, HD40544, HD40500, HD68282, HD68268, HD27917, HD21410, and HD36801) from the NICHD and by funding from Neoventa Medical.</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>The comments and views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>We thank Kim Hill, R.N., B.S.N., and Ashley Salazar, R.N., M.S.N., W.H.N.P., for assistance with protocol development and coordination between clinical research centers; Steven J.

To determine whether treatment with a calcium-channel blocker would improve survival and neurologic outcome in acute ischemic stroke, we enrolled 186 patients in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nimodipine (30 mg every six hours), begun within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke.\n\n【2】During the four-week treatment period, mortality from all causes was significantly reduced with nimodipine as compared with placebo (8 deaths \\[8.6 percent\\] vs. 19 \\[20.4 percent\\]). The improvement in survival was restricted to men. During the follow-up period of six months, an additional eight patients in each group died. A significantly better neurologic outcome, as assessed by the Mathew scale of neurologic deficit, was also observed in the nimodipine group. The improvement in neurologic status was greatest in patients with a moderate to severe deficit at base line. There were no important side effects except for one episode of reversible azotemia that may have been related to treatment with nimodipine.\n\n【3】Our data suggest that patients with acute ischemic stroke may benefit from early treatment with nimodipine, but this therapeutic effect appears to be limited to men. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1988; 318:203–7.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

On the basis of a case-spouse comparison, the risk ratio of Hodgkin's disease among tonsillectomized persons was 3.1 (1.5 to 7.7, 95 per cent confidence limits); on the basis of a case-sibling comparison it was 1.4 (0.8–2.6).

A similar variation of risk ratio with sibship size was found in data from a prior study. The range of the association implies that the relation between tonsillectomy and Hodgkin's disease either is noncausal or is complex and modified by family size. Risk of Hodgkin's disease was found to increase as sibship size decreased, suggesting that a cause of Hodgkin's disease is correlated with childhood social class. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 292:22–25, 1975)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Differences exist between these sedatives in arousability, immunity, and inflammation. Whether they affect outcomes differentially in mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis undergoing light sedation is unknown.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】In a multicenter, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis to receive dexmedetomidine (0.2 to 1.5 μg per kilogram of body weight per hour) or propofol (5 to 50 μg per kilogram per minute), with doses adjusted by bedside nurses to achieve target sedation goals set by clinicians according to the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (RASS, on which scores range from −5 \\[unresponsive\\] to +4 \\[combative\\]). The primary end point was days alive without delirium or coma during the 14-day intervention period. Secondary end points were ventilator-free days at 28 days, death at 90 days, and age-adjusted total score on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status questionnaire (TICS-T; scores range from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50±10 and lower scores indicating worse cognition) at 6 months.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of 432 patients who underwent randomization, 422 were assigned to receive a trial drug and were included in the analyses — 214 patients received dexmedetomidine at a median dose of 0.27 μg per kilogram per hour, and 208 received propofol at a median dose of 10.21 μg per kilogram per minute. The median duration of receipt of the trial drugs was 3.0 days (interquartile range, 2.0 to 6.0), and the median RASS score was −2.0 (interquartile range, −3.0 to −1.0). We found no difference between dexmedetomidine and propofol in the number of days alive without delirium or coma (adjusted median, 10.7 vs. 10.8 days; odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.74 to 1.26), ventilator-free days (adjusted median, 23.7 vs. 24.0 days; odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.51), death at 90 days (38% vs. 39%; hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.52), or TICS-T score at 6 months (adjusted median score, 40.9 vs. 41.4; odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.33). Safety end points were similar in the two groups.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Among mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis who were being treated with recommended light-sedation approaches, outcomes in patients who received dexmedetomidine did not differ from outcomes in those who received propofol. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01739933 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Worldwide, at least 20 million patients each year have sepsis with severe organ dysfunction, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> with over 20% receiving mechanical ventilation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Sedative medications are frequently used for patient comfort and safety but may potentiate acute brain dysfunction (e.g., delirium or coma) and long-term cognitive impairment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4-10 </a></sup></u> Basic and translational studies show that among the recommended sedatives, dexmedetomidine (an alpha <sub>2 </sub> receptor agonist) has antiinflammatory and bacterial clearance properties that are superior to those of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, such as benzodiazepines and propofol, and also reduces neuronal apoptosis and promotes biomimetic sleep — all of which could improve clinical outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-17 </a></sup></u> Trials comparing dexmedetomidine with benzodiazepines in adults have shown that the use of dexmedetomidine results in improvement in outcomes such as delirium, coma, and time receiving mechanical ventilation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18,19 </a></sup></u> Patients treated with dexmedetomidine had a lower incidence of subsequent infection, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> and the beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine, including lower 28-day mortality, were more pronounced in patients with sepsis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18,20</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】A noninferiority trial comparing dexmedetomidine with propofol in critically ill patients, about half of whom had sepsis, showed that patients who received dexmedetomidine were more interactive, but the choice of sedation did not affect the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital, or short-term mortality. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> The differences between the sedatives with respect to the risk of acute brain dysfunction or cognitive impairment and mortality months after critical illness were unclear. Subsequent open-label trials with dexmedetomidine as the primary sedative did not show a reduction in acute brain dysfunction, a greater number of ventilator-free days, or lower mortality at 180 days than was shown with control sedative regimens (primarily propofol), although concomitant nontrial sedatives were frequently used and few patients were maintained at light sedation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】The Society of Critical Care Medicine 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> recommends sedation with either dexmedetomidine or propofol targeted to light levels of sedation for adults receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous sedation. Given the superior immunomodulatory effects of dexmedetomidine and its benefit in patients with sepsis as compared with benzodiazepines, we designed the MENDS2 trial (Maximizing the Efficacy of Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction and Mortality in Septic Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure) to test whether dexmedetomidine leads to better short-term and long-term outcomes than propofol in mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【16】We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial at 13 medical centers in the United States. The institutional review board at each center approved the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Patients or their surrogates provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was designed by the authors, who gathered and analyzed the data, attest to the accuracy and completeness of the data, vouch for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, and wrote and agreed to submit the manuscript for publication. An independent data and safety monitoring board provided oversight of the trial. Pfizer supplied the dexmedetomidine trial drug but had no role in the design or conduct of the trial, analysis of the data, or writing of the manuscript. The Food and Drug Administration approved an Investigational New Drug application for dexmedetomidine administered for more than 24 hours and for doses up to 1.5 μg per kilogram per hour ( see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). We registered the trial at ClinicalTrials.gov before enrollment began. Before group assignments were unmasked, we registered the statistical analysis plan at Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/dfyxh/ . opens in new tab ) in January 2019 (with publication in March 2020). 删除3:<u><sup><a>25</a></sup></u>\n\n【17】Patient Selection and Randomization\n-----------------------------------\n\n【18】We included adults who were sequentially admitted to a medical or surgical ICU, had suspected or known infection, and were treated with continuous sedation for invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were excluded if they had baseline severe cognitive impairment; were pregnant or breast-feeding; were blind, deaf, or unable to understand approved languages; had second-degree or third-degree heart block or persistent bradycardia requiring intervention; had an allergy to dexmedetomidine or propofol; had an indication for benzodiazepines; were anticipated to have immediate discontinuation of mechanical ventilation; were expected to have neuromuscular blockade for more than 48 hours; were in a moribund state; or had received mechanical ventilation for more than 96 hours before meeting all inclusion criteria. Additional details on exclusion and inclusion criteria are provided in Section S1 in the Supplementary Appendix . We randomly assigned patients to receive dexmedetomidine or propofol in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated permuted blocks stratified by enrollment site and age (<65 years vs. ≥65 years). Researchers, clinicians (except bedside nurses), patients, and families were unaware of the group assignments.\n\n【19】Trial Interventions and Measurements\n------------------------------------\n\n【20】Investigational pharmacists prepared dexmedetomidine (5 μg per milliliter) and propofol (10 mg per milliliter) in identical intravenous fluid bags covered with opaque plastic bags to be administered in units of milliliters per hour to maintain study masking 删除2:<u>(Sections S2 and S3)</u>. Bedside nurses covered intravenous tubing with opaque coverings and verified that covers were in place before study personnel or clinicians entered patients’ rooms. The trial drug was initially infused at a dose corresponding to the same sedative dosing that the patient was receiving immediately before randomization. Bedside nurses used a weight-based dosing guideline (0.15 to 1.5 μg per kilogram of actual body weight per hour for dexmedetomidine and 5 to 50 μg per kilogram of actual body weight per minute for propofol) to adjust the trial drug every 10 minutes to target sedation goals set by the clinical team and documented each adjustment and the rationale for it. The clinical team used the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (RASS, on which scores range from −5 \\[unresponsive\\] to +4 \\[combative\\]), 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> to set the sedation goal, which was primarily light sedation (RASS score 0 to −2).\n\n【21】Administration of the trial drug was temporarily held in the event of hypotension, bradycardia, sedation deeper than the target level, spontaneous awakening trials, or surgery. The trial drug was permanently discontinued if the patient had persistent symptomatic bradycardia, new onset second- or third-degree heart block, serious allergic reactions, suspected propofol-related infusion syndrome (refractory shock, rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, and kidney failure related to high propofol exposure), or any serious adverse event related to the intervention. The trial drug was discontinued after the 14-day intervention period, extubation, or discharge from the ICU, whichever came first. Patients whose trachea was extubated and reintubated within the 14-day intervention period resumed the trial drug if sedation was indicated.\n\n【22】We treated pain with intermittent opioid boluses or fentanyl infusion (see Section S4 for details regarding rescue sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and treatment of agitated delirium). Additional patient care practices (e.g., administration of fluids, vasopressors, or antibiotics and extubation criteria) were based on international guideline recommendations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,27</a></sup></u>\n\n【23】All centers performed, and investigators reinforced, the ABCDE (awakening and breathing coordination, choice of sedation, delirium monitoring and management, and early mobility) bundle, 删除3:<u><sup><a>28,29 </a></sup></u> with daily adherence recorded. In addition to care assessments made by nurses, trained research personnel assessed patients with the use of RASS for level of arousal, 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> for delirium, and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> for pain; assessments were made twice daily in the ICU and then once daily after transfer from the ICU for up to 14 days or until discharge from the hospital or death. We strived to conduct delirium assessments when the patient was maximally awake. A RASS score of −4 or −5 indicated coma, and a positive CAM-ICU score indicated delirium.\n\n【24】Six months after randomization, research personnel assessed patients’ cognition with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) questionnaire 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> and a validated telephone cognitive battery, 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> functional status with the Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale 删除3:<u><sup><a>34 </a></sup></u> and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> and quality of life with the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) survey 删除2:<u>(Section S5)</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>36</a></sup></u>\n\n【25】Trial End Points\n----------------\n\n【26】The primary efficacy end point was the number of calendar days alive without delirium or coma during the 14-day intervention period. Secondary efficacy end points included ventilator-free days at 28 days, death at 90 days, and global cognition at 6 months using the age-adjusted TICS total score (TICS-T score). Additional details regarding efficacy, adherence, and safety end points are provided in Section S5, along with a list of additional end points not reported here.\n\n【27】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【28】Owing to enrollment that was slower than anticipated, the data and safety monitoring board and the National Institutes of Health approved a protocol amendment in March 2017 to lower the enrollment target from 530 patients to 420 patients receiving the trial drug to provide 85% power to detect a 1.5-day difference in days alive without delirium or coma between groups and 80% power to detect a 12 percentage-point absolute difference in mortality at 90 days, assuming an expected mortality of 30% in the propofol group. We had at least 80% power to detect a 3.9-point difference in age-adjusted TICS-T scores between groups, with a 5-point difference considered to be clinically important.\n\n【29】We analyzed data in the modified intention-to-treat population, which was prespecified as all patients who underwent randomization and received a trial drug. We analyzed primary and secondary end points using both univariate methods and multivariable regression models and considered adjusted analyses to be the primary analyses. We analyzed days alive without delirium and coma, ventilator-free days, and age-adjusted TICS-T scores at 6 months using proportional-odds logistic regression and analyzed death at 90 days using Cox proportional-hazards regression (adjusted for covariates listed in Section S5).\n\n【30】We adjusted the level of statistical significance for the primary end point analysis to P<0.044 to account for one prespecified planned interim analysis. The level of statistical significance for all other end points was P<0.05. Simple imputation was used for missing in-hospital variables and multiple imputation for partially available long-term end points to avoid bias owing to missing variables. We did not adjust for multiple comparisons in the analysis of secondary end points. We used Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University) for data management and R, version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), for statistical analyses.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】Patients\n--------\n\n【33】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, Follow-up, and Analysis.\n\n【34】The number of patients excluded for each criterion total more than the total number of patients excluded because some patients met more than one exclusion criterion.Table 1.  Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【35】From May 2013 through December 2018, we screened 4840 patients, 4402 (91%) of whom met at least one exclusion criterion 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of 438 patients enrolled, 6 were subsequently found to be ineligible, 432 patients underwent randomization, and 422 began receiving dexmedetomidine (214 patients) or propofol (208 patients). The demographic and in-hospital characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and Table S1.\n\n【36】Trial Interventions\n-------------------\n\n【37】Table 2.  Table 2. Adherence and Sedation Regimen.\n\n【38】Details of trial drug dosing, dose adjustment, and sedation regimen are shown in Table 2 and Table S2. The median RASS score as assessed by the research team was −2 (interquartile range, −3.00 to −1.00) while patients were receiving a trial drug (median days of administration, 3.0 \\[interquartile range, 2.0 to 6.0\\]), indicating light sedation and ability of patients to make eye contact with only verbal stimulation 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1)</u>. The overall time spent at the target sedation was close to 60% in both groups 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. Bedside nurses adjusted the trial drug infusion a median of 10 times (interquartile range, 5 to 21) over the duration of administration. Common reasons for adjustment of the infusion included undersedation, oversedation, and hypotension. The trial drug was temporarily held in approximately one quarter of all patients. Rescue midazolam was used in about half the patients, most often for procedural sedation or during neuromuscular blockade, and the median daily exposure on days it was administered was 4 mg (interquartile range, 2 to 11). The use of open-label propofol (received by 13% in the dexmedetomidine group and 8% in the propofol group) and dexmedetomidine (4% in the dexmedetomidine group and 3% in the propofol group) was infrequent and doses were low, indicating high adherence to the protocol. Overall, 42% of the patients received an antipsychotic medication. Soft wrist restraints during receipt of mechanical ventilation were the standard of care in our trial ICUs; thus, 96% of patients had restraints in place for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 5). Neuromuscular blockade infusion was used in 17% of patients for a median of 1 day (interquartile range, 1 to 2) at some point while they were receiving the trial drug. Pain was well controlled in both groups according to Critical Care Pain Observation Tool scoring, and we noted high adherence to all components of the ABCDE bundle. We proactively assessed for unblinding among clinicians and research staff and found an episode of unblinding in 58 patients (14%), with a similar frequency in the two groups.\n\n【39】Efficacy End Points\n-------------------\n\n【40】Table 3. Table 3. Primary and Secondary Efficacy End Points. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Effects of Dexmedetomidine and Propofol on 90-Day Survival.\n\n【41】The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the probability of survival. In the adjusted analyses, there was no significant difference between the trial groups with respect to death at 90 days (hazard ratio with dexmedetomidine vs. propofol, 1.06; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.74 to 1.52). Results have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. The shading indicates 95% confidence intervals.\n\n【42】The adjusted number of days alive without delirium or coma over the 14-day intervention period was not significantly different between the dexmedetomidine group (adjusted median, 10.7 days; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 8.5 to 12.5) and the propofol group (adjusted median, 10.8 days; 95% CI, 8.7 to 12.6) (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.26; P=0.79). Similarly, we found no significant differences between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups in the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days (adjusted median, 23.7 vs. 24.0 days; odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.51) or in death at 90 days (81 patients \\[38%\\] vs. 82 patients \\[39%\\]; hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.52). Results of primary and secondary efficacy end point analyses are shown in Table 3 , Figure 2 , and Figure S3.\n\n【43】We assessed more than 90% of eligible patients at 6 months after randomization 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Approximately 25% in each group had age-adjusted TICS-T scores that were 2 standard deviations below population norms (i.e., a score of ≤30, at a level consistent with impairment), which suggests clinically important cognitive dysfunction 6 months after critical illness. We observed no significant differences between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups in age-adjusted TICS-T scores at 6 months (adjusted median score, 40.9 vs. 41.4; odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.33). There were no clinically meaningful differences between groups in median cognitive, functional, and quality-of-life assessment scores at 6 months 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【44】Results of sensitivity analyses that included the 10 patients who underwent randomization but never received a trial drug 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u> were qualitatively similar to the results of the main analyses. Results of differential effects of the study treatment on end points according to age at enrollment, baseline cognition, and medical as compared with surgical hospitalization show that the clinical importance of these interactions appeared to be minimal 删除2:<u>(Figs. S4 through S9)</u>; however, the trial may not have been adequately powered to draw conclusions about these or other subgroups.\n\n【45】Safety End Points\n-----------------\n\n【46】Data on organ dysfunction and safety end points by group are shown in Tables S6 and S7, respectively. The proportions of patients who had organ dysfunction, hypotension, or severe lactic acidosis after randomization were similar in the two groups. Symptomatic bradycardia requiring discontinuation of the trial drug was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>. Fewer patients in the dexmedetomidine group had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or signs of trial drug withdrawal, and fewer patients in the propofol group extubated themselves. Median plasma triglyceride levels and the proportion of patients with severely elevated levels of trigliceride (>500 mg per deciliter) were quantitatively higher in the propofol group than in the dexmedetomidine group on days 7 and 14, although these differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant. Similarly, median plasma cortisol levels at day 14 were slightly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group, including a higher proportion of patients with low cortisol (<20 μg per deciliter). Clinicians had access to these results without indication of group assignment and discontinued the trial drug in eight patients owing to hypertriglyceridemia. One patient had suspected propofol-related infusion syndrome (later disproved) and had the propofol discontinued.\n\n【47】Discussion\n----------\n\n【48】In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis who were being treated with recommended light-sedation approaches, we did not find evidence that sedation with dexmedetomidine led to more days alive without acute brain dysfunction than propofol. Furthermore, we found no difference in ventilator-free days at 28 days, death at 90 days, or global cognition (as assessed with the use of age-adjusted TICS-T scores) at 6 months between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups. Safety end points were also similar in the two groups.\n\n【49】Although recent data suggest that many critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation may not require sedative infusions, 删除3:<u><sup><a>38,39 </a></sup></u> our trial specifically enrolled adults with sepsis who had a high severity of illness, a greater risk for ARDS, and a higher requirement for continuous sedation. It was important to better characterize the effect of greater arousability, analgesic properties, and lack of respiratory depression observed with dexmedetomidine as compared with GABAergic sedatives in this population. Data indicate meaningful differences between dexmedetomidine and GABAergic sedatives with respect to innate immunity and risk of infection, including evidence that dexmedetomidine may offer superior antiinflammatory effects. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11-17 </a></sup></u> Despite these theoretical benefits and studies supporting the use of dexmedetomidine, the choice between dexmedetomidine and propofol alone does not appear to substantially affect patient outcomes in the complex milieu of critical illness with sepsis. Our findings, therefore, strongly reinforce current guidelines 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> that recommend the use of either dexmedetomidine or propofol for light sedation when continuous sedation is needed for adults with or without sepsis who require mechanical ventilation.\n\n【50】Our trial builds on other trials that have compared dexmedetomidine with propofol, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21-23,40 </a></sup></u> with important methodologic advances that include a higher degree of sedative trial drug blinding, a better separation between groups with regard to sedative exposure, and stricter adherence to light sedation approaches, with high compliance with a standardized, multicomponent sedation management bundle (i.e., the ABCDE bundle) 删除3:<u><sup><a>28,29 </a></sup></u> that has been shown to reduce mortality and improve other important outcomes. One study by Kawazoe et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> randomly assigned 201 patients with sepsis who required mechanical ventilation to open-label sedation with dexmedetomidine (up to 0.7 μg per kilogram per hour) or sedation without dexmedetomidine (infusions of propofol or midazolam or both) for up to 7 days. On 1 or more study days, 29% of the dexmedetomidine group received propofol (nearly three times the crossover rate of our study) and up to 21% received midazolam. The authors found no significant difference in the number of days without delirium or coma, the number of ventilator-free days, or mortality at 28 days with dexmedetomidine use, although the trial was probably underpowered to measure a difference in mortality.\n\n【51】More recently, Shehabi et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> performed a landmark open-label, randomized trial of dexmedetomidine (up to 1.5 μg per kilogram per hour) as compared with usual care (infusions of propofol or midazolam or both) for up to 28 days in more than 3900 patients with critical illness. The authors did not find a significant difference between the groups in the number of days without delirium or coma at 28 days, the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, death at 90 days (including in subgroup analyses of 806 patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis), or death at 180 days. Most patients (86%) in the dexmedetomidine group received concomitant propofol for a median of 2.0 days, and 23% received midazolam for a median of 0.5 days; this lack of separation between groups limits the interpretation of the results. Despite an unmasking episode in 14% of patients and crossover in about 10% of patients in the present study, we believe that our methodologic rigor allows a more definitive conclusion that dexmedetomidine and propofol have similar efficacy with regard to acute brain dysfunction, mechanical ventilation requirement, and mortality when light sedation goals and the ABCDE bundle are used to care for critically ill mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis. Biologically, patients with sepsis should derive important benefits from dexmedetomidine because of its immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory properties; thus, it is highly unlikely that patients without sepsis would have outcomes with dexmedetomidine substantially different from those we report.\n\n【52】An expanding area of interest in the care of critically ill patients is the prevention of cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and decline in quality of life after hospital discharge. The study by Shehabi et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> showed similar scores in cognition (as assessed with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly \\[IQCODE\\]) and quality of life (as assessed with the EQ-5D) at 180 days in the dexmedetomidine and control groups. Using a more robust cognitive assessment battery, we found clinically important cognitive dysfunction in approximately 25% of patients after sepsis and critical illness even with light sedation approaches, and the use of dexmedetomidine as compared with propofol did not alter this finding. Considering our high follow-up rates and use of a robust assessment battery, it appears that sedation choice does not affect survivorship outcomes when currently recommended sedation approaches are used.\n\n【53】Our trial has a number of strengths but also some notable limitations. We made every effort to mask the delivery of propofol and dexmedetomidine considering their different physical properties. Although an episode of unmasking of the group assignment to a clinician or research team member occurred in 14% of patients, adherence to blinding in our trial was higher than that reported in similar clinical trials of propofol and dexmedetomidine. We allowed clinicians to set sedation targets, achieved good separation between groups regarding sedative exposure, and had robust follow-up. In general, patients had light levels of sedation with low doses of sedative medications and concomitant opioid analgesia. This may reflect changing sedation strategies conforming to recommended practices or the need for lower sedative doses in patients with sepsis. We had some cross-contamination of sedative use, although substantially less than that in similar sedation studies, and had a rescue protocol that included the use of low-dose antipsychotic medications. The trial drug was started a median of 22 hours after the patient met all inclusion criteria, which may have limited our ability to affect outcomes. We had slower-than-anticipated enrollment, which required an adjustment of the sample size, yet had adequate power to study the questions of interest. Some exclusions were the result of clinicians not having equipoise regarding sedation for a given patient or were due to patients’ (or their surrogates’) decision not to agree to enrollment in the trial, factors that may affect generalizability. Overall, we believe that we studied a representative population of patients with sepsis in centers across the United States and provide more definitive evidence regarding the choice of sedation in critically ill patients with sepsis who require mechanical ventilation.\n\n【54】Our trial showed that among critically ill adults with sepsis who were receiving mechanical ventilation and for whom recommended light-sedation approaches were used, dexmedetomidine did not lead to better outcomes than propofol with respect to days alive without acute brain dysfunction, ventilator-free days, death at 90 days, or cognition at 6 months.\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a grant (HL111111) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a grant (TR000445) from the NIH for the use of REDCap, grants from the NIH to Dr. Duprey (1F31AG066460) and to Dr. Girard (HL135144), and a grant from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to Dr. Pun (HL14678-01).

From data on 2801 patients, we developed a predictive instrument for use in a hand-held programmable calculator, which requires only 20 seconds to compute a patient's probability of having acute cardiac ischemia.\n\n【2】In a prospective trial that included 2320 patients in the six hospitals, physicians' diagnostic specificity for acute ischemia increased when the probability value determined by the instrument was made available to them. Rates of false-positive diagnosis decreased without any increase in rates of false-negative diagnosis. Among study patients with a final diagnosis of \"not acute ischemia,\" the number of CCU admissions decreased 30 per cent, without any increase in missed diagnoses of ischemia. The proportion of CCU admissions that represented patients without acute ischemia dropped from 44 to 33 per cent.\n\n【3】Widespread use of this predictive instrument could reduce the number of CCU admissions in this country by more then 250,000 per year. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1984; 310: 1273–8.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

However, even today, when genetically engineered preparations of human insulin are used, anti–human insulin IgG subclasses still are frequently detected in patients treated with insulin. Why therapeutically used insulin molecules, despite having exactly the same primary structure as endogenous insulin, are immunogenic has not been fully clarified.\n\n【3】We describe the induction of immunologic tolerance with the use of intravenously injected insulin in a severely insulin-allergic patient with diabetes. In April 2003, a 24-year-old man with a three-year history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and with insulin allergy was referred to our institution. Skin tests performed with all forms of commercially available insulin and insulin analogues were positive, but skin tests were negative for solvent and additives. Attempted desensitization with the subcutaneous administration of insulin, with continuous subcutaneous injection of insulin lispro, or with oral antiallergic agents did not prevent frequent life-threatening allergic symptoms (e.g., systemic urticaria, shock, and dyspnea), especially after bolus injections with meals. However, when no allergic reactions were observed after intravenous injection of 0.05 U of regular insulin per patient, we gradually increased the dose.\n\n【4】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Blood Levels of Glycosylated Hemoglobin, Anti–Human Insulin Antibodies, and Antiallergic Agents over Time.\n\n【5】Conventional intermittent subcutaneous injections of insulin were switched to continuous subcutaneous injections of insulin lispro in March 2003. In September 2004, continuous intravenous injections of regular insulin (Humulin R, Eli Lilly) were introduced (at a dose of 100 U per 500 ml, given by means of a central line), owing to exacerbation of allergic symptoms. A portable pump delivered 5 to 10 ml per hour, adjusted according to self-monitored blood glucose levels. In addition, undiluted regular insulin (approximately 25 U) was injected intravenously before meals. The figure shows blood levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (Panel A), anti–human insulin IgG bound/total (B/T) (Panel B), and anti–human insulin IgE (Panel C). The levels of anti–human insulin IgG and IgE declined sharply once treatment with intravenous insulin began, and normal levels were reached 10 months after the start of intravenous treatment. The doses of the oral antiallergic agents olopatadine hydrochloride and prednisolone are also shown.\n\n【6】We ultimately succeeded in administering all the required insulin intravenously with a portable parenteral-nutrition device (a central venous catheter, a subcutaneously embedded reservoir, and a portable infusion pump). All symptoms of an allergic reaction disappeared as soon as intravenous injection was begun. Oral antiallergic agents were no longer required. Within a year after the introduction of intravenously injected insulin, levels of anti–human insulin IgE returned to normal (decreasing from 2.51 to <0.34 U per milliliter), as did levels of anti–human insulin IgG bound/total (B/T) (from 42.6 to 9.2 percent), without any adverse effect on glucose control 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.\n\n【7】In July 2005, despite these changes in anti-insulin antibodies, subcutaneous injection of regular insulin still caused immediate allergic reactions in our patient. Thus, identical insulin molecules can behave in markedly different ways depending on the route of injection. Also, it is possible that the formation of anti–human insulin IgG is caused only by insulin molecules that are in contact with subcutaneous tissue. We assume that some modification of insulin, such as aggregation, leads to the immunologic reactions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> We believe that the example of our patient not only indicates an option for the treatment of severe insulin allergy but also may help elucidate the pathogenesis of the immunologic response to therapeutic insulin.\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Masato Asai, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNagoya University Graduate School of Medicine and Hospital, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan  \nmasato-a@mbc.  ocn.  ne.  jp</u>\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Masanori Yoshida, M.D.  \nToyota Memorial Hospital, Toyota 471-8513, Japan</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Yoshitaka Miura, M.D., Ph.D.  \nNagoya University Graduate School of Medicine and Hospital, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>3 References</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>1.  1\\.

Five years after the entry of the last patient and with a median follow-up of all survivors for 80 months, the recurrence rate was highest among the control patients (55 per cent) and lowest among the patients receiving a combination of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (33 per cent). Time to tumor recurrence differed significantly among the four treatment groups (P<0.04); it was significantly prolonged by combined radiation and chemotherapy as compared with resection alone (P<0.009). Overall survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. The superiority of the combined-modality regimen appeared to be attributable to the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in controlling local and distant recurrences, respectively. We conclude that this study provides evidence supporting the use of postoperative radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy in patients who have had \"curative\" resection of rectal cancer with involvement of perirectal fat or regional nodes or both (Stages B <sub>2 </sub> and C). 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1985; 312:1465–72.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

They are extremely rare, but in Napa County, what appears to be the Bay Area’s first fatal breakthrough Covid-19 infection has happened.\n\n【14】_Speaker 8_ : The new CDC internal report not only acknowledges that so-called breakthrough infections are rising, but that they may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases.\n\n【15】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : And what about all these boosters?\n\n【16】_Speaker 9_ : More than 100 million Americans have now received their first booster shot, but 91 million people who are eligible have yet to get the additional shot. So basically —\n\n【17】_Speaker 10_ : While the new booster is ready, health officials on Long Island say not many people are getting —\n\n【18】_President Joe Biden_ : The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with Covid. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over.\n\n【19】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Well, the pandemic is definitely not over. But what about the future? Can we do better with our Covid vaccines? And if so, how much better? And how do we make sense of these short-acting boosters and what we can really expect moving forward? I’m Rachel Gotbaum and you’re listening to “Intention to Treat” from the _New England_ _Journal of Medicine_ .\n\n【20】To get some answers to these questions, I’m joined by NEJM editor-in-chief, Dr. Eric Rubin. Hi, Eric. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\n【21】_Eric Rubin_ : Great to be here, Rachel. Thanks.\n\n【22】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : We’re also going to bring in Eric’s colleague at the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, Dr. Paul Offit. Dr. Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Paul, thank you so much for being here.\n\n【23】_Paul Offit_ : It’s my pleasure. Thanks for asking.\n\n【24】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Let’s first talk about where we are before we discuss if we can actually do better.\n\n【25】_Paul Offit_ : Well, I think we’re doing great. I mean, if you look at where we were in 2020, we didn’t have monoclonal antibodies, we didn’t have vaccines, we didn’t have antivirals. All we had was barrier protections, sort of isolate, quarantine, test, close schools, close businesses, restrict travel. That’s how bad things were. And you’d have 3000 people dying a day, 4000 people dying a day. We were bad off. And we were a blank slate. We had no population immunity when that virus first rolled into this country. Now we do. We have probably 90 to 95% population immunity. We have drugs that can treat people at high risk. We have monoclonal antibodies for people who are immune-compromised, and we have vaccines as our ticket out of this pandemic. So we’re in much, much better shape.\n\n【26】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Eric, what are your thoughts?\n\n【27】_Eric Rubin_ : Remember that at the beginning of the epidemic, when we first used vaccines, they were remarkably effective not only at preventing death and preventing severe disease, as Paul already said, but they really prevented infection and transmission of disease. So there was a time when it looked like we might be able to really control disease to a much greater extent. That doesn’t appear to be the case now. The vaccines do help prevent severe disease. They are stopping people from dying, and that’s very important. But at the same time, we’ve had to lower our expectations thus far.\n\n【28】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Yes. Let’s talk about this lowering of expectations because Paul, in one of your recent Perspective articles for NEJM, you talk about an over-promising with these vaccines and a stirring up of confusion. What did we need to do differently?\n\n【29】_Paul Offit_ : I think there was a false hope, in a sense, that was created by those original studies back in December of 2020. What you found was you found 95% protective efficacy against all manner of illness, mild, moderate, severe illness. There’s no way that was going to last. I mean, those were relatively short studies. They were done over only a period of 3 months. This is a short-incubation-period mucosal infection. You’re not going to be protected against mild disease for very long. It’s true really of all short-incubation-period mucosal infections, whether it’s flu or parainfluenza virus or rotavirus. You can get excellent protection, I think probably fairly long-term, against severe disease, but you’re not going to get long-term protection against mild disease. And that’s what happened. Six months later, if you look at the studies that were done, protection against severe disease was holding up, but protection against mild disease wasn’t. And that was also true a year later.\n\n【30】I think we created this unrealistic expectation. To me, the seminal moment came when thousands of men got together in Provincetown, Massachusetts, to celebrate the July 4th holiday. Seventy-nine percent were vaccinated; 346, despite being vaccinated, got Covid. Four were hospitalized. Four of 346. That was a hospitalization rate of 1.2%. That was a vaccine working very well. The remaining 342 had mild or asymptomatic infection, which the CDC labeled as “breakthrough infections”. That was the wrong word. Breakthrough implies failure. That’s not a failure. That was a moment to celebrate that vaccine. Here were people who, because they were vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, only suffered a mild illness. And I think we lost that opportunity and created this unrealistic notion that we could somehow in any long-term manner protect against mild disease, which is just not possible. The only attainable goal of this vaccine is keep people out of the hospital, keep them out of the intensive care unit, and keep them from dying.\n\n【31】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Eric, let me get to you for a minute. Did you somehow think we were going to do better with these vaccines? Paul is clear that there will probably never be long durability with them. What’s your experience?\n\n【32】_Eric Rubin_ : Well, first let me add something to what Paul said, which is that there is this annoying thing called evolution. So not only is the immunity short-lived to many of these infections, but the virus has changed and it continues to change. And it’s changing because of vaccines and because of the amount of infection out there that’s applying some sort of evolutionary pressure to select for these new mutants. So there’s sort of a double whammy here: our lack of ability to produce long-lasting immunity using vaccines and natural infection, and the fact that the virus keeps changing. If we keep on doing the same thing, we’re very likely to come up with the same sorts of answers. Chasing after each new viral variant is likely to at best continue what we’re doing right now. It’s not likely to make a breakthrough for preventing infection for any persistent amount of time, I think.\n\n【33】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Eric, what would you like to see?\n\n【34】_Eric Rubin_ : I would love to see more effort put into different modalities. Some of them are being tried, although they’re not being tried at the scale or with the pace that the original vaccines were when they were developed. There certainly are efforts, for example, to try to produce mucosal vaccines. Perhaps they would make a difference. Perhaps they would give us more protection against infection. So far, I’m afraid the results haven’t been glowingly positive.\n\n【35】_Paul Offit_ : Here’s how I see this. If you want to try and protect against a mild infection or try and decrease transmission, you need high levels of neutralizing antibodies, especially now with these more contagious variants, which have, if anything, shorter incubation period. So the only way to get long-lived protection against mild illness is to have long-lived induction of antibodies. And that is not something I can think of a way to do unless you’re trying to just boost several times a year, which I don’t think is a viable public health strategy. To me, what makes sense is focus on the goal. The goal is prevent serious illness. The goal is keep people out of the hospital. I don’t see how you can reasonably try and prevent against mild disease for any length of time for a short-incubation-period disease knowing that neutralizing antibodies are not going to be long-lived. And I can’t think of a strategy that would allow that to happen. The only other way that this could happen is if this becomes a longer-incubation-period disease like measles or rubella or smallpox, the kind of diseases you really can eliminate from the face of the earth because they are long incubation.\n\n【36】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Paul, do we need to change our expectation here?\n\n【37】_Paul Offit_ : I think so, to some extent. I think that when you hear, for example, the administration and public health agencies say, “Everybody needs to get a booster. Everybody over 12 needs to get a booster.” And some people have said, because this way you can feel a little better about being in crowds over the winter in indoors over the winter that you’re less likely to transmit, less likely to get mild disease — I just think that’s a little misleading. And I think that’s caused a fair amount of disappointment. Very early on, actually 6 months, 8 months into this, having a vaccine, people would say, “Look, I got two doses of the vaccine and then I still got infected.” And I do think if you could go back in time and do this all over again, I wish we could have set more reasonable expectations for what this vaccine can and can’t do.\n\n【38】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : What would we have said then?\n\n【39】_Paul Offit_ : We would’ve said that the goal of this vaccine is to prevent serious illness. The goal of this vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital, keep you out of the ICU, and keep you out of the morgue. That is the goal. You may still get a mild illness. You still may get two doses or three doses or four doses, and you still may get a mild illness and you may feel terrible. But you’re not going to need oxygen. You’re not going to need to go to the hospital. And that’s the goal of this vaccine. And it would’ve been more realistic to, I think, have offered that rather than this sort of notion of Covid Zero.\n\n【40】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Eric, are you as pessimistic as Paul that we’re not going to get real durability and we’re going to have mild disease, as you guys call it, but what that means is we’re going to be infectious and we’re going to be living with this. What’s your take on it?\n\n【41】_Eric Rubin_ : Well, I have to agree with Paul. We have many years of experience with trying to develop vaccines, and these are the characteristics of the vaccines we get. Having said that, we don’t right now harness every part of the immune system. Cell immunity, for example, perhaps it could make a difference. Mucosal immunity, which certainly is induced by some other vaccines, might be an addition. It may be impossible. It may be this is the best we can do. I wouldn’t give up yet, but I do think that we’re not going to know unless we make some sort of investment in continuing research and development. Remember that things that prevent disease are far better than things that treat disease. So I think we underinvest in vaccines in general, and this is one where I would continue to be spending some money.\n\n【42】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Paul, you talked about repeated boosters as not a viable public health option. We’ve had editorials from colleagues who have agreed, said, “We shouldn’t be getting these even once a year.” That’s the current state of things. So where do we go here?\n\n【43】_Paul Offit_ : Right. So on September 1, the CDC recommended that everybody over 12 years of age receive a bivalent vaccine booster dose. I guess I would argue that if you look at their data, the CDC data, or data recently published by the United Kingdom, the question was does a booster dose benefit people in terms of preventing hospitalization? Yes, that was true for a third dose, and it was true to a lesser extent with the fourth dose. But if you look at who benefited, it wasn’t everybody. The people who benefited primarily were those who were elderly, those who lived in nursing homes, those who were immune-compromised, and those who had high-risk medical conditions, so focus on them.\n\n【44】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So essentially, there is no magic bullet. I’d like you to speak about how we should be thinking about this and how providers should be thinking about this.\n\n【45】_Eric Rubin_ : You know, I started as a Red Sox fan in the 1960s, and optimism does eventually pay off oftentimes. So I’d go back to where we started with what Paul said. We have had a huge success here, not just vaccines, but of course a lot of people have been infected and therefore the prevalence of immune individuals is very high. So we’re really starting from a pretty good place.\n\n【46】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Paul?\n\n【47】_Paul Offit_ : I think moving forward, given that we have a high level of population immunity, given that we have vaccines and monoclonals and antivirals which can help save our lives, to me, the critical thing that has to happen moving forward is a collaboration between two groups. One is CDC epidemiologists in collaboration with immunologists and academic centers to answer the question for how long are you protected against severe disease based on how many doses of the vaccine you’ve gotten, based on which vaccines you’ve gotten, based on what your medical background is. How often do you need to get a booster dose? Is it a year later? Is it 2 years later? Is it 5 years later? So that’s what you need to define.\n\n【48】_Eric Rubin_ : I think Paul makes an important point that I want to make very explicit. While we’ve invested a lot in developing vaccines, rolling them out, and other public health measures, one place we have continued to fall short is in surveillance. We really don’t know who’s getting infected, how many people are getting infected, and that problem has been compounded because of home testing, lack of reporting systems. We really need some sort of systematic surveillance. I think the important point is I don’t think we know. We don’t know the answer to boosting without data. We’re going to have to have a good idea of what’s happening and what’s working at any given time to inform those decisions.\n\n【49】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : So Paul, do you envision the future of Covid to be like the flu in terms of having an annual tailored shot for each strain moving forward? Is that how you see this happening?\n\n【50】_Paul Offit_ : I guess I’m going to make the following predictions, which is probably a terrible thing to do because if you make predictions about SARS-CoV-2 you’re always wrong, but I’m going to try anyway. I assume this virus is going to be circulating for years, if not decades. I assume that if the entire world were vaccinated and the virus still never mutated, that it would still circulate in the community and still cause mild disease in many and severe disease in some. So the goal then is to focus on those who are most at risk for severe disease and make sure that we can keep them as immune as possible over time. But we will settle in to where we are with flu. Two years before SARS-CoV-2 came into the United States in say January 2020, 2 years before that, we had 800,000 hospitalizations from influenza and 60,000 deaths. If we masked and social distanced and were a little more careful about interacting with people during the winter, we could have dramatically lowered those numbers. We didn’t. We accepted those, and I think at some level we’re going to get to the point with this virus where we grandfather in, if that’s the right term, a certain amount of disease and hospitalization and death. I don’t know what those numbers are, but I suspect that’s likely to happen.\n\n【51】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : Well, thank you both very much. It sounds like what we’re working on now is not going to get us long-term durability, which is what I think a lot of people had hoped for. Then again, we may need to rethink how we see these vaccines. Paul Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and he is also on the FDA’s Vaccine Advisory Committee with Eric Rubin, who is editor-in-chief of the _New England Journal of Medicine_ . Thank you both very much for coming in.\n\n【52】_Eric Rubin_ : Thanks, Rachel.\n\n【53】_Paul Offit_ : Thank you.\n\n【54】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : You’re listening to “Intention to Treat” from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ . Next time we’ll hear from OB-GYN specialists practicing in states where providing needed medical care can mean a criminal indictment and where patients are being put at risk.\n\n【55】_Speaker 14_ : We can’t function like this. We can’t function in fear. We can’t be fearful that every time we provide indicated abortion, we could potentially go to jail. So I think we’re all bracing for an increase in maternal death. And the fact that we think we won’t be able to change the law until women die seems absurd.\n\n【56】_Rachel Gotbaum_ : I’m Rachel Gotbaum.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission.\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography.\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress—velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P<0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload, sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1991; 324:808–15.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin are effective antileukemic agents used widely in chemotherapeutic regimens in children for the past 20 years. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Dose-related cardiotoxicity is commonly recognized, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> but the late effects on the heart (those occurring more than one year after the administration of doxorubicin) are not known. We therefore evaluated cardiac status in children 1 to 15 years after the successful treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chemotherapeutic regimens that included doxorubicin.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Subjects\n--------\n\n【14】Table 1.  Table 1.

The children had been treated according to a number of different protocols, all of which included doxorubicin. In March 1987, all eligible patients were asked to participate in a study of the late cardiac effects of anthracycline therapy. The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire, a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording (with a Holter monitor), an exercise test, and echocardiography.\n\n【16】The questionnaire was designed to elicit a history of symptoms referable to the cardiovascular system and to assess the patient's and the family's perception of the patient's health. A 24-hour electrocardiographic record was made with a Holter monitor and reviewed for abnormalities of heart rate 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> and rhythm. A maximal symptom-limited exercise-tolerance test was performed on either a bicycle ergometer or a treadmill. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u>\n\n【17】The echocardiographic evaluation consisted of two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler evaluation with analyses of the stress—velocity and stress—shortening indexes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler cardiography were performed in all patients for the qualitative assessment of left ventricular regional-wall motion, the presence of intracardiac thrombus, and evidence of structural or valvular heart disease. An M-mode echocardiogram directed by two-dimensional echocardiography was recorded simultaneously with a phonocardiogram showing the aortic component of the second heart sound, an indirect carotid or axillary pulse tracing, and an electrocardiogram. Blood pressure was measured with a Dinamap automated vital-signs monitor (Critikon). The M-mode echocardiogram, phonocardiogram, and pulse tracing were analyzed by computer as described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【18】Previous and subsequent echocardiograms were analyzed in an identical fashion. Analysis was restricted to size, wall thickness, and measurements of cardiac function when data on blood pressure and pulse were not available.\n\n【19】The normal control group for comparison of the echocardiographic data consisted of 370 normal subjects (age, 1 month to 40 years). Data from this normal control group showed that ventricular size and wall thickness were closely related to body size and that adjustment for body-surface area eliminated size-related changes. In contrast, afterload in the control group was more closely related to age. Therefore, values adjusted for body-surface area were used for size and wall thickness, and age-adjusted values were used for wall stress. The normal ranges for afterload, indexes of cardiac function, and the relation between afterload and contractility were determined in these subjects and used for statistical comparisons with the values in the study group.\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【21】All analyses were performed both for the entire patient group and for the subgroup of patients who received more than one dose of doxorubicin. Exercise tolerance was expressed as a percentage of normal, according to published standards adjusted for age and sex (for the treadmill) or body-surface area (for the bicycle ergometer). 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> Patients with exercise-tolerance values more than 2 SD below the standards were considered to have reduced exercise tolerance. The relation among reported symptoms, exercise capacity, Holter-monitor findings, and the results of studies of left ventricular function were evaluated with Fisher's exact test. The results of left ventricular-function studies were expressed as means ±SD. Left ventricular size, wall thickness, wall stress, and function were compared with values for the normal controls with use of a two-sample t-test. Paired t-tests were used to evaluate changes in cardiac function over time. The relation between end-systolic wall stress and the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, adjusted for heart rate, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> was calculated for each subject in relation to the normal range and expressed as the normal deviate (Z score). For each patient, left ventricular contractility was considered to be abnormal if the relation between end-systolic wall stress and the velocity of shortening was less than –2 (i.e., a value for velocity more than 2 SD below the mean for that level of wall stress). Similarly, for each subject, increased afterload was defined as a value for end-systolic wall stress more than 2 SD above the mean for age in the normal population.\n\n【22】The potential effects of sex, age at diagnosis, total dose of doxorubicin, age at evaluation, and length of time from the completion of therapy to evaluation on the incidence of cardiac abnormalities were evaluated with use of logistic-regression models. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> All P values are two-sided.\n\n【23】Results\n-------\n\n【24】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【25】Of 460 potentially eligible patients, 179 patients were excluded because their disease was not in remission (20 patients), they had relapsed (135 patients), or they had died in remission (24 patients). Of the 281 remaining patients eligible for cardiac evaluation (i.e., patients in continuous complete remission from acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had had their last doxorubicin treatment at least one year earlier), 115 (41 percent) underwent noninvasive cardiac testing 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u> and are the subjects of this report. All received doxorubicin as part of combination chemotherapy; other chemotherapeutic agents used included vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone, mercaptopurine, and L-asparaginase from _Escherichia coli_ . No patient received the potentially cardiotoxic agent amsacrine, or cyclophosphamide in a cardiotoxic dosage. None underwent mediastinal or spinal irradiation. At the time of the cardiac evaluation, no patient had a hematocrit value lower than 30 percent, had known hypothyroidism, or was receiving steroids or cardiotonic therapy.\n\n【26】The study population consisted of 58 boys and 57 girls. Their mean age at the time of the study was 13.6 years (median, 12.6; range, 3.9 to 31.7). The age at diagnosis ranged from 7 months to 19.1 years (mean, 6.2 years; median, 4.8). The length of time since the completion of therapy was 1 to 15 years (median, 6.4). The total dose of doxorubicin ranged from 45 to 550 mg per square meter of body-surface area; for purposes of this study, the patients were divided according to the cumulative-dose categories 45 mg per square meter (n = 18), 228 to 360 mg per square meter (n = 52), 361 to 475 mg per square meter (n = 42), and more than 500 mg per square meter (n = 3). No patient had a total dose of doxorubicin between 45 and 228 mg per square meter. For the multiple-dose protocols, the rate of administration ranged from 30 to 60 mg per square meter every three weeks 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>.\n\n【27】To evaluate possible bias in the selection of patients, we examined the clinical characteristics of the 166 patients who met the study's entrance criteria but who were not enrolled. Specifically, we compared the study group and the group of patients who did not participate with respect to age at diagnosis, sex, specific treatment protocol, total dose of doxorubicin, and length of time since the completion of doxorubicin therapy. We found no significant differences in any of these variables (data not shown).\n\n【28】Acute Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity\n--------------------------------\n\n【29】Acute congestive heart failure (defined as failure beginning within one year of the completion of doxorubicin therapy) occurred in 11 of the 115 patients (10 percent). All 11 patients improved with anticongestive therapy, which was eventually discontinued in all cases. Five of the 11 patients subsequently had recurrent congestive heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment. Two of these five patients underwent cardiac transplantation.\n\n【30】Echocardiography\n----------------\n\n【31】An echocardiogram was obtained specifically for this study in all 115 patients. Regional wall motion appeared normal in all the study patients. No intracardiac mass (thrombus or vegetation) or structural abnormality was detected in any of the patients.\n\n【32】Left Ventricular Size and Wall Thickness\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】The mean left ventricular end-diastolic size adjusted for body-surface area for all 115 patients was 4.47±0.58 cm, similar to that in normal controls (4.52±0.29 cm, P = 0.376). In the subset of 97 patients who received more than 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, this value was also not significantly different from normal (4.55±0.58 cm). Left ventricular posterior-wall thickness adjusted for body-surface area was lower in recipients of doxorubicin than in normal controls (0.68±0.20 vs. 0.81 ±0.09 cm, P<0.0001). In patients in the higher-dose group, this value was also significantly lower than normal (0.66±0.18 cm).\n\n【34】Left Ventricular Function, Afterload, and Contractility\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】We used analysis of covariance to compare fractional shortening, velocity of shortening, end-systolic wall stress, and posterior-wall thickness (adjusted for age or body-surface area) in patients who received a single dose of 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter with the values in those who received a cumulative dose of more than 227 mg per square meter and in the normal control group. For each measure, the group that received the higher cumulative dose had significantly impaired function (P<0.0001), whereas the group that received the single dose was similar to the normal controls.\n\n【36】Specifically, fractional shortening was reduced from normal values in both the overall patient group (30.2±5.7 percent; normal, 33.5±2.5 percent; P<0.0001) and in the subgroup of patients who received more than 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter (29.1±5.3 percent, P<0.0001). The velocity of shortening was similarly reduced in all patients (0.96±0.18 circumferences per second; normal, 1.05±0.08; P<0.0001) and in the group that received more than 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter (0.93±0.17 circumferences per second, P<0.0001). Left ventricular end-systolic wall stress was significantly higher in the study group (P<0.0001), ranging from 21 to 129 g per square centimeter (mean, 64.0±22.4; normal, 47.5±7.0), and was even higher in the subgroup that received more than 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter (67.6±22.2 g per square centimeter, P<0.0001). Wall stress is inversely related to wall thickness, and directly related to left ventricular size and intracavitary pressure. In these patients, size and pressure were normal, and increased wall stress was attributable exclusively to reduced wall thickness.\n\n【37】Table 2. Table 2. Echocardiographic Findings in the Patients, According to Various Characteristics. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Relation of Rate-Corrected Velocity of Circumferential Fiber Shortening (VCFc, in Circumferences per Second) to End-Systolic Wall Stress (Afterload) for 115 Study Patients at Follow-up at Least One Year after the Completion of Doxorubicin Therapy.\n\n【38】The diagonal line indicates the lower 95 percent confidence limit for left ventricular contractility. The vertical line indicates the upper limit of normal end-systolic wall stress for adults in our laboratory for reference purposes. For purposes of analysis, age-adjusted norms were used. The upper left quadrant (group 1 ) includes patients with normal afterload and contractility. The upper right quadrant (group 2) comprises patients with elevated afterload and normal contractility. Reduced contractility is present in both lower quadrants (groups 3 and 4); patients in group 4 also had elevated afterload. Open circles represent patients who received a single dose of 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, and solid circles those treated with at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter. No patient received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin between 45 and 228 mg per square meter.Table 3.  Table 3. Relation of Left Ventricular Function to Reported Symptoms, Results of Exercise Testing, and Results of Holter Monitoring.\\*\n\n【39】Contractility, as assessed by the relation between afterload and the velocity of shortening, was not impaired in the study group overall. When the relations among left ventricular performance, afterload, and contractility were examined, it was apparent that abnormal contractility was the primary or only cause of reduced systolic performance in only a small proportion of patients. To facilitate further analysis, the patients were classified according to afterload and contractility 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Forty-nine patients (43 percent) had normal left ventricular contractility and afterload (group 1 in Fig. 1 ). Group 1 included 15 patients who had received only a single dose (45 mg per square meter) of doxorubicin. Left ventricular contractility was reduced in 22 patients (19 percent) (groups 3 and 4 in Fig. 1 ). End-systolic stress was elevated in 60 patients (52 percent) (groups 2 and 4 in Fig. 1 ). Contractility was normal in 44 of the 60 patients with increased afterload (high end-systolic stress) (group 2 in Fig. 1 ) and depressed in the other 16 patients (group 4 in Fig. 1 ). No relation was found between abnormalities of contractility, afterload, or both and reported symptoms, an abnormal result on exercise stress testing, or an abnormal Holter-monitor recording 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【40】The left ventricular shortening fraction was normal or increased in 83 patients and reduced (more than 2 SD below the mean value for normal controls) in 32 others. The shortening fraction was a poor index of left ventricular contractility at the late evaluation. Of the 32 patients with a reduced shortening fraction, only 19 (59 percent) had decreased contractility. In patients with a reduced shortening fraction but normal contractility, excess afterload fully accounted for the observed reduction in systolic performance.\n\n【41】Serial Echocardiographic Data\n-----------------------------\n\n【42】A total of 629 echocardiograms, including 220 studies with stress—velocity analysis of cardiac contractility and loading conditions, were available for the 115 patients. Echocardiography was performed before the initiation of doxorubicin therapy in 63 patients.\n\n【43】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Relation of Left Ventricular Posterior-Wall Thickness (End-Diastole) to Body-Surface Area in 63 Patients.\n\n【44】Dotted lines indicate the 95 percent confidence limits. Open circles indicate the mean wall thickness measured before doxorubicin treatment, and solid circles the mean wall thickness at the follow-up study. The I bars indicate the SEM for each value. Groups 1 through 4 correspond to the four ventricular-function groups described in the legend to Figure 1 .\n\n【45】The mean left ventricular end-diastolic size, adjusted for body-surface area, was within the normal range in all studies, both before and after treatment, for all four patient groups, regardless of ventricular function or loading conditions. The mean left ventricular posterior-wall thickness, adjusted for body-surface area, was normal before doxorubicin therapy in the 63 patients for whom such measurements were available 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 )</u>. As Figure 2 shows, during the period of follow-up, left ventricular posterior-wall thickness increased in proportion to body-surface area in the subjects in whom afterload remained normal (groups 1 and 3). In contrast, the patients who had excess afterload at the time of the evaluation had an increase in wall thickness that was less than would be expected for somatic growth (groups 2 and 4). For those in whom serial values for afterload were available, there was a significant increase in age-adjusted end-systolic stress (afterload) during the follow-up interval (median, 2.9 years) from 52.6± 19.0 g per square centimeter to 69.2±30.8 g per square centimeter (P = 0.005); 24 of 34 patients (71 percent) had higher values on the last study. The relation of end-systolic wall stress to the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (contractility) was not found to change significantly during the same time interval (-0.91 ±3.0 SD on the first echocardiogram vs. -0.22±2.33 SD on the most recent).\n\n【46】Risk Factors\n------------\n\n【47】Table 2 shows the relation between potential risk factors and the incidence of cardiac abnormalities (increased afterload or decreased contractility). In univariate logistic-regression analyses including all 115 patients, the following were found to be significant risk factors for the presence of any abnormality: a higher cumulative dose of doxorubicin (P = 0.002), a longer time between the completion of doxorubicin therapy and the study echocardiogram (P = 0.006), and an age of less than four years at the time of treatment (P = 0.04). All three were significant predictors of increased afterload (P<0.01), whereas the cumulative dose of doxorubicin and the length of time since the end of treatment were significant predictors of decreased contractility (P<0.01). In multivariate analyses, the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was a risk factor for both increased afterload and decreased contractility (P<0.003), and age at the time of treatment was a risk factor for increased afterload (P = 0.003). The length of time between the completion of doxorubicin therapy and the study echocardiogram was not a significant factor in any logistic model that included the cumulative dose of doxorubicin. In multivariate models restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant factors were a higher cumulative dose for predicting decreased contractility (P = 0.01), and an age of less than four years at the time of treatment for predicting increased afterload (P = 0.003).\n\n【48】Ventricular Function at the Completion of Therapy\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【49】Echocardiograms were obtained within one year of the completion of doxorubicin therapy in 57 patients, all of whom received more than 45 mg of doxorubicin per square meter. Twenty-seven were found to have a reduced shortening fraction (<28 percent) early after treatment (mean, 20.28±5.55 percent), and 30 had normal fractional shortening (mean, 31.8±7.28 percent). Abnormal fractional shortening at the completion of therapy was 70 percent accurate in predicting the presence of either abnormal contractility or abnormal afterload at follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> (sensitivity = 64 percent, specificity = 81 percent) and was slightly more accurate in predicting abnormalities of contractility (accuracy = 74 percent, sensitivity = 88 percent, specificity = 68 percent) than abnormalities of afterload (accuracy = 67 percent, sensitivity = 63 percent, specificity = 72 percent).\n\n【50】Questionnaire\n-------------\n\n【51】Completed questionnaires were available for 91 patients. Thirty-six patients (40 percent) reported symptoms referable to the cardiovascular system, including easy fatigability (16 patients), chest pain (10), shortness of breath (9), palpitations (6), or syncope (4). The relation between reports of easy fatigability or shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance on stress testing was not statistically significant (P = 0.26).\n\n【52】Holter-Monitor Recordings\n-------------------------\n\n【53】Twenty-four-hour Holter-monitor recordings were available for 89 patients. Four recordings demonstrated ventricular tachycardia. One patient had syncope and two had palpitations at the time ventricular tachycardia was recorded. All four patients had severe ventricular dysfunction, and congestive heart failure developed in all four within the year after the observation of high-grade ventricular ectopy. Abnormalities on the Holter-monitor recordings were not related to perceived symptoms overall (P = 0.13), nor did they specifically relate to a history of palpitations or syncope.\n\n【54】Exercise Testing\n----------------\n\n【55】Exercise tests were performed by 96 patients, of whom 41 (43 percent) had abnormalities: 33 had abnormal duration of exercise; 8 excess tachycardia; 2 exercise-induced hypotension; 3 atrial ectopy; 12 ventricular ectopy (Lown grade 1 through 4A 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> ); 9 abnormal ST-segment and T-wave changes with exercise23; and 6 symptoms of nausea, excess dyspnea, or leg pain during exercise. Eighty-one exercise tests were completed by patients who had received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter; 48 percent had abnormalities similar in distribution to those noted for the entire group of patients. When the patients' actual exercise duration was divided by the expected duration, the median value was 80 percent of normal. The exercise-duration ratio was not significantly different for subjects with and without abnormal contractility, afterload, or both (P = 0.38).\n\n【56】Myocardial Biopsy\n-----------------\n\n【57】We reviewed our experience with cardiac biopsy in survivors of childhood cancer and found eight patients who had undergone myocardial biopsy. Six were treated for leukemia (3 of them were among the 115 patients included in this study), and 2 were treated for sarcoma. All eight had marked elevations in left ventricular wall stress (mean, 124±28 g per square centimeter; range, 62 to 181) with reduced systolic performance (fractional shortening, 13.06±3.56 percent) and reduced contractility. Six had clinical congestive heart failure at the time of the biopsy, congestive heart failure developed in one 10 months after the biopsy, and one had symptomatic ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring. These patients had completed doxorubicin therapy 9.5 to 14 years previously. Marked hypertrophy of myocytes with sarcoplasmic and nuclear enlargement was noted in all the biopsy specimens. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24</a></sup></u>\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】Echocardiographically detectable abnormalities of left ventricular afterload and contractility were common 1 to 15 years after the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood with chemotherapeutic regimens that included doxorubicin. Reduced contractility and, especially, increased afterload progressed with time and were related to the cumulative dose of doxorubicin, the age of the patient at the time of treatment, and the length of follow-up. Patients were usually asymptomatic, and symptoms correlated poorly with echocardiographic indexes and the duration of exercise. Reduced exercise tolerance was common, although it did not predict abnormalities of ventricular function. Serious disturbances of rhythm were uncommon and were found only in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction.\n\n【60】Increased afterload was the most common abnormality in our patients and those of others. 删除3:<u><sup><a>25 </a></sup></u> End-systolic wall stress (afterload) is a function of blood pressure, the size of the ventricular cavity, and wall thickness. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Blood pressure and the size of the cavity were normal in our patients, and the excess afterload was attributable exclusively to reduced left ventricular wall thickness. Serial studies revealed an increasing disproportion between wall thickness and ventricular size with time. This progression was most striking in patients who had substantial somatic growth. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> The consequences of the prolonged elevation of left ventricular wall stress are uncertain, but excess afterload appears to contribute to the eventual myocardial deterioration associated with left ventricular volume- and pressure-overload lesions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u>\n\n【61】Reduced contractility was less common than increased afterload. The majority of patients with reductions in contractility in whom earlier measurements of ventricular function were available had echocardiographic evidence of acute doxorubicin toxicity. These patients appeared to have had severe injury to the myocardium that impaired both the growth potential and the contractile function of the remaining myocardial cells. The data were insufficient, however, to determine whether reduced contractility was a residuum of acute doxorubicin toxicity, the result of prolonged elevation in afterload, or the combined result of both factors.\n\n【62】The three factors that appeared to influence the frequency of cardiac abnormalities years after doxorubicin therapy (cumulative dose, age at treatment, and length of follow-up) were interrelated. The patients who were followed up for the longest time were treated according to earlier protocols, which used the highest cumulative dose of doxorubicin. In addition, more children under four years of age received doxorubicin at the highest dose rates and the highest cumulative doses. Nevertheless, multivariate analyses clearly demonstrated that the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictive factor for both increased afterload and decreased contractility; an age below four years at treatment was also a significant independent predictive factor for increased afterload.\n\n【63】Multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter indicated that the only significant prognostic factors in this group were age at treatment, for increased afterload, and cumulative dose of doxorubicin, for decreased contractility. We hypothesize that afterload was more adversely affected by doxorubicin in younger patients because more myocardial growth is required for young children to reach adult proportions. Thus, the increase in afterload observed at follow-up might be peculiar to patients who received doxorubicin in early childhood. In contrast, decreased contractility at follow-up was more strongly related to both the cumulative dose of doxorubicin and early depression of ventricular function, suggesting that dose-related early cardiotoxicity may persist or recur years later.\n\n【64】The administration of doxorubicin appears to impair myocardial growth, as indicated by the inappropriately small increase in left ventricular wall thickness in relation to somatic growth. By six months of age, the adult number of myocytes is present, and subsequent myocardial growth occurs by increase in the size of existing myocytes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>28 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> The doxorubicin-induced loss of or damage to a critical number of myocytes 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> might decrease the number of residual myocardial cells below that required to generate a normal adult myocardial mass, despite a marked increase in the size of the remaining myocytes. This process may take place with or without signs and symptoms of acute toxicity. In support of this hypothesis, we observed marked hypertrophy of myocytes with focal interstitial fibrosis in myocardial-biopsy specimens in conjunction with reduced wall thickness and increased afterload. Similar pathological findings have been reported in children with doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>31 </a></sup></u> Limited fibrosis may be due to the inhibitory effects of doxorubicin on the proliferation of nonmuscle cells, 删除3:<u><sup><a>32 </a></sup></u> which make up 75 percent of the cells of the heart. 删除3:<u><sup><a>33 </a></sup></u> In our patients, the size of the left ventricular cavity was appropriate for somatic growth, whereas left ventricular wall thickness failed to keep pace and, consequently, left ventricular after-load increased progressively.\n\n【65】Only 41 percent of the eligible patients were evaluated. We therefore considered the possibility that selection bias might have led to an overestimation of the incidence of late cardiac toxicity, since patients with preexisting cardiac disease might have been more likely to participate in the study. The base-line characteristics of the patients who participated were similar to those of the patients who did not, however, and therefore we do not believe that such bias existed. Furthermore, the patients studied in this series were probably at lower risk for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity than some other children who received doxorubicin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>34 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>35 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>36 </a></sup></u> No patient underwent mediastinal irradiation or received high doses of other cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, and patients who relapsed were excluded from the study.\n\n【66】This study could not address whether there is a safe cumulative dose of doxorubicin or a safe age for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin. Echocardiography at the completion of doxorubicin therapy appeared to be of value in predicting subsequent reductions in ventricular contractility. However, we did not identify measurements that predicted the more common finding of increased after-load. Certain recreational activities (such as weight-lifting 删除3:<u><sup><a>37 </a></sup></u> ) or medical interventions to accelerate somatic growth (such as growth hormone-replacement therapy 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> ) might result in rapid increases in afterload and thus need to be evaluated carefully in the light of their potential to cause adverse cardiac effects in this population.\n\n【67】Our results indicate that the treatment for a potentially fatal childhood cancer may cause another serious or even fatal disease. We found an unexpectedly high incidence of late cardiovascular abnormalities in children who received the anthracycline doxorubicin. The contribution of these agents to the cure of children with cancer must be balanced against the later effects of treatment and their influence on the quality of life of the patient.\n\n【68】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【69】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to the collaborating members of our acute lymphoblastic leukemia trials consortium and to Virginia Dalton, R.N., Mia Donnelly, Suzanne Mone, Kelly Strickland, Kristi Thomas, Denise Bryant, and Sharon Thornhill for technical assistance.</u>\n\n【70】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【71】参考删除-1:<u>From the Departments of Cardiology (S.E.L., S.D.C, S.P.S.) and Pathology (A.R.P.-A.) and the Division of Hematology/Oncology (S.E.S.), Children's Hospital; the Department of Pediatric Oncology (S.E.S.) and the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (R.D.G.), Dana–Farber Cancer Institute; the Departments of Pediatrics (S.E.L., S.D.C, R.D.G., S.E.S., S.P.S.) and Pathology (A.R.P.-A.), Harvard Medical School; and the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health (R.D.G.); all in Boston.

The Covid-19 crisis required that patients, clinicians, and staff stay home, so clinics throughout the United States had ramped up their telehealth practices. The federally qualified health center (FQHC) where I work had spent several weeks thoughtfully developing the workflows for video visits. I was eager to virtually see my patients — mostly elderly, Spanish-speaking, and low income — and be a part of the digital health revolution.\n\n【3】When I started, I thought there was a hierarchy in which in-person care was the gold standard, video visits were second, and telephone visits the method of last resort. But a year later, I don’t think of them as best, good, and OK. I see them as different — each ideal for different contexts. And just as people with visual impairment may have heightened use of their other senses, my year of telephone care during the Covid-19 pandemic has cultivated my capacity to connect with patients solely through sound.\n\n【4】It took only a day or two to discover the benefits of video communication. A patient called in to say he had run out of one of his pills. He lived alone and didn’t understand the labels on his pill bottles. Had he missed doses of his blood thinner or his vitamins? During our video visit, he showed me the empty bottle, and I was able to promptly identify the needed medication and arrange for home delivery.\n\n【5】But video was not the norm for my telehealth practice in 2020, for a simple reason: more often than not, it was problematic for my patients. Many of them had basic phone plans with restricted data for video calls. Others struggled to set up the video platform on their phone or to find a private space to speak openly with me about their health. We had set up the clinic to support video-conferencing technology, but the technology fell short of supporting patients with limited incomes, digital literacy, or housing.\n\n【6】The inequity in use of video technology for care during the Covid-19 pandemic is well documented: older, non-White, or uninsured patients were 40 to 60% less likely to use video visits than younger, White, or insured patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> It’s hard for patients to embrace digital health if their clinic does not have information-technology support or their clinicians don’t encourage them to try it. Aware of implicit bias, I told my patients about the public Wi-Fi program with outdoor access points on streetlight poles. I offered access to a language interpreter. I avoided reinforcing negative stereotypes in my notes (e.g., “patient declines video visit”). But despite such efforts, my patients were choosing telephone over video visits. I had to adapt and embrace this new reality. My patients needed to be heard.\n\n【7】 Best Practices for Active Listening during Telehealth Visits.\n\n【8】The first few months of telephone visits were punctuated by awkward pauses, but I gradually became more comfortable, even confident, with the silence. Since I was unable to look at or touch a patient, the only “data” I had were words and tone of voice. I became adept at active listening, listening for the intent and feeling in my patients’ voices. I paid attention to _how_ my patients were telling their stories. I realized I had more to learn, and I read about what communication researchers have described as best practices (see table ). 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【9】While the telephone visit helped me become a better listener, there were also benefits for my patients. When they couldn’t see my face or other visual distractions, some patients seemed more willing to confide in me about sensitive topics, such as drinking or smoking habits. Admittedly, on some telephone visits, I felt like I was on the other side of a virtual confessional wall. The flexible, on-the-go nature of a telephone visit also fit very well into my patients’ busy lives. Many of them, essential workers, would discreetly speak with me on their way to work or during a lunch break. During the summer and fall of 2020, I consistently had 0% no-shows for audio visits, because I was meeting my patients where they were.\n\n【10】My experience is consistent with data showing that telephone visits support high-quality care, particularly in primary care and community health settings. Since 2010, the Veterans Health Administration has incorporated scheduled telephone visits into their patient-centered medical home model to improve care access and efficiency, and such visits have proven beneficial when a physical exam is not required or when patients are anxious about facing a clinician. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> A survey of 43 FQHCs in California revealed that telephone visits during the pandemic increased access to care, reduced wait times, and in certain circumstances, offered quality of care comparable to that of video visits. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> More evidence is needed to understand the situations in which telephone visits can effectively support specialty care, as in my cardiology clinic.\n\n【11】As I return to in-person clinic visits in 2021, I’ve reflected on my audio-only experiences from the past year. I recently saw a woman in her 80s for follow-up for heart failure. In the 30 minutes we had together in clinic, most of the time was taken up by vital signs checks, medication reconciliation, and making sure she was wearing a properly fitted face mask. I recall thinking that just a few months ago when we had been on the phone together, I had immediately jumped into asking her about lilacs, her latest gardening project. Audio-only visits had provided a level of intimacy and candor that I realized I was losing “in person.” Yes, I was grateful to reconnect with her through the physical exam, but my laser focus on her story was slipping away. Was I actually nostalgic for the telephone visit?\n\n【12】Practicing medicine during a pandemic has indelibly changed my attitude toward audio-only communication. I now see the telephone as a useful tool for person-centered care. I offer my patients the option of telephone follow-up visits, and I look forward to the moments when I can chat with them on the phone between scheduled appointments. Audio-only care keeps me mindful of the humanity of medicine.\n\n【13】Outside the field of medicine, there is growing recognition of the profound personal connections that can be nurtured in audio-only environments. The cofounder of Clubhouse, a popular voice-only social media app, has said, “Voice adds texture and fidelity to conversations that can be lacking in other venues. The intonation, inflection, and emotion that are conveyed through voice allow people to pick up on nuance and empathize with each other.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> As a safety-net clinician, I couldn’t agree more. During a year marked by inequity and isolation, I learned how to listen and provide equitable and empathic care, thanks to the low-tech telephone.\n\n【14】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the author are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on August 7, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>From Fair Oaks Health Center, Redwood City, and Google Health, Palo Alto — both in California.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 96KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

(10:47) Download\n\n【4】In his 2019 State of the Union address, President Donald Trump announced a new initiative with the ambitious goal of reducing HIV transmission in the United States by 90% within 10 years, in part by focusing on the burden of disease in rural America. The Department of Health and Human Services has outlined several steps for achieving this goal but hasn’t focused on the role of injection-drug use in HIV transmission.\n\n【5】Ever since the 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Scott County, Indiana, it has been clear that the sharing of syringes among people who inject drugs is fueling the spread of these diseases in rural America. After intense resistance, then-Governor of Indiana Mike Pence declared a public health emergency in response to the outbreak and authorized a temporary syringe-exchange program. The program was successful, with 277 enrollees and more than 90,000 syringes distributed and returned between April and October 2015, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> and the number of new HIV infections decreased. The Scott County outbreak was a wake-up call for advocates, epidemiologists, policymakers, and program administrators throughout the United States. Never before had the country seen such a swift outbreak of HIV in a rural community.\n\n【6】Soon after the outbreak ended, Congress overturned a long-standing ban on using federal funding to support syringe-exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) then released a report identifying the 220 rural counties in the United States that were most vulnerable to HIV and HCV outbreaks among people who inject drugs. The director of the CDC at the time, Tom Frieden, called the sharing of unsterile syringes a “horrifyingly efficient route for spreading HIV, hepatitis, and other infections” and called for states to implement more syringe-exchange programs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】 U.S. Counties’ Vulnerability to HIV and HCV Outbreaks and Their Syringe-Exchange Program (SEP) Status.\n\n【8】Data are as of 2018 and are from the CDC and the North American Syringe Exchange Network.\n\n【9】The aftermath of the Scott County outbreak presented an opportunity for a transformative change in the use of harm-reduction interventions in rural America, as syringe-exchange programs regained prominence as cost-effective tools for reducing the spread of HIV and HCV in the midst of rising rates of injection-drug use. We examined the adoption of syringe-exchange programs in the 220 counties identified in the CDC report, using publicly available data from the North American Syringe Exchange Network and state departments of health. Our analysis revealed that less than a quarter of these vulnerable counties (47 of 220) were operating syringe-exchange programs in 2018 (see map ). The outbreak in Scott County may have been a warning sign, but the message hasn’t been heeded in many parts of the country.\n\n【10】This tepid response is not attributable to a lack of evidence. Syringe-exchange programs have existed for decades in the United States. Such programs were originally pioneered by people who inject drugs and were later adopted as a public health intervention in the midst of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A 2014 meta-analysis of 12 studies found convincing evidence that needle- and syringe-exchange programs are associated with reductions in HIV transmission, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and a 2017 Cochrane review suggested that a combination of syringe-exchange programs and opioid-substitution therapy could reduce the risk of HCV transmission among people who inject drugs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Along with the CDC, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine), and the World Health Organization all support syringe-exchange programs as important interventions that reduce the spread of infectious disease and can serve as gateways to obtaining naloxone, opioid-substitution therapy, HIV and HCV testing and treatment, and other medical care.\n\n【11】Yet stigma has remained a critical barrier. In the midst of a devastating public health crisis, large regions of the country are locked in an ideological battle about the morality of harm reduction. Although a 2007 systematic review by the Institute of Medicine found no evidence that syringe-exchange programs increase the frequency of injection-drug use, expand substance-use networks, or facilitate local crime, fears remain widespread that harm-reduction programs will promote drug use and threaten the existing social order. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> These concerns have had profound consequences: only 21 states have explicitly authorized syringe-exchange programs.\n\n【12】Even states that have authorized harm-reduction approaches have struggled to implement specific programs. Virginia passed a law in 2017 granting certain counties the ability to operate syringe-exchange programs, but it required public health officials to obtain formal consent from local law-enforcement officers because the legislation did not exempt participants from drug-paraphernalia laws. In essence, the law asked police to turn a blind eye to syringe-exchange programs since possession of syringes was still illegal under existing statutes. Unsurprisingly, only three districts have been able to build enough local consensus to move forward.\n\n【13】Kentucky passed legislation in 2015 authorizing syringe-exchange programs and is now a national leader in this area, with more than 50 programs operating statewide. Yet of the state’s 54 counties classified as most vulnerable by the CDC, only half have such a program. Kentucky’s legislation also mandates that all programs restrict exchanges to “one-to-one” interventions, meaning that only one clean syringe can be distributed for each dirty syringe returned. Such restrictions may limit the effect of exchange programs on the spread of infectious disease. More liberal strategies allow multiple or unlimited syringes to be dispensed, regardless of the number of syringes returned.\n\n【14】To be clear, syringe-exchange programs are just one component of a continuum of harm-reduction services and by themselves are not enough to prevent transmission of infectious disease or overdoses. Such programs can be offered in conjunction with other interventions, such as opioid-substitution therapy and naloxone distribution. Access to opioid-substitution therapy also remains an important concern in rural areas. For example, we found that less than 60% of the counties most vulnerable to HIV and HCV outbreaks (127 of 220) had a buprenorphine prescriber in 2018, according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration registries.\n\n【15】Lack of access to opioid-substitution therapy in these areas is probably rooted in the same stigma that limits implementation of syringe-exchange programs. In addition to obtaining a waiver and prescribing buprenorphine (which all physicians can consider doing), distributing naloxone widely, and advocating for our patients’ basic needs, health professionals can confront stigma and support the expansion of harm-reduction approaches in several ways.\n\n【16】At the local level, clinicians can partner with people who inject drugs, listen to their experiences, and engage stakeholders — including mayors, police, and faith leaders — to offer education about harm reduction and address concerns. At the state level, they can advocate for laws that authorize comprehensive syringe-exchange programs, decriminalize possession of syringes and residual substances, and guarantee access to over-the-counter syringes without a prescription. At the national level, clinicians can encourage their elected representatives to support harm reduction as a core component of the country’s public health strategy. Just as Surgeon General Jerome Adams called for more people to carry naloxone, he could call on state leaders to ensure that syringe-exchange programs and opioid-substitution therapy are available in all counties nationwide.\n\n【17】Finally, once these programs are authorized, clinicians can establish direct connections between syringe-exchange programs and health systems to ensure that people with addiction receive the care they need and are treated with dignity.\n\n【18】Four years after the United States received a wake-up call about the importance of harm reduction, the most vulnerable areas of the country remain asleep. Despite the federal government’s goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the United States, it’s not clear that it will do what is necessary to address the spread of HIV and HCV in rural America.

The risk ranged from 2.4 percent among children with simple febrile convulsions to 6 to 8 percent among children with a single complex feature — i.e., focal or prolonged seizures or repeated episodes of febrile convulsions with the same illness. For children with any two of the complex features, the risk was 17 to 22 percent, and for those with all three features, 49 percent. The occurrence of subsequent partial unprovoked seizures was strongly associated with all three of the complex features, whereas the occurrence of subsequent unprovoked seizures of generalized onset was associated with the number of febrile convulsions and a family history of unprovoked seizures.\n\n【3】These results are consistent with the view that the increased risk of generalized-onset unprovoked seizures reflects a predisposition to both simple febrile convulsions and generalized-onset unprovoked seizures. The association between complex febrile convulsions and partial seizures, on the other hand, may reflect either a causal association or the presence of preexisting brain disease that is responsible for both the complex febrile seizures and later partial seizures. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1987; 316:493–8.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Patients were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, within 12 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion to receive endovascular thrombectomy or best medical care (control). The primary outcome was good functional status, defined as a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]), at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2, distribution across the modified Rankin scale score categories, and quality of life. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 24 to 72 hours, 90-day mortality, and procedural complications.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】Of the 507 patients who underwent screening, 340 were in the intention-to-treat population, with 226 assigned to the thrombectomy group and 114 to the control group. Intravenous thrombolysis was used in 31% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and in 34% of those in the control group. Good functional status at 90 days occurred in 104 patients (46%) in the thrombectomy group and in 26 (23%) in the control group (adjusted rate ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.46 to 2.91, P<0.001). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 12 patients (5%) in the thrombectomy group and in none in the control group. Results for the secondary clinical and imaging outcomes were generally in the same direction as those for the primary outcome. Mortality at 90 days was 37% in the thrombectomy group and 55% in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82). Procedural complications occurred in 14% of the patients in the thrombectomy group, including one death due to arterial perforation.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】In a trial involving Chinese patients with basilar-artery occlusion, approximately one third of whom received intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy within 12 hours after stroke onset led to better functional outcomes at 90 days than best medical care but was associated with procedural complications and intracerebral hemorrhage. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Program for Innovative Research Team of the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC and others; ATTENTION ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04751708 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nEndovascular Treatment of Acute Basilar-Artery Occlusion  \n_02:20_\n\n【13】Among patients with basilar-artery occlusion who present with moderate-to-severe clinical findings, up to 80% die or remain with severe disability despite best medical care. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> Endovascular thrombectomy has become a standard treatment for acute large-vessel-occlusion strokes involving the anterior circulation within certain time constraints. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5 </a></sup></u> However, there is limited evidence to support the use of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute basilar-artery occlusion.\n\n【14】Two randomized trials, the Endovascular Treatment versus Standard Medical Treatment for Vertebrobasilar Artery Occlusion (BEST) trial and the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS), investigated the safety and efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with basilar-artery occlusion. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> Despite numerical differences in favor of endovascular thrombectomy, these trials did not show the superiority of endovascular thrombectomy plus best medical care over best medical care alone. However, there were high rates of crossovers in the BEST trial and a lack of consecutive enrollment in BASICS, which limited the certainty of their results. Previous observational studies and meta-analyses have also shown mixed results regarding the association of endovascular thrombectomy and clinical outcomes in patients with basilar-artery occlusion. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3,8-13 </a></sup></u> We undertook the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar-Artery Occlusion (ATTENTION) trial to investigate whether endovascular thrombectomy added to best medical care would be superior to best medical care alone in patients with acute stroke due to basilar-artery occlusion who presented within 12 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【17】We conducted this investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label trial at 36 centers in China 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)</u>. The trial protocol , available at NEJM.org, was approved by the medical ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China and all relevant local ethics committees. Written informed consent was obtained before randomization from all the patients or their legal representatives. The trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as amended. Details of the trial rationale, design, and methods are provided in the protocol.\n\n【18】The steering committee designed the trial and oversaw its conduct and the data analysis. An independent data and safety monitoring board was responsible for the safety, ethics, and oversight of the trial. An independent clinical research organization (JetMed) was involved in monitoring trial quality. An independent clinical-event adjudication committee, whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments, adjudicated the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. An independent adverse-events committee assessed adverse events, procedural-related complications, and serious adverse events. All the images were assessed in a blinded manner by a central imaging laboratory. An independent statistician was responsible for the statistical analysis. The methods of this trial have been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】The trial was funded by the Program for Innovative Research Team of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China, the Beijing Dingyi Foundation (China Special Fund for Stroke Prevention and Treatment), and the Beijing Healthunion Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease Prevention and Treatment Foundation. These entities were not involved in the design or conduct of the trial or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Members of the executive committee collected the data and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author, and all the authors contributed to critical review of the manuscript. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the presented data, for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, and for the accurate reporting of adverse events.\n\n【20】Patients and Participating Centers\n----------------------------------\n\n【21】Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 years of age or older and had had a moderate-to-severe acute ischemic stroke consistent with basilar-artery occlusion. A moderate-to-severe acute ischemic stroke was defined by a score of 10 or higher on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; range, 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater neurologic deficits) at the time of neuroimaging. Basilar-artery occlusion was confirmed on computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography within 12 hours after the estimated time of stroke onset. The estimated time at which occlusion occurred was defined as the time of sudden onset of basilar-artery stroke symptoms, with no consideration of any preceding minor prodromal symptoms, as adjudicated by two neurologists. For patients whose stroke was evident on awakening or who had an unwitnessed time of stroke onset because of unconsciousness, a 12-hour time window was calculated from the time at which the patient was last seen to be well. Imaging to determine whether a patient fulfilled the enrollment criteria was done mostly at the trial hospitals, even if imaging had been previously performed at another institution. Patients who had basilar-artery occlusion that was observed at a referring hospital but who were found to have a patent artery at the trial hospital were not enrolled.\n\n【22】Patients were excluded if they had prestroke score, assessed retrospectively, of at least 3 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 to 6, with a score of 0 indicating no disability, 1 no clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability, 3 moderate disability but remaining able to walk unassisted, 4 moderately severe disability, 5 severe disability, and 6 death) among those younger than 80 years of age or a modified Rankin scale score of at least 1 among those 80 years of age or older; if they had intracranial hemorrhage on neuroimaging; or if they had a posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (PC-ASPECTS) of less than 6 points among patients younger than 80 years of age and of less than 8 points among those 80 years of age or older. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> The PC-ASPECTS is a 10-point imaging scoring system to quantify early ischemic changes in the posterior circulation territory, with a score of 10 indicating normal appearance and 1 point subtracted for each abnormal region on noncontrast CT or CTA source images or on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (with lower scores indicating a larger territory of ischemic change). The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the protocol.\n\n【23】Centers were eligible to participate in the trial if more than 100 endovascular thrombectomy procedures for acute ischemic stroke had been completed there in the year 2020, if the center had a mean time of less than 60 minutes from hospital arrival to the start of intravenous thrombolysis, and if the center had a time of less than 90 minutes from hospital arrival to arterial puncture. Interventional operators must have had more than 5 years of experience in cerebrovascular interventional therapy and must have independently completed more than 80 thrombectomy procedures. The number of endovascular procedures that were performed in 2021 and the number of beds in each center are listed in Table S1.\n\n【24】Participating centers were instructed to keep a screening log of all the patients who presented with suspected basilar-artery occlusion and were thought to potentially qualify for the trial. Centers were instructed to specify patients who were eligible to participate in the trial but were not enrolled, as well as those who were not eligible to participate after additional screening.\n\n【25】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【26】Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to undergo endovascular thrombectomy and receive best medical care (thrombectomy group) or to receive best medical care alone (control group). Randomization was performed as soon as possible after the occlusion of the basilar artery had been confirmed on imaging at trial hospitals and written informed consent for trial participation had been obtained. Owing to the nature of the intervention, treatment assignments were not concealed from patients or the treating team. The randomization procedure was Web-based on mobile devices or webpage platforms.\n\n【27】Treatments\n----------\n\n【28】Patients in each treatment group received what was considered to be best medical care, including intravenous thrombolytic agents, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulation, or combinations of these treatments according to national and institutional guidelines. The standard care for acute basilar-artery occlusion in China is that patients arriving at a hospital within 4.5 hours after stroke onset receive intravenous thrombolysis. Most patients were required to pay for the thrombolytic drugs in advance, and some were eligible for reimbursement from government insurance. The strategies that were used for endovascular treatment included stent retrievers, thromboaspiration, balloon angioplasty, stent deployment, intraarterial thrombolysis (with alteplase or urokinase), or combinations of these approaches that were left to the discretion of the treating team.\n\n【29】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【30】The primary outcome was good functional status, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3, at 90 days (within a window of ±14 days). Secondary efficacy outcomes included excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2, at 90 days (window, ±14 days); the distribution of modified Rankin scale scores toward a better outcome at 90 days (window, ±14 days); the NIHSS score at 24 to 72 hours and at 5 to 7 days or discharge (whichever came first); the score on the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) patient-reported questionnaire (range, −0.39 to 1, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life); and the Barthel Index (dichotomized as 0 to 94 vs. 95 to 100, with a score of 95 to 100 indicating no interference with daily activities). 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> The modified Rankin scale scores at 90 days were obtained by means of a structured telephone interview that was performed by local certified neurologists or nurses who were unaware of the trial-group assignments.\n\n【31】Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to the modified Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke–Monitoring Study (SITS-MOST) criteria, defined as local or remote parenchymal hemorrhage type 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage that led to death or was observed on an imaging scan obtained 24 to 72 hours after treatment, combined with a neurologic deterioration of at least 4 points from baseline on the NIHSS or from the lowest NIHSS score between baseline and 24 hours, or death from any cause within 90 days (window, ±14 days). 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> Imaging outcomes included intracranial hemorrhage according to the Heidelberg classification and recanalization on CTA or MRA at 24 to 72 hours (modified Arterial Occlusive Lesion score of 2 to 3, on a scale from 0 \\[no recanalization\\] to 3 \\[complete recanalization\\]). 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【32】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【33】On the basis of BEST trial, we originally calculated that the enrollment of 192 patients would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a between-group difference of 20 percentage points in the percentage of patients with good functional status at 90 days (primary outcome; 25% in the control group vs. 45% in thrombectomy group) at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> After the results of BASICS became available, the steering committee revised the sample size to 342 on the basis of the combined results of the BEST and BASICS trials (new estimate, 25% in the control group vs. 40% in thrombectomy group, with a 15-percentage-point difference), 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> with allowance for 5% of the patients to be lost to follow-up or have data that could not be evaluated.\n\n【34】The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who provided informed consent and underwent randomization. Supportive analyses of the primary outcome were performed in the per-protocol population, which excluded patients who did not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria or who crossed over to the other treatment group.\n\n【35】We compared the results for the primary, secondary, and safety outcomes between patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy and those receiving best medical care in multivariable logistic and linear regressions with adjustment for age, modified Rankin scale score before the stroke, time from stroke onset to randomization, and baseline stroke severity (NIHSS score). Adjusted rate ratios or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were reported for dichotomous outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> The shift of the modified Rankin scale scores toward a better functional outcome was estimated with an ordinal logistic-regression model after verification of the proportional-odds assumption by the Brant test. For the comparison of the two treatment groups with respect to the secondary outcomes of the NIHSS and EQ-5D-5L scores at 90 days (modeled as continuous variables), linear regression was used to calculate the beta coefficient. Subgroup analyses were prespecified for the primary outcome according to sex (male or female), age (<70 years or ≥70 years and <80 years or ≥80 years), baseline stroke severity (NIHSS score 10 to 19 or ≥20), time from the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion to randomization (<6 hours or ≥6 hours), intravenous thrombolysis (no or yes), location of basilar-artery occlusion (proximal, middle, or distal), the presumed cause of the basilar-artery occlusion (large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, or undetermined and other determined cause), intracranial atherosclerotic disease as cause of stroke (yes or no), and PC-ASPECTS at baseline (<8 or ≥8).\n\n【36】Because the statistical plan did not include a provision for the correction of the widths of confidence intervals for multiple comparisons, no definite conclusions can be drawn from secondary-outcome results or subgroup analyses. No imputations for missing data were performed. All the analyses were performed with the use of Stata software, version 17.0 (StataCorp).\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】Patients\n--------\n\n【39】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Randomization and Treatment of the Patients.\n\n【40】Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to undergo endovascular treatment plus receive best medical care (thrombectomy group) or to receive best medical care alone (control group). Patients were required to have a score on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 \\[no symptoms\\] to 6 \\[death\\]) of less than 3 if they were younger than 80 years of age or a score of 0 if they were 80 years of age or older. Patients were required to have a posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (PC-ASPECTS) on noncontrast CT or CT angiographic source images or on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of less than 6 if they were younger than 80 years of age or of less than 8 if they were 80 years of age or older. PC-ASPECTS is a 10-point imaging scoring system to quantify early ischemic changes in the posterior circulation territory, with a score of 10 indicating normal appearance and 1 point subtracted for each abnormal region (with lower scores indicating a larger territory of ischemic change).\n\n【41】From February 21, 2021, through January 3, 2022, a total of 507 patients were assessed for participation in the trial, of whom 141 did not meet the eligibility criteria (5 patients had a spontaneous recanalization before randomization) and 24 declined to participate. The remaining 342 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group; 228 to the thrombectomy group and 114 to the control group 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The legal representatives of 2 patients who had been assigned to the thrombectomy group withdrew their consent, so 340 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n【42】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【43】The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups, as shown in Table 1 and Table S2; these tables also show data on additional procedural characteristics and workflow measures. The representativeness of the enrolled patients is summarized in Table S3. Intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 31% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and in 34% of those in the control group. Details of the endovascular thrombectomy procedures are described in Table S4. The mean age of the patients was 66 years in the thrombectomy group and 67 years in the control group. The median estimated time from basilar-artery occlusion to randomization was 5.1 hours in the thrombectomy group and 4.9 hours in the control group. The median NIHSS score at the time of the baseline examination at the trial hospital was 24 in each group. The median PC-ASPECTS was 9 in the thrombectomy group and 10 in the control group. A total of 183 patients completed neuroimaging within less than 4.5 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion; of these, 103 patients (56%) received intravenous thrombolysis, and the percentages were similar in the two trial groups.\n\n【44】Six patients (3 in the thrombectomy group and 3 in the control group) crossed over to receive the other therapy. Two patients in the thrombectomy group underwent diagnostic angiography only, owing to complete recanalization after intravenous thrombolysis. Therefore, 221 patients in the thrombectomy group underwent endovascular thrombectomy. General anesthesia was used in 124 of 223 patients (56%). A total of 40% of the patients underwent additional intracranial angioplasty or stenting, and 8% underwent extracranial angioplasty or stenting.\n\n【45】The clinical event-adjudication committee and imaging-evaluation committee excluded 12 patients from the per-protocol analysis, including the 6 patients who crossed over to the other group, 2 who underwent randomization more than 12 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion, 2 who had a PC-ASPECTS of less than 6 points, 1 who had a PC-ASPECTS of less than 8 points and was older than 80 years of age, and 1 in whom the basilar artery was considered to be occluded by the treating team but was found to be critically stenotic by the imaging core laboratory 删除2:<u>(Table S5)</u>. No patients were lost to follow-up or had data missing for main baseline covariates and primary outcome.\n\n【46】Primary and Secondary Outcomes\n------------------------------\n\n【47】Table 2. Table 2. Outcomes According to Assigned Treatment Group. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Distribution of Functional Outcomes at 90 Days in the Intention-to-Treat Population.\n\n【48】Shown are scores on the modified Rankin scale for the patients in the two treatment groups. The intention-to-treat population included all the patients who provided informed consent and underwent randomization. No patients were lost to follow-up. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically significant disability, 2 slight disability (patients are able to look after their own affairs without assistance but are unable to carry out all previous activities), 3 moderate disability (patients require some help but are able to walk unassisted), 4 moderately severe disability (patients are unable to attend to bodily needs without assistance and are unable to walk unassisted), 5 severe disability (patients require constant nursing care and attention), and 6 death. The adjusted common odds ratio for the modified Rankin scale score toward a better outcome with endovascular thrombectomy at 90 days was 2.87 (95% CI, 1.84 to 4.47).\n\n【49】Good functional status at 90 days (modified Rankin scale score, 0 to 3; the primary outcome) was observed in 46% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and in 23% of those in the control group (adjusted rate ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.46 to 2.91; P<0.001) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. (Unadjusted values for primary and secondary outcomes are provided in Table S6.) In the ordinal logistic-regression model to account for the shift in distribution in the modified Rankin scale score, the adjusted common odds ratio for the modified Rankin scale score toward a better outcome with endovascular thrombectomy at 90 days was 2.87 (95% CI, 1.84 to 4.47) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. A total of 75 patients (33%) in the thrombectomy group and 12 (11%) in the control group had excellent functional status (modified Rankin scale score, 0 to 2) at 90 days (adjusted rate ratio, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.84 to 5.46). Secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as the primary outcome, but rate ratios were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and no definite conclusions can be drawn from these results. Patency of the basilar artery at 24 to 72 hours as assessed on CTA or MRA was observed in 91% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and in 38% of those in the control group 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Other secondary clinical and imaging outcomes are shown in Table 2 .\n\n【50】Safety\n------\n\n【51】A total of 37% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and 55% of those in the control group died within 90 days (adjusted risk ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 24 to 72 hours occurred in 12 patients (5%) in the thrombectomy group and in none of the patients in the control group. There were 32 procedural complications (in 14% of the patients in the thrombectomy group) including 6 arterial dissections and 5 vessel perforations. One patient with arterial perforation died on the day after the procedure. Other adverse events are described in Table S7, and causes of death are summarized in Table S8.\n\n【52】Subgroup and Per-Protocol Analyses\n----------------------------------\n\n【53】Figure 3.  Figure 3. Subgroup Analyses of a Modified Rankin Scale Score of 0 to 3 at 90 Days (Primary Outcome).\n\n【54】Scores on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater neurologic deficits. The trial was not powered and had no prespecified correction for multiple comparisons for a definitive analysis of subgroups.\n\n【55】The results of the subgroup analyses for the primary outcome are shown in Figure 3 . In the per-protocol population, the characteristics of the patients were similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S9)</u>, and the results of the analyses in the per-protocol population were generally in the same direction as those of the main analyses for the primary, secondary, and safety outcomes 删除2:<u>(Table S10 and Figs. S2 and S3)</u>.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】In this trial involving patients with moderate or severe stroke due to basilar-artery occlusion who were randomly assigned to undergo endovascular thrombectomy or receive best medical care within 12 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion, the percentage of patients with a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3 (good functional status) at 90 days was higher in the thrombectomy group than in the control group. Secondary outcomes generally favored the thrombectomy group, but these results were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Mortality at 90 days was 37% in the thrombectomy group and 55% in the control group. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 5% of the patients in the thrombectomy group and in none of the patients in the control group, and procedural complications, including one fatal arterial perforation, occurred in 14% of the patients in the thrombectomy group.\n\n【58】The ATTENTION registry that preceded this trial showed that the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy was modified by the NIHSS score at baseline. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> This finding is consistent with data from both the BASICS registry and the BASICS trial, as well as from several anterior circulation trials suggesting that thrombectomy might not be beneficial in patients presenting with mild stroke. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,7,20,21 </a></sup></u> Therefore, the steering committee decided that only patients with acute basilar-artery occlusion and an NIHSS score of at least 10 should be enrolled in this trial. Given the potential interaction between age and stroke burden with the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy, 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> we also opted for different thresholds for the baseline PC-ASPECTS and the prestroke modified Rankin scale score in patients younger than 80 years of age and those 80 years of age or older. Given the anticipated poor prognosis from basilar-artery occlusion, a range of 0 to 3 in the modified Rankin scale score (with a score of 3 indicating moderate disability requiring assistance but retaining an ability to walk) rather than a range of 0 to 2 was used as the primary outcome, which is the same as the outcome chosen in the BEST and BASICS trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7</a></sup></u>\n\n【59】The percentages of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after endovascular thrombectomy of basilar-artery occlusion are relatively consistent across trials (approximately 4 to 8%) 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,7 </a></sup></u> ; the percentage has been approximately 4% in anterior circulation trials of endovascular treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> However, most trials have shown no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages in patients with basilar-artery occlusion who did not undergo thrombectomy, and so the percentage is lower than for anterior circulation stroke. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,6,7 </a></sup></u> This situation suggests that the added risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with thrombectomy may be higher among patients with basilar-artery occlusion than among those with anterior circulation strokes. In our trial, intracranial hemorrhage occurred in approximately 5% of the patients who underwent thrombectomy, and no patient in the control group had intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【60】Limitations of our trial include the exclusive enrollment of Chinese patients, who have a high prevalence of intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis, and our results may not be generalizable to Western countries. The cause of stroke was large-artery atherosclerosis in approximately 44% of the patients in the trial, which led to high rates of intracranial or extracranial angioplasty or stenting. Angioplasty and stenting are technically demanding procedures and may be associated with higher complication rates than mechanical thrombectomy alone. Our results are not generalizable to patients with milder stroke (NIHSS score, <10) or to those who present beyond 12 hours after the estimated time of basilar-artery occlusion. The Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular (BAOCHE) trial, the results of which are published in this issue of the _Journal_ 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> assessed the efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy 6 to 24 hours after basilar-artery occlusion and may provide information about the effect of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with longer times to hospital arrival than were included in our trial. Approximately one third of the patients in each group in our trial received intravenous thrombolysis, as compared with approximately 80% of the patients in BASICS, which may have disadvantaged the control group in our trial. This difference may be related to the fact that during the first 4 years of recruitment, BASICS required all patients to be eligible for intravenous thrombolysis. Furthermore, that trial used a 6-hour time window for intravenous thrombolysis, as compared with the 12-hour window that was used in ATTENTION. Finally, most patients in China are required to pay in advance for intravenous thrombolysis, and this disincentive, although similarly present in the two trial groups, may have led to the relatively low use of intravenous thrombolysis and contributed to a poorer outcome in the control group. However, despite more than three quarters of the patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis in BASICS, a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 3 was observed in essentially the same percentage of patients in the medical care group in that trial as in our trial.\n\n【61】Among patients with moderate or severe stroke symptoms who presented within 12 hours after basilar-artery occlusion, approximately one third of whom received intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy was superior to best medical care alone with respect to good functional status at 90 days. However, endovascular thrombectomy was associated with more intracerebral hemorrhages and with procedural complications.\n\n【62】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the Program for Innovative Research Team of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China, the Beijing Dingyi Foundation (China Special Fund for Stroke Prevention and Treatment), and the Beijing Healthunion Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease Prevention and Treatment Foundation.</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Drs.

From December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021, the participants completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing by providing mid-turbinate nasal swabs for qualitative and quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The formula for calculating vaccine effectiveness was 100%×(1−hazard ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), with adjustments for the propensity to be vaccinated, study site, occupation, and local viral circulation.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 participants (5%), of whom 5 were fully vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2), 11 partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2), and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1) were excluded. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 91% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 76 to 97) with full vaccination and 81% (95% CI, 64 to 90) with partial vaccination. Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mean viral RNA load was 40% lower (95% CI, 16 to 57) in partially or fully vaccinated participants than in unvaccinated participants. In addition, the risk of febrile symptoms was 58% lower (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.98) and the duration of illness was shorter, with 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7).\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world conditions, and the vaccines attenuated the viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had breakthrough infection despite vaccination. 删除2:<u>(Funded by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】The two-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) were shown to be highly effective in preventing symptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 efficacy trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> Recently, we reported interim estimates of the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world conditions, which showed benefits similar to those observed in the efficacy trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Less is known about the potentially important secondary benefits of mRNA vaccines, including possible reductions in the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), viral RNA load, and duration of viral RNA detection.\n\n【12】In conducting a prospective cohort study involving health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers in six U.S. states, we had three aims. First, we estimated the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with partial and full vaccination, with adjustments for the propensity to be vaccinated and local viral circulation. Second, among participants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared the mean viral RNA load in participants who were partially or fully vaccinated with the level in participants who were unvaccinated. Third, among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we compared the frequency of febrile symptoms and the duration of illness in partially or fully vaccinated participants with those outcomes in unvaccinated participants.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Population\n----------------\n\n【15】The HEROES-RECOVER network includes prospective cohorts from two studies: HEROES (the Arizona Healthcare, Emergency Response, and Other Essential Workers Surveillance Study) and RECOVER (Research on the Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Essential Response Personnel). The network was initiated in July 2020 and has a shared protocol, described previously and outlined in the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Participants were enrolled in six U.S. states: Arizona (Phoenix, Tucson, and other areas), Florida (Miami), Minnesota (Duluth), Oregon (Portland), Texas (Temple), and Utah (Salt Lake City). To minimize potential selection biases, recruitment of participants was stratified according to site, sex, age group, and occupation. The data for this analysis were collected from December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021. All participants provided written informed consent. The individual protocols for the RECOVER study and the HEROES study were reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at participating sites or under a reliance agreement.\n\n【16】Participant-Reported Outcome Measures\n-------------------------------------\n\n【17】Sociodemographic and health characteristics were reported by the participants in electronic surveys completed at enrollment. Each month, participants reported their potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and their use of face masks and other employer-recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) according to four measures: hours of close contact with (within 3 feet \\[1 m\\] of) others at work (coworkers, customers, patients, or the public) in the previous 7 days; the percentage of time using PPE during those hours of close contact at work; hours of close contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19 at work, at home, or in the community in the previous 7 days; and the percentage of time using PPE during those hours of close contact with the virus.\n\n【18】Active surveillance for symptoms associated with Covid-19 — defined as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle aches, or a change in smell or taste — was conducted through weekly text messages, emails, and reports obtained directly from the participant or from medical records. When a Covid-19–like illness was identified, participants completed electronic surveys at the beginning and end of the illness to indicate the date of symptom onset, symptoms, temperatures, the number of days spent sick in bed for at least half the day, the receipt of medical care, and the last day of symptoms. Febrile symptoms associated with Covid-19 were defined as fever, feverishness, chills, or a measured temperature higher than 38°C.\n\n【19】Laboratory Methods\n------------------\n\n【20】Participants provided a mid-turbinate nasal swab weekly, regardless of whether they had symptoms associated with Covid-19, and provided an additional nasal swab and saliva specimen at the onset of a Covid-19–like illness. Supplies and instructions for participants were standardized across sites. Specimens were shipped on weekdays on cold packs and were tested by means of qualitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute (Marshfield, WI). Quantitative RT-PCR assays were conducted at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (Madison, WI). SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing was conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in accordance with previously published protocols, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> for viruses detected in 22 participants who were infected at least 7 days after vaccine dose 1 (through March 3, 2021), as well as for viruses detected in 3 or 4 unvaccinated participants matched to each of those 22 participants in terms of site and testing date, as available (71 total matched participants). Viral lineages were categorized as variants of concern, variants of interest, or other. We compared the percentage of variants of concern (excluding variants of interest) in participants who were at least partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1) with the percentage in participants who were unvaccinated.\n\n【21】Vaccination Status\n------------------\n\n【22】Covid-19 vaccination status was reported by the participants in electronic and telephone surveys and through direct upload of images of vaccination cards. In addition, data from electronic medical records, occupational health records, or state immunization registries were reviewed at the sites in Minnesota, Oregon, Texas, and Utah. At the time of specimen collection, participants were considered to be fully vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2), partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 1 and <14 days after dose 2), or unvaccinated or to have indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1).\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【24】The primary outcome was the time to RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated participants as compared with unvaccinated participants. Secondary outcomes included the viral RNA load, frequency of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【25】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Participants According to SARS-CoV-2 Test Results and Vaccination Status.\n\n【26】The effectiveness of mRNA vaccines was estimated for full vaccination and partial vaccination. Participants with indeterminate vaccination status were excluded from the analysis. Hazard ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated participants as compared with unvaccinated participants were estimated with the Andersen–Gill extension of the Cox proportional hazards model, which accounted for time-varying vaccination status. Unadjusted vaccine effectiveness was calculated with the following formula: 100%×(1−hazard ratio). An adjusted vaccine effectiveness model accounted for potential confounding in vaccination status with the use of an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Generalized boosted regression trees were used to estimate individual propensities to be at least partially vaccinated during each study week, on the basis of baseline sociodemographic and health characteristics and the most recent reports of potential virus exposure and PPE use 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Predicted propensities were then used to calculate stabilized weights. Cox proportional hazards models incorporated these stabilized weights, as well as covariates for site, occupation, and a daily indicator of local viral circulation, which was the percentage positive of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in the local county 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1)</u>. A sensitivity analysis removed person-days when participants had possible misclassification of vaccination status or infection or when the local viral circulation fell below 3%.\n\n【27】Because there was a relatively small number of breakthrough infections, for the evaluation of possible attenuation effects of vaccination, participants with RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were partially vaccinated and those who were fully vaccinated were combined into a single vaccinated group, and results for this group were compared with results for participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were unvaccinated. Means for the highest viral RNA load measured during infection were compared with the use of a Poisson model adjusted for days from symptom onset to specimen collection and for days with the specimen in transit to the laboratory. Dichotomous outcomes were compared with the use of binary log-logistic regression for the calculation of relative risks. Means for the duration of illness were compared with the use of Student’s t-test under the assumption of unequal variances. All analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R software, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n\n【28】Results\n-------\n\n【29】Participant Characteristics\n---------------------------\n\n【30】After the exclusion of 1147 participants who had laboratory documentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection before the start of the study period, the study sample consisted of 3975 participants 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. Approximately half the participants (51%) were from the three study sites in Arizona 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Most participants were female (62%), 18 to 49 years of age (72%), White (86%), and non-Hispanic (83%) and had no chronic medical conditions (69%). The participants included primary health care providers (20%), such as physicians and other clinical leads; nurses and other allied health care personnel (33%); first responders (21%); and other essential and frontline workers (26%). Over the 17-week study period, adherence to weekly surveillance reporting and specimen collection was high (median, 100%; interquartile range, 82 to 100).\n\n【31】Vaccination\n-----------\n\n【32】A total of 3179 participants (80%) had received at least one dose of an authorized mRNA vaccine by April 10, 2021 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>, and 2686 of those participants (84%) had received both recommended doses. Of the vaccine products administered, 67% were the BNT162b2 vaccine, 33% were the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and less than 1% were an unspecified mRNA vaccine. Because only 39 participants received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & Johnson–Janssen), results for those participants could not be compared with results for participants who received the mRNA vaccines; therefore, person-time for those 39 participants was censored at vaccination, and they contributed only person-time associated with unvaccinated status. Participants most likely to have received at least one vaccine dose were located in Minnesota or Oregon, female, 50 years of age or older, White, non-Hispanic, or health care personnel or had at least one chronic medical condition. The mean number of hours of close contact with someone suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19 was lower and the percentage of time using PPE was higher among vaccinated participants 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Associations with additional covariates included in the vaccination-probability model are shown in Table S2. Standardized mean differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants for all covariates were well balanced after propensity weighting, with a maximum difference of 0.09 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>.\n\n【33】SARS-CoV-2 Infections Confirmed by RT-PCR Assay\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected by means of RT-PCR assay in 204 participants (5%), of whom 5 were fully vaccinated, 11 partially vaccinated, and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with indeterminate vaccination status were excluded. Of the 93 genetically sequenced viruses, 12 were detected in participants with indeterminate vaccination status and were excluded. Of the remaining viruses, 10 were variants of concern (8 were the B.1.429 variant and 1 was the B.1.427 variant \\[epsilon\\] and 1 was the B.1.1.7 variant \\[alpha\\]); 1 was a variant of interest (the P.2 variant \\[zeta\\]) 删除2:<u>(Table S3)</u>. There were 10 genetically sequenced viruses detected in partially or fully vaccinated participants; 3 of these 10 viruses (30%) were variants of concern (all the B.1.429 variant \\[epsilon\\]), as compared with 7 of the 70 viruses (10%) detected in unvaccinated participants (excluding the variant of interest).\n\n【35】RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was most frequently detected in participants who were located in Arizona, Florida, or Texas or were male, Hispanic, or a first responder 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. However, the frequency of infection did not differ according to reported hours of potential virus exposure or PPE use. Most participants with RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had symptoms associated with Covid-19 before or within 1 day after specimen collection (74%) or within 2 to 14 days after specimen collection (13%); the remainder had other symptoms (2%) or were asymptomatic within the 14 days before and after specimen collection (11%). Only 26% of the participants with RT-PCR–confirmed infection received medical care, including 3 unvaccinated participants who were hospitalized; no deaths were reported.\n\n【36】Characteristics of the 16 participants who were partially or fully vaccinated at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the 156 participants who were unvaccinated at the time of infection are shown in Table S5. The percentage who were infected while partially or fully vaccinated was highest among participants in Arizona, Minnesota, and Utah and among health care personnel; there were no substantial differences according to other sociodemographic or health characteristics or according to potential virus exposure or PPE use.\n\n【37】Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Infection\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】During the 17-week study period, a total of 3964 participants contributed a median of 19 unvaccinated days per participant (interquartile range, 8 to 41; total days, 127,971), during which 156 RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified. A total of 3001 participants contributed a median of 22 partially vaccinated days (interquartile range, 21 to 28; total days, 81,168), during which 11 RT-PCR–confirmed infections were identified. A total of 2510 participants contributed a median of 69 fully vaccinated days (interquartile range, 53 to 81; total days, 161,613), during which 5 RT-PCR–confirmed infections were identified. Results of vaccination-propensity weight calculations are shown in Figure S3.\n\n【39】Table 2.  Table 2. Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Full and Partial Vaccination.\n\n【40】Estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness against RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 91% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 76 to 97) with full vaccination and 81% (95% CI, 64 to 90) with partial vaccination 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness according to mRNA vaccine product and age group are shown in Table 2 . Point estimates of vaccine effectiveness were unchanged in a sensitivity analysis that excluded periods of low local viral circulation 删除2:<u>(Table S4)</u>.\n\n【41】Attenuation of Viral RNA Load with Vaccination\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Table 3.  Table 3. Viral RNA Load, Duration of Viral RNA Detection, Frequency of Febrile Symptoms, and Duration of Illness in Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Participants with SARS-CoV-2 Infection.\n\n【43】There were no substantial associations between the mean viral RNA load and participant characteristics, except for a somewhat lower viral RNA load among first responders 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. The mean viral RNA load was 3.8 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per microliter among unvaccinated participants and 2.3 log <sub>10 </sub> copies per microliter among partially or fully vaccinated participants; in an adjusted model, the viral RNA load was 40% lower (95% CI, 16.3 to 57.3) with at least partial vaccination than with no vaccination 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Among vaccinated participants, the mean viral RNA load decreased after receipt of dose 1 删除2:<u>(Fig. S4)</u>. Viral RNA was detected for only 1 week in most partially or fully vaccinated participants (75%) and was detected for more than 1 week in most unvaccinated participants (72%); the risk of viral RNA detection for more than 1 week was 66% lower with at least partial vaccination 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>.\n\n【44】Attenuation of Febrile Symptoms and Duration of Illness with Vaccination\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】There were no substantial associations between measures of the severity and duration of Covid-19 and participant characteristics, except for a lower mean duration of illness among participants located in Texas and Utah and a lower frequency of febrile symptoms among participants located in Florida and Utah 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. Among participants with RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 25% of those who were partially or fully vaccinated reported febrile symptoms, as compared with 63% of those who were unvaccinated; the risk of febrile symptoms was 58% lower with at least partial vaccination 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Vaccinated participants also reported 6.4 fewer total days of symptoms (95% CI, 0.4 to 12.3) and 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed with Covid-19 (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7) than unvaccinated participants.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】In a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers followed over 17 weeks in six U.S. states, the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 91% (95% CI, 76 to 97) with full vaccination; vaccine effectiveness was 81% with partial vaccination. These estimates of vaccine effectiveness in real-world conditions are consistent with findings from efficacy trials 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> and from a similar prospective study involving health care personnel in which routine SARS-CoV-2 testing was also conducted. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7</a></sup></u>\n\n【48】Among the small number of participants with breakthrough RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, the mRNA vaccines appeared to attenuate infection and disease in multiple ways. Participants who were partially or fully vaccinated at the time of infection had a 40% lower viral RNA load and a 66% lower risk of viral RNA detection for more than 1 week than participants who were unvaccinated at infection. Partially or fully vaccinated participants also had a 58% lower risk of febrile symptoms and a shorter duration of illness, with approximately 6 fewer days of symptoms and 2 fewer days spent sick in bed, than unvaccinated participants. The observed presence of a reduced viral RNA load after the administration of mRNA vaccines is consistent with findings in a recent report, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> and the observed combination of virologic and clinical effects is consistent with previous findings of a lower level and shorter duration of viral RNA detection with milder Covid-19. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【49】The mechanisms by which vaccination attenuates Covid-19 are largely unknown, but the effect is probably due to recall of immunologic memory responses that reduce viral replication and accelerate the elimination of virally infected cells. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> The biologic plausibility of these benefits is supported by the observation of similar phenomena in studies of other vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10-19 </a></sup></u> Our findings are also consistent with reports of less severe symptoms in patients with moderate Covid-19 who received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine than in those who received placebo in a randomized, controlled trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【50】Strengths of this study include the focus on working-age adults without previous laboratory-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness with high adherence to surveillance, the multimethod documentation of vaccination status, and the estimation of vaccine effectiveness with vaccination-propensity weighting, continuous updates regarding local viral circulation, and reports of potential virus exposure and PPE use. The use of a standard synthetic RNA to conduct quantitative RT-PCR assays improves on the methods used in many previous studies, which relied on cycle thresholds from real-time RT-PCR assays as a proxy for viral RNA loads. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9</a></sup></u>\n\n【51】This study also has several limitations. First, although our estimate of 81% vaccine effectiveness with partial vaccination is similar to results provided in other reports, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2,7,21,22 </a></sup></u> this estimate is based on a relatively brief follow-up period (with a median of 22 partially vaccinated days, as compared with 69 fully vaccinated days, per participant). Second, we could have overestimated vaccine effectiveness if we disproportionately failed to detect infections among vaccinated participants because of attenuation of viral RNA load after vaccination or because of reductions in the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays associated with specimen collection by participants and shipping of specimens. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> Third, we have not completed genetic sequencing for all viruses. Fourth, because there was a relatively small number of breakthrough infections, we could not differentiate attenuation effects associated with partial vaccination from effects associated with full vaccination. Similarly, sparse data reduced the precision of estimates, although the consistency of trends across measures affirms the direction of the overall effect. Fifth, because of the sparse data and limited racial and ethnic diversity among participants, we were unable to fully examine or adjust for potential confounders of vaccine attenuation effects. Nonetheless, we stratified our participant recruitment to ensure a combination of participant characteristics according to occupation, age, and sex; we did not observe consistent associations of sociodemographic or health characteristics or reported virus exposure or PPE use with vaccination status, viral RNA load, or duration of illness. Sixth, results for febrile symptoms and duration of illness were based on participant-reported data, which can be subject to recall and confirmation biases. Yet, the findings for these measures were consistent with the virologic findings of a reduced viral RNA load and duration of viral RNA detection among vaccinated participants. Finally, the detection of viral RNA is not equivalent to isolation of an infectious virus; however, low cycle thresholds on RT-PCR assay have been associated with the ability to isolate SARS-CoV-2 in culture, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> and both the level and the duration of viral RNA detection are associated with infectivity and transmission in other viral infections. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19,24-26</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】If further data confirm that the administration of mRNA vaccines reduces the number of viral RNA particles and the duration of viral RNA detection, thereby blunting the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, then the overall results support that mRNA vaccines not only are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection but also may mitigate the effects of breakthrough infections — a finding that is especially important to essential and frontline workers, given their potential to transmit the virus through frequent close contact with patients, coworkers, and the public.\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (contracts 75D30120R68013 to Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, 75D30120C08379 to the University of Arizona, and 75D30120C08150 to Abt Associates).</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</u>\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on June 30, 2021, and updated on September 30, 2021, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>A data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>We thank the participants involved in the study, as well as our colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the University of Arizona, Arizona Department of Health Services, and the University of Miami; Kaiser Permanente Northwest; St. Luke’s Regional Health Care System; the University of Utah; Marshfield Clinic Research Institute; Abt Associates; and Baylor Scott and White Health.</u>\n\n【60】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【61】参考删除-1:<u>From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response Team, Atlanta (M.G.T., A.L.F., L.G., J.M.L., Y.M.Y., G.J., J.

In each test, an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was simulated with the use of a life-size mannequin, with two participants, matched by sex and age, present at the scene; seven tests were conducted in each of five different geographic zones 删除2:<u>(Figs.

Sites varied by the number of AEDs available within 600 ft (183 m) of the simulated cardiac arrest. Drone launch sites were not visible from the cardiac arrest sites, and the distance from the launch site to the site of the arrest differed by zone, ranging from 780 to 1290 ft (238 to 393 m). In each test, we randomly assigned one participant to call a mock 911 telecommunicator who initiated the drone’s autonomous flight and the other participant to simultaneously conduct a ground search to locate an AED and return to the site with it.

Because this fluctuating pattern could be eliminated by muscle paralysis, we conducted a prospective study of preterm infants receiving mechanical ventilation for the respiratory distress syndrome in which we evaluated the effect of paralysis and this flow-velocity pattern on the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage. Twenty-four infants with the fluctuating pattern in the first hours of life were identified and randomly selected to serve as controls (10) or to be subjected to muscle paralysis (14). Intraventricular hemorrhage developed in all 10 control infants but in only 5 of the 14 infants subjected to muscle paralysis. Moreover, in 4 of the 5 paralyzed infants in whom hemorrhage developed, it did so after cessation of the paralysis. Seven of the 10 control infants had Grade III hemorrhage, the most severe variety of intraventricular hemorrhage, whereas none of the paralyzed infants had Grade III hemorrhage. We conclude that elimination of fluctuating cerebral blood-flow velocity in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome markedly reduces the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1985; 312:1353–7.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

We investigated the effectiveness of wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and helmets in preventing skating injuries.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】We used data from the 91 hospital emergency departments participating in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a national probability sample of randomly selected hospitals with 24-hour emergency departments. Injured in-line skaters who sought medical attention between December 1992 and July 1993 were interviewed by telephone. We conducted a case–control study of skaters who injured their wrists, elbows, knees, or heads as compared with skaters with injuries to other parts of their bodies.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】Of 206 eligible injured subjects, 161 (78 percent) were interviewed. Wrist injuries were the most common (32 percent); 25 percent of all injuries were wrist fractures. Seven percent of injured skaters wore all the types of safety gear; 46 percent wore none. Forty-five percent wore knee pads, 33 percent wrist guards, 28 percent elbow pads, and 20 percent helmets. The odds ratio for wrist injury, adjusted for age and sex, for those who did not wear wrist guards, as compared with those who did, was 10.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 36.9). The odds ratio for elbow injury, adjusted for the number of lessons skaters had had and whether or not they performed trick skating, was 9.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 34.4) for those who did not wear elbow pads. Nonuse of knee pads was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the risk of knee injury (crude odds ratio, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 7.2). The effectiveness of helmets could not be assessed.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Wrist guards and elbow pads are effective in protecting in-line skaters against injuries.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】In-line skating is a fast-growing recreational sport in the United States. In-line skates, with three, four, or five low-friction wheels set in a single row, afford greater maneuverability and speed than traditional quad skates, which have four wheels arranged in two rows. An estimated 22.5 million people participated in 1995, reflecting a 79 percent increase over the 1993 figure. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> During the same two-year period, the estimated number of in-line skaters injured badly enough to require emergency department care increased by 169 percent to an annual level of 99,500 (in 1995). 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The most common site of injury is the wrist, accounting for 37 percent of all skating injuries, and two thirds of wrist injuries are fractures. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,4 </a></sup></u> Wrist guards are designed to prevent sudden extreme hyperextension, to absorb shock and dissipate kinetic forces by enabling the skater to slide forward on the guard's hard volar plate, and to prevent gravel burns. Helmets, elbow pads, and knee pads are designed to absorb shock during a fall. The use of all four of these items of safety gear has been recommended, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-7 </a></sup></u> but their effectiveness, although suggested, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5,8 </a></sup></u> had been untested. We surveyed a representative sample of injured in-line skaters who received emergency department treatment in order to identify behavioral and environmental risk factors for injury, the mechanism and nature of injury, and the degree of protection afforded by safety gear.\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】Sample Design and Data Acquisition\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】Subjects were drawn from a sampling frame consisting of all patients injured during the study period who were wearing in-line skates and sought treatment at 1 of the 91 hospital emergency departments participating in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> NEISS is a national probability sample, stratified into four levels according to the annual number of emergency visits, of randomly selected U.S. hospitals with 24-hour emergency departments. The study period had two parts: December 25, 1992, through April 7, 1993, and July 1 to July 31, 1993.\n\n【15】We developed a list of possible risk factors for injury by conducting focus-group discussions with skaters 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> and by interviewing novice and experienced skaters. We constructed a 20-minute questionnaire to gather information on the characteristics of injured skaters, the circumstances surrounding the injury, and the use of safety gear.\n\n【16】Injured skaters were interviewed by telephone by Dr. Schieber during August 1993 after providing informed consent. If the skater was a minor, consent was obtained from the participant and a parent. Children were interviewed directly (although a parent was present in a few instances); the parent was then interviewed privately to verify the child's reported level of experience, the account of the injury, and the use of safety gear at the time.\n\n【17】The study was conducted with approval from the Office of Management and Budget, which authorized the Consumer Product Safety Commission to conduct confidential, selective telephone surveys of persons with product-related injuries to learn of the interactions among the product, the victims, and the environment.\n\n【18】Definitions and Analytic Design\n-------------------------------\n\n【19】Subjects were assigned to case and control groups for our analyses of the relative benefits of the use of wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and helmets. To enhance precision, we defined four risk groups according to the four anatomical sites shielded by the various types of safety gear: the wrist, elbow, knee, and head (or face). Subjects were classified in a particular risk group if the given anatomical region had been exposed to injury in the subject's fall. For example, subjects were included in the wrist risk group if they fell on one or both outstretched arms or otherwise struck the wrist or lower arm during the fall. Within each risk group, we defined as case patients those skaters who injured the specified anatomical site seriously enough to require medical attention. The controls were skaters in the risk group who did not injure the specified site, although they did injure another part of their body. The main exposure variable was the self-reported use (or nonuse) of the appropriate safety gear for the specified anatomical site. The outcome variable was the presence or absence of an injury to that anatomical site, as reported by the skater and confirmed by the NEISS record.\n\n【20】Selected characteristics of the skaters were considered as covariates. The subjects were classified according to age into groups: elementary-school children (6 to 12 years), junior or senior high-school youth (13 to 18 years), and adults (19 years or older). Subjects comfortable standing up on skates were classified as novices; beginners were those who could make a simple turn on two skates; intermediates could perform a crossover turn (made with a sequence of short, alternating cross-steps); and experts could do two or more stunts. In-line skating experience was classified according to the number of times the skater had participated in the sport. Ice hockey, ice skating, alpine skiing, roller skating, bicycle racing, and mountain bicycling were defined as cross-training sports. Lessons were defined as prior training with an instructor or accompaniment by a more skilled skater. The levels of perceived exertion at the time of injury, as assessed by the skaters themselves, were warming-up, cruising, and fatigued. Other covariates in the analysis were sex, handedness, and whether the skater performed tricks (as a covariate, considered a proxy for risk-taking behavior). Characteristics of the fall that were considered as covariates included the subject's reported inability to stop just before injury and the severity of injury. A fracture, a dislocation, or an internal injury constituted a major injury; a laceration, abrasion, contusion, sprain, or strain was a minor injury.\n\n【21】We evaluated the possibility that selection bias might result from the use of controls who also were injured while skating. For example, many subjects treated as case patients in the analysis of wrist injury were used as controls for the analysis of elbow injury. If nonuse of wrist guards was highly correlated with nonuse of elbow pads, then these subjects might be less likely than the general population to wear gear and have protection. Therefore, separate covariates were defined for each type of gear used as well as for a composite variable indicating the use or nonuse of any additional safety gear not related to the injury site.\n\n【22】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【23】All data reported have been weighted according to the probability of hospital selection from the four levels based on hospital size in the total NEISS sample. All analyses were conducted with SUDAAN statistical software to account for complex sampling. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> Log-linear chi-square tests were used to test for association between groups and for significant differences in proportions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Association was assessed with unadjusted odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios with control for confounding factors. Population-attributable risks were calculated with established methods. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> A P value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered to indicate statistical significance, with the use of variances derived from the weighted sample.\n\n【24】Results\n-------\n\n【25】Demographic Characteristics of the Skaters and Circumstances of the Injuries\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Table 1. Table 1. Selected Characteristics of Injured In-Line Skaters in the National Sample. Table 2.  Table 2. Characteristics of Falls and of Injuries Sustained by In-Line Skaters.\n\n【27】We interviewed 161 of 206 eligible subjects (for a 78 percent response rate 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> ); their data were weighted, on the basis of hospital selection, so as to represent the distribution of characteristics of the estimated 6331 in-line skating injuries treated in emergency departments nationally during the study period. The skaters ranged from 6 to 59 years of age (mean, 20.8; median, 15). Forty-eight percent were male, and 89 percent were right-handed (other characteristics of the skaters are provided in Table 1 ; data on their falls and consequent trauma are provided in Table 2 ). The most typical fall involved young novice or beginner skaters wearing little or no safety gear, who either spontaneously lost their balance while skating outdoors or fell after striking a road defect or debris. The falls typically occurred on outstretched arms without any attempt to stop. The wrist was the most common site of primary injury (32 percent); 25 percent of all injuries were wrist fractures. Seven percent of the injured skaters wore all four types of safety gear; 46 percent wore none. Of the total, 45 percent wore knee pads, 33 percent wrist guards, 28 percent elbow pads, and 20 percent helmets.\n\n【28】The Case–Control Study\n----------------------\n\n【29】Table 3.  Table 3. Selected Characteristics of the In-Line Skaters with Wrist or Elbow Injuries and Their Controls.\n\n【30】Case patients and controls in the wrist risk group and in the elbow risk group are compared in Table 3 . The projected national total in the wrist risk group (5404 persons) was estimated on the basis of weighted data on 141 interviewed subjects; the projected total in the elbow risk group (4708) was estimated on the basis of 122 subjects. Case patients and controls in the wrist group differed significantly in age distribution (case patients tended to be younger) and in their use of wrist guards and elbow pads. Case patients and controls in the elbow group differed only in their use of elbow pads, the number of lessons taken (case patients tended to have taken more lessons), and history of trick skating (controls had more frequently performed tricks).\n\n【31】Table 4.  Table 4. Odds Ratios for Injuries to In-Line Skaters Not Wearing Appropriate Safety Gear.\n\n【32】Analysis of crude odds ratios indicated that among those at risk for wrist injury, skaters who did not wear wrist guards had a likelihood of actually sustaining a wrist injury that was 12.9 times that among those who did wear wrist guards (95 percent confidence interval, 4.5 to 37.1) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Among skaters at risk for injury to the elbow, those not wearing elbow pads had a risk of sustaining an elbow injury that was 8.0 times that among skaters who did wear such gear (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 30.1). Nonuse of knee pads was associated with an increase, but not a significant increase, in the risk of knee injury (crude odds ratio, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 7.2). The association between not using a helmet and sustaining a head or facial injury was also not significant (odds ratio, 0.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 6.8).\n\n【33】Bivariate analysis showed a significant association between the likelihood of wrist injury and both the use of wrist guards and age and an association between the likelihood of elbow injury and the use of elbow pads, the taking of lessons, and a history of doing tricks (for all associations, P<0.05). The relation between wrist injury and the use of wrist guards was confounded by age and sex; the relation between elbow injury and the use of elbow pads was confounded by having taken lessons and a history of performing tricks. When we controlled for these confounders, the multivariate analysis indicated that the nonuse of wrist guards was associated with a risk of sustaining a wrist injury that was 10.4 times that among skaters who did wear wrist guards (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 36.9), and nonuse of elbow pads was associated with an odds ratio of 9.5 for sustaining an elbow injury (95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 34.4) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. The use of wrist guards was not significantly associated with injury to the elbow (data not shown).\n\n【34】In calculations of population-attributable risk, the nonuse of wrist guards accounted for 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 84 to 96 percent) of all wrist injuries. Failure to use elbow pads accounted for 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 78 to 95 percent) of all elbow injuries. Failure to use knee pads accounted for 32 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 27 to 79 percent) of all knee injuries.\n\n【35】Discussion\n----------\n\n【36】Our analysis of several environmental and behavioral risk factors for in-line skating injuries in a nationally representative sample of skaters found that wrist guards and elbow pads afforded skaters a high level of protection, but that their rate of use among injured patients was relatively low. The degree of protection afforded by wrist guards and elbow pads is similar to the degree of protection afforded the head by bicycle helmets (85 percent) in a study of bicycle crashes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15</a></sup></u>\n\n【37】The NEISS data set permits the estimation of the national incidence of an injury with known variance. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Even using unweighted data (thereby converting the probability sample to a sample of convenience), we found that the adjusted odds ratio for wrist injuries associated with the failure to use wrist guards was 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 18.8), and that for elbow injuries associated with the failure to use elbow pads, 7.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 27.5). To bolster the strength of our analysis, we used a single interviewer and multiple lines of inquiry, sought parental confirmation for important data, controlled the analysis for many potential confounders, sampled a wide age range, sought (and achieved) a high response rate, and increased precision by restricting the selection of case and control patients to those exposed to the risk of injury to a specific anatomical site.\n\n【38】Our study, however, has several potential limitations. Selection bias may have resulted from our use of emergency department patients as controls, rather than skaters drawn from the general population. Controls who have sustained a skating injury may be more similar to case patients than population-based controls would be, which would have biased our results toward the null hypothesis. However, any potential bias of this type would not have altered the public health consequences of our findings because the point estimates of the odds ratios are so large.\n\n【39】On the other hand, had a significant correlation existed among the use of different kinds of safety gear, our results might have been biased away from the null hypothesis. The use of more than one type of gear was not a significant confounder, either when use of a given type was examined individually or when we assessed a composite indicator (data not shown). Forcing these variables for use of more than one type of gear into the final model decreased the point estimate of the odds ratio for wrist injury minimally and increased the odds ratio for elbow injury substantially, but it did not change the significance of these ratios. However, the level of precision was reduced considerably (data not shown). To recruit geographically matched, population-based controls would have been prohibitively costly; controls from a single area only might not have had attributes (e.g., skill level) that properly matched those of the case patients; and seeking to select controls from a random national telephone survey might not have, in 1993, yielded many in-line skaters.\n\n【40】Information bias may be present because these data were reported by the skaters themselves. The recall period ranged from several weeks to eight months, and some respondents may not have remembered details well. Some variables, such as skating frequency, were difficult for the youngest children to quantify. Lifetime person-hours of skating experience, the ideal measure of exposure to possible injury, was crudely approximated by the number of times a subject remembered having skated. This number may not have been recalled accurately. The study lacked sufficient power to detect a significant association between knee injury and the use of knee pads (the point estimate, however, was elevated) as well as between head injury and the use of a helmet. Some potential confounders could not be assessed, including skating speed, crash forces on impact, cross-training experience with cross-country skiing, the use of poorly fitting safety gear, and household income.\n\n【41】The nature of in-line skating has some practical implications for the use of safety gear. The widespread availability of gear in child and adult sizes and its relatively low cost should facilitate use. Automatic braking devices, which slow the wheels or apply a heel brake without dorsiflexion of the foot, may reduce the injury rate; such devices became available after the conclusion of the study. Currently, wrist guards may not be practical for participants in roller hockey because the wrist guards interfere with the player's ability to hold the hockey stick firmly or make a wrist shot. This limitation warrants further attention on the part of product designers, given the popularity of roller hockey and the large proportion of the skaters in our study who were injured while playing hockey.\n\n【42】In conclusion, we recommend that in-line skaters wear wrist guards, elbow pads, knee pads, and helmets. Although the small number of skaters who sustained a head injury did not allow us to determine the degree of protection afforded by helmets, other studies 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,16 </a></sup></u> indicate that helmets that meet existing standards for bicycle helmets 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> are strongly protective against head injuries in physical environments quite similar to that of skaters.\n\n【43】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【44】参考删除-1:<u>The views expressed by the authors do not necessarily represent those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</u>\n\n【45】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to the NEISS coding nosologists from each hospital, who retrieved the information needed to contact injured persons; to the adult skaters, parents, and children who permitted interviews; and to Marcie-jo Kresnow, M.S.

The current policies and sentencing laws that result in mass incarceration represent an enormous social experiment in which there is vast racial and economic inequity. For more than two decades, there has been a dramatic and steady increase in the number of people incarcerated in the United States. Much of this increase results directly from inadequate treatment of mental illness and addiction in the community. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The natural history of addiction and mental illness often results in illegal activity, and persistently inadequate treatment perpetuates a cycle of crime and incarceration.\n\n【3】In part because prisoners have a constitutional guarantee of health care, physicians are an essential component of correctional institutions. Yet incarceration can often be harmful to a patient's physical and mental health. In U.S. prisons, rehabilitation has been largely abandoned in favor of punishment, which conflicts with a therapeutic approach and often results in neglect of the psychological and medical needs of patients with mental illness or addiction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Even in situations in which treatment has been proved effective, it is often underused in correctional settings. According to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, although 83% of state prisoners reported past drug use and 57% were using drugs during the month before committing their offense, only 20% participated in treatment for substance abuse while in prison. In federal prisons, 63% of all prisoners in 1997 were held for drug offenses, yet only 15% of them reported participation in treatment for substance abuse while incarcerated. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】Although there are some potential health benefits from incarceration, including access to basic requirements such as nutrition, shelter, medical care, and forced relative sobriety, many of these benefits can be provided more efficiently in less expensive, nonpunitive therapeutic settings, such as residential treatment programs and group homes. The current practice of mass incarceration cannot be condoned, in our view, given its effect on the health of individuals and its destabilizing effect on communities. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】We feel strongly that physicians have the ability and the duty to advocate for effective and humane treatment for patients. The correctional system has been ineffective in providing therapy, including proven approaches such as mental health services, expanded high-quality drug treatment, and support services for reentry into society after incarceration. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3,5 </a></sup></u> We believe that it is time for physicians to influence the sentencing laws, policies, and procedures that directly affect the health and well-being of patients and society and to advocate for more humane and effective community-based alternatives for addressing addiction and mental illness.\n\n【6】参考删除-2:<u>Scott A.

To be deemed intravenous leiomyomatosis, any extrauterine benign smooth muscle must remain within the vascular lumen or cardiac chambers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> There are two principal theories about the origin of intravenous leiomyomatosis: it may arise from the smooth-muscle wall of a myometrial vein, or it may result from unusual vascular invasion by a uterine leiomyoma.

To assess the effect of potassium repletion in hypokalemic hypertension, we administered either potassium chloride, 60 mmol per day, or placebo tablets, each for six weeks, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial to 16 hypertensive patients who had diuretic-induced hypokalemia and who continued to take a constant amount of diuretic. We selected patients whose control serum potassium levels were below 3.5 mmol per liter. In association with an average rise in the serum potassium concentration of 0.56 mmol per liter, the mean blood pressure fell by an average of 5.5 mm Hg (P = 0.004), with at least a 4 mm Hg fall observed in 9 of the 16 patients.

Two patients have recently been identified in our institute with autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis, and their IgG4 levels have been measured.\n\n【3】Patient 1 was a 49-year-old white man presenting with a nine-month history of intermittent attacks of epigastric pain, obstructive jaundice, and fever. Imaging studies showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas (on computed tomography), diffuse hypoechoic enlargement of the pancreas (on endoscopic ultrasonography), a long segment of extrahepatic biliary stricture, and an irregular pancreatic duct (on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). The patient eventually underwent a Whipple procedure because of concern about cancer. The final histologic examination of the resected specimen showed autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】Patient 2 was a 56-year-old black woman with two previous episodes of pancreatitis, persistent abdominal pain, and weight loss. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed stricture at the junction of the body and the tail of the pancreas with dilatation of the pancreatic duct at the tail. The possibility of a neoplastic process was raised, and the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy. Histologic examination showed the presence of autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis. After diagnosis, total IgG and IgG4 levels were obtained in these patients (seven months and one month after surgery in Patient 1 and Patient 2, respectively). The IgG4 levels were found to be elevated in both patients (159 mg per deciliter in Patient 1 and 182 mg per deciliter in Patient 2; range, 7 to 89 mg per deciliter), although total IgG levels were normal (1180 mg per deciliter in Patient 1 and 1300 mg per deciliter in Patient 2; range, 694 to 1618 mg per deciliter). Other autoantibodies — antinuclear antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antithyroglobulin antibodies, and antimicrosomal antibodies — were not present.\n\n【5】Although IgG4 levels have been shown to be elevated in Japanese patients with autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis, it is unclear whether they are elevated in patients of other races or ethnic groups. We found that IgG4 was elevated in both a white man and a black woman, suggesting that elevation of IgG4 might be useful for the identification of patients with autoimmune sclerosing pancreatitis, which is usually difficult to diagnose preoperatively.\n\n【6】参考删除-2:<u>Robert Y.M.

They received 6 million to 10 million U of interferon alfa three times per week for 12 months. Information on the psychiatric diagnosis was obtained before therapy with the use of the non-patient structured clinical interview from the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,_ third edition, revised. Interferon alfa–induced adverse psychiatric effects were monitored monthly with use of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. We analyzed these results using response-feature analysis (maximal scores on psychopathologic rating scales during the therapy) and analysis of covariance. We compared the psychopathologic response of the 25 patients with a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis with that of the 35 patients with no psychiatric diagnosis, while adjusting for base-line differences 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. As expected, patients with a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis had higher base-line scores than patients with no psychiatric diagnosis (all P<0.01) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. After adjusting for the base-line values, we found no evidence that patients with a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis and patients with no psychiatric diagnosis had different maximal scores on the psychopathological rating scales (all P>0.5) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. We also found no significant difference between groups in the incidence of adverse psychiatric effects severe enough to require psychopharmacologic treatment: 3 of the 25 patients with a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis had such effects, as compared with 7 of the 35 patients with no psychiatric diagnosis (12 percent vs. 20 percent; chi-square with 1 df=0.22; P=0.6). We believe that patients who have psychopathologic symptoms before they begin taking interferon alfa should not be denied this effective therapy.\n\n【5】参考删除-2:<u>Carmine M.

The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study was organized to identify the diseases that require transplantation and to analyze factors that affect the success of transplantation in children.\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】We collected data from 73 pediatric transplantation centers from 1987 through 1990. These data included information about demographic characteristics of patients, graft function, and therapy one month after transplantation and every six months thereafter for each patient 17 years of age or younger.\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】Altogether, 1550 children received 1667 renal allografts during this period; 31 percent of the children were five years of age or younger. Forty-three percent of the transplanted kidneys came from a living related donor, and 57 percent from a cadaver. The two most common causes of renal disease leading to transplantation were congenital malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract (42 percent of the patients) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (12 percent). One year after transplantation, the rate of graft survival in recipients of a kidney from a living related donor was 89 percent; it was 80 percent after three years. For recipients of cadaver kidneys, the comparable rates were 74 percent and 62 percent, respectively (P<0.001). The best growth was observed in patients who were no more than five years old at the time of transplantation. During follow-up, 79 patients died, and cancer developed in 12 patients.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】The most common causes of end-stage renal disease in children and adolescents are congenital malformations of the kidneys and urinary tract and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The rates of graft survival at one and three years are better in children and adolescents who receive a kidney from a living related donor than in those who receive a kidney from a cadaver. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1992;326:1727–32.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】CHRONIC renal disease in children is frequently due to a congenital renal lesion, such as aplasia or dysplasia, which leads to end-stage renal disease in early infancy. Such children have retarded growth and renal osteodystrophy. Dialysis therapy tends to exacerbate renal bone disease and leads to early epiphyseal closure. To avoid this additional injury, physicians frequently prefer to perform renal transplantation as soon as possible, even before dialysis is initiated. Because of the small number of procedures performed annually at individual centers, data on the outcome of renal transplantation in children are sparse. The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study was organized in 1987 to register and follow children up to 17 years of age in the United States and Canada who receive renal allografts. This report is based on the 1550 patients who underwent 1667 transplantation procedures that were reported to the registry during its first four years of operation (1987 through 1990).\n\n【12】Methods\n-------\n\n【13】The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study is made up of a clinical coordinating center, a data-coordinating center, and 73 medical centers treating children with renal disease in the United States and Canada. The data for this report, compiled in February 1991, include transplantations reported during the four preceding years. Since January 1987 each allograft received by a child or adolescent ≤17 years of age at a participating center has been reported to the study registry, along with information on graft function and therapy one month after transplantation and every six months thereafter, as described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Standard univariate and multivariate statistical methods, including product—limit estimates of survival distributions, were used to analyze the data. Proportional-hazards survival models were constructed that equated an individual patient's hazard to an underlying hazard multiplied by an estimated exponentiated linear combination of risk factors. Multivariate models were scaled so that risk increased with larger values of the covariates; the relative risk for a single dichotomous risk factor is the exponentiated parameter.\n\n【14】Results\n-------\n\n【15】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【16】Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of Pediatric Renal-Transplant Recipients, According to Year of Transplantation. Table 2.  Table 2. Characteristics of pediatric Renal-Transplant Recipients, According to Age at the Time of Transplantation.\n\n【17】Both the number of patients who received transplants during each of the four years and the number of transplantation procedures have decreased slightly each year since 1987, although a lag in reporting probably accounts for the small size of the 1990 group 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The age, race, and sex distribution of the patients did not change significantly over time. The youngest patient who underwent transplantation was five months old. Among the patients five months to five years of age, 70 percent were boys; the sex ratio was more nearly equal in the two older age groups, which included 76 percent of the patients 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【18】The most common causes of renal failure were congenital lesions (renal dysplasia, obstructive malformations, or both) in 42 percent of the patients and glomerulonephritis in 18 percent (including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 12 percent). Lupus nephritis (5 percent) and hemolytic—uremic syndrome (3 percent) were rare, and only one patient had diabetic nephropathy. Of the patients 5 years of age or younger, 46 percent had congenital lesions, whereas various forms of glomerulonephritis — such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and lupus nephritis — were the most frequent causes of renal failure among those 13 to 17 years of age. Although nonwhite patients made up 31 percent of all transplant recipients, 44 percent of the patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were nonwhite.\n\n【19】At the time of entry into the registry, 14 percent of the patients had just received their second or subsequent transplants, with a median of 46 months (range, 5 to 178) since the previous transplantation. Transplantation was used as initial therapy (without dialysis) in 22 percent of the patients; 34 percent of the transplants from living related donors and 12 percent of those from cadavers were received by such patients. The rate of transplantation as initial therapy was similar in all four age groups (≤1, 2 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years). Among the patients treated by dialysis, the median length of time from the initiation of dialysis to transplantation was 12 months (mean, 21). All native renal tissue was removed in 29 percent of the patients, and the existing grafts were removed in 62 percent of the patients who had undergone a previous transplantation.\n\n【20】Characteristics of Donors and HLA Matching\n------------------------------------------\n\n【21】The patient's parent was the source of the allograft in 624 (37 percent) of the transplantations; in 94 (6 percent) the kidney came from a sibling or other living relative. Six of the sibling donors were under 18 years of age, and three were identical twins of the patients; the youngest of these pairs of twins was 13 years old. In 949 (57 percent) of the transplantations, the kidney was obtained from a cadaver; 39 percent of the cadaver donors were 10 years of age or younger. In the case of allografts from cadavers, 82 percent were maintained with an iced electrolyte perfusion; the cold-storage times of the grafts were at least 24 hours in 56 percent of the cases and more than 48 hours in 1 percent.\n\n【22】The percentage of recipients who received transfusions of blood from the donor of the allograft decreased during the four years, from 43 percent in 1987 to 19 percent in 1990. Twenty-nine percent of the patients who received kidneys from living related donors and 53 percent of those who received cadaver kidneys received more than five transfusions of blood from unidentified donors. Among the recipients of kidneys from living related donors, 87 percent had at least one haplotype match with the donor (HLA-B and HLA-DR), whereas 12 percent had only one HLA-B or one HLA-DR antigen match. Matches of all A, B, and DR alleles occurred in only 2 percent of the cases of transplantation of a kidney from a cadaver.\n\n【23】Medication after Transplantation\n--------------------------------\n\n【24】The median doses of prednisone received by the patients were 0.31 mg per kilogram of body weight per day 6 months after transplantation and 0.19 mg per kilogram per day after 30 months. The percentage of transplant recipients who received prednisone therapy on alternate days increased from 12 percent to 36 percent during the same period. There was little change in the proportion of patients who received prednisone, cyclosporine, and azathioprine at each follow-up evaluation. The dose of azathioprine was constant throughout the study period (mean, 1.7 mg per kilogram per day); the median dose of cyclosporine was 6.1 mg per kilogram per day at 6 months and 4.1 mg per kilogram per day at 30 months. The proportion of recipients of kidneys from living related donors who received triple-drug therapy at six months increased each year; 54 percent of those who underwent transplantation in 1987 and 87 percent of those who received transplants in 1990 received all three drugs. For the recipients of kidneys from cadavers, the comparable figures were 69 percent and 81 percent. The dose of each of the three maintenance immunosuppressive medications correlated positively with age and weight, although the patients who weighed less received more medication per kilogram of body weight.\n\n【25】One month after transplantation, 72 percent of the patients were receiving antihypertensive therapy, but this percentage decreased to 53 percent at 30 months. Similarly, 59 percent initially received prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and 31 percent continued to receive it at 30 months; such treatment was more frequent among patients who had had obstructive lesions (40 percent).\n\n【26】Rejection\n---------\n\n【27】A total of 1707 episodes of rejection (defined as the initiation of antirejection therapy or graft failure due to rejection) were reported in 966 recipients, of whom 404 had 2 or more episodes of rejection (maximum, 7). Overall, half of all transplant recipients had had an episode of rejection by 66 days after transplantation (median, 187 days for recipients of grafts from living related donors and 39 days for recipients of cadaver kidneys). At the end of the second year, 40 percent of the recipients of kidneys from living related donors and 27 percent of the recipients of cadaver kidneys had not had an episode of rejection.\n\n【28】The younger patients were at no disadvantage with respect to the length of time to the first episode of rejection. The perioperative use of antithymocyte globulin—antilymphocyte globulin or OKT3 monoclonal antibody was associated with a significantly longer time to the first episode of rejection among all kidney-transplant recipients, regardless of the source of the graft. The recipients of kidneys from donors five years of age or younger had a higher relative risk of rejection (1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 1.6; P<0.001) than those who received kidneys from older donors; 18 percent of the recipients of kidneys from cadaver donors five years of age or younger had had no rejection episodes after one year, as compared with 35 percent of the recipients of kidneys from donors more than five years of age.\n\n【29】Overall, 54 percent of the episodes of rejection were completely reversed, 38 percent were partially reversed, and 8 percent ended in graft failure or death. The rates of complete reversal declined with an increasing number of rejection episodes, from 62 percent for the first episode to 30 percent when four or more episodes had occurred. Treatment with antithymocyte globulin-antilymphocyte globulin or OKT3 antibody at the time of transplantation did not affect the probability that a later episode of rejection would be completely reversed. Among the 28 patients who received OKT3 antibody at the time of transplantation and again for the treatment of an episode of rejection, 18 had complete reversal and 8 partial reversal of the rejection episode. OKT3 antibody was given during 469 (27 percent) of the episodes of rejection, and intravenous methylprednisolone during 1187 (70 percent), whereas dialysis was used during 242 (14 percent) of the episodes.\n\n【30】Graft Survival\n--------------\n\n【31】Table 3.  Table 3. Causes of Graft Failure in Pediatric Renal-Transplant Recipients.\n\n【32】Of the 1667 grafts, 378 (23 percent) failed at some time during follow-up 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Forty-nine percent of the graft failures were caused by rejection, including 26 percent caused by acute rejection episodes. In 7 percent of the patients, recurrence of the original disease resulted in graft failure; the most common recurrent disease was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Vascular thrombosis was the cause of graft failure in 15 percent of the cases. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【33】Figure 1. Figure 1. Graft Survival According to Source. Table 4.  Table 4. Risk of Graft Failure in Recipients of Renal Allografts from Cadavers, Based on a Proportional-Hazards Model.\\*\n\n【34】Figure 1 shows the rates of graft survival in the recipients of kidneys from cadavers and from living related donors. Among recipients of cadaver kidneys, 74 percent of grafts survived at one year and 62 percent at three years; among recipients of kidneys from living relatives, 89 percent of the grafts survived at one year and 80 percent at three years (P<0.001). For patients who were two years old or younger at the time of transplantation and received kidneys from cadavers, the one-year graft-survival rate was only 46 percent. For all patients who received grafts from cadaver donors less than six years old, the two-year graft-survival rate rose only to 57 percent. Proportional-hazards analysis identified several factors that were associated with an increased risk of graft failure among recipients of cadaver kidneys 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. Among these children, 74 percent of those who did not undergo dialysis in the first week after transplantation had functional grafts at two years, as compared with 52 percent among those in whom a delay in graft function caused by acute tubular necrosis necessitated dialysis during the first week. Among children 2 to 17 years old who received kidneys from living relatives, the graft-survival rate for various age groups (2 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years) ranged from 81 to 85 percent. In those less than one year old at the time of transplantation, the two-year graft-survival rate was 71 percent. The only factor associated with an increased risk of graft failure in the recipients of kidneys from living related donors was acute tubular necrosis in recipients less than one year old (relative risk, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 5.4; P<0.01).\n\n【35】Growth of Children\n------------------\n\n【36】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Mean (±SE) Change in Standardized Height Scores for Patients with Graft Function at Each Follow-up Interval, According to Age at Transplantation.\n\n【37】Data on height at the end of each six-month period were converted to a standard-deviation score (z score) according to the following formula:\n\n【38】patient's height — height at 50th percentile for age and sex. z score =\n\n【39】standard deviation of height for age and sex\n\n【40】Standardization was achieved with the use of normative data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n【41】At the time of transplantation, the mean height for all patients was 2.2 SD below the appropriate age- and sex-adjusted mean for normal children and adolescents (z score). This deficit was comparable in both sexes, although it was greater among younger patients ( — 2.8 SD for patients ≤5 years of age) and those with previous transplantations ( — 3.2 SD). The mean height scores remained relatively constant after transplantation in all but the two youngest groups of children 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 )</u>. The recipients who were 1 year old or younger at the time of transplantation had an increase of 0.3 SD in height during the first 6 months after the procedure; this increase was 0.8 SD by the 12th month. Accelerated growth did not continue, however, and the z score for height changed little in subsequent months. An anticipated adolescent growth spurt or catchup growth was not observed during the three years of observation after transplantation. In particular, patients who were 13 years old or older at the time of transplantation had decreases in the mean z score. All but the youngest age group had increases of 1.0 SD in weight scores by the 12th month after transplantation. After two and three years, the mean weight values were comparable to those in normal children and adolescents.\n\n【42】Morbidity and Mortality\n-----------------------\n\n【43】The median length of hospitalization at the time of transplantation decreased from 19 to 16 days during the study; the median stay was 2 days longer for the recipients of cadaver kidneys than for the recipients of kidneys from living related donors. The number of hospital days after the procedure was negatively correlated with the patient's age; the median hospital stay was 24 days for children 1 year old or younger, 19 days for those 2 to 5 years old, 17 days for those 6 to 12 years old, and 15 days for those 13 to 17 years old. During the first one to five months after transplantation, 58 percent of the recipients were rehospitalized (mean duration of hospital stay, nine days), 30 percent for symptoms of rejection. Bacterial infection (12 percent), viral infection (12 percent), and hypertension requiring hospital treatment (8 percent) were the other major causes of hospitalization. Both the frequency and the length of hospitalizations decreased with increasing follow-up.\n\n【44】Cancer developed in 12 patients, of whom 6 had a lymphoproliferative disorder, 5 sarcoma, and 1 a thyroid carcinoma. Eight of the patients with cancer died, five within a month of diagnosis. Four of these 12 patients had received more than one renal allograft.\n\n【45】Seventy-nine of the patients (including the 8 with cancer) died during the study period; infection was the cause of death in 32 patients. In 38 patients the graft was reported to be functioning at the time of death. Nineteen deaths occurred within 30 days after the initial transplantation during the study period, and 10 during the first postoperative week. At two years, 95 percent of the patients who received kidneys from living related donors and 92 percent of those who received kidneys from cadavers were alive (P = 0.03). Sixteen (15 percent) of the patients one year old or younger died, nine of them with functioning grafts; they accounted for 20 percent of all deaths.\n\n【46】Discussion\n----------\n\n【47】The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study was established to study systematically the effects of renal transplantation in a large population of children and adolescents and to generate data that could ultimately improve the probability of successful transplantation in such patients. The problems of the adverse effects of immunosuppression, growth deficits, and questions about the optimal timing of transplantation surgery are apparent in our results. These observations also highlight several factors affecting prognosis that are different from those in adults.\n\n【48】The geometric mean hospital stay authorized for adults undergoing renal transplantation under the Medicare system of prospective payment according to diagnosis-related groups was 15.8 days in 1987—1988 and 15.4 days in 19881989.3 The median length of the hospital stay after transplantation surgery in children was 17.6 days, but the number of hospital days was negatively correlated with the patient's age; thus, the median hospital stay for transplant recipients one year old or younger was 24.5 days.\n\n【49】In 1989 a total of 8882 renal transplantations were performed in adults, of which 1900 (21 percent) used kidneys from living related donors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> We found that 47 percent of the kidneys transplanted into children in 1989 came from living related donors; the comparable figure was 43 percent during the four years of this study. In 1983 through 1986, the European Dialysis and Transplant Association recorded 226 transplantations of kidneys from living related donors (20 percent) among 1105 transplantations in children. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Whether the proportion of renal allografts from living related donors in children in North America is high because a smaller number of kidneys from cadavers are allocated to children or because of the presence of a more altruistic attitude than that in Europe is a matter for conjecture, but the high rate could be due to the knowledge that the graft-survival rate for cadaver kidneys in children has been inferior to that for kidneys from living related donors. In this study, the 89 percent graft-survival rate at one year for kidneys from living related donors decreased to 80 percent by the third year, whereas the 74 percent one-year graft-survival rate for kidneys from cadavers decreased to 62 percent at three years.\n\n【50】An age of two years or less in the recipient, more than 24 hours of cold storage, an age of five years or less in the donor, black race, and delayed graft function due to acute tubular necrosis were associated with a lower rate of graft survival for cadaver kidneys. Almost 40 percent of all cadaver kidneys were obtained from donors under 10 years of age, with donors from 1 to 5 years old accounting for 25 percent of all such transplants. The graft-survival rate for kidneys from cadaver donors five years of age or younger was lower and the rejection rates were higher than when the donors were older. In addition, the incidence of graft thrombosis was inversely related to the age of the donor. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> These results suggest that the current practice of transplanting kidneys from very young donors into young recipients does not lead to optimal graft survival.\n\n【51】At the time of transplantation, the mean height deficit for all the recipients exceeded 2.0 SD, with the youngest children having the greatest deficit. Deceleration of growth is more frequent than stable growth in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> The children who were one year old or younger had an acceleration of growth soon after transplantation, but this group also had the worst long-term outcome. In contrast, adolescent recipients (13 to 17 years of age) had a deceleration in growth after transplantation. Our results suggest that delaying transplantation beyond the 12th year of age for children who need a transplant is disadvantageous in terms of improvement in height. Thus, vigorous attempts should be made to allocate more kidneys to children from 2 to 12 years of age. The process of allocating kidneys from cadavers to children has been addressed by the United Network for Organ Sharing, 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> which now adds points for children 10 years old and younger on the waiting list. The results of this policy are not yet available.\n\n【52】An additional important result that emerges from this study relates to the role of immunosuppression after transplantation. As in adults, sequential therapy after the transplantation of a cadaver kidney is increasingly popular in children. The use of multiple drugs in children increases the risk of cancer as well as that of infection, however. Of the deaths in this study group, 45 percent were attributable to infection. The increase in triple-drug immunosuppression therapy —from 52 percent of the recipients of kidneys from living related donors in 1987 to 80 percent in 1990 —indicates the need for a study of the effects of various treatment regimens (with three drugs, two drugs, or lower doses of therapeutic agents) on graft survival and patient growth.\n\n【53】Author Affiliations\n-------------------\n\n【54】From the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati (P.T.M.); the EMMES Corporation, Potomac, Md.

The early epicenters — New York City, Washington State, and the San Francisco Bay Area — implemented aggressive measures in mid-March, many of which remain in place. Other states and localities opted for milder restrictions, acted much later, or barely intervened at all. Many states began unwinding restrictions weeks ago, although surging case numbers are prompting some to change course. The patchwork nature of the response helps explain the current situation: Covid-19’s spread now has many different trajectories, which partly track jurisdictional boundaries. In the third week of July, for example, Covid-19 incidence was 10 times as high in some states as in others.\n\n【3】 States with Orders Restricting Interstate Travel, March 17 through July 15, 2020.\n\n【4】Start dates shown reflect the day on which the order came into effect. Information is from state government websites, news reports, and Ballotpedia ( https://ballotpedia.org . opens in new tab ).\n\n【5】Many jurisdictions have responded to the unevenness of the unfolding pandemic by battening down their borders. Nearly half the states have imposed interstate travel restrictions to date (see graph ). Eight have imposed restrictions on entrants from all states, 12 have imposed them only on entrants from selected high-prevalence areas, and 4 have shifted between these positions. A common feature of these orders is a requirement that entrants — both residents and nonresidents — self-quarantine for 14 days, although news reports suggest that states are not actively monitoring compliance. Several states recently modified their orders to permit proof of negative tests for Covid-19 infection in lieu of self-quarantine. A stark illustration of the shifting geographic dynamics is that some states, such as Florida and Texas, that months ago targeted “fugitives” from Covid-19 hotspots in the Northeast now find the tables turned.\n\n【6】Other federations have turned to controls on movement, too. Interprovincial travel restrictions have been a prominent feature of the Covid-19 response in Canada; they are beginning to give way to other arrangements, such as the “Atlantic bubble,” a regional pact that lowers travel barriers across Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Four of Australia’s eight states and territories are currently restricting all domestic entrants, three restrict entrants from certain states, and one maintains an open border. In Germany, the federal and state governments have agreed to frame travel bans around small, local areas of outbreaks within states.\n\n【7】In the United States, attempts to restrict interstate travel present distinctive legal issues. The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized an implicit constitutional right to travel, consisting of three elements: the right to enter and leave a state, the right “to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien” when visiting a state, and the right to become a citizen of any state. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> The first element is among the liberty interests protected by the due process clauses of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution; the second and third elements are grounded in the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.\n\n【8】When laws infringing the right to travel across state lines are challenged in court, they are usually subjected to heightened scrutiny: courts uphold them only if they serve an important government interest (variously described as “substantial” or “compelling”) and are “narrowly tailored” — meaning that the government’s purpose cannot feasibly be achieved through less restrictive means. The Supreme Court has never explained the nature and extent of the right to travel during a natural disaster or public health crisis. Precedent upholding state and local governments’ authority to quarantine incoming ships (domestic and foreign) for health reasons is relevant but predates modern right-to-travel cases. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Courts could choose to apply no greater judicial scrutiny than they do to many other legal measures adopted to fight contagious diseases; following the seminal holding in _Jacobson v. Massachusetts_ , courts typically ask only whether such measures are reasonable and necessary. But it seems more likely that courts will choose the heightened scrutiny they have applied to public health orders affecting specially protected rights, such as church attendance and abortion access.\n\n【9】Indeed, two federal trial courts have recently done just that in Covid-19 right-to-travel cases, with different results. One court suspended Kentucky’s orders that residents and nonresidents entering the state must self-quarantine for 14 days, finding them overbroad. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> In a poorly reasoned opinion, the court simply assumed that a less restrictive alternative existed, without indicating what it was. Nor did the court address the state’s arguments that the orders were time limited, included some exceptions, didn’t affect intrastate travel, and could be no narrower because Covid-19 conditions were constantly changing in other states.\n\n【10】In Maine, an alliance of campground and restaurant owners and prospective visitors challenged the state’s mandatory self-quarantine for incoming travelers, which applied to both residents and nonresidents. The court turned away the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, noting that the less restrictive alternatives they offered were “unworkable.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> However, the court expressed openness to hearing additional evidence about alternatives as the suit progressed.\n\n【11】In a third lawsuit, three U.S. mainland residents who own property in Hawaii and one Hawaii resident have challenged that state’s mandatory self-quarantine of all entrants. The U.S. Department of Justice has intervened with a “statement of interest” supporting the plaintiffs, as it did in the Maine case. The nub of the federal government’s argument is that these states’ rules could have been crafted less restrictively; they could have been applied only to visitors from Covid-19 hotspots or exempted visitors who tested negative for or had recovered from Covid-19. On July 2, a federal district court judge rejected this argument. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Applying the more lenient standard of review from _Jacobson_ , the court found ample evidence that the restrictions were justified by the emergency at hand and concluded that it would reach the same result applying heightened scrutiny. The same judge invoked similar reasoning on July 22 to reject another attempt at suspending Hawaii’s travel restrictions; she noted that the spike in Covid-19 cases and deaths since early July had made the case for requiring entrants to self-quarantine even stronger.\n\n【12】Notably, the orders challenged to date have applied to residents as well as nonresidents entering the state. Even so, the court that initially upheld Maine’s order was persuaded that it discriminated against out-of-state residents in practice because visitors who don’t own a home in Maine would have greater difficulty self-quarantining. This finding matters because when states treat out-of-state travelers differently, they confront greater constitutional uncertainty than when their regulations affect residents and nonresidents even-handedly. Courts are mindful that, historically, differential travel restrictions have served as a pretext for turning away minorities or impoverished people and for economic protectionism. Courts also tend to be more skeptical when exceptions are granted to some interests and activities but not to other, similar ones.\n\n【13】In sum, states seeking to impose interstate travel restrictions must navigate a very uncertain legal path, aiming for rules that are neither over- nor under-inclusive. Nevertheless, basic legal principles suggest that travel restrictions stand the best chance of withstanding constitutional scrutiny if they apply equally to residents and nonresidents, allow well-justified exceptions (e.g., for people with recent negative SARS-CoV-2 tests), are time limited and regularly reviewed, and are grounded in epidemiologic data (e.g., focused on entrants from states with higher incidence of Covid-19). Conscientious judges will carefully weigh the gravity of local pandemic conditions and consider whether less restrictive alternatives, such as mass testing at the border, might do as well in containing spread.\n\n【14】Whether or not the travel restrictions ultimately pass legal muster, the impulse to adopt them is understandable. Early in the pandemic, states with few cases wanted to keep it that way. Today, people in areas that have endured crushing losses of liberty worry that unregulated borders will jeopardize their hard-won gains in controlling Covid-19.\n\n【15】Yet state or regional isolationism is a poor substitute for national leadership in pandemic response. Even as it refused to suspend Maine’s travel restrictions, the Maine court quoted Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo’s admonition in _Baldwin v. Seelig_ , an economic protectionism case, that “The Constitution was framed … upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.” Cardozo’s plea for unity could be read today as a call for the coordinated, coherent federal response to Covid-19 that has been so lacking. Such a response might have mitigated the disparities now driving interstate divisions and the desperation states feel to protect themselves when no one else will. Infectious diseases may not recognize political boundaries, but disease-control policies certainly do.\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on August 5, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-1:<u>From Stanford Law School and Stanford Health Policy and the Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA (D.M.S., M.M.M.); and Wake Forest University Schools of Law and Medicine, Wake Forest, NC (M.A.H.).</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 139KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【23】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【24】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) at a dose of 30 mg twice daily or aspirin at a dose of 81 mg twice daily while they were in the hospital. After hospital discharge, the patients continued to receive thromboprophylaxis according to the clinical protocols of each hospital. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, and bleeding complications.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】A total of 12,211 patients were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (6101 patients) or low-molecular-weight heparin (6110 patients). Patients had a mean (±SD) age of 44.6±17.8 years, 0.7% had a history of venous thromboembolism, and 2.5% had a history of cancer. Patients received a mean of 8.8±10.6 in-hospital thromboprophylaxis doses and were prescribed a median 21-day supply of thromboprophylaxis at discharge. Death occurred in 47 patients (0.78%) in the aspirin group and in 45 patients (0.73%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.05 percentage points; 96.2% confidence interval, −0.27 to 0.38; P<0.001 for a noninferiority margin of 0.75 percentage points). Deep-vein thrombosis occurred in 2.51% of patients in the aspirin group and 1.71% in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.80 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31). The incidence of pulmonary embolism (1.49% in each group), bleeding complications, and other serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】In patients with extremity fractures that had been treated operatively or with any pelvic or acetabular fracture, thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing death and was associated with low incidences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and low 90-day mortality. 删除2:<u>删除5:<u>(Funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; PREVENT CLOT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02984384 . opens in new tab .)</u></u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nAspirin vs. Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin after a Fracture  \n_01:45_\n\n【13】Venous thromboembolism is a well-recognized, potentially fatal complication after orthopedic trauma. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-4 </a></sup></u> Numerous clinical guidelines recommend thromboprophylaxis therapy to reduce the risk of death and complications associated with venous thromboembolism after traumatic orthopedic injuries. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8</a></sup></u>\n\n【14】Findings from recent trials and meta-analyses suggest that aspirin may be an effective thromboprophylaxis alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin in patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty, with a more favorable safety profile. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-12 </a></sup></u> However, evidence from head-to-head comparisons among patients with fractures that have been treated operatively is limited. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,13,14 </a></sup></u> Patients with fractures have shown a strong preference for aspirin if clinical outcomes are similar among thromboprophylaxis options, given the lower cost of aspirin and its oral administration (as compared with subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin). 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,16</a></sup></u>\n\n【15】We conducted the Prevention of Clot in Orthopaedic Trauma (PREVENT CLOT) trial to examine the effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis with aspirin as compared with low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with a fracture. This pragmatic, randomized trial was designed from the perspective of a hospital thromboprophylaxis policy and aimed to assess whether aspirin would be noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin with regard to thromboembolic outcomes in patients with orthopedic trauma.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design\n------------\n\n【18】We conducted the PREVENT CLOT trial at 21 trauma centers in the United States and Canada. The trial was investigator-initiated, designed by the protocol committee, and planned and conducted in collaboration with patients and other relevant stakeholders. The trial objectives and design have been published previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> The protocol (including the statistical analysis plan) and the Supplementary Appendix (including detailed descriptions of the outcomes) are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\n\n【19】Members of the writing committee performed the analyses and wrote the first draft of the manuscript. All the members of the writing committee made revisions to the draft, agreed to submit the manuscript for publication, and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. There were no agreements between the sponsor and the authors or their institutions concerning the confidentiality of the data.\n\n【20】Trial Oversight\n---------------\n\n【21】The sponsor had no role in the design or conduct of the trial, collection and analysis of the data, or preparation of the manuscript. The Department of Orthopedics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium Coordinating Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health co-led the trial and oversaw data collection by research staff at the enrolling centers. The trial was approved by the research ethics boards at the coordinating center and at all participating hospitals.\n\n【22】Patients\n--------\n\n【23】Patients who were included in the trial were 18 years of age or older and had an extremity fracture that was treated operatively or a fracture of the pelvis or acetabulum that was treated operatively or nonoperatively. We included upper extremity fractures from the shoulder to the wrist and lower extremity fractures from the hip to the midfoot. We excluded fractures of the hand (carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges) and forefoot (metatarsals and phalanges). Key exclusion criteria were presentation to the hospital more than 48 hours after injury or receipt of three or more doses of thromboprophylaxis before providing informed consent for enrollment in the trial. Patients who had a history of a venous thromboembolism diagnosis in the past 6 months, were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of admission, or had a chronic blood-clotting disorder were excluded. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the Supplementary Appendix and the protocol . All the participants provided written informed consent.\n\n【24】Randomization and Interventions\n-------------------------------\n\n【25】Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive aspirin or low-molecular-weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis. Randomization was performed with variable block sizes and stratified according to clinical site with the use of an automated structure embedded into the Research Electronic Data Capture system. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> Patients and their treating physicians were aware of the trial-group assignments. However, the assigned thromboprophylaxis was concealed for purposes of data monitoring, adjudication, and analysis.\n\n【26】Patients in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group received subcutaneous enoxaparin at a predetermined dose of 30 mg twice daily. Adjusted dose levels were permitted for patients with obesity or renal disease or as the result of other medical indications according to the protocols at each site. Patients in the aspirin group received aspirin at a dose of 81 mg twice daily to balance the probability of adherence to a twice-daily intervention. The duration of thromboprophylaxis could end at hospital discharge or continue on the basis of the clinical protocols of each hospital, given the lack of consensus on the appropriate duration of treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6,8 </a></sup></u> However, sites were instructed not to vary the indication or duration of thromboprophylaxis on the basis of the group assignment.\n\n【27】Adherence to treatment was monitored daily during the index hospital admission and at the time of discharge from the hospital. Adherence to the protocol was determined by two conditions. First, the patient had to adhere to at least 80% of the assigned in-hospital trial medication doses. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> This definition allowed doses that were scheduled during the inpatient period to be missed for medical reasons (e.g., medication withheld for surgery). Second, if thromboprophylaxis therapy was prescribed at the time of hospital discharge, it had to be the trial medication that had been randomly assigned to that patient. A patient who met both conditions was considered to have adherence to the protocol.\n\n【28】Trial Outcomes\n--------------\n\n【29】The primary outcome was death from any cause at 90 days. The initial primary outcome was death related to pulmonary embolism, with death from any cause as a secondary outcome. The primary outcome was changed to death from any cause in January 2021, before publication of the protocol, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> finalization of the statistical analysis plan, completion of recruitment, or review of the trial data. The change in primary outcome was made because of concern regarding misclassification and competing risk with the outcome of cause-specific death. We used the LexisNexis Accurint database, including data from the Limited Access Death Master File, to obtain additional mortality information with regard to patients with unknown status at 90 days after randomization.\n\n【30】Secondary efficacy outcomes included cause-specific death, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis. A three-person committee whose members were unaware of trial-group assignments adjudicated cause-specific death with a specific focus on death related to pulmonary embolism. Three grades of cause-specific death were used: related to pulmonary embolism, possibly related to pulmonary embolism, and unlikely to be related to pulmonary embolism. Nonfatal pulmonary embolism was also adjudicated by the committee and reported as any, massive, submassive, clinically significant, or asymptomatic and in a segmental or subsegmental location. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20 </a></sup></u> In addition, deep-vein thrombosis events were subclassified according to the proximal or distal location. The criteria for adjudicating secondary outcomes are described in the Supplementary Appendix . The protocol did not specify screening for pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis in asymptomatic patients.\n\n【31】Secondary safety outcomes included bleeding events, wound complications, and surgical-site infections. Bleeding events included symptomatic bleeding into a critical area or organ; bleeding that caused a drop in the hemoglobin level of 20 g per liter or more within a 24-hour period and led to a transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells; or bleeding that led to reoperation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> Wound complications included wound drainage, hematoma, or seroma of an orthopedic injury that led to subsequent surgery. We defined surgical-site infections using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for a deep incisional or organ-space infection leading to surgical treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>21</a></sup></u>\n\n【32】All the trial outcomes were evaluated within 90 days after randomization and were ascertained by means of an interview with the patient that was performed by the clinical research team during a clinical appointment or by telephone. Additional methods used in patients who ceased clinical follow-up before 90 days or who did not respond to telephone contact are described in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【33】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【34】The sample-size calculation used in the trial assumed a baseline incidence of death from any cause in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group of 1.0%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,22 </a></sup></u> On the basis of surveys of patients and surgeons, we established a noninferiority margin for death from any cause of 0.75 percentage points. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> 删除2:<u>(Details of the statistical analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix and protocol .)</u> We calculated that a sample size of 12,200 patients would provide the trial with 95% power to determine whether aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin with respect to death from any cause. The sample-size calculation accounted for two interim analyses with an O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundary and 7.5% attrition. The interim analyses, with trial-group assignments masked, were performed by a coordinating center analyst and evaluated only by the data and safety monitoring board. No changes resulted from the interim analyses.\n\n【35】We followed the intention-to-treat approach for our primary analysis. The primary outcome was evaluated with the use of treatment-specific Kaplan–Meier estimators, and we assessed noninferiority with the upper boundary of a two-sided 96.2% confidence interval (to account for two interim analyses) and a noninferiority margin of 0.75 percentage points. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> If the noninferiority criterion was satisfied, we planned to test for superiority.\n\n【36】We assessed all secondary outcomes using cumulative incidence functions that included death from any cause as a competing risk for nonfatal events and cause-specific death as a competing risk for other causes of death. If a patient’s final outcome status was missing, the data were censored at the patient’s last known clinical encounter. A secondary analysis estimated the treatment effects in the per-protocol population of patients who adhered to at least 80% of their in-hospital doses of medication and who received the randomly assigned trial drug at the time of discharge if thromboprophylaxis was prescribed. We reported risk-difference estimates and 95% confidence intervals for all secondary outcomes but did not perform formal hypothesis testing. We did not stratify treatment estimates according to center to avoid the imposition of additional modeling assumptions that might arise given the number of centers relative to the low event rates. We report treatment-specific 90-day outcome probabilities, as calculated by a Kaplan–Meier estimator for the primary outcome and cumulative-incidence functions for the secondary outcomes. This method was chosen over simple percentages to reflect the differential follow-up in some patients and for consistency with our treatment-effect estimates. We did not adjust the widths of the secondary outcome confidence intervals for multiple comparisons, and therefore the 95% confidence intervals should not be used to infer treatment effects.\n\n【37】We included one prespecified subgroup analysis for death from any cause that explored the effect-modification according to age (<60 years or ≥60 years). 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> All analyses were performed with R Software, version 4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing).\n\n【38】Results\n-------\n\n【39】Patients\n--------\n\n【40】From April 2017 through August 2021, we obtained written informed consent from 12,211 patients who were randomly assigned to receive aspirin (6101 patients) or low-molecular-weight heparin (6110 patients) for the primary analysis 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Patient follow-up was completed in February 2022, with primary outcome data available for 96.8% of the patients.\n\n【41】Table 1.  Table 1. Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【42】The majority of the patients were men (62.3%), and the mean (±SD) age was 44.6±17.8 years. The median Injury Severity Score (a standardized measure of the severity of traumatic injuries based on the worst injuries present across a maximum of three different body regions; scores range from 1 to 75, with a higher score indicating more severe injury) was 9 (interquartile range, 4 to 10). The demographic, medical, and surgical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations and were largely representative of the target population 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Tables S3 through S5)</u>. Orthopedic trauma with or without surgery was the only known risk factor of thromboembolic events in 3328 patients (27.3%). Most patients (69.2%) had received fewer than two doses of low-molecular-weight heparin before consent was obtained 删除2:<u>(Table S6)</u>. The mean hospital duration was 5.3±5.7 days. At the time of hospital discharge, the injured extremities in 5447 patients (45.4%) were non–weight-bearing, and 4373 patients (36.4%) were allowed to bear full weight on their injured extremities 删除2:<u>(Tables S7 and S8)</u>.\n\n【43】Adherence to the Assigned Intervention\n--------------------------------------\n\n【44】The inpatient protocol-adherence criteria were met in 5778 patients (94.7%) in the aspirin group and in 5291 patients (96.9%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group. The mean number of inpatient doses of a trial medication was 8.6±10.8 in the aspirin group and 9.1±10.5 in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group. At the time of discharge, 91% the patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis: 93.6% in the aspirin group and 88.8% in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group 删除2:<u>(Table S9)</u>. The median duration of thromboprophylaxis prescribed at discharge was 21 days (interquartile range, 19 to 21) in the aspirin group and 21 days (interquartile range, 14 to 21) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group. The protocol-adherence criteria at discharge were met by a total of 5760 patients (94.4%) in the aspirin group and 5305 patients (86.6%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group. The per-protocol population included 87.4% of the enrolled patients (90.2% of the aspirin group and 84.6% of the low-molecular-weight–heparin group) who met both the inpatient and discharge protocol-adherence criteria.\n\n【45】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【46】Table 2. Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes. Figure 1.  Figure 1. Estimated Difference in Death from Any Cause and Cause-Specific Death in the Intention-to-Treat and Per-Protocol Populations.\n\n【47】The per-protocol population included only patients who were adherent to at least 80% of their in-hospital medication doses and who were prescribed the assigned trial drug at hospital discharge if thromboprophylaxis was recommended. Because the statistical analysis plan did not include a provision for correcting for multiplicity when conducting tests for secondary or other outcomes, results are reported as point estimates. The primary outcome is reported with a 96.2% confidence interval to account for the interim analyses. The secondary outcomes are reported with 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, so the intervals should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects for secondary outcomes. LMWH denotes low-molecular-weight heparin, and PE pulmonary embolism.\n\n【48】During the 90-day follow-up period, death occurred in 47 of 6101 patients (90-day probability, 0.78%) in the aspirin group and 45 of 6110 patients (90-day probability, 0.73%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.05 percentage points; 96.2% confidence interval \\[CI\\], −0.27 to 0.38) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , Figure 1 , and Fig. S2)</u>. Aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin (P<0.001) but not superior (P=0.63) in preventing death from any cause. A per-protocol analysis of the primary outcome produced similar findings (difference, 0.03 percentage points; 96.2% CI, −0.31 to 0.38). Of the 92 patients who died, 79 (85.9%) had been adherent to the protocol and had received a mean of 13.1±12.1 inpatient doses of trial medication. We did not observe a differential treatment effect according to patient age on death from any cause: among patients less than 60 years of age, the difference was 0.02 percentage points (95% CI, −0.21 to 0.25), and among patients at least 60 years of age or older, the difference was 0.16 percentage points (95% CI, −0.94 to 1.25) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>.\n\n【49】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【50】The between-group difference in the 90-day probability that death was related to pulmonary embolism was similar to the difference in probability that death was not related to pulmonary embolism (−0.02 percentage points and −0.03 percentage points, respectively) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , Figs. S4 and S5, and Table S10)</u>. The between-group difference in the 90-day probability that death had possibly been caused by pulmonary embolism (0.08 percentage points) was similar to that of the primary outcome 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S6)</u>.\n\n【51】Nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in 90 patients (90-day probability, 1.49%) in the aspirin group and in 90 patients (90-day probability, 1.49%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.00 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.43 to 0.43) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S7)</u>. The majority of nonfatal pulmonary embolisms took place within 7 days (interquartile range, 3 to 22) after randomization, and venous thromboembolism surveillance was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S11)</u>.\n\n【52】Deep-vein thrombosis occurred in 151 patients (90-day probability, 2.51%) in the aspirin group and in 103 patients (90-day probability, 1.71%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.80 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Fig. S8)</u>. The between-group difference in distal deep-vein thrombosis was 0.58 percentage points (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.96), and the between-group difference in proximal deep-vein thrombosis was 0.25 percentage points (95% CI, −0.12 to 0.62). The median time from randomization to the occurrence of deep-vein thrombosis was 16 days (interquartile range, 7 to 35).\n\n【53】Safety Outcomes\n---------------\n\n【54】Bleeding events occurred in 834 patients (90-day probability, 13.72%) in the aspirin group and in 869 patients (90-day probability, 14.27%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, −0.54 percentage points; 95% CI, −1.78 to 0.69) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 , Table S12, and Fig. S9)</u>. The median time to a bleeding event was 2 days after randomization (interquartile range, 1 to 4) in the aspirin group and 2 days after randomization in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (interquartile range, 1 to 3). Wound complications occurred in 8 patients (90-day probability, 0.13%) in the aspirin group and in 14 patients (90-day probability, 0.23%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, −0.10 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.25 to 0.05) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S10)</u>. Deep surgical-site infections occurred in 103 patients (90-day probability, 1.73%) in the aspirin group and in 93 patients (90-day probability, 1.55%) in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group (difference, 0.18 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.28 to 0.64) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S11)</u>. The occurrence of other serious adverse events was similar in the two groups 删除2:<u>(Table S13)</u>.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】We found that thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of death from any cause in patients with a pelvic or acetabular fracture treated with or without surgery or a fracture of the extremities treated operatively. The result of the prespecified per-protocol analysis was consistent with the primary intention-to-treat finding. The finding of noninferiority for aspirin in the prevention of death from any cause was supported by consistent results with regard to the secondary outcomes, including the outcome of death related to pulmonary embolism and the outcome of nonfatal pulmonary embolism. Orthopedic trauma was the only known risk factor for venous thromboembolism for one quarter of the patients. Fewer deep-vein thromboses were noted among patients in the low-molecular-weight–heparin group than among those in the aspirin group (2.51% vs. 1.71%; difference, 0.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31) as well as fewer distal deep-vein thromboses (1.45% vs. 0.86%; difference, 0.58 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.96). In addition, there was no signal of an increased safety risk with aspirin thromboprophylaxis in this patient population or evidence of differential effectiveness on the basis of patient age.\n\n【57】Our results align with those from a previous trial, which suggests that aspirin is as safe and effective as low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing fatal thromboembolism after orthopedic trauma. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Our observation with regard to fewer deep-vein thrombosis events in patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin in this trial is consistent with the point estimates of three previous trials that involved patients who had undergone hip or knee arthroplasty. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24-26 </a></sup></u> However, the differences that were reported in two of the three previous trials were not statistically significant.\n\n【58】We chose death from any cause as the primary outcome for the trial owing to its paramount importance to patients, its designation in a Cochrane review of thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients, and its scientific reliability. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,15 </a></sup></u> However, we also acknowledge that protection against nonfatal thromboembolic events bears careful consideration when thromboprophylaxis agents are compared. As such, we included venous thromboembolism and safety outcomes to provide a more complete comparison of the two trial drugs.\n\n【59】Previous thromboprophylaxis trials have used a composite outcome of death, pulmonary embolism, or deep-vein thrombosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27,28 </a></sup></u> The size of this trial allowed for the evaluation of each of these outcomes. Health care providers along with patients with traumatic fractures and similar characteristics to those enrolled in this trial can now weigh the noninferiority of aspirin to low-molecular-weight heparin (difference, 0.05 percentage points; 96.2% CI, −0.27 to 0.38) and similar findings of pulmonary embolism in the two groups (difference, 0.00 percentage points; 95% CI, −0.43 to 0.43) against the increased cost and administration by injection of low-molecular-weight heparin and its association with fewer deep-vein thromboses (difference, 0.80 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.31).\n\n【60】This trial has several limitations. First, we anticipated enrollment challenges at the initial hospital admission owing to the critical injuries of the trial population. Therefore, we allowed eligible patients to receive up to two doses of low-molecular-weight heparin as standard care before consent was obtained. Because the half-life of low-molecular-weight heparin is 3 to 4 hours, 删除3:<u><sup><a>29 </a></sup></u> we suspect that these initial doses were unlikely to have affected the trial findings. Conversely, the longer half-life of aspirin might have provided differential sustained protection in patients who were discharged without thromboprophylaxis. Second, considering the variability in clinical guideline recommendations for the duration of thromboprophylaxis at different institutions and our pragmatic trial design, we did not mandate the duration of thromboprophylaxis therapy. Differences in the duration of thromboprophylaxis therapy after hospital discharge may have influenced the outcomes. However, we did monitor the prescribed duration of thromboprophylaxis, which was similar in the two treatment groups. Third, the trial had an open-label design, so there was a potential for diagnostic suspicion or surveillance bias in our secondary outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>30 </a></sup></u> However, the risk of this bias was reduced by an objective primary outcome of death from any cause and by the blinded adjudication of death related to pulmonary embolism and of pulmonary embolism events. Also, we observed that a similar proportion of patients in the two groups had undergone screening tests. Finally, the primary outcome was changed from death related to pulmonary embolism to death from any cause after enrollment began but before we published the protocol, 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> finalized the statistical analysis plan or completed enrollment. We completed this change without any knowledge of the trial outcomes.\n\n【61】Despite these limitations, our findings are clinically meaningful. Patients with orthopedic trauma strongly favor aspirin over low-molecular-weight heparin because of the lower costs and less burdensome administration of aspirin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,16 </a></sup></u> In hospitalized patients, oral medications are less often subject to nonadministration than injectable thromboprophylaxis drugs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>31,32 </a></sup></u> The trial was performed at 21 sites with high follow-up (96.8%) and adherence (87.4%). An adjudication committee whose members were unaware of trial-group assignments reviewed all outcomes of death and pulmonary embolism, which further verified the reliability of our findings.\n\n【62】We found that thromboprophylaxis with aspirin was noninferior to low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of fatal events in patients with orthopedic trauma and was associated with low frequencies of deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death from any cause at 90 days. This finding was consistent for outcomes of death related to pulmonary embolism and nonfatal pulmonary embolism. In addition, we found no evidence of additional safety risks associated with aspirin thromboprophylaxis in our trial population.\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute award (PCS-1511-32745).</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【66】参考删除-1:<u>The members of the writing committee (Robert V.

Questions about pulse oximeter technology have been raised, given its original development in populations that were not racially diverse. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2 </a></sup></u> The clinical significance of potential racial bias in pulse oximetry measurement is unknown.\n\n【3】Our study involved adult inpatients who were receiving supplemental oxygen at the University of Michigan Hospital (from January through July 2020) and patients in intensive care units at 178 hospitals (from 2014 through 2015). 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> We analyzed paired pulse oximetry measures of oxygen saturation and measures of arterial oxygen saturation in arterial blood gas, with all evaluations performed within 10 minutes of each other. To ensure that the arterial oxygen saturation was directly measured by co-oximetry, we limited analyses to measures of arterial blood gas that included carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin saturations.\n\n【4】We tested for occult hypoxemia (i.e., an arterial oxygen saturation of <88% despite an oxygen saturation of 92 to 96% on pulse oximetry) among patients who identified their race as Black or White. Since a low level of peripheral perfusion could lower the accuracy of oxygen saturation values, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> we also estimated the percentage of patients with occult hypoxemia after adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) in the University of Michigan cohort. Additional details regarding the methods that were used in the study are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.\n\n【5】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Accuracy of Pulse Oximetry in Measuring Arterial Oxygen Saturation, According to Race.\n\n【6】Shown is a comparison of paired measurements of pulse oximetry readings of oxygen saturation and time-matched directly measured arterial oxygen saturation among hospitalized patients who were stratified according to race. The shaded area indicates an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 88%. In the box plot, the horizontal line within each box represents the median, the top and bottom of each box represent the upper and lower limits of the interquartile range, and the whiskers represent 1.5 times the interquartile range. Outliers outside this range are indicated by data points.\n\n【7】We analyzed 10,789 pairs of measures of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturation in arterial blood gas obtained from 1333 White patients and 276 Black patients in the University of Michigan cohort and 37,308 pairs obtained from 7342 White patients and 1050 Black patients in the multicenter cohort. In the University of Michigan cohort, among the patients who had an oxygen saturation of 92 to 96% on pulse oximetry, an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 88% was found in 88 of 749 arterial blood gas measurements in Black patients (11.7%; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 8.5 to 16.0) and in 99 of 2778 measurements in White patients (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.7 to 4.7) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The findings in the adjusted analyses were similar to those in the unadjusted analyses, with an arterial blood gas oxygen saturation of less than 88% in 11.4% (95% CI, 7.6 to 15.2) of the measurements in Black patients and in 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.6) of those in White patients. Results were also consistent after the exclusion of patients with an elevated carboxyhemoglobin level or diabetes. 删除2:<u>(Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .)</u>\n\n【8】In unadjusted analyses, the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for detecting an arterial blood gas oxygen saturation of less than 88% according to the oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.87) among Black patients and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.91) among White patients (P=0.003). In the multicenter cohort, the unadjusted analyses involving patients with an oxygen saturation of 92 to 96% on pulse oximetry showed an arterial blood gas oxygen saturation of less than 88% in 160 of 939 measurements in Black patients (17.0%; 95% CI, 12.2 to 23.3) and in 546 of 8795 measurements in White patients (6.2%; 95% CI, 5.4 to 7.1).\n\n【9】Thus, in two large cohorts, Black patients had nearly three times the frequency of occult hypoxemia that was not detected by pulse oximetry as White patients. Given the widespread use of pulse oximetry for medical decision making, these findings have some major implications, especially during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Our results suggest that reliance on pulse oximetry to triage patients and adjust supplemental oxygen levels may place Black patients at increased risk for hypoxemia. It is important to note that not all Black patients who had a pulse oximetry value of 92 to 96% had occult hypoxemia. However, the variation in risk according to race necessitates the integration of pulse oximetry with other clinical and patient-reported data.\n\n【10】In device applications, the Food and Drug Administration requires reporting of demographic subgroups to mitigate risk. However, our findings highlight an ongoing need to understand and correct racial bias in pulse oximetry and other forms of medical technology.\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Michael W. Sjoding, M.D.  \nRobert P.

We studied 130 nondiabetic adult southwestern American Indians (74 men and 56 women) from 54 families to determine whether the resting metabolic rate, as measured by indirect calorimetry, is a familial trait that is independent of individual differences in fat-free mass (estimated mass of metabolically active tissue), age, and sex. We found that most of the variance in the resting metabolic rate (83 percent, P<0.0001) was accounted for by three covariates — fat-free mass, age, and sex — and that fat-free mass was the most important determinant. Family membership accounted for an additional 11 percent (P<0.0001) of the variance in the resting metabolic rate. Thus, resting metabolic rate is a familial trait in this population, and it is independent of differences in fat-free mass, age, and sex.\n\n【2】We also found that persons from families with lower resting metabolic rates were no more obese than persons from families with higher metabolic rates. This finding may be partly explained by the close correlation between fat-free mass and percentage of body fat (r = 0.81, P<0.0001), which indicates that the resting metabolic rate, as adjusted for fat-free mass, is already partly adjusted for obesity. Only prospective studies will elucidate whether the familial dependence of the resting metabolic rate is a contributing mechanism to the familial predisposition to obesity. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1986; 315: 96–100.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Recent data show that although Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population, they account for 21% of deaths from Covid-19 but only 3% of enrollees in vaccine trials. This problem threatens both the validity and the generalizability of the trial results and is of particular concern in vaccine trials, in which differences in lifetime environmental exposures can result in differences in immunologic responses that could affect both safety and efficacy. Despite long-standing calls from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve the participation of underrepresented subgroups in drug trials, the problem persists. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】What are the barriers to greater participation of Black people in Covid-19 trials? Although they are multiple, a critical factor is the deep and justified lack of trust that many Black Americans have for the health care system in general and clinical research in particular. This distrust is often traced to the legacy of the infamous syphilis study at Tuskegee, in which investigators withheld treatment from hundreds of Black men in order to study the natural history of the disease. But the distrust is far more deeply rooted, in centuries of well-documented examples of racist exploitation by American physicians and researchers. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】How can these long-standing barriers to trust be overcome? The presidents of Dillard and Xavier Universities, two of the 104 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the United States, recently wrote to their communities saying that they themselves were participating in one of the vaccine trials and asking their students, faculty, and staff to consider doing the same. The pushback from parents of some students came quickly. One wrote on Xavier’s Facebook page, “Our children are not lab rats for drug companies. I cannot believe that Xavier is participating in this. This is very disturbing given the history of drug trials in the black and brown communities.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】Presidents of the four historically Black U.S. medical schools recently called for measures to increase the participation of Black patients in clinical trials, correctly arguing that without such involvement, “there will be no proof that our patients should trust the vaccine.” The presidents added that “Black doctors are the best way to build trust in our communities” and called on other HBCUs to join the effort to “foster trust in communities throughout the country.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【7】Though we applaud these efforts, we fear that once again the responsibility for addressing the sequelae of centuries of racism is falling on Black people themselves. Our country has yet to comprehend adequately that overcoming racism is not primarily the responsibility of Black people; the racist ideas and practices that constitute today’s “structural racism” were created, and have been sustained, primarily by White people. It would be wrong, as well as ineffective, to ask Black communities to simply be more trusting. Clinicians, investigators, and pharmaceutical companies must provide convincing evidence — sufficient to overcome the extensive historical evidence to the contrary — that they are, in fact, trustworthy.\n\n【8】What can we do to earn and deserve increased trust?\n\n【9】First, trial sponsors and regulatory agencies can ensure that the informed-consent process is exemplary, including ensuring that all relevant aspects of the design and conduct of the clinical trials are maximally transparent.\n\n【10】Second, all clinical research depends on people who are willing to accept the risks posed by trial participation in order to improve health for the people who come after them. Black participants who agree to enroll in these trials have a right to expect and trust that Black communities will have fair access to vaccines once they become available. The recent guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) are notable in this regard, recommending that priority be given to “people who are considered to be the most disadvantaged or the worst off,” as defined by measures such as the Social Vulnerability Index created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Though this approach would not directly target people in specific racial or ethnic groups, it is functionally antiracist in that it prioritizes people who have suffered from the social determinants of poor health that are unfortunately prevalent in many Black communities.\n\n【11】Third, politicization of the vaccine trials has engendered widespread mistrust among the general public. The joint pledge by nine pharmaceutical companies that they will “stand with science” and not submit a vaccine for approval until it has been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy is welcome, but earning trust will require credible evidence that this pledge is being honored. Just as important, however, is that the evidence must not only be convincing to the general public, but — in the words of the NAS guidelines — also be perceived as convincing “by audiences who are socioeconomically, culturally, and educationally diverse, and who have distinct historical experiences with the health system.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Fourth, to earn and deserve trust from prospective trial participants, we must ensure that they will receive appropriate medical care if they are injured as a result of receiving an experimental vaccine. In addition to often lacking access to health care, Black people are also disproportionately likely to be uninsured, and pharmaceutical sponsors in the United States are not required to provide compensation to people who experience research-related injuries. Even when participants have insurance, there is no guarantee that they will be covered for such injuries. In many cases, injured participants will be forced to rely on the tort system for compensation — a situation that is morally indefensible, especially for participants who lack the means to engage in this time-consuming and expensive process. One way to demonstrate trustworthiness would be for the pharmaceutical companies sponsoring these trials to establish a fund to guarantee health care coverage and death benefits to patients and families as compensation for serious vaccine injuries or possible deaths.\n\n【13】When Covid-19 vaccines are eventually approved by the FDA, their success in Black and other communities will depend on whether members of these communities not only trust that they are safe and effective, but also believe that the organizations offering them are trustworthy. Trust could be earned more quickly by a collaboratively designed Operation Build Trustworthiness that matches the seriousness and scope of Operation Warp Speed. To be effective, this effort would need to be firmly grounded in grassroots involvement of individuals and organizations with solid, well-earned reputations for trustworthiness in Black and other minority communities, including respected elected representatives, trusted local and national faith leaders, community advocates, and others. Active, ongoing, and fully bidirectional collaboration, learning, and communication will be essential. Time is running short, and trustworthiness, not trust, must be our first and most urgent priority.\n\n【14】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【15】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【16】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on October 16, 2020, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>From the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL (R.C.W., D.A.H.); and the Center for Bioethics, Harvard Medical School, Boston (L.F., R.D.T.).</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>Supplementary Material\n----------------------</u>\n\n参考删除-1:<u>| Disclosure Forms | PDF | 179KB |\n| --- | --- | --- |</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>References _(5)_\n----------------</u>\n\n【22】参考删除-1:<u>1.  1\\.

Since thyroid lymphocytes are probably a major site of thyroid-antibody synthesis in Graves' disease and methimazole is concentrated in the thyroid during treatment, a local action of the drug on antibody production seems likely.

Annual arrivals of approximately 400,000 immigrants and 50,000 to 70,000 refugees from overseas are likely to contribute substantially to the tuberculosis burden among foreign-born persons in the United States.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects information on overseas screening for tuberculosis among U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees, along with follow-up evaluation after their arrival in the United States. We analyzed screening and follow-up data from the CDC to study the epidemiology of tuberculosis in these populations.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】From 1999 through 2005, a total of 26,075 smear-negative cases of tuberculosis (i.e., cases in which a chest radiograph was suggestive of active tuberculosis but sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli on 3 consecutive days) and 22,716 cases of inactive tuberculosis (i.e., cases in which a chest radiograph was suggestive of tuberculosis that was no longer clinically active) were diagnosed by overseas medical screening of 2,714,223 U.S.-bound immigrants, representing prevalences of 961 cases per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 949 to 973) and 837 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 826 to 848), respectively. Among 378,506 U.S.-bound refugees, smear-negative tuberculosis was diagnosed in 3923 and inactive tuberculosis in 10,743, representing prevalences of 1036 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1004 to 1068) and 2838 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 2785 to 2891), respectively. Active pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in the United States in 7.0% of immigrants and refugees with an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 1.6% of those with an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】Overseas screening for tuberculosis with follow-up evaluation after arrival in the United States is a high-yield intervention for identifying tuberculosis in U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees and could reduce the number of tuberculosis cases among foreign-born persons in the United States.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Tuberculosis is the second most common cause of death from infectious diseases in the world. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> During the period from 1990 through 2003, the incidence of tuberculosis increased globally. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 84.1% of the estimated 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis worldwide in 2005. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Global migration has greatly affected the epidemiology of tuberculosis in developed countries. In 2007, foreign-born persons accounted for 57.8% of new cases of tuberculosis in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> In that year, the tuberculosis rate in the United States was 20.6 cases and 2.1 cases per 100,000 population among foreign-born and U.S.-born persons, respectively. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Furthermore, 27.5% of tuberculosis cases among foreign-born persons are diagnosed within 2 years after the person's arrival in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Approximately 400,000 immigrants and 50,000 to 70,000 refugees arrive in the United States annually, many from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> Therefore, these populations are likely to contribute substantially to the tuberculosis burden among foreign-born persons in United States.\n\n【12】To eliminate tuberculosis in the United States, it is essential to control and prevent tuberculosis in foreign-born persons. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Overseas tuberculosis screening of U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees, coupled with follow-up evaluation after their arrival in the United States, is considered to be one intervention that may decrease the incidence of tuberculosis in foreign-born persons in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> Previous studies of this intervention have focused primarily on the follow-up evaluation at state and local levels, 删除3:<u><sup><a>9-17 </a></sup></u> although one recent study examined the efficacy of overseas screening for tuberculosis among U.S.-bound immigrants in Vietnam. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> To understand the epidemiology of tuberculosis in U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees, we analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notification system for tuberculosis in immigrants and refugees.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Populations of U.S.-Bound Immigrants and Refugees\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Demographic data for 2,714,223 immigrants who received a visa for permanent residence and who arrived in the United States during the period from 1999 through 2005 were obtained from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Demographic data for 378,506 refugees who arrived in the United States during the same period were obtained from the CDC's notification system for tuberculosis in immigrants and refugees, which collects information about overseas screening for tuberculosis and follow-up evaluation of immigrants and refugees after their arrival in the United States. The office of the Associate Director for Science, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, CDC, determined that this analysis was considered to be part of the CDC's public health surveillance activities, not human-subjects research, and therefore approval by an institutional review board and informed consent were not required.\n\n【16】Overseas Screening for Tuberculosis\n-----------------------------------\n\n【17】A medical examination performed overseas is required for U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees. The U.S. embassies and consulates appoint 400 to 800 licensed local physicians worldwide as panel physicians to perform the examinations. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> The U.S. Department of State sponsors refugees, but immigrants are responsible for paying for their own examinations. Although there is no formal certification process, the CDC provides technical guidance and oversight to the panel physicians. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8,19 </a></sup></u> Screening for tuberculosis is a major component of the examination. During the period from 1999 through 2005, the tuberculosis screening algorithm, which was based on the 1991 Technical Instructions for Panel Physicians, consisted of a standard posteroanterior radiograph of the chest for persons 15 years of age or older; in the case of those with a chest radiograph suggestive of active tuberculosis or with symptoms of tuberculosis, sputum specimens were obtained on 3 consecutive days and stained for acid-fast bacilli. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Panel physicians made local arrangements for the radiologic and laboratory examinations required as part of the screening. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> No mycobacterial cultures were obtained during the study period. Children younger than 15 years of age were required to undergo screening for tuberculosis only if they had a history of tuberculosis, signs or symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, or close contact with someone who had tuberculosis.\n\n【18】Persons were classified as having smear-positive tuberculosis if the chest radiograph was suggestive of active tuberculosis and one or more sputum smears were positive for acid-fast bacilli; smear-negative tuberculosis if the chest radiograph was suggestive of active tuberculosis and sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli on 3 consecutive days; inactive tuberculosis if the chest radiograph was suggestive of tuberculosis that was not clinically active (e.g., showing fibrosis, scarring, pleural thickening, diaphragmatic tenting, or blunting of costophrenic angles); or no tuberculosis, if the chest radiograph was normal. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> Persons with smear-positive tuberculosis had two options: either complete a course of tuberculosis therapy, administered over a specified period of time with documented smear negativity at the end of treatment, at which point they would be reclassified as having inactive tuberculosis, or receive tuberculosis treatment until sputum smears became negative and then apply for a medical immigration waiver. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Persons with immigration waivers were allowed to travel to the United States but were instructed to report to the U.S. jurisdictional public health agency for evaluation. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Persons with smear-negative or inactive tuberculosis were allowed to travel without restriction, although a voluntary evaluation visit to the U.S. jurisdictional health agency after their arrival in the United States was recommended. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7,8 </a></sup></u> Although aggregate national data are unavailable, previous studies indicate that the percentage of post-arrival follow-up evaluations that are completed varies widely among tuberculosis-control programs of state and local health departments, ranging from 63.6 to 97.3%. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,10,13,14</a></sup></u>\n\n【19】Follow-up Evaluation after Arrival in the United States\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】When immigrants and refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis arrive at U.S. ports of entry, their medical-examination forms (Department of State forms DS-2053, DS-3024, DS-3025, and DS-3026) are collected by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security and forwarded to the CDC Quarantine Station that has jurisdiction over the port of arrival. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> The CDC notifies health departments of arriving immigrants and refugees in whom tuberculosis was diagnosed overseas. Health department physicians are asked to conduct a follow-up evaluation, assign a post-arrival tuberculosis diagnosis, and sign and return the follow-up evaluation form (CDC form 75.17) to the CDC. We categorized the status of these immigrants and refugees in the following way: follow-up completed, if the evaluation form included information about a tuberculosis diagnosis; follow-up not completed, if the evaluation form had other follow-up information but did not have information about a tuberculosis diagnosis; lost to follow-up, if the evaluation form had no follow-up information or indicated that the person had not been located; or follow-up form not received by the CDC. On the basis of results of chest radiography and sputum smears, health department physicians assigned one of the following post-arrival diagnoses for persons who completed the follow-up evaluation: active pulmonary tuberculosis; extrapulmonary tuberculosis; pulmonary tuberculosis, activity undetermined; inactive tuberculosis; or no tuberculosis.\n\n【21】The percentage of post-arrival follow-up evaluations that were completed could not be calculated, since some evaluation forms were not received by the CDC. We therefore estimated a lower percentage and a higher percentage. The lower estimate was based on the assumption that immigrants and refugees did not complete the follow-up evaluation if their evaluation forms were not received by the CDC. The higher estimate was based on the assumption that they completed the follow-up evaluation even though their evaluation forms were not received by the CDC.\n\n【22】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【23】In this analysis, we focused on smear-negative and inactive tuberculosis. We calculated the prevalence of smear-negative and inactive tuberculosis among immigrants and refugees, examined time trends for the prevalence of these conditions, and analyzed the results of the post-arrival follow-up evaluation. The WHO regions used in the analysis were the African region, the region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean region, the European region, the Southeast Asian region, and the Western Pacific region. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. The Cochran–Armitage test was used to analyze time trends for prevalence and to generate associated P values. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20,21 </a></sup></u> The time-trend statistic was computed on the basis of actual yearly data. All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.13 (SAS Institute). All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple testing.\n\n【24】Results\n-------\n\n【25】Rates of Tuberculosis in U.S.-Bound Immigrants and Refugees\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Table 1.

Prevalences of Smear-Negative and Inactive Tuberculosis among U.S.-Bound Refugees, 1999–2005.\n\n【27】During the period from 1999 through 2005, among 2,714,223 U.S.-bound immigrants screened overseas, smear-negative tuberculosis was diagnosed in 26,075 and inactive tuberculosis in 22,716, representing prevalences of 961 cases per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 949 to 973) and 837 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 826 to 848), respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Among 378,506 U.S.-bound refugees, smear-negative tuberculosis was diagnosed in 3923 and inactive tuberculosis in 10,743, representing prevalences of 1036 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1004 to 1068) and 2838 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 2785 to 2891), respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. The prevalence of smear-negative tuberculosis among refugees was slightly higher than that among immigrants, but the prevalence of inactive tuberculosis among refugees was 3.4 times as high as that among immigrants 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>. During the same period, 31 immigrants and 16 refugees with smear-positive tuberculosis were granted immigration waivers.\n\n【28】Geographic Variation\n--------------------\n\n【29】Table 1 shows the results of overseas screening of immigrants from 1999 through 2005 according to geographic region. Immigrants born in the Western Pacific region had the highest prevalences of smear-negative and inactive tuberculosis. Only 25.6% of U.S.-bound immigrants were born in the Western Pacific region, but they accounted for 91.1% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 70.4% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among immigrants. The top five birth countries of immigrants with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis (the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Mexico, and India) accounted for 40.7% of U.S.-bound immigrants but for 95.2% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 67.4% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among immigrants.\n\n【30】Table 2 shows the results of overseas screening of refugees from 1999 through 2005 according to geographic region. Refugees born in the Western Pacific region had the highest prevalence of smear-negative and inactive tuberculosis. Only 7.6% of U.S.-bound refugees were born in the Western Pacific region, but they accounted for 40.6% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 12.0% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among refugees. The top five birth countries of refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis (Ukraine, Vietnam, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Sudan) accounted for 44.8% of U.S.-bound refugees but for 58.5% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 69.1% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among refugees.\n\n【31】Birth Countries with a High Prevalence of Tuberculosis\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】During the 1999–2005 period, 56.8% of U.S.-bound immigrants and 62.2% of U.S.-bound refugees were born in countries that had a tuberculosis prevalence of 100 or more cases per 100,000 population per year, as estimated by the WHO, but they accounted for 95.3% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 80.4% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among immigrants as well as 90.1% of the cases of smear-negative tuberculosis and 80.4% of the cases of inactive tuberculosis among refugees 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【33】HIV and Tuberculosis Coinfections\n---------------------------------\n\n【34】Among 179 immigrants infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 4 (2.2%) had smear-positive, smear-negative, or inactive tuberculosis. The proportion of immigrants with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis did not differ significantly between those who were infected with HIV and those who were not (2.2% and 1.8%, respectively; P=0.57). Among 1343 refugees infected with HIV, 112 (8.3%) had smear-positive, smear-negative, or inactive tuberculosis. The proportion of refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis was significantly higher among those who were infected with HIV than among those who were not (8.3% vs. 3.9%, P<0.001).\n\n【35】Temporal Variation\n------------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Prevalences of Smear-Negative and Inactive Tuberculosis among U.S.-Bound Immigrants and Refugees, 1999–2005.\n\n【37】Figure 1 shows the prevalences of smear-negative tuberculosis and inactive tuberculosis among immigrants and refugees from 1999 through 2005. There was a trend toward an overall increase in the prevalence of smear-negative tuberculosis among both immigrants and refugees (P<0.001 for both tests for time trends). However, the prevalence of smear-negative tuberculosis increased by only 1.9% among immigrants, as compared with an increase of 158.9% among refugees between 1999–2002 and 2003–2005. There was a trend toward a decrease in the prevalence of inactive tuberculosis among immigrants and among refugees (P<0.001 for both tests for time trends). The prevalence of inactive tuberculosis decreased by 19.9% among immigrants and by 25.8% among refugees between 1999–2002 and 2003–2005.\n\n【38】Follow-up Evaluation after Arrival in the United States\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Rates of Follow-up Evaluation in the United States among Newly Arrived Immigrants and Refugees in Whom Smear-Negative or Inactive Tuberculosis Had Been Diagnosed Overseas, 1999–2005.\n\n【40】Figure 2 shows the estimated rates of completed follow-up evaluations in the United States among newly arrived immigrants and refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis, for the period from 1999 through 2005. For immigrants, the lower estimate (based on the assumption that the follow-up evaluation was not completed if an evaluation form was not received by the CDC) was 68.1%, and the higher estimate (based on the assumption that the evaluation was completed even though the form was not received by the CDC) was 89.1%; the lower and upper estimates for refugees were 62.3% and 90.4%, respectively.\n\n【41】The median time from overseas screening to arrival in the United States was 83 days (interquartile range, 47 to 141) for immigrants and 111 days (interquartile range, 63 to 174) for refugees. The median time from arrival in the United States to the follow-up evaluation was 53 days (interquartile range, 26 to 103) for immigrants and 47 days (interquartile range, 26 to 86) for refugees.\n\n【42】Table 3.  Table 3. Results of Follow-up Evaluation in the United States of Newly Arrived Immigrants and Refugees with an Overseas Diagnosis of Smear-Negative Tuberculosis or Inactive Tuberculosis, 1999–2005.\n\n【43】On follow-up evaluation, active pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 6.9% of immigrants and 7.7% of refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 1.4% of immigrants and 1.8% of refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Two HIV-infected immigrants who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis completed the follow-up evaluation, and active pulmonary tuberculosis was not diagnosed in either of them. Active pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 5 (17.9%) of the 28 HIV-infected refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 3 (9.1%) of the 33 HIV-infected refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis.\n\n【44】Discussion\n----------\n\n【45】One objective of overseas screening for tuberculosis is to identify active tuberculosis in U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees before their arrival in the United States. Another objective is to allow appropriate follow-up of newly arrived immigrants and refugees who are at high risk for tuberculosis. Overseas screening also provides a unique opportunity to offer preventive therapy for latent tuberculosis infection, since the majority of immigrants and refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis have a positive tuberculin skin test. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> From 1999 through 2005, an average of 4285 immigrants and refugees with smear-negative tuberculosis and 4480 with inactive tuberculosis arrived annually in the United States. During that period, only 47 immigrants and refugees with smear-positive tuberculosis were granted immigration waivers. The number of cases of smear-positive tuberculosis diagnosed by overseas screening was unavailable, although a previous study has reported that 7.0% of adults with a chest radiograph suggestive of active tuberculosis have positive smears. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18</a></sup></u>\n\n【46】The algorithm for tuberculosis screening put forth in the 1991 Technical Instructions for Panel Physicians 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> could not identify persons who had tuberculosis that was smear-negative but culture-positive. The limitations of this algorithm have been confirmed by a previous study, which showed that 10.9% of persons with smear-negative tuberculosis have positive culture results. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> To address these limitations, the CDC released the 2007 Technical Instructions for Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment for Panel Physicians, which require a mycobacterial culture and drug-susceptibility testing for persons with suspected tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23</a></sup></u>\n\n【47】Our findings indicate that overseas screening is a relatively high-yield intervention for identifying cases of active tuberculosis in U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees. We found that among immigrants and refugees who underwent follow-up evaluation after their arrival in the United States, active pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 7.0% of those who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 1.6% of those who had received an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies, in which active tuberculosis was diagnosed in 3.3 to 14.8% of immigrants and refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 0.4 to 4.3% of immigrants and refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-15 </a></sup></u> In comparison, active tuberculosis is identified in 0.7 to 2.4% of persons who have close contact with patients with infectious tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24-26</a></sup></u>\n\n【48】Our analyses show that during the period from 1999 through 2005, the majority of cases of tuberculosis diagnosed overseas among U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees were among persons born in the Philippines, Vietnam, China, Mexico, and India. Previous studies in which data from the CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System were used have shown that these five countries also account for the majority of cases of tuberculosis diagnosed in foreign-born persons in the United States. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4,5,27,28 </a></sup></u> In addition, our study showed a trend toward an increasing prevalence of smear-negative tuberculosis among immigrants and refugees. These findings highlight the need to target and enhance overseas screening, treatment, and control activities for tuberculosis among U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis.\n\n【49】We found an association between tuberculosis and HIV infection among refugees but not among immigrants. This finding was not unexpected, since during the study period, restrictions were placed on the admission of HIV-infected immigrants to the United States, restrictions that did not apply to HIV-infected refugees. Despite the elevated prevalence of tuberculosis among HIV-infected refugees, cases in this subgroup did not contribute substantially to the number of overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis among U.S.-bound refugees.\n\n【50】During the 1999–2005 period, 10.9 to 31.9% of immigrants and 9.6 to 37.7% of refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis may not have completed the follow-up evaluation. State and local health departments may improve the rate of follow-up evaluation if they can institute active outreach policies. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,13</a></sup></u>\n\n【51】Our findings should be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the data used in this study. Misclassifications of tuberculosis cases are likely to have occurred during overseas screening and post-arrival follow-up evaluation. We could not examine the effects of misclassification owing to a lack of detailed case information. On post-arrival follow-up evaluation, no tuberculosis was diagnosed in 26.4% of the immigrants and refugees who had received an overseas diagnosis of smear-negative tuberculosis and in 36.6% of those who had received an overseas diagnosis of inactive tuberculosis, suggesting that tuberculosis may have been overdiagnosed overseas. Although the CDC has developed technical instructions for panel physicians, accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis still depends on many factors, including the professional training of the examining physician and the quality of laboratory testing. In addition, we lacked follow-up data for 31.9% of the immigrants and 37.7% of the refugees with overseas diagnoses of tuberculosis. Finally, we are likely to have underestimated tuberculosis cases in children, since the screening algorithm in use during the study period did not require a routine chest radiograph for children younger than 15 years of age.\n\n【52】Overseas screening for tuberculosis, with follow-up evaluation in the United States, is a high-yield intervention for identifying tuberculosis in U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees and could reduce the number of tuberculosis cases among foreign-born persons in the United States. Improvements such as overseas use of mycobacterial culture, drug-susceptibility testing, directly observed therapy, tuberculin skin testing for children 2 to 14 years of age, and a shorter interval between screening and departure for the United States, as well as use of the CDC's Electronic Disease Notification system for data exchange among the CDC, state and local health departments, and international partners, should increase the effectiveness of this intervention. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22,23 </a></sup></u> To further reduce and prevent tuberculosis, diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection among U.S.-bound immigrants and refugees may be considered in the future, particularly if shortened treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection are proved to be effective.\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【54】参考删除-1:<u>The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</u>\n\n【55】参考删除-1:<u>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</u>\n\n【56】参考删除-1:<u>We thank Drs.

In this report, we describe the successful retransplantation of an allograft that was failing in the first recipient owing to recurrent primary FSGS.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Glomerular Filtration Rate and Proteinuria in the Initial Transplant Recipient and in a Second Patient after Retransplantation of the Allograft.\n\n【4】The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and levels of proteinuria are shown as measured after transplantation of the allograft in the first recipient, Patient 1 (beginning on day 0), and after retransplantation into the second recipient, Patient 2 (on day 14). Patient 1 underwent plasmapheresis seven times (twice before transplantation) before the allograft was removed and was retransplanted in Patient 2. Biopsies of the allograft were performed in Patient 1 on day 6 after the initial transplantation and in Patient 2 on retransplantation days 8 and 25.\n\n【5】A 27-year-old man with end-stage renal disease caused by primary FSGS (Patient 1) received a kidney transplant from his healthy 24-year-old sister. Given the known risk of recurrent FSGS after transplantation, plasmapheresis was performed before surgery (two sessions) and after surgery (five sessions), and standard immunosuppressive therapy was administered. Although the renal allograft functioned immediately 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>, marked proteinuria (>10 g of protein per 24 hours) developed on the second post-transplantation day. A biopsy specimen from the allograft obtained on day 6 revealed a normocellular glomerulus with prominent podocytes and marked podocyte foot-process effacement and loss of the interdigitating arrangement, consistent with disease recurrence (see Panels A and B of the figure in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).\n\n【6】The renal allograft was removed on post-transplantation day 14 because of persistent proteinuria, worsening hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g per deciliter), rising creatinine (8.3 mg per deciliter \\[733.7 μmol per liter\\]), and the development of an intraabdominal hematoma. At this time, after consulting with the hospital ethics committee and internal review board and obtaining informed consent, we approached the first recipient about donating his kidney transplant to another patient on the transplant waiting list. We identified a 66-year-old man with end-stage renal disease caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus who was willing to receive the failing allograft, after informed consent (Patient 2).\n\n【7】Immediately after the allograft was retransplanted, it regained function, with serum creatinine levels decreasing from 5.27 to 1.84 mg per deciliter (465.9 to 162.7 μmol per liter) and proteinuria decreasing from 25 to 1.2 g per 24 hours 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. In addition, allograft biopsies performed on days 8 and 25 after retransplantation showed a reversal of the histopathologic lesions (see Panels C through F of the figure in the Supplementary Appendix ). Eight months after retransplantation, Patient 2 continues to have excellent allograft function, with the glomerular filtration rate remaining above 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m 删除3:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> of body-surface area in the setting of mild proteinuria (0.27 g per 24 hours).\n\n【8】This case report may provide insight into the incompletely understood pathogenesis of primary FSGS. The rapid recovery of allograft function after retransplantation supports the theory of a circulating factor as the cause of primary FSGS, and the fact that the histopathologic findings of FSGS resolved implies that podocyte injury before scar formation may be a reversible lesion.\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Lorenzo Gallon, M.D.  \nJoseph Leventhal, M.D., Ph.D.  \nAnton Skaro, M.D., Ph.D.  \nYashpal Kanwar, M.D., Ph.D.  \nAntonio Alvarado, M.D.  \nNorthwestern University, Chicago, IL  \nl-gallon@northwestern.  edu</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>5 References</u>\n\n【12】参考删除-2:<u>1.  1\\.

However, the results are unreliable if the specimen is contaminated or obtained during a complicated pregnancy. We therefore compared the predictive value of the L/S ratio with that of the concentration of saturated phosphatidylcholine (SPC) in 322 amniotic-fluid samples, 75 per cent of which were contaminated or obtained during complicated pregnancies or both. A _positive_ result is one that predicted the development of respiratory-distress syndrome, taken as an L/S ratio equal to or less than 2/1 or an SPC below 500 μg per deciliter. The respiratory-distress syndrome was correctly predicted in 25 of 45 cases (55.5 per cent) with L/S ratios equal to or less than 2/1, and in 35 of 42 cases (82 per cent) with SPC's less than 500 μg per deciliter. When L/S ratios were greater than 2/1, there were 13 of 277 (4.7 per cent) false negatives, and when SPC's were above 500 μg per deciliter, there were three of 280 (1.1 per cent) false negatives. We conclude that determination of SPC is both more specific and more sensitive as a predictor of the respiratory-distress syndrome than the techniques currently in use. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 301:1013–1018, 1979)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Sotatercept is a fusion protein that traps activins and growth differentiation factors involved in pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【5】We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (World Health Organization \\[WHO\\] functional class II or III) who were receiving stable background therapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous sotatercept (starting dose, 0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight; target dose, 0.7 mg per kilogram) or placebo every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline at week 24 in the 6-minute walk distance. Nine secondary end points, tested hierarchically in the following order, were multicomponent improvement, change in pulmonary vascular resistance, change in N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level, improvement in WHO functional class, time to death or clinical worsening, French risk score, and changes in the Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension–Symptoms and Impact (PAH-SYMPACT) Physical Impacts, Cardiopulmonary Symptoms, and Cognitive/Emotional Impacts domain scores; all were assessed at week 24 except time to death or clinical worsening, which was assessed when the last patient completed the week 24 visit.\n\n【6】### Results\n\n【7】A total of 163 patients were assigned to receive sotatercept and 160 to receive placebo.

Thirty-two women refused treatment; 24 of their infants were followed and served as the controls. Therapy was discontinued by 5 of 10 women who had gastrointestinal disturbances. Forty-seven women who completed therapy refused infant follow-up; in four (9 percent) of these women, therapy had failed to eradicate the infection. Sixty women and 59 infants completed the entire protocol; 55 (92 percent) of the women had negative cultures for chlamydia at follow-up. Chlamydial infection developed in 4 (7 percent) of the 59 infants of treated mothers, as compared with 12 (50 percent) of the 24 infants of untreated mothers; this difference was significant (P<0.001).

The national minimum drinking age of 21, adopted universally by the states after Congress made it a condition of receiving federal highway funds in 1984, is credited with decreasing alcohol consumption, drunk driving, and motor vehicle accidents among young people. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> These laws have withstood the test of time, against objections that find echoes in those raised to Tobacco 21 laws.\n\n【7】Chief among these objections are protests against “nanny state” interference with the decisions of young adults. If these people are old enough to vote and enlist in the military, it is argued, they are old enough to make decisions that affect their own health. There is also initial skepticism about the effectiveness of restrictions on access for young people, who may make purchases in surrounding jurisdictions with lower minimum ages or may buy tobacco or alcohol from friends. Finally, critics worry about the cost to small businesses.\n\n【8】Tobacco 21 laws are too new to have generated rigorous evidence concerning their effectiveness, but early data are provocative. Consider the case of Needham, Massachusetts, which in 2005 became the first town in the country to adopt such a law. Before fully implementing the measure, the town had a smoking rate among high school students of 12.9%, as compared with 14.9% in surrounding towns, according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. By 2010, the youth smoking rate in Needham had fallen by nearly half, to 6.7%, while the rate in surrounding communities decreased to 12.4%. The percentage decline in Needham was nearly triple that of its neighbors — contradicting the hypothesis that young people will simply shift their purchases to surrounding towns.\n\n【9】The most compelling case for Tobacco 21 laws comes not from experience, however, but from the epidemiology and science of smoking addiction. Eighty percent of adult smokers began smoking daily before 20 years of age, 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and 90% of persons who purchase cigarettes for distribution to minors are under 21. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> Increasing the minimum tobacco-sales age to 21 could virtually eliminate minors' ability to buy from other local high school students, substantially raising barriers to access. It therefore addresses a major reason why — as critics hasten to point out — existing age restrictions have not successfully eliminated smoking among children.\n\n【10】There remains the prospect of shopping across jurisdictional lines, but minors are not a highly mobile population that can easily cross borders for regular purchases. Although those who are already addicted may be sufficiently motivated to do so, increasing the transaction costs associated with obtaining tobacco products may reduce daily consumption among regular users and discourage others from starting to smoke. Protecting younger adolescents is a key goal, but often overlooked is the fact that 31% of smokers progress to daily smoking in early adulthood. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> For this group, the practical costs of increasing tobacco use shift from negligible to considerable under Tobacco 21 laws.\n\n【11】Erecting further barriers to tobacco use among adolescents is especially crucial in light of evolving neuroscientific evidence that the adolescent brain has a heightened susceptibility to the addictive qualities of nicotine. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> While people are still experimenting with tobacco use and before they're aware of their own addiction, they go through a process in which they first want, then crave, then need nicotine. Once they reach the point of need, they are often unable to quit. Research suggests that adolescents can become dependent on nicotine very rapidly, at lower levels of consumption than adults; that they are undergoing alterations in the structure and function of the brain that make them more vulnerable to addiction to nicotine and other substances over the long term; and that they may be less responsive than adults to nicotine-replacement therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Adolescents' greater impulsivity and risk taking also leads them to discount the potential consequences of tobacco experimentation and use. These tendencies place young people at high risk for addiction, which is a strong counterpunch to objections related to paternalistic interference with free choice.\n\n【12】The burdens associated with any new regulation should be carefully considered, but Tobacco 21 laws would not impose major new compliance costs. FDA regulations already require tobacco retailers to check the identification of anyone seeking to purchase tobacco products who appears to be younger than 27. Convenience stores and other outlets that sell alcoholic beverages also already enforce the minimum purchase age of 21 for alcohol. Tobacco retailers and producers fear, with reason, that Tobacco 21 laws will mean lost sales revenue, but that has never been a strong argument for permitting the sale of a lethal product to young people. Finally, enforcement costs to the government are offset to a degree by revenue generated through fines.\n\n【13】One barrier to successful implementation of Tobacco 21 laws is the prospect of incomplete compliance by retailers. Compliance with the 18-year minimum has been variable, and interventions to boost compliance have had mixed success. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Some retailers may prove even more reluctant to comply with Tobacco 21 laws, particularly in challenging economic times, because they further undercut already-reduced sales revenue and lack the perceived moral force of laws that more explicitly aim to protect children.\n\n【14】Studies show that the extent to which such access restrictions reduce the prevalence of smoking among young people depends on the vigor with which authorities enforce them. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Strong incentives for enforcement activities can be provided through mechanisms such as the Synar Amendment, which made a portion of federal block grants from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration conditional on states' willingness to adopt policies to restrict tobacco sales to minors and demonstrate high levels of compliance with these laws.\n\n【15】A forthcoming FDA report to Congress on the public health impact of raising the minimum tobacco-sales age could soon place Tobacco 21 legislation on the federal agenda. In the interim, further state and local policy leadership can help to generate effectiveness data to determine whether the policy merits nationwide adoption and what implementation problems should be anticipated.\n\n【16】According to a recent Gallup poll, nearly 90% of U.S. adults who smoke report that if they had it to do over again, they would not have started. Helping today's adolescents avoid that regret requires a comprehensive strategy that includes strong supply-side interventions. We believe that Tobacco 21 laws are a logical next step.\n\n【17】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【18】参考删除-1:<u>Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【19】参考删除-1:<u>This article was published on January 8, 2014, at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【20】参考删除-1:<u>Author Affiliations\n-------------------</u>\n\n【21】参考删除-1:<u>From the Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital for Children (J.P.W.), the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Northeastern University School of Law (M.G.), and the Department of Health Policy and Management, Harvard School of Public Health (M.M.M.) — all in Boston; and the Edmond J.

Clinical tuberculosis may also arise from a primary infection, and this is thought to be more likely in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the relative importance of these two pathogenetic mechanisms in this population is unclear.\n\n【4】Methods.\n--------\n\n【5】Between December 1990 and April 1991, tuberculosis was diagnosed in 12 residents of a housing facility for HIV-infected persons. In the preceding six months, two patients being treated for tuberculosis had been admitted to the facility. We investigated this outbreak using standard procedures plus analysis of the cultured organisms with Restriction-Fragment Length polymorphisms (RFLPs).\n\n【6】Results.\n--------\n\n【7】Organisms isolated from all 11 of the culturepositive residents had similar RFLP patterns, whereas the isolates from the 2 patients treated for tuberculosis in the previous six months were different strains. This implicated the first of the 12 patients with tuberculosis as the source of this outbreak. Among the 30 residents exposed to possible infection, active tuberculosis developed in 11 (37 percent), and 4 others (13 percent) had newly positive tuberculin skin tests. Of 28 staff members with possible exposure, at least 6 had positive tuberculin-test reactions, but none had tuberculosis.\n\n【8】Conclusions.\n------------\n\n【9】Newly acquired tuberculous infection in HIV-infected patients can spread readily and progress rapidly to active disease. There should be heightened surveillance for tuberculosis in facilities where HIV-infected persons live, and investigation of contacts must be undertaken promptly and be focused more broadly than is usual. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1992;326:231–5.)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】INFECTION with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has had a substantial impact on the global epidemiology of tuberculosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> By causing a progressive and ultimately profound reduction in cell-mediated immunity, HIV infection increases the risk of tuberculosis through two pathogenetic mechanisms, both of which have been suggested by earlier reports. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> First, in persons previously infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , the immunologic mechanisms that contain the infection are sufficiently impaired to allow the organisms to proliferate and cause clinical disease. Second, whether or not there has been a previous infection, HIV-infected persons who are exposed to infectious tuberculosis may not be able to control a new infection; thus, clinical disease may develop quickly after exposure to _M. tuberculosis_ . Because prevention strategies differ according to the sequence with which tuberculosis develops in HIV-infected populations, determining the mechanisms involved is important. If, for example, tuberculosis occurs in HIV-infected persons predominantly as a reactivation of latent infection, as it does in persons without HIV infection, the greatest emphasis should be placed on the identification of persons with latent infection and on their preventive treatment with isoniazid. Alternatively, if most cases of tuberculosis among persons with HIV infection are a consequence of the accelerated progression of new tuberculous infection, targeted surveillance of high-risk groups and prompt evaluation of contacts, together with preventive therapy, would have a larger overall epidemiologic impact. If both sequences occur, as is likely, preventive measures should be geared to both patterns of disease transmission and pathogenesis.\n\n【12】This report describes an outbreak of tuberculosis in a residential facility for HIV-infected persons. We used analysis of restriction-fragmentlength polymorphisms (RFLPs) to identify the strains of _M. tuberculosis_ in the index patient and 11 subsequent patients with rapidly developing tuberculosis. The features of the outbreak provide insight into the pathogenesis of the disease in HIV-infected persons and raise a number of important issues concerning the control of tuberculosis in HIV-infected populations.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Review of Cases\n---------------\n\n【15】The available medical records and the records of the Tuberculosis Case Registry related to the patients with tuberculosis were reviewed. Standard demographic data, information on methods of diagnosis, and results of laboratory investigations were abstracted.\n\n【16】Investigation of Tuberculosis Contacts\n--------------------------------------\n\n【17】All patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis were interviewed by disease-control investigators trained and experienced in the investigation of tuberculosis contacts. The information collected included the names of persons with whom the index patient had been in contact and the duration and circumstances of the exposure. In addition, patterns of air circulation within the facility were examined.\n\n【18】The residents and staff of the facility were given tuberculin skin tests by the Mantoux method, with 5 tuberculin units of commercial purified protein derivative of tuberculin (Aplisol, Parke-Davis, Morris Plains, N.J.). Intradermal tests for both mumps (40 colonyforming units per milliliter; Connaught, Swiftwater, Pa.) and candida (Dermatophyton \"O\" 1:100; Miles, West Haven, Conn.) were administered to residents of the facility (all of whom were known to be infected with HIV). For persons whose initial tuberculin skin tests were negative, the tests were repeated approximately 10 weeks after the discovery of the 11th secondary case of tuberculosis in the facility. For each of the antigens, a reaction ≥5 mm of induration was considered positive.\n\n【19】The residents of the facility were also evaluated with standard frontal- and lateral-view chest radiographs. The staff members of the facility underwent chest radiography only if they had positive tuberculin reactions.\n\n【20】Persons with abnormal findings on chest radiographs were evaluated in a standard fashion, with specimens from the respiratory tract being submitted for acid-fast staining and mycobacterial culture as well as for the identification of other respiratory pathogens. Standard laboratory procedures were used for the mycobacterial cultures, the determination of species, and testing of any organisms isolated for drug susceptibility.\n\n【21】A patient was considered to have tuberculosis if _M. tuberculosis_ was isolated from any specimen or if there were symptoms and radiographic abnormalities of undetermined cause that responded to antituberculosis chemotherapy.\n\n【22】RFLP Analysis\n-------------\n\n【23】_M. tuberculosis_ strains isolated from the patients and from other, randomly selected patients during the time of the outbreak were obtained from Lowenstein—Jensen slant cultures from the laboratory of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Reference strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, Md.) included the bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) strain of _M. bovis_ (A. Jespersen strain, ATCC 27291), _M. intracellulare_ (ATCC 13590), and _M. avium_ (ATCC 25291). The organisms were grown for two to three weeks at 37°C in 15 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with Tween 80, glycerol, and albumin—dextrose complex (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.). Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and chromosomal DNA was extracted with the method developed by van Soolingen et al. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Reaction mixtures containing 1 μg of genomic DNA were digested with 10 units of _Pvu_ II and electrophoresed on 1 percent agarose gels. After blotting, the membranes were hybridized with a 245-base-pair (bp) fragment of the insertion element IS986, and developed with use of enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL gene-detection kit, Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). 删除3:<u><sup><a>6</a></sup></u>\n\n【24】The Outbreak\n------------\n\n【25】The outbreak occurred in a congregate-living facility subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for HIV-infected persons in San Francisco. The facility was a 2 1/2-story structure with 32 private rooms and 8 shared bathrooms or lavatories. Two communal meeting rooms and a shared kitchen were located on the first floor. The structure was centrally heated by four forced-air residential-type gas furnaces with recirculation ducts. The furnaces had disposable filters of relatively low efficiency. Each bedroom had a heater vent; there were no exhaust inlets in the rooms. A return register was located in the corridor on each floor.\n\n【26】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Sequence of the Tuberculosis Outbreak in a Residential Facility for HIV-infected Patients.\n\n【27】The date of entry into the facility is indicated in the case of long-term residents. Vertical bars indicate the time of entry into or exit from the facility, and arrows the time of diagnosis. Asterisks indicate patients whose tuberculosis was identified when the outbreak was investigated. Brief absences from the facility for hospitalizations are not shown.\n\n【28】The periods during which the patients with tuberculosis resided in the facility and the time of their diagnoses are shown in Figure 1. The first patient known to have tuberculosis (Patient 1) came to the facility in early July 1990. Pulmonary tuberculosis had been diagnosed on June 15, and the patient had been receiving antituberculosis treatment for approximately two weeks when he entered the site. A second patient with tuberculosis (Patient 2) entered the facility in November, having received antituberculosis chemotherapy since September, when pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed.\n\n【29】Between December 1990 and April 1991, 12 additional residents were found to have tuberculosis. The first of these (Patient 3) entered the facility on November 1, 1990, and was hospitalized on December 19 after approximately three weeks of progressive respiratory symptoms. Acid-fast organisms were found by microscopical examination of a sputum sample, and _M. tuberculosis_ was isolated from the same specimen. The patient did not return to the facility after his hospitalization.\n\n【30】After residing at the facility for 1/2 years, Patient 4 was hospitalized on January 19, 1991; for 1 week he had had nonproductive cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath. Acid-fast bacilli were found in an induced-sputum specimen, and antituberculosis chemotherapy was begun. _M. tuberculosis_ was isolated from the sputum, blood, and pleural fluid. The patient returned to the facility on February 5 but did not take his medications. He was hospitalized again on February 15; acid-fast organisms were again detected in his sputum, from which _M. tuberculosis_ was subsequently isolated. Although his tuberculosis improved with treatment, Patient 4 died of sepsis involving _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ on March 10.\n\n【31】Between February 21 and March 4, three additional residents (Patients 5, 6, and 7) were found to have active pulmonary tuberculosis. Their infections were diagnosed in the course of hospitalizations for respiratory conditions.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Investigation of Contacts\n-------------------------\n\n【34】Thirty-one other residents were living in the facility when Patients 3 and 4 were living there. Of these 31, 18 were still living in the facility and had not yet been identified as having tuberculosis when the investigation of contacts took place. These 18 residents had tuberculin tests performed, of which 7 were positive and 1 was negative with positive control antigens. The remaining 10 residents were anergic. In addition, all the residents had chest radiography. Three of those with positive tuberculin reactions and two who were anergic were found to have tuberculosis (Patients 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12). None of the remaining 13 residents who were evaluated had evidence of active tuberculosis. All 13 were offered isoniazid, and 11 accepted this therapy.\n\n【35】Eight of the 31 residents were not evaluated in the investigation because they had moved from the facility. Of these, one was known to have had tuberculosis (Patient 13), one was dead of an unknown cause, three were alive with no evidence of tuberculosis, and no information was available for three.\n\n【36】The final patient with tuberculosis (Patient 14) was identified on April 4. In the course of the investigation he was found to be anergic and to have a normal chest radiograph. Although preventive therapy with isoniazid was recommended, in consultation with his physician he decided not to take the drug, because of markedly abnormal liver-function tests.\n\n【37】Each of the _M. tuberculosis_ isolates was sensitive to all the primary antituberculosis agents.\n\n【38】Fourteen of the 28 staff members who had potentially been exposed to 1 or more of the 14 patients were evaluated in the outbreak investigation, and 4 had positive tuberculin reactions, one of which was a documented conversion. Five staff members had previously documented positive tuberculin tests and were not tested. The remaining 19 staff members had negative tuberculin reactions (9 were tested by private physicians). No cases of tuberculosis were found among them.\n\n【39】Repeat tuberculin testing was performed in early June 1991 for the residents and staff who had negative reactions on initial testing. There were no new reactions among the residents, but five of the staff members tested positive, whereas 10 weeks earlier they had been negative. No new cases of tuberculosis were identified.\n\n【40】RFLP Analysis\n-------------\n\n【41】Figure 2.  Figure 2. RFLPs of _M. bovis_ BCG, _M. intracellulare_ , and Clinical Mycobacterial Isolates from Residents of the HIV Congregate-Living Site.\n\n【42】Patients 1 and 2 were receiving antituberculosis therapy when they entered the facility. Tuberculosis developed in the remaining patients while they lived at the facility. Patient 8, who did not have positive cultures, is not shown.Figure 3.  Figure 3. RFLPs of _M. bovis_ BCG, _M. avium_ , and Random Clinical Isolates of _M. tuberculosis_ Obtained from Patients Identified in San Francisco at the Time of the Outbreak and Used as Controls.\n\n【43】The RFLP patterns of the genomic DNA of _M. bovis_ BCG, _M. avium, M. intracellulare_ , and clinical mycobacterial isolates are shown in Figure 2 (for Patients 1 through 7 and 9 through 14; Patient 8 had negative cultures) and Figure 3 (random clinical isolates). The _M. bovis_ BCG strain tested yielded an RFLP pattern containing two bands. However, other BCG strains have yielded from one to three bands under the same conditions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> No _M. avium_ or _M. intracellulare_ restriction fragments hybridized with the _M. tuberculosis_ probe. The mycobacteria isolated from the treated patients (Patients 1 and 2) had unique RFLP patterns, whereas those from the residents in whom tuberculosis was diagnosed between December and April had very similar patterns (Patients 3 to 14). The RFLP patterns of nine of the strains are identical. The slight difference in the patterns in Patients 9 and 11, as compared to the other nine patients starting with Patient 3, appears to be due to the movement of the insertion element. In contrast, all 13 randomly selected isolates of _M. tuberculosis_ from San Francisco were found to have unique patterns 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 )</u>.\n\n【44】Demographic and Clinical Data\n-----------------------------\n\n【45】Table 1.  Table 1. Immunologic and Microbiologic Data on the Patients with Tuberculosis.\\*\n\n【46】The mean age of Patients 3 through 14 was 37.2 years (range, 26 to 49). Eleven patients were men; 8 were white, and 4 were black; and 11 were homosexual or bisexual, 3 of whom also used intravenous drugs. Injection drug use was the only HIV risk factor in the one woman. The results of tuberculin skin tests, CD4+ lymphocyte counts, acid-fast smears, and mycobacterial cultures for Patients 3 through 14 are shown in Table 1. No patient was known to have had a positive tuberculin skin test before the diagnosis, and six patients had had negative reactions documented previously. Three of these six had positive reactions at the time tuberculosis was diagnosed.\n\n【47】In summary, tuberculosis developed in 10 of 29 residents (34 percent) who were exposed to Patient 3 or Patient 4. Beginning with Patient 3, the rate of new infections was 37 percent (11 of 30 residents). Tuberculosis did not develop in any of 28 staff members with exposures, although there were 6 with documented tuberculin conversions and 8 others had positive tuberculin reactions of unknown duration. Eight of the 12 cases occurred among the residents of the 15 rooms on the second floor. However, no specific features of the building's heating and ventilation system or of the residents' patterns of socialization were found to correlate with the risk of acquiring _M. tuberculosis._\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】The outbreak of tuberculosis described in this report shows that in HIV-infected patients, recently acquired tuberculosis infections can progress rapidly to cause tuberculosis. This pathogenetic sequence can be inferred from the report by DiPerri and coworkers, 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> who examined a nosocomial outbreak of tuberculosis among 18 HIV-infected inpatients, 7 of whom had active disease within 60 days of exposure to the index patient. In the outbreak reported here, however, RFLP analysis was used to provide positive identification of strains and thus confirm that 11 patients had disease caused by a single strain. The contention that this outbreak represented a spread of infection from Patient 3 is strengthened by the failure to identify the same strain or similar strains among isolates from patients with tuberculosis selected at random from San Francisco at approximately the time of the outbreak. It is reassuring to note that isolates from the first two patients (Patients 1 and 2), who were being treated for tuberculosis when they entered the facility, bore no similarity to the strain associated with the outbreak. The finding that these two patients had unique RFLP patterns served to exclude them from consideration as sources and focused the investigation on Patient 3.\n\n【50】The usefulness of RFLP analysis as an epidemiologic tool has been suggested by work with other pathogens as well as with _M. tuberculosis._ 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>7 </a></sup></u> Because this method yields a kind of \"fingerprint,\" strains can be tracked accurately. In the patients described in this report, nearly identical RFLP patterns were obtained with DNA probes derived from the insertion element IS986 (essentially the same as IS61lO). 删除3:<u><sup><a>8 </a></sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup>, </sup></u> 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> The similarity of the RFLP patterns, the temporal association of the onset of disease, or both clearly indicate that Patients 3 through 14 were epidemiologically connected. The slightly different patterns in Patients 9 and 11, thought to be due to movement of the insertion element, could have been caused by the transposition of the insertion element in a proportion of the organisms, resulting in a more weakly hybridizing 6-kb band.\n\n【51】Two features of this outbreak were striking. The first was the extraordinarily large number of tuberculous infections resulting from the exposure. In the United States, approximately 30 percent of the close contacts of newly identified patients with tuberculosis have positive tuberculin skin tests, indicative of infection with _M. tuberculosis_ , presumably acquired from the index patient. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> In this outbreak in which all residents and staff members could be considered to be close contacts, the incidence of new, active tuberculosis, not just quiescent infection, was 37 percent among the HIV-infected residents, whereas no cases were identified among the staff members. The number of new infections among residents in whom the disease did not develop cannot be determined, because previous tuberculin-test results were generally not known. Given the high rate of anergy among the residents who did not have the disease (55 percent), it is likely that not all tuberculous infections were detected. However, 4 of the 18 people in whom tuberculosis did not develop had positive reactions to purified protein derivative detected during the course of the outbreak investigation, for a minimal overall rate of tuberculous infection among exposed HIV-infected patients of 50 percent (15 of 30). Among the 28 staff members, 6 had tuberculin-test conversions, 3 were tuberculin-positive without previous testing, and 5 were known to have had previous positive reactions, for an overall prevalence of positive reactions of 50 percent by the end of the outbreak. On the basis of these data, and assuming an artifactually low rate of positive skin-test reactions because of anergy, the acquisition of the organism by HIV-infected residents seems to have been facilitated.\n\n【52】The second striking feature of this outbreak was the high percentage of exposed people in whom tuberculosis developed and the rapidity with which it did so. Usually, new tuberculous infections are quiescent, with clinically evident tuberculosis developing within the first year after infection in only 3 to 5 percent of persons who acquire new infections. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11 </a></sup></u> It is estimated that another 3 to 5 percent of the infected persons in whom disease does not develop in the first year will become ill with tuberculosis at some point in their lives. The total duration of this outbreak (from Patient 3 to Patient 14) was 106 days, and in one patient (Patient 7) disease developed within 4 weeks of exposure. This rapid progression suggests that the organisms proliferated very rapidly without the usual inhibition from specific cell-mediated immunity. Although the data are not presented, the clinical manifestations of tuberculosis in this outbreak were essentially those of primary tuberculosis. These features have commonly been described among HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis and have generally been ascribed to the lack of an immune response in the host rather than to the actual presence of progressive primary infection.\n\n【53】This outbreak presents a number of implications for the control of tuberculosis in HIV-infected populations. Clearly, prompt and thorough investigation of contacts is exceedingly important when tuberculosis is diagnosed in a person who is in contact with HIV-infected persons, whether or not the source patient is HIV-infected. The usual criteria for judging an exposed person's risk for acquiring tuberculous infection should be modified when that person is known or thought to be infected with HIV. In general, this will enlarge the scope of contact investigations.\n\n【54】In evaluating persons who are known or suspected to be infected with HIV and who are exposed to infectious tuberculosis, the value of skin testing with either tuberculin or control antigens is questionable. In this outbreak, little information was gained by skin testing. Among the patients, all the possible combinations of reaction patterns were found. Given a substantial exposure history, all the persons who have been in contact with the source patient, regardless of their skin-test reactions, should be offered preventive therapy with isoniazid if they have no clinical or chest radiographic evidence of tuberculosis. In view of the rapid progression from infection to disease, however, HIV-infected contacts must be carefully evaluated before preventive therapy with isoniazid is begun. If active tuberculosis has developed, treatment with isoniazid alone would be a major error. Besides the usual first step of tuberculin testing, persons with possible exposure should be asked about their symptoms and a chest radiograph should be obtained in those with HIV infection or at risk for it. If there is even suggestive evidence of active tuberculosis, therapy with multiple drugs should be initiated until the situation is clarified. It is noteworthy that Patients 1 and 2 came to the facility after receiving antituberculous therapy for a relatively short time, but they caused no secondary cases.\n\n【55】There should be heightened concern about the screening for tuberculosis of persons who are admitted to HIV care facilities, as well as the screening of employees. Moreover, surveillance for tuberculosis in such facilities should be maintained, and persons with suspicious symptoms should be evaluated promptly. The risks of acquisition of tuberculous infection should be made known to HIV-infected health care workers, and surveillance should be extended to them as well.\n\n【56】In patients with both tuberculous infection and HIV infection, limited data suggest that preventive therapy with isoniazid is effective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> During this outbreak, tuberculosis did not develop in any of the residents taking isoniazid chemoprophylaxis. However, pulmonary tuberculosis did subsequently develop in one of the two patients who did not take isoniazid. At least in this outbreak, isoniazid seemed to be effective in preventing the rapid progression to tuberculosis.\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>Supported in part by an Institutional National Research Service Award (HL 07185), by a grant (AIZ6170) from the National Institutes of Health, and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</u>\n\n【59】参考删除-1:<u>We are indebted to Antonio Paz, Houmpheng Banouvong, Carlos Balladares, and Octavio Lumba for conducting the investigation of contacts; to Marilyn Girodo and Arthur Back for providing clinical isolates; to William Charney and Leonard Fisher for assessing the ventilation system; to Jack Crawford and Barry Bloom for their thoughtful comments; and to Peter W.M.

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】Download a PDF of the Research Summary .\n\n【6】In an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with severe Covid-19 were randomly assigned to a pragmatically defined regimen of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in accordance with local usual care. The primary outcome was organ support–free days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of −1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge.\n\n【7】Results\n-------\n\n【8】The trial was stopped when the prespecified criterion for futility was met for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Data on the primary outcome were available for 1098 patients (534 assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 564 assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis). The median value for organ support–free days was 1 (interquartile range, −1 to 16) among the patients assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and was 4 (interquartile range, −1 to 16) among the patients assigned to usual-care thromboprophylaxis (adjusted proportional odds ratio, 0.83; 95% credible interval, 0.67 to 1.03; posterior probability of futility \\[defined as an odds ratio <1.2\\], 99.9%). The percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge was similar in the two groups (62.7% and 64.5%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% credible interval, 0.64 to 1.11). Major bleeding occurred in 3.8% of the patients assigned to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 2.3% of those assigned to usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【10】In critically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin did not result in a greater probability of survival to hospital discharge or a greater number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support than did usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. 删除5:<u>(REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a, and ATTACC ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02735707 . opens in new tab , NCT04505774 . opens in new tab , NCT04359277 . opens in new tab , and NCT04372589 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】 QUICK TAKE  \nTherapeutic Anticoagulation in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19  \n_02:51_\n\n【13】Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with inflammation and thrombosis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-4 </a></sup></u> Critically ill patients with Covid-19 are at high risk for thrombosis despite receiving standard-dose pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5-8 </a></sup></u> Circulating biomarkers reflecting systemic inflammation and coagulation activation (e.g., d \\-dimer and C-reactive protein) are independently associated with a greater risk of respiratory failure, thrombosis, and death in patients with Covid-19. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,9,10 </a></sup></u> Inflammation and thrombosis may therefore be important contributors to poor outcomes.\n\n【14】Unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins are parenteral anticoagulants with antiinflammatory properties and possible antiviral properties. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11,12 </a></sup></u> Given the reports of excess thrombotic risk, enhanced-dose anticoagulation strategies have been incorporated into some Covid-19 guidance statements, especially for critically ill patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> However, the effectiveness and safety of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation given to improve outcomes in Covid-19 are uncertain.\n\n【15】We conducted an international, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin improves in-hospital survival and reduces the duration of intensive care unit (ICU)–level cardiovascular or respiratory organ support in critically ill patients with Covid-19.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】Trial Design and Oversight\n--------------------------\n\n【18】Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the lead investigators of three international adaptive platform trials harmonized their protocols and statistical analysis plans (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) to study the effect of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19 in one integrated, multiplatform, randomized clinical trial to accelerate the generation of evidence and maximize the external validity of the results (see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). The platforms included the Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> A Multicenter, Adaptive, Randomized Controlled Platform Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of Antithrombotic Strategies in Hospitalized Adults with COVID-19 (ACTIV-4a), and the Antithrombotic Therapy to Ameliorate Complications of Covid-19 (ATTACC) trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> The platforms aligned the trial design, eligibility criteria, interventions, outcome measures, and statistical analysis plan (comparisons of the three platforms are provided in the Supplementary Appendix ). Each platform was overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards following a collaborative cross-platform interaction plan. The members of the writing committees vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trials to the protocols.\n\n【19】The multiplatform trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation. Ethics and regulatory approval were obtained at each participating center. Written or oral informed consent, in accordance with regional regulations, was obtained from all patients or their surrogates. The trial was supported by multiple international funding organizations that had no role in the design, analysis, or reporting of the trial results, with the exception of the ACTIV-4a protocol, which received input on design from professional staff members at the National Institutes of Health and from peer reviewers.\n\n【20】Patients\n--------\n\n【21】All three platforms enrolled patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19. Although REMAP-CAP enrolled patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, only patients with infection confirmed by laboratory testing were included in the primary analysis of the multiplatform trial. The trial was designed to evaluate the effect of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in patients with severe Covid-19 and in those with moderate Covid-19 stratified according to d \\-dimer level (high, low, or unknown). This report describes the results of the analyses involving patients with severe Covid-19; the results of analyses involving patients with moderate Covid-19 are reported separately. 删除3:<u><sup><a>17</a></sup></u>\n\n【22】Severe Covid-19 was defined as Covid-19 that led to receipt of ICU-level respiratory or cardiovascular organ support (oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal life support, vasopressors, or inotropes) in an ICU. In ACTIV-4a, in which definitions of an ICU were thought to be challenging to operationalize during the pandemic, receipt of ICU-level organ support, irrespective of hospital setting, was used to define ICU-level care. Patients were ineligible if they had been admitted to the ICU with Covid-19 for 48 hours or longer (in REMAP-CAP) or to a hospital for 72 hours or longer (in ACTIV-4a and ATTACC) before randomization. They were also ineligible if they were at imminent risk for death and there was no ongoing commitment to full organ support, or if they were at high risk for bleeding, were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, had a separate clinical indication for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, or had a history of heparin sensitivity, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Detailed exclusion criteria for the platforms are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【23】Randomization\n-------------\n\n【24】Randomization was performed with the use of separate central Web-based systems for each platform. Patients were randomly assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or to receive usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in an open-label fashion. Patients in ACTIV-4a underwent randomization in a 1:1 ratio. The other two platforms specified response-adaptive randomization; randomization probabilities could be updated for those platforms during the period from each monthly adaptive interim analysis in the multiplatform trial to the end of enrollment (as described in the Supplementary Appendix ).\n\n【25】Therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was administered according to local site protocols for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism for up to 14 days or until recovery (defined as either hospital discharge or discontinuation of supplemental oxygen for at least 24 hours). Usual-care thromboprophylaxis was administered at a dose and duration determined by the treating clinician according to local practice, which included either standard low-dose thromboprophylaxis or enhanced intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis. The anticoagulation and thromboprophylaxis regimens that were specified by each platform are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix . Some of the patients who were enrolled in REMAP-CAP also underwent randomization in the antiplatelet-agent domain and in other domains of that trial. There were no additional active domains in ACTIV-4a and ATTACC.\n\n【26】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【27】The primary outcome, organ support–free days, was evaluated on an ordinal scale indicating the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge; patients who died in the hospital by day 90 were assigned a value of –1. Among the patients who survived to hospital discharge, the number of days free of respiratory organ support (high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal life support) and cardiovascular organ support (vasopressors or inotropes) through day 21 was recorded. A higher number of organ support–free days indicates a better outcome. Patients who were discharged from the hospital before day 21 were assumed to be alive and free of organ support through day 21.\n\n【28】Prespecified secondary outcomes included survival to hospital discharge, major thrombotic events or death (a composite of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, systemic arterial embolism, or in-hospital death), and any thrombotic events (major thrombotic events or deep-vein thrombosis) or death. The outcomes of major thrombotic events or death and any thrombotic events or death were assessed through 28 days (in ACTIV-4a and ATTACC) or through hospital discharge (REMAP-CAP). Safety outcomes included major bleeding during the treatment period, as defined by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis for nonsurgical patients, 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> and laboratory-confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic and bleeding events were adjudicated by independent platform-specific adjudication committees, the members of which were unaware of the treatment assignments. Definitions of all the outcomes are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .\n\n【29】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The multiplatform trial analyzed combined individual patient data from all platforms with the use of a single overarching Bayesian model (as described in the Supplementary Appendix and in the protocol). Monthly interim analyses of combined data from all platforms were planned within each of the prespecified patient cohorts. Randomization continued within each cohort until a statistical conclusion of superiority (defined as >99% posterior probability of a proportional odds ratio of >1) or futility (>95% posterior probability of a proportional odds ratio of <1.2) was made for a cohort. The stopping criteria for a statistical conclusion applied independently to each cohort, with the exception of the cohort with unknown d \\-dimer levels.\n\n【31】The primary analysis involved a Bayesian cumulative logistic-regression model (shown in the Supplementary Appendix ) that was used to calculate the posterior distribution for the proportional odds ratio for organ support–free days. The primary model was adjusted for age, sex, trial site, and enrollment time interval (in 2-week intervals). Patients in the severe-disease and moderate-disease cohorts were included in the model. Weakly informative Dirichlet prior probability distributions were specified to model the baseline probabilities for each value for organ support–free days in the severe-disease and moderate-disease cohorts. The model was used to estimate treatment effects in each of the cohorts (the severe-disease cohort and the moderate-disease cohort stratified according to d \\-dimer level), with the use of a Bayesian hierarchical approach. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> The treatment effects of anticoagulation in the severe-disease and moderate-disease cohorts were nested in a hierarchical prior distribution centered on an overall intervention effect that had been estimated with a neutral prior distribution, but distinct cohort-specific effects were estimated. When consistent effects were observed between the cohorts, the posterior distribution for the intervention effect in each cohort was shrunk toward the overall estimate. For the purposes of this report, the primary analysis involved all the patients enrolled in the multiplatform trial (including the severe-disease and moderate-disease cohorts) for whom data on the primary outcome were available as of April 8, 2021. The analysis of this data set was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan.\n\n【32】The primary model was fit with the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with 100,000 samples from the joint posterior distribution, which allowed calculation of the posterior distributions for the odds ratios, including medians and 95% credible intervals, and the posterior probabilities of superiority (indicated by an odds ratio of >1), futility (indicated by an odds ratio of <1.2), or inferiority (indicated by an odds ratio of <1). A similar model was run for survival to hospital discharge. Prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary model are described in the Supplementary Appendix . To assess the influence of potential prior enthusiasm for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation (i.e., a prior distribution expressing a higher probability of success with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation than with usual-care thromboprophylaxis), a sensitivity analysis was conducted with the use of an enthusiastic prior distribution (prior mean odds ratio, 1.75; 95% credible interval, 0.74 to 4.15; prior probability of superiority, 90%).\n\n【33】For the key secondary end points, similar models were restricted to the severe-disease cohort without borrowing information from the moderate-disease cohort. Subgroup analyses assessed whether the treatment effect varied according to age, sex, receipt of mechanical ventilation at baseline, and intensity of thromboprophylaxis dosing in the group that received usual-care thromboprophylaxis (defined on the basis of the pattern of practice at each site, as described in the Supplementary Appendix ). In a post hoc exploratory analysis, a possible interaction between assignment to therapeutic-dose anticoagulation or usual-care thromboprophylaxis and assignment to receive an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist or standard care (control) in REMAP-CAP was evaluated.\n\n【34】Results\n-------\n\n【35】Characteristics of the Patients\n-------------------------------\n\n【36】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Screening, Enrollment, Randomization, and Inclusion in Analysis.\n\n【37】Sites used varying screening and documentation practices during the pandemic to identify eligible patients (shown in the protocol); as reported, 3799 were assessed for eligibility in ACTIV-4a, 7202 in ATTACC, and 2372 in REMAP-CAP. “Other” exclusion criteria included an absence of a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and a duration of hospital stay anticipated to be less than 72 hours. Patients who had moderate Covid-19 at baseline may have been included in calculations for covariate adjustment and dynamic borrowing.\n\n【38】The first patient underwent randomization on April 21, 2020. During the trial, randomization proportions were modified in the REMAP-CAP platform to 0.388 for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 0.612 for usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis on the basis of an adaptive interim analysis on November 20, 2020 (see the Supplementary Appendix ). Enrollment was discontinued in the severe-disease cohort on December 19, 2020, after an adaptive interim analysis showed that the statistical criterion for futility had been met. At that time, a total of 1207 patients with severe suspected or confirmed Covid-19 had undergone randomization at 393 sites in 10 countries (with 591 assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 616 assigned to receive usual-care thromboprophylaxis) 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these patients, 23 withdrew consent and 81 did not have laboratory-confirmed Covid-19; data on the primary outcome were not available for an additional 5 patients as of April 8, 2021. The current report presents the results of the primary analysis involving 1103 patients with severe confirmed Covid-19; data on the primary outcome were available for 1098 of these patients.\n\n【39】Table 1.  Table 1. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Patients at Baseline.\n\n【40】The baseline characteristics of the patients were similar in the two intervention groups 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The majority of patients were enrolled through REMAP-CAP (929 of 1103 enrolled patients, 84%). The pattern of anticoagulant administration in the intervention groups is described in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix . Among the patients who were assigned to receive usual-care thromboprophylaxis and for whom data were available, the initial postrandomization dose equivalent corresponded to standard low-dose thromboprophylaxis in 41% and to enhanced intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis in 51%.\n\n【41】Primary Outcome\n---------------\n\n【42】Table 2. Table 2. Primary and Secondary Outcomes. Figure 2.  Figure 2. Organ Support–free Days Up to Day 21.\n\n【43】Panel A shows the proportions of patients in each intervention group with each value for organ support–free days, with death listed first on the x axis (−1). Curves that rise more slowly indicate a more favorable distribution in the number of days alive and free of organ support. The height of each curve at −1 indicates the in-hospital mortality associated with each intervention. The height of each curve at any point from 0 to 21 days indicates the proportion of patients with that number of organ support–free days or fewer (e.g., at 10 days, the curve indicates the proportion of patients with ≤10 organ support–free days). The difference in height between the two curves at any point represents the difference in the cumulative probability of having a number of organ support–free days less than or equal to that number on the x axis. Panel B shows the values for organ support–free days as horizontally stacked proportions for each intervention group. Red represents worse outcomes and blue better outcomes. The median adjusted odds ratio in the primary analysis was 0.83 (95% credible interval, 0.67 to 1.03; posterior probability of futility, 99.9%). Among the patients in REMAP-CAP, 12 patients assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 19 patients assigned to receive usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis had 21 organ support–free days; the cardiovascular or respiratory organ support these patients had been receiving at the time of randomization was discontinued within 12 hours after randomization.\n\n【44】Among the patients assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, the median value for organ support–free days was 1 (interquartile range, –1 to 16); among the patients assigned to usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, the median value was 4 (interquartile range, –1 to 16). The median adjusted proportional odds ratio for the effect of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation on organ support–free days was 0.83 (95% credible interval, 0.67 to 1.03), yielding a posterior probability of futility of 99.9% and a posterior probability of inferiority of 95.0% 删除2:<u>( Table 2 and Figure 2 )</u>. A total of 335 of 534 patients (62.7%) assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and 364 of 564 patients (64.5%) assigned to receive usual-care thromboprophylaxis survived to hospital discharge. The median adjusted proportional odds ratio for survival to hospital discharge was 0.84 (95% credible interval, 0.64 to 1.11; posterior probability of inferiority, 89.2%). The median adjusted absolute difference in the percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge (therapeutic-dose anticoagulation minus usual-care thromboprophylaxis) was –4.1 percentage points (95% credible interval, –10.7 to 2.4).\n\n【45】Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses\n---------------------------------\n\n【46】In sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome 删除2:<u>(Table S2)</u>, incorporation of prior enthusiasm for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation did not modify the conclusion (median adjusted proportional odds ratio, 0.86; 95% credible interval, 0.70 to 1.07). The inclusion of patients with suspected Covid-19 or exclusion of patients who were concomitantly receiving an antiplatelet agent at baseline or those who underwent concomitant randomization in the REMAP-CAP antiplatelet-agent domain also yielded similar results. Among the 273 patients with severe confirmed Covid-19 who had also been randomly assigned to receive either an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist or no immunomodulation in REMAP-CAP, there was no evidence of a meaningful interaction between the anticoagulation and immunomodulation domains 删除2:<u>(Table S3 and Fig. S1)</u>. In prespecified subgroup analyses, the estimated effect did not vary meaningfully according to age, sex, baseline receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation, or the site-specific dosing pattern for usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (intermediate vs. low dose) 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>.\n\n【47】Secondary Outcomes\n------------------\n\n【48】Although fewer patients had major thrombotic events in the group assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation than in the group assigned to receive usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (6.4% vs. 10.4%), the incidence of the secondary efficacy outcome of major thrombotic events or death was similar in the two groups (40.1% and 41.1%, respectively; median adjusted odds ratio, 1.04; 95% credible interval, 0.79 to 1.35) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. An analysis incorporating deep-vein thrombosis showed similar results. A breakdown of the thrombotic events is provided in Table S4. A major bleeding event occurred during the treatment period in 3.8% of the patients assigned to receive therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 2.3% of those assigned to receive usual-care thromboprophylaxis 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.\n\n【49】Discussion\n----------\n\n【50】In this multiplatform, randomized trial involving more than 1000 critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation did not increase the probability of survival to hospital discharge or the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support and had a 95% probability of being inferior to usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. There was an 89% probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation led to a lower probability of survival to hospital discharge than usual-care thromboprophylaxis. Bleeding complications were infrequent in both intervention groups.\n\n【51】Our results refute the hypothesis that routine therapeutic-dose anticoagulation benefits critically ill patients with Covid-19. This hypothesis was based in part on observational studies that reported an association between therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and improved outcomes. 删除3:<u><sup><a>14,20,21 </a></sup></u> Multiple small and moderate-size randomized trials continue to evaluate different anticoagulation strategies in Covid-19. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22</a></sup></u>\n\n【52】The net effect of anticoagulation on clinical outcomes in patients with Covid-19 may depend on the timing of initiation in relation to disease course and may vary with the severity of illness (and the degree of coagulation or inflammation) at the time that therapy is commenced. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23-25 </a></sup></u> Despite demonstrable activation of coagulation in multiple organ systems in patients with severe Covid-19, it is possible that initiation of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation after severe Covid-19 has developed may be too late to alter the consequences of established disease processes.\n\n【53】In this trial, the probability of inferiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with respect to the primary outcome was 95%. Mechanisms accounting for likely harm are uncertain. Although the incidence of major bleeding was numerically higher with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation than with usual-care thromboprophylaxis, it was still low (3.8%). Autopsy findings in patients with Covid-19 and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome have included microthrombosis but also alveolar hemorrhage. 删除3:<u><sup><a>26 </a></sup></u> It is possible that in the presence of marked pulmonary inflammation, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation might exacerbate alveolar hemorrhage, leading to worse outcomes.\n\n【54】In this multiplatform trial, a harmonized pragmatic trial protocol was implemented by three platform networks spanning five continents. The interventions that were evaluated are familiar and widely available, rendering the findings broadly applicable to critically ill patients with severe Covid-19. The collaboration allowed us to reach a conclusion of futility with probable harm much more quickly than would have been possible as independent platforms.\n\n【55】One limitation of our trial is the open-label design, which may have introduced bias in the ascertainment of thrombotic events. A second possible limitation is that a substantial majority of the patients who were enrolled in the severe-disease cohort were in the United Kingdom, where national practice guidelines changed during the trial to recommend that patients with Covid-19 who were admitted to an ICU receive intermediate-dose anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Many patients in the usual-care thromboprophylaxis group therefore received intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis. It is possible that the effect of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in patients with severe Covid-19 varies according to the type of treatment given to the comparator group, although we did not find evidence of meaningful differences in treatment effect according to site proclivity for low-dose or intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis. Recent data also suggest that intermediate-dose thromboprophylaxis is not superior to standard or low-dose thromboprophylaxis for the treatment of critically ill patients. 删除3:<u><sup><a>27</a></sup></u>\n\n【56】In critically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin was not associated with a greater probability of survival to hospital discharge or a greater number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support than was usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was inferior to usual-care thromboprophylaxis with respect to these outcomes was high.\n\n【57】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【58】参考删除-1:<u>REMAP-CAP was supported by the European Union through FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION: the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics (PREPARE) consortium (grant 602525) and the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program: the Rapid European Covid-19 Emergency Research response (RECOVER) consortium (grant 101003589) and by grants from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1101719 and APP1116530), the Health Research Council of New Zealand (16/631), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Innovative Clinical Trials Program Grant 158584 and COVID-19 Rapid Research Operating Grant 447335), the U.K. National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, the Health Research Board of Ireland (CTN 2014-012), the UPMC Learning While Doing Program, the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium, the French Ministry of Health (PHRC-20-0147), the Minderoo Foundation, Amgen, Eisai, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research, and the Wellcome Trust Innovations Project (215522).

While in the trial, a high percentage of patients were treated with glucocorticoid or tocilizumab (more than 80% totally) , suggesting that most patients had levels of inflammation at least high enough to require systemic anti-inflammatory therapy. To reduce potential baseline imbalanced levels of inflammation and the effect of antiinflammatory therapy on heparin efficacy, we suggest that a subgroup analysis can be performed in those with relatively lower levels of inflammation (for example, setting h-CRP below a reasonable threshold or choose the subjects who did not meet the criteria for anti-inflammatory therapy in the trial) to determine the exact efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation.

False negative results in early epithelial malignant pleural mesothelioma have been reported. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】Measurement of the uptake of 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine has been useful for metabolic imaging of brain tumors. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> This uptake is related to the overexpression of the LAT-1 amino acid transporter. After administration, the tracer is incorporated into proteins, and imaging reflects the increased metabolic activity of the tumor.\n\n【4】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Axial CT and PET CT Images of the Chest.\n\n【5】In each panel, the image on the left side is a CT scan obtained without the administration of contrast material, and the image on the right side is a PET CT scan obtained after the administration of either 删除3:<u><sup>18 </sup></u> F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) or 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine. All the scans are at the same level. Panel A shows a mediastinal PET CT scan obtained 60 minutes after the administration of FDG. No uptake of FDG is visible at the site of the disease. Panel B shows a PET CT scan obtained 10 minutes after the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine. Abnormal tracer uptake is present in the left mediastinal pleura. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV <sub>max </sub> ) was 4.3. On the CT image in Panel B, a pleural effusion on the left side is evident. Panel C shows scans obtained after the patient had undergone two cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin. On the PET CT scan, which was obtained 10 minutes after the administration of 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine, the tracer uptake in the same area as that shown on the pretreatment scan is normal. Visual analysis was confirmed by a reduction in the SUV <sub>max </sub> to 2.2.\n\n【6】We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial malignant mesothelioma of the left pleura. The results of a pretreatment FDG-PET CT study 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u> were negative. She underwent a 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine PET CT study 2 weeks later. It showed diffuse uptake in the left anterior mediastinal pleura and two foci of pleural uptake in the para-aortic and left bronchial regions 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. The patient received chemotherapy with pemetrexed (an inhibitor of folate synthesis) plus carboplatin. After two courses of therapy, a second 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine PET CT study showed very little uptake of the radiopharmaceutical agent 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>.\n\n【7】The detectable 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine uptake in a patient with malignant pleural mesothelioma who had an otherwise negative FDG-PET CT evaluation and the early reduction of this uptake during treatment suggest that metabolic imaging with 删除3:<u><sup>11 </sup></u> C-labeled methionine could be an alternative for the metabolic measurement of malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients with negative findings on FDG-PET scans.\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Giovanni L.

In Sweden, pertussis became endemic during the 1970s despite vaccination. Because of its limited efficacy, the Swedish-made whole-cell vaccine was withdrawn in 1979.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】To evaluate the efficacy of an acellular vaccine consisting of pertussis toxin inactivated by hydrogen peroxide (pertussis toxoid), we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Sweden. Infants were vaccinated with either diphtheria and tetanus toxoids alone (DT toxoids, 1726 infants) or diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxoids (DTP toxoids, 1724 infants) at 3, 5, and 12 months of age.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】There were no serious reactions. With the pertussis vaccine there were slightly more local reactions than with the DT toxoids alone, but the rates of postvaccination fever were the same. The main period of surveillance, which began 30 days after the third vaccination, continued for a median of 17.5 months. There were 312 cases of pertussis (72 in the DTP-toxoids group and 240 in the DT-toxoids group) that met the clinical criterion (paroxysmal cough lasting >21 days) and laboratory criteria for pertussis as defined by the World Health Organization. The efficacy of this acellular vaccine was 71 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 63 to 78 percent). The recipients of DTP toxoids who had pertussis had cough of shorter duration than the recipients of DT toxoids, and fewer had whooping and vomiting. The vaccine efficacy after two doses was 55 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 78 percent), on the basis of 14 cases in the DTP-toxoids group and 31 in the DT-toxoids group that met the definition of the World Health Organization.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】A pharmacologically inert, acellular pertussis-toxoid vaccine that is easily standardized is safe and confers substantial protection against pertussis.\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Vaccines consisting of inactivated _Bordetella pertussis_ induce protection against pertussis, but estimates of their efficacy vary from 40 to 90 percent. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> There is no consensus about what the protective moieties are in whole-cell vaccines or what mechanism induces protection. The potency of whole-cell vaccines is estimated by the mouse protection test, which has considerable variability. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3 </a></sup></u> Local reactions and fever are frequent after the administration of whole-cell vaccines, which are also associated with hypotonic–hyporesponsive events, persistent crying, and convulsions. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> These limitations of whole-cell vaccines have stimulated the development of vaccines made with purified antigens, which should have fewer side effects and be easier to standardize. All acellular vaccines contain detoxified pertussis toxin; some also contain filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】Because every vaccine component has the potential for causing side effects, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single-component, pharmacologically inert pertussis toxoid. Pertussis toxin is a protein with a central role in the pathogenesis of pertussis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,6 </a></sup></u> Open studies and a double-blind study indicate that pertussis toxoids induce protection. 删除3:<u><sup><a>7-9 </a></sup></u> The present trial was performed in Sweden, where pertussis has been endemic since the early 1970s, when changes in production made the Swedish-made whole-cell vaccine ineffective. 删除3:<u><sup><a>10 </a></sup></u> When the incidence of pertussis increased despite vaccination rates of about 90 percent, the recommended infant vaccine was withdrawn in 1979. Since then, Sweden has had no licensed pertussis vaccine. Accordingly, it was possible to perform a placebo-controlled study. Inclusion of a whole-cell vaccine was considered undesirable because renewed licensure of a whole-cell vaccine in Sweden was highly unlikely.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】Study Design\n------------\n\n【15】The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Infants were randomly assigned to be vaccinated with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT toxoids) or to receive the same DT toxoids with pertussis toxoid (DTP toxoids). Vaccines were injected subcutaneously in the anterolateral part of the thigh at 3, 5, and 12 months of age, as is recommended for DT toxoids in Sweden.\n\n【16】The study protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the Medical Products Agency, Uppsala, Sweden; and the Ethics Committee, Göteborg University. All parents gave written consent after receiving oral and written information.\n\n【17】Vaccines\n--------\n\n【18】The pertussis toxoid inactivated by hydrogen peroxide was developed at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and manufactured by Amvax (Beltsville, Md.). The vaccine elicits serum antibodies that neutralize pertussis toxin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8,11 </a></sup></u> The DT toxoids were manufactured by Statens Seruminstitut (Copenhagen, Denmark). One 0.5-ml dose (DT-toxoids lot K36, DTP-toxoids lot K36-567) consisted of 25 flocculation units of diphtheria toxoid and 7 flocculation units of tetanus toxoid adsorbed onto 0.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide with 0.01 percent thimerosal, with or without 40 μg of pertussis toxoid. The purity of pertussis toxin was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The inactivation of pertussis toxin was verified by tests for histamine sensitization, toxicity in Chinese-hamster-ovary cells, and hemagglutinating activity. The DTP-toxoids vaccine passed the rabbit pyrogenicity and general-safety assays of the FDA. The DT toxoids and DTP toxoids were identical in appearance. Vials were filled and coded in sets of three, one set for each child, according to a computer-based randomization list. No other vaccine was given with the study vaccines.\n\n【19】Recruitment and Study Cohort\n----------------------------\n\n【20】Full-term, healthy infants in the Göteborg area were eligible for the study if the family had a telephone and if a parent spoke Swedish. About 99 percent of Swedish children visit publicly financed child health centers, where the first information about the study was given to parents. Vaccinations and follow-up were performed by project nurses at five study sites.\n\n【21】During the recruitment period, 7040 newborns were registered at 96 child health centers in the area. The parents of 3450 of 5964 eligible children (58 percent) agreed to participate. Of those, 1724 were randomly assigned to receive DTP toxoids, and 1726 to receive DT toxoids. The 1750 boys and 1700 girls were evenly distributed between the two groups. There were 817 recipients of DTP toxoids and 850 recipients of DT toxoids with one or more older siblings. At 13 months, 8 percent of the DTP-toxoids group attended day-care centers, as compared with 7 percent of the DT-toxoids group; at 27 months, the respective figures were 55 and 51 percent. The first vaccination was given to the 3450 participants between September 1991 and September 1992. The second was given to 3425 children and the third to 3379 between May 1992 and July 1993.\n\n【22】Fifty-two children (1.5 percent; 30 in the DTP-toxoids group and 22 in the DT-toxoids group) were withdrawn from the study, 27 before and 25 after the third vaccination. Twenty-three moved, contraindicating diseases developed in 2, 1 had pertussis before the first vaccination, 1 died, and the parents of 25 declined further participation.\n\n【23】Coughing episodes starting between the first vaccination and July 24, 1994, were included in the study analysis. On that day the median age of the children was 30.5 months (range, 26 to 37). The surveillance period was divided into two parts: from the first vaccination until 29 days after the third, and from 30 days after the third vaccination until July 24, 1994 (the main period of follow-up). The median duration of follow-up during the main period was 17.5 months (range, 13 to 24). The randomization code was broken on November 18, 1994.\n\n【24】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【25】Parents measured the children's rectal temperatures 6, 24, and 48 hours after each vaccination and inspected the injection site daily for seven days, after which time they were interviewed about their children's temperatures, local reactions, and such events as convulsions, symptoms of the hypotonic–hyporesponsive syndrome, and persistent crying. During the study, the parents were contacted monthly by telephone. Visits to doctors and hospitalizations were noted. Between August 1 and November 18, 1994, a final interview was conducted with parents of 3413 of the 3450 children originally enrolled (99 percent).\n\n【26】Coughing Episodes\n-----------------\n\n【27】Parents were instructed to contact the study nurse if anyone in the family coughed for seven or more days. A nasopharyngeal sample for culture and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analysis and a serum sample were obtained. A serum sample was also obtained during convalescence, at least four weeks later. The duration of cough, paroxysms, whooping, vomiting, fever, and rhinitis and the use of antibiotics were recorded. Follow-up continued for at least 60 days or until the cough ended.\n\n【28】We followed the guidelines of the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare, which recommend prophylaxis with erythromycin for infants under 6 months of age and early treatment for infants 6 to 11 months old and for siblings of infants under 12 months old. All prescriptions of macrolides were documented.\n\n【29】Laboratory Assays\n-----------------\n\n【30】Secretions obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured on Regan–Lowe medium 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> and in an enrichment medium (Regan–Lowe with 50 percent charcoal agar), and PCR was used to detect _B. pertussis_ and _B. parapertussis_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>13,14 </a></sup></u> Colonies of _B. pertussis_ and _B. parapertussis_ were verified by Gram's staining, agglutination, and biochemical tests.\n\n【31】Antibodies against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 删除3:<u><sup><a>15,16 </a></sup></u> in duplicate in eight threefold dilutions starting from 1:10 for IgG and 1:100 for IgM and IgA. The pertussis toxin was obtained from Amvax, and the filamentous hemagglutinin from the Institut Pasteur Mérieux, (Marcy l'Etoile, France). The reference was pertussis antiserum lot 3 from the FDA. Titers were defined as the reciprocal serum dilution corresponding to an absorbance of 0.2 above the background level. On the basis of intraassay variation and variation in individual subjects, threefold increases were considered statistically significant if the titer in the serum sample obtained during convalescence was >200. On the basis of a pilot study, titers of >6000 for IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin concurrently in a single convalescence serum sample were considered a sign of pertussis (data not shown).\n\n【32】Serum was obtained from 3361 children at least four weeks after the third vaccination. IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin and toxin-neutralizing antibodies 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> were measured.\n\n【33】Case Definitions\n----------------\n\n【34】Table 1. Table 1. Categories of Coughing Episodes in the Göteborg Classification. Table 2.  Table 2. Major and Minor Criteria for Pertussis in the Göteborg Classification.\n\n【35】Coughing episodes were classified according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> and according to the Göteborg classification 删除2:<u>( Table 1 and Table 2 )</u> developed by the authors. The WHO definition of pertussis includes a paroxysmal cough lasting 21 days or more and at least one of the following: a positive culture, a positive culture in a family member with onset of pertussis within 28 days before or after the onset of the episode studied, and a statistically significant increase in IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin or filamentous hemagglutinin.\n\n【36】The Göteborg classification was developed because the WHO definition accepts only household contact confirmed by culture as a criterion and because an acute-phase serum sample, necessary for the detection of an increase in antibodies, is not always obtained. Moreover, increases in filamentous-hemagglutinin antibodies can be seen in both pertussis and parapertussis and these antibodies cross-react with outer-membrane proteins of nonencapsulated _Haemophilus influenzae_ . 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【37】Children with confirmed, probable, or unverified pertussis (categories 1, 2, and 3 in Table 1 ) were considered at risk for pertussis until the first day of cough. Children with parapertussis (category 4) were considered to be still at risk for pertussis. 删除3:<u><sup><a>20</a></sup></u>\n\n【38】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【39】The efficacy of the pertussis vaccine was estimated as 1 - R, where R is the ratio of incidence rates (the number of cases divided by the total time at risk) in recipients of DTP toxoids and DT toxoids. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for efficacy were estimated by exact calculation 删除3:<u><sup><a>21 </a></sup></u> based on the conditional binomial distribution that follows from the assumption of a Poisson distribution for cases in each group. 删除3:<u><sup><a>22 </a></sup></u> Proportions were compared with a two-sided Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables with the two-sided permutation t-test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】Safety\n------\n\n【42】Table 3.  Table 3. Occurrence of Fever within 48 Hours and Local Reactions within 7 Days in Children Vaccinated with DTP Toxoids or with DT Toxoids.\n\n【43】There were no serious reactions to the vaccines. No child was withdrawn because of an adverse reaction. The frequency of fever within 48 hours of vaccination did not differ between the groups. Redness and swelling increased with the number of vaccinations and were somewhat more common among recipients of DTP toxoids 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. Irritability and feeding and sleeping problems were equally frequent in the two groups. No child had the hypotonic–hyporesponsive syndrome, persistent or high-pitched crying, or afebrile convulsions. Two recipients of DTP toxoids had febrile convulsions within 48 hours after the third vaccination; both had respiratory tract infections. The one child who died was a DTP-toxoids recipient who had pneumococcal endocarditis. Four children, all recipients of DT toxoids, had invasive bacterial infections with favorable outcomes. Malignant diseases developed in five children (two in the DTP-toxoids group and three in the DT-toxoids group). The frequency of other serious diseases was similar in the two groups.\n\n【44】Bordetella Infections\n---------------------\n\n【45】There were 2037 coughing episodes lasting at least seven days with onset before July 25, 1994, in children in the study. Of those, 465 (160 in the DTP-toxoids group and 305 in the DT-toxoids group) met the criteria for confirmed or probable pertussis (categories 1 and 2, Table 1 ), including 368 (92 in the DTP-toxoids group and 276 in the DT-toxoids group) that met the WHO definition. Another 14 children (4 in the DTP-toxoids group and 10 in the DT-toxoids group) had clinical pertussis without laboratory confirmation (category 3). Twelve children (seven in the DTP-toxoids group and five in the DT-toxoids group) had confirmed parapertussis. None of the 491 children with bordetella infections were hospitalized.\n\n【46】In family members, 336 of 917 coughing episodes met the WHO definition. Another 98 family members had confirmed or probable pertussis according to the Göteborg classification. Twenty-two episodes met the criteria for category 3. Four family members had confirmed parapertussis.\n\n【47】Efficacy during the Main Period of Follow-up\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Table 4.  Table 4. Cases of Pertussis and Efficacy of the Pertussis Vaccine during the Main Period of Follow-up (from 30 Days after the Third Vaccination until the End of the Study).\n\n【49】Thirty days after the third vaccination, 1670 recipients of DTP toxoids and 1665 recipients of DT toxoids remained at risk. The incidence of pertussis, according to the WHO definition, was 2.96 cases per 100 person-years among the recipients of DTP toxoids and 10.32 cases per 100 person-years among the recipients of DT toxoids, respectively. The efficacy of the pertussis vaccine was 71 percent 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>.\n\n【50】Nine children who had paroxysmal cough for 21 days or more (three in the DTP-toxoids group and six in the DT-toxoids group) did not meet the WHO definition but had confirmed or probable pertussis according to the Göteborg classification. Seven had elevated titers of IgG antibodies against both pertussis toxin (7156 to 65,610) and filamentous hemagglutinin (8620 to 21,870) in serum samples obtained during convalescence. Two had household contacts with serologically confirmed pertussis.\n\n【51】Sixty-two children (50 in the DTP-toxoids group and 12 in the DT-toxoids group) received diagnoses of confirmed or probable pertussis with paroxysmal cough lasting less than 21 days. The incidence of pertussis including all children with cough lasting at least seven days was 5.13 cases per 100 person-years among the recipients of DTP toxoids and 11.09 cases per 100 person-years among the recipients of DT toxoids (efficacy of the pertussis vaccine, 54 percent) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>.\n\n【52】Table 5.  Table 5. Comparison of Clinical Symptoms among Recipients of DTP Toxoids and of DT Toxoids during the Main Period of Follow-up, According to the Classification of Pertussis.\n\n【53】Periods of cough, vomiting, and whooping were significantly shorter in children with pertussis in the DTP-toxoids group than in those in the DT-toxoids group 删除2:<u>( Table 5 )</u>. There were no significant differences in efficacy between boys and girls or among the five study sites and no decreasing efficacy with time after the third vaccination.\n\n【54】Possible Sources of Bias\n------------------------\n\n【55】Nine children (two in the DTP-toxoids group and seven in the DT-toxoids group), who were not included in efficacy estimates, had clinical pertussis without laboratory confirmation (category 3). Eight (four of whom were positive for _B. pertussis_ by PCR) had high values for IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin in both the initial and convalescence serum samples but did not have significant increases or titers of >6000 for both antibodies. Their first serum samples were obtained more than 10 days after the onset of cough. No serum samples were available from one child who was positive by PCR.\n\n【56】Three cases of pertussis in recipients of DT toxoids with onset 30 to 60 days after the third vaccination were not included in efficacy estimates because of the timing of serum collection 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Two patients had increases in IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin, and one had titers of IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin above 6000. Erythromycin was given to 5 of 125 recipients of DTP toxoids with pertussis (4 percent) and to 17 of 258 recipients of DT toxoids with pertussis (7 percent) within 14 days after onset of cough. The parents of 25 of the 52 children withdrawn from the study were interviewed during the autumn of 1994 before the randomization code was broken. Three children (two in the DTP-toxoids group and one in the DT-toxoids group) had culture-confirmed pertussis after leaving the study.\n\n【57】Comparison of Diagnostic Assays\n-------------------------------\n\n【58】Cultures were performed for 357 of 383 children with confirmed or probable pertussis. The proportion of positive cultures was lower in DTP-toxoids recipients than in DT-toxoids recipients (49 percent \\[56 of 115\\] vs. 64 percent \\[154 of 242\\], P<0.01). Results of the PCR were similar: 55 of 108 DTP-toxoids recipients with pertussis (51 percent) and 155 of 225 DT-toxoids recipients with pertussis (69 percent) were positive (P<0.01).\n\n【59】Paired serum samples were available for 345 of 383 children with confirmed or probable pertussis. Significant increases in IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin were less common in recipients of DTP toxoids than in recipients of DT toxoids (31 percent \\[33 of 107\\] vs. 89 percent \\[201 of 226\\], P<0.001) because 80 percent of DTP-toxoids recipients had values above 1000 for these antibodies in the acute-phase serum samples, as compared with 20 percent of DT-toxoids recipients. Significant increases in IgG antibodies against filamentous hemagglutinin were seen in 94 percent of the DTP-toxoids recipients (104 of 111) and 92 percent of the DT-toxoids recipients (216 of 234).\n\n【60】A significant increase in IgG antibodies against filamentous hemagglutinin was the only criterion met in 29 cases of pertussis (22 in the DTP-toxoids group and 7 in the DT-toxoids group). In all cases there was a clinical picture of bordetella infection, with known exposure, paroxysmal cough, and little or no rhinitis or fever. Nineteen cases (15 in the DTP-toxoids group and 4 in the DT-toxoids group) met the WHO definition of at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough. Seventeen involved whooping or vomiting. Four of seven DT-toxoids recipients with increases only in IgG antibodies against filamentous hemagglutinin did not have IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies against pertussis toxin in their acute-phase and convalescence serum samples, suggesting parapertussis rather than pertussis. The other three DT-toxoids recipients had IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin in both serum samples, indicating pertussis. The 22 recipients of the DTP toxoids had IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin in both serum samples.\n\n【61】Efficacy before the Main Period of Follow-up\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【62】From the first vaccination to 29 days after the second, 13 children (7 in the DTP-toxoids group and 6 in the DT-toxoids group) had confirmed or probable pertussis with cough lasting at least 7 days. Eleven of these cases met the WHO definition.\n\n【63】From 30 days after the second vaccination to 29 days after the third, there were 69 cases with cough lasting at least 7 days (28 in the DTP-toxoids group and 41 in the DT-toxoids group; efficacy of pertussis vaccine, 31 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 59 percent). Of the 69 cases, 45 met the WHO definition (14 in the DTP-toxoids group and 31 in the DT-toxoids group; efficacy of the pertussis vaccine, 55 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 78 percent).\n\n【64】Serologic Responses\n-------------------\n\n【65】Geometric mean antibody titers were determined at least four weeks after the third vaccination in 71 DTP-toxoids recipients who later had pertussis according to the WHO definition. The values were 5407 for IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin (range, 881 to 77,990) and 200 for neutralizing antibodies (range, 40 to >640). Corresponding titers for 433 randomly selected children in whom pertussis did not develop were 7801 (528 to 65,610) and 244 (40 to >640).\n\n【66】Discussion\n----------\n\n【67】This study shows the safety of the acellular pertussis-toxoid vaccine. Apart from slight increases in local reactions in recipients of DTP toxoids as compared with recipients of DT toxoids, no adverse reactions were observed.\n\n【68】Pertussis is endemic in Sweden, with epidemic peaks about every third year. A peak occurred during the winter of 1993–1994. Seventeen percent of DT-toxoids recipients had pertussis during the trial. After three injections, the efficacy of the acellular vaccine against pertussis with at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough was 71 to 77 percent, depending on the case definition, and 54 percent when all cases with cough lasting at least 7 days were included. The disease had a shorter duration and lower frequency of whooping and vomiting in vaccinated children than in unvaccinated ones.\n\n【69】The evaluation of coughing episodes that resemble pertussis but do not meet laboratory criteria because of suboptimal diagnostic sampling indicated no overestimation of efficacy due to missed cases. The nine cases in category 3 had the same distribution among vaccine groups as cases that met the WHO definition (two in the DTP-toxoids group and seven in the DT-toxoids group). Two other potential causes of bias — erythromycin use and pertussis among children who were withdrawn from the study — were ruled out. The rate of erythromycin use was low (6 percent) and similar in the two groups, and the withdrawal rate was only 1.5 percent.\n\n【70】It is difficult to make detailed comparisons of the efficacy of this pertussis vaccine and that of others. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of whole-cell vaccines have not been performed since the 1950s, when diagnostic methods were different. 删除3:<u><sup><a>23 </a></sup></u> A review of 39 open studies of whole-cell vaccines found efficacy estimates of 40 to 90 percent. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Several factors influence the estimates, including case definitions and rates of pertussis in the population studied. Efficacy estimates were higher when only cases of long duration were included, when laboratory confirmation was required, or when the attack rate in the unvaccinated population was relatively low. Furthermore, the amount of pertussis toxoid varies among whole-cell vaccines. 删除3:<u><sup><a>24,25 </a></sup></u> During the 1980s, a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial was performed in Sweden with a one-component pertussis toxoid and a two-component vaccine composed of pertussis toxoid and filamentous hemagglutinin. 删除3:<u><sup><a>9 </a></sup></u> Both vaccines reduced the incidence and severity of pertussis. Since only two doses were given and the children were 6 to 11 months of age when admitted to the trial, valid comparisons with the pertussis toxoid used in our study are not possible.\n\n【71】Because of cross-reactivity between outer-membrane proteins of nonencapsulated _H. influenzae_ and filamentous hemagglutinin, 删除3:<u><sup><a>19 </a></sup></u> there is a risk of overdiagnosing bordetella infections with serologic tests for filamentous-hemagglutinin antibodies. A clinical analysis of all patients with an increase in IgG antibodies against filamentous hemagglutinin as the only positive laboratory finding indicated, however, that all of them had an infection with bordetella rather than _H. influenzae_ . Thus, cases with an increase in filamentous-hemagglutinin antibodies as the only laboratory evidence of bordetella infection should be included in calculations of vaccine efficacy, even though a few parapertussis cases could be falsely diagnosed as pertussis. If an increase in IgG antibodies against filamentous hemagglutinin alone had not been accepted as diagnostic in our study, the efficacy of the pertussis toxoid against pertussis with at least 21 days of paroxysmal cough would have been 78 percent instead of 71 percent.\n\n【72】This study reveals an important diagnostic difficulty that occurs when antibodies against a vaccine component are assayed for serologic diagnosis. Pertussis-toxin serologic testing had much lower sensitivity in recipients of DTP toxoids than in recipients of DT toxoids, because the DTP-toxoids recipients already had high values for IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin in the acute-phase serum samples. It was therefore of great value to measure antibodies against an antigen (filamentous hemagglutinin) that was not included in the vaccine. In trials of vaccines containing both pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin, the serologic diagnosis will be even more difficult. Furthermore, cultures and the PCR were less sensitive in vaccinated children than in unvaccinated ones.\n\n【73】In conclusion, a pertussis-toxoid vaccine was safe and immunogenic and reduced the incidence and severity of pertussis. Furthermore, recovery of the organism was reduced. We propose that pertussis toxoid is both essential and sufficient for the vaccination of children and adults. It is the simplest and thus theoretically the safest vaccine for pertussis. We are now investigating whether mass vaccination of children with pertussis toxoid will eliminate pertussis, as happened in the case of diphtheria, another noninvasive, toxin-mediated respiratory disease.

These patients had impaired coronary vasodilator responses to the stress of rapid atrial pacing and to the administration of dipyridamole, a potent vasodilator of coronary arterioles. This abnormality appears to be localized to the prearteriolar microvascular bed. To determine whether these patients have a more generalized abnormality of vasodilator reserve, we used mercury-in-Silastic strain-gauge plethysmography to compare their hyperemic responses to forearm ischemia with those of normal controls.\n\n【2】After 10 minutes of ischemia, peak forearm flow was 39.9±5.0 ml per minute per deciliter in the patients and 31.7±10.5 in the controls (21 percent reduction; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 percent to 37 percent). Flow responses were also significantly reduced after three and five minutes of ischemia. Correspondingly, the vascular resistance after ischemia was also consistently higher in the patients with microvascular angina. The degree of vasodilator impairment in the peripheral circulation correlated well with the degree of vasodilator impairment in the coronary circulation (r = 0.74; P<0.004).\n\n【3】Thus, patients with microvascular angina appear to have an impairment of vasodilator reserve that affects not only their coronary circulation but also their peripheral arterial bed. 删除4:<u>(N Engl J Med 1987; 317:1366–70.)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

We tested the efficacy and safety of alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke.\n\n【4】Methods\n-------\n\n【5】After exclusion of patients with a brain hemorrhage or major infarction, as detected on a computed tomographic scan, we randomly assigned patients with acute ischemic stroke in a 1:1 double-blind fashion to receive treatment with intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The primary end point was disability at 90 days, dichotomized as a favorable outcome (a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale, which has a range of 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms at all and 6 indicating death) or an unfavorable outcome (a score of 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale). The secondary end point was a global outcome analysis of four neurologic and disability scores combined. Safety end points included death, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and other serious adverse events.\n\n【6】Results\n-------\n\n【7】We enrolled a total of 821 patients in the study and randomly assigned 418 to the alteplase group and 403 to the placebo group. The median time for the administration of alteplase was 3 hours 59 minutes. More patients had a favorable outcome with alteplase than with placebo (52.4% vs. 45.2%; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.02 to 1.76; P=0.04). In the global analysis, the outcome was also improved with alteplase as compared with placebo (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.65; P<0.05). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase than with placebo (for any intracranial hemorrhage, 27.0% vs. 17.6%; P=0.001; for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 2.4% vs. 0.2%; P=0.008). Mortality did not differ significantly between the alteplase and placebo groups (7.7% and 8.4%, respectively; P=0.68). There was no significant difference in the rate of other serious adverse events.\n\n【8】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【9】As compared with placebo, intravenous alteplase administered between 3 and 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke; alteplase was more frequently associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. 删除5:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00153036 . opens in new tab .)</u>\n\n【10】Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Intravenous thrombolytic treatment with alteplase, initiated within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms, is the only medical therapy currently available for acute ischemic stroke. In 1995, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) study group reported that patients with acute ischemic stroke who received alteplase (0.9 mg per kilogram of body weight) within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms were at least 30% more likely to have minimal or no disability at 3 months than those who received placebo. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Two European trials, the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) and ECASS II, investigated a time window of up to 6 hours but failed to show the efficacy of thrombolytic treatment, as defined by each trial. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3</a></sup></u>\n\n【12】A subsequent analysis of the NINDS study 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> and the combined analysis 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> of data from six randomized trials, 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3,6,7 </a></sup></u> which investigated thrombolysis treatment for ischemic stroke in a total of 2775 patients, showed a clear association between treatment efficacy and the interval between the onset of symptoms and administration of the thrombolytic agent. In the pooled analysis, a favorable outcome was observed even if treatment was given between 3 and 4.5 hours, with an odds ratio of 1.4 for a favorable outcome with alteplase treatment as compared with placebo. This analysis also suggested that the longer time window, as compared with the shorter window, was not associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> International guidelines recommend alteplase as a first-line treatment for eligible patients when administered within 3 hours after the onset of stroke. 删除3:<u><sup><a>8-10 </a></sup></u> Despite this recommendation, alteplase is underused; it is estimated that fewer than 2% of patients receive this treatment in most countries, primarily because of delayed admission to a stroke center. 删除3:<u><sup><a>11</a></sup></u>\n\n【13】Thrombolysis with alteplase has been approved in most countries. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) granted approval of alteplase in 2002 but included two requests. One request was that an observational safety study be initiated; subsequently, the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke–Monitoring Study (SITS–MOST) was undertaken. This study confirmed that alteplase is as safe and effective in routine clinical practice as it is in randomized trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> The second request was that a randomized trial be conducted in which the therapeutic time window was extended beyond 3 hours.\n\n【14】We describe the results of ECASS III, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial designed to test the hypothesis that the efficacy of alteplase administered in patients with acute ischemic stroke can be safely extended to a time window of 3 to 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】Patient Population and Study Design\n-----------------------------------\n\n【17】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Numbers of Patients Who Were Enrolled, Randomly Assigned to a Study Group, and Included in the Per-Protocol Population.\n\n【18】The intention-to-treat population was defined as all patients who were enrolled and randomly assigned to a study group. The per-protocol population was defined as all randomly assigned patients who received alteplase or placebo and who were not excluded because of major protocol violations, which included, most notably, noncompliance with the current European Summary of Product Characteristics for alteplase (excluding time window of treatment). Of the randomly assigned patients, 771 were evaluated by means of CT and 50 by means of MRI at baseline. Among the 418 patients assigned to treatment with alteplase, 13 were lost to follow-up, and among the 403 patients assigned to receive placebo, 10 were lost to follow-up; the worst possible outcome for the primary end point was imputed for these patients. Among those excluded from per-protocol analyses, reasons for exclusion listed as “other” included a history of both stroke and diabetes, treatment with an oral anticoagulant within 24 hours, broken medication code, treatment with a prohibited medication, no ischemic stroke, and either no informed consent or withdrawal of consent.Table 1.  Table 1. Major Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.\n\n【19】ECASS III was a double-blind, parallel-group trial that enrolled patients from multiple centers across Europe (see the Appendix). Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were 18 to 80 years of age, had received a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, and were able to receive the study drug within 3 to 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. A cerebral computed tomographic (CT) scan was required before randomization to exclude patients who had an intracranial hemorrhage or major ischemic infarction. In some cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed instead of CT 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 1 . In May 2005, after 228 patients had been enrolled, the study protocol was amended, and the time window of 3 to 4 hours was extended by 0.5 hour (3 to 4.5 hours). There were two reasons for the extension of the time window: the publication of the pooled analysis, which suggested that patients may benefit from thrombolytic treatment administered up to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms, 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> and a slow rate of patient recruitment. The trial protocol and the amendments were accepted by the EMEA and were approved by the institutional review boards of the participating centers. All patients or legally authorized representatives gave written informed consent before enrollment.\n\n【20】Randomization and Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 0.9 mg of alteplase (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) per kilogram, administered intravenously (with an upper limit of 90 mg), or placebo. An interactive voice-randomization system was used, with randomization at centers performed in blocks of four to ensure a balanced distribution of group assignments at any time. The size of the blocks was withheld from the investigators to make sure that they were unaware of the treatment assignments. Alteplase and matched placebo were reconstituted from a lyophilized powder in sterile water for injection. Of the total dose, 10% was administered as a bolus, and the remainder was given by continuous intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes. With the exception of the extended time window, alteplase was to be used in accordance with current European labeling.\n\n【22】Study Management\n----------------\n\n【23】The steering committee designed and oversaw the trial. An independent data and safety monitoring board regularly monitored the safety of the trial. The data and safety monitoring board did not have access to functional outcome data but received a group assignment of A or B for death and C or D for monitoring of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage to ensure unbiased review of each of the two main safety outcomes. The chair of the data and safety monitoring board, who contributed to the design of the trial but had no role in the conduct of the study, was invited to be part of the writing committee after completion of the trial. Monitoring and data management were undertaken by the sponsor of the trial. Statistical analyses were performed simultaneously by an independent external statistician and the statistician of the sponsor. The steering committee had complete access to the trial data after the database had been locked and assumed complete responsibility for the final statistical analysis and interpretation of the results. All study committees are listed in the Appendix. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses.\n\n【24】Concomitant Therapies\n---------------------\n\n【25】Treatment with intravenous heparin, oral anticoagulants, aspirin, or volume expanders such as hetastarch or dextrans during the first 24 hours after administration of the study drug had been completed was prohibited. However, the use of subcutaneous heparin (≤10,000 IU), or of equivalent doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, was permitted for prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis.\n\n【26】Clinical Assessment\n-------------------\n\n【27】Patients were assessed by an examiner who was unaware of the treatment assignment. Assessments were made at the time of enrollment, at 1, 2, and 24 hours after administration of the study drug was begun, and on days 7, 30, and 90 after administration of the drug. In addition, the patients' clinical condition (e.g., blood pressure, oxygenation, and heart rate) was closely monitored for the first 24 hours. Initial assessments included a physical examination, CT or MRI, and the quantification of any neurologic deficit with the use of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a 15-item scale that measures the level of neurologic impairment. Total scores on the NIHSS range from 0 to 42, with higher values reflecting more severe cerebral infarcts (<5, mild impairment; ≥25, very severe neurologic impairment). 删除3:<u><sup><a>13 </a></sup></u> Examiners were trained and certified in the use of the NIHSS examination. Patients were assessed with the NIHSS on days 1, 7, 30, and 90. The modified Rankin scale, 删除3:<u><sup><a>14 </a></sup></u> a measure of disability, was used to assess patients on days 30 and 90. Scores on the modified Rankin scale range from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 6 (death); a score of 5 indicates severe disability (the patient is bedridden and incontinent and requires constant nursing care and attention). Investigators were instructed in the use of the modified Rankin scale by watching video clips from a training DVD. 删除3:<u><sup><a>15 </a></sup></u> During the follow-up period, two other commonly used functional scales were also applied 删除3:<u><sup><a>16 </a></sup></u> : the Barthel Index 删除3:<u><sup><a>17 </a></sup></u> and the Glasgow Outcome Scale. 删除3:<u><sup><a>18 </a></sup></u> The Barthel Index, which assesses the ability to perform activities of daily living, on a scale that ranges from 0 (complete dependence on help with activities of daily living) to 100 (independence), was scored on days 30 and 90. We assigned a score of 0 to patients who died. The Glasgow Outcome Scale, a 5-point scale on which 1 indicates independence, 3 severe disability, and 5 death, was scored on day 90.\n\n【28】Assessment of Hemorrhages and Adjudication of Symptomatic Intracranial Hemorrhage\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】CT or MRI was performed before treatment and 22 to 36 hours after treatment. Additional CT studies were performed at the discretion of the investigators. Members of the safety outcome adjudication committee, who were unaware of the treatment assignments, reviewed all CT or MRI scans, classified the findings according to the ECASS morphologic definitions, 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> and logged the results in a database. On the basis of these findings, the chairs of the safety outcome adjudication committee and the steering committee, who remained unaware of the treatment assignments, together adjudicated whether each death or score change indicating neurologic deterioration was likely to have been due to intracranial hemorrhage, other brain injury or disease, or neither of these causes.\n\n【30】Outcome Measures\n----------------\n\n【31】The primary efficacy end point was disability at day 90 (3-month visit), as assessed by means of the modified Rankin scale, dichotomized as a favorable outcome (a score of 0 or 1) or an unfavorable outcome (a score of 2 to 6). The secondary efficacy end point was a global outcome measure that combined the outcomes at day 90 of a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale, a score of 95 or higher on the Barthel Index, a score of 0 or 1 on the NIHSS, and a score of 1 on the Glasgow Outcome Scale. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> Further functional end points were based on predefined cutoff points for the NIHSS score (a score of 0 or 1, or more than an 8-point improvement in the score), the score on the modified Rankin scale (dichotomized as 0 to 2 or 3 to 6), and the Barthel Index (≥95 points), assessed on day 90 and also on day 30. Because of recent interest in the scientific community in a stratified analysis of the outcome distribution of the modified Rankin scale at day 90, this type of evaluation was undertaken according to the methods described previously. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【32】Safety end points included overall mortality at day 90, any intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic edema (defined as brain edema with mass effect as the predominant cause of clinical deterioration), and other serious adverse events. In the ECASS III protocol, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as any apparently extravascular blood in the brain or within the cranium that was associated with clinical deterioration, as defined by an increase of 4 points or more in the score on the NIHSS, or that led to death and that was identified as the predominant cause of the neurologic deterioration. To allow comparison with published data, a post hoc analysis of rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was also performed according to definitions used in other trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,3,12,20</a></sup></u>\n\n【33】Statistical Analysis\n--------------------\n\n【34】Efficacy end points were assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients, whether or not they were treated. In the case of missing data on outcome among patients known to be alive, the worst possible outcome score was assigned. For the primary end point, between-group differences were calculated with the use of the chi-square test of proportions (with a two-sided alpha level of 5%). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated for odds ratios and for relative risk. In keeping with the study protocol, all predefined analyses were performed without adjustment for confounding factors. A post hoc adjusted analysis (logistic regression) of the primary end point was undertaken in the intention-to-treat population. This analysis was performed by including all baseline variables in the model and retaining those that were significant at P<0.10. For the secondary end point — the probability of a favorable outcome with alteplase as compared with placebo — a global odds-ratio test based on a linear logistic-regression model (a method that uses generalized estimation equations to perform a Wald-type test) 删除3:<u><sup><a>21,22 </a></sup></u> was used. For the per-protocol population 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>, the same statistical tests were applied. The post hoc stratified analysis of scores on the modified Rankin scale was adjusted for the two most strongly prognostic baseline variables: the NIHSS score and the time to the start of treatment. 删除3:<u><sup><a>19</a></sup></u>\n\n【35】The calculation of the sample size was based on the analysis of pooled data from the cohorts that received thrombolysis or placebo between 3 and 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> (with data from the first ECASS trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> excluded because of the higher dose of alteplase used in that trial). On the basis of these data, we calculated that 400 patients per group were required in order to have 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.4 for the primary end point.\n\n【36】Results\n-------\n\n【37】Study Patients\n--------------\n\n【38】Table 2.  Table 2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.\n\n【39】Between July 29, 2003, and November 13, 2007, a total of 821 patients from 130 sites in 19 European countries were randomly assigned to a study group: 418 patients were assigned to receive alteplase and 403 patients were assigned to receive placebo 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Grouped according to 0.5-hour intervals, 10.0% of the patients were treated between 3 and 3.5 hours, 46.8% between 3.5 and 4 hours, and 39.2% between 4 and 4.5 hours 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. (The values do not add up to 100% because data on the exact time of treatment initiation were not available for 12 patients in the alteplase group and 15 patients in the placebo group; in addition, treatment was initiated after 4.5 hours in 1 patient in the alteplase group and 5 patients in the placebo group.) Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>, except that there were significant differences between the groups (before adjustment for multiple comparisons) with respect to the initial severity of the stroke and the presence or absence of a history of stroke.\n\n【40】Efficacy\n--------\n\n【41】Table 3.  Table 3. Odds Ratios for Primary End Point and Secondary End Point, Including Components, in the Intention-to-Treat and Per-Protocol Populations at 90 Days.\n\n【42】For the primary end point, 219 of the 418 patients in the alteplase group (52.4%) had a favorable outcome (defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale), as compared with 182 of the 403 patients in the placebo group (45.2%), representing an absolute improvement of 7.2 percentage points (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.02 to 1.76; relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.34; P=0.04). In the post hoc intention-to-treat analysis, adjusted for confounding baseline variables (logistic regression), study-group assignment, baseline NIHSS score, smoking status, time from the onset of stroke to treatment, and presence or absence of prior hypertension were identified as significant at P<0.10. In the adjusted analysis, treatment with alteplase remained significantly associated with a favorable outcome (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.98; P=0.04) 删除2:<u>删除7:<u>( Table 3 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org)</u></u>.\n\n【43】Treatment with alteplase also resulted in a more favorable outcome than that with placebo for the secondary end point, as indicated by the global odds ratio. (Since the global odds-ratio test was based on a linear logistic-regression model, with generalized estimation equations used to perform a Wald-type test, 删除3:<u><sup><a>21,22 </a></sup></u> only probabilities, and not absolute numbers, for each treatment group can be provided.) The global odds ratio for a favorable outcome was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.65; P<0.05), indicating that the odds for a favorable outcome (the ability to return to an independent lifestyle) after stroke were 28% higher with alteplase than with placebo.\n\n【44】Figure 2.  Figure 2. Distribution of Scores on the Modified Rankin Scale.\n\n【45】The distribution of scores is shown for the intention-to-treat population (Panel A) and the per-protocol population (Panel B) at the 3-month visit (90 days plus or minus 14 days). In both the intention-to-treat population and the per-protocol population, stratified analysis of the score distribution showed a significant difference between the study groups (P=0.02 for both comparisons by the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, with adjustment for the baseline score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and for the interval between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of treatment). In the intention-to-treat population, the number of deaths recorded at the 3-month visit (59) was different from the overall number of deaths (66), since 7 deaths occurred after 90 days. The scores on the modified Rankin scale indicate the following: 0, no symptoms at all; 1, no significant disability despite symptoms (able to carry out all usual duties and activities); 2, slight disability (unable to carry out all previous activities but able to look after own affairs without assistance); 3, moderate disability (requiring some help but able to walk without assistance); 4, moderately severe disability (unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance); 5, severe disability (bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and attention); 6, death.\n\n【46】The overall distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale is shown in Figure 2 . The post hoc stratified analysis of scores on the modified Rankin scale at day 90 (performed with the use of the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, with adjustment for the baseline NIHSS score and time to the start of treatment) also showed a favorable outcome with alteplase as compared with placebo (P=0.02).\n\n【47】Table 4.  Table 4. Odds Ratios for Further Functional End Points at Days 90 and 30 after Treatment in the Intention-to-Treat and Per-Protocol Populations.\n\n【48】The results of analyses of further functional end points are summarized in Table 4 . In the intention-to-treat analysis, the odds ratios for a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale, an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, and more than an 8-point improvement in the NIHSS score at day 30 showed a significant advantage of alteplase treatment, whereas there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to the other functional end points. Neurologic status up to day 30 did not differ significantly between the two groups.\n\n【49】Safety\n------\n\n【50】A total of 66 patients died — 32 of the 418 patients in the alteplase group (7.7%) and 34 of the 403 in the placebo group (8.4%). Of these 66 patients, 25 died between days 1 and 7 (12 \\[2.9%\\] in the alteplase group and 13 \\[3.2%\\] in the placebo group), 18 between days 8 and 30 (10 \\[2.4%\\] and 8 \\[2.0%\\], respectively), and 16 between days 31 and 90 (6 \\[1.4%\\] and 10 \\[2.5%\\], respectively). Seven patients died after day 90 (four \\[1.0%\\] and three \\[0.7%\\], respectively).\n\n【51】Table 5.  Table 5. Prespecified Safety End Points and Other Serious Adverse Events.\n\n【52】There were more cases of intracranial hemorrhage in the alteplase group than in the placebo group (27.0% vs. 17.6%, P=0.001). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with alteplase was less than 3 cases per 100 patients (10 of 418 patients \\[2.4%\\]), but that incidence was significantly higher than the incidence with placebo (1 of 403 \\[0.3%\\]; odds ratio, 9.85; 95% CI, 1.26 to 77.32; P=0.008). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to definitions used in other studies followed a similar pattern 删除2:<u>( Table 5 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. All symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred within the first 22 to 36 hours after initiation of treatment.\n\n【53】The rate of symptomatic edema did not differ significantly between the study groups: 6.9% in the alteplase group and 7.2% in the placebo group (29 patients in each group; odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.64; P=0.88) 删除2:<u>( Table 5 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>. Other serious adverse events categorized according to organ system did not differ significantly between the two groups 删除2:<u>( Table 5 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix )</u>.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this randomized, placebo-controlled study, patients with acute ischemic stroke benefited from treatment with intravenous alteplase administered 3 to 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms. ECASS III is the second randomized trial (after the NINDS trial of 1995 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> ) to show a significant treatment effect with intravenous alteplase in the unadjusted analysis of the primary end point. The treatment effect remained significant after adjustment for all prognostic baseline characteristics. The overall rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was increased with alteplase as compared with placebo, but mortality was not affected. Both of these findings are consistent with results from other randomized, controlled trials of thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,5,23 </a></sup></u> The results of the analysis of secondary end points and of the post hoc stratified analysis mirrored the primary efficacy results in favor of alteplase.\n\n【56】The initial severity of a stroke is a strong predictor of the functional and neurologic outcome and of the risk of death. Patients with severe stroke were excluded from this trial in order to meet the protocol requirements requested by the EMEA and to conform with the European label of alteplase. It is likely that the milder initial severity of stroke overall among patients enrolled in this trial as compared with those in the NINDS trial 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> explains, for the most part, the improved outcomes in the placebo group in our study as compared with the outcomes in the placebo group in the NINDS trial. Outcomes in the placebo group in our study were similar to those observed in ECASS II. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【57】In this context, it is interesting to note that there has been a gradual decline in the overall initial severity of stroke and in mortality rates among patients enrolled in major randomized studies of acute ischemic stroke over the past two decades. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3 </a></sup></u> This observation may reflect the trend toward the use of thrombolytic agents in patients who have less severe acute ischemic stroke, as reflected in the results of SITS–MOST, 删除3:<u><sup><a>12 </a></sup></u> as well as the increased number of stroke units in Europe and the improved care provided in such units.\n\n【58】Some of the previous trials of treatment with alteplase for acute ischemic stroke included patients who received treatment within 0 to 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. However, these trials failed to show a significant advantage of alteplase therapy. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2,3,6,24 </a></sup></u> Potential explanations for the failure to show a significant difference in previous trials include the choice of end points, a time window of up to 6 hours, and a lack of statistical power. (In the ECASS II 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> and in the Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke \\[ATLANTIS\\] trial, 删除3:<u><sup><a>6 </a></sup></u> the cohorts that were treated 3 to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms were much smaller, and these studies were therefore not powered to detect an effect size of 7 to 10%.)\n\n【59】Thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, which is the most feared complication. It is difficult, however, to compare the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage across studies because of the varying definitions used. In our study, we modified the ECASS definition of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage by specifying that the hemorrhage had to have been identified as the predominant cause of the neurologic deterioration. With the use of this definition, the difference in rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between the two study groups was significant (a difference of 2.14 percentage points), although the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage among alteplase-treated patients was low. To allow for comparison across trials, we also analyzed rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage according to definitions used in other trials. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1-3,20 </a></sup></u> With these definitions, the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in our trial was no higher than that reported in previous randomized trials or in SITS–MOST, despite the extended time window in our study. 删除3:<u><sup><a>12</a></sup></u>\n\n【60】Although in our trial the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher in the alteplase group than in the placebo group, we did not observe a difference in mortality between the two groups. The overall mortality rate (approximately 8%) was lower than that in previous trials, probably also owing to the inclusion of patients with less severe strokes.\n\n【61】Early treatment remains essential. The effect size of thrombolysis is time-dependent. In the pooled analysis, treatment with alteplase is nearly twice as efficacious when administered within the first 1.5 hours after the onset of a stroke as it is when administered within 1.5 to 3 hours afterward (odds ratio for the global outcome, 2.81 for an interval of 0 to 90 minutes, 1.55 for 91 to 180 minutes, and 1.40 for 181 to 270 minutes). 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> In comparison, in ECASS III, the odds ratio was 1.34 for an interval of 181 to 270 minutes. For 1 patient to have a favorable outcome (a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin scale), the number needed to treat is 14 with the extended time window. This effect size is clinically meaningful and thus extends the treatment window for patients who do not arrive at the hospital early. It does not mean, however, that patients who can be treated within 3 hours should have their treatment delayed. The “door-to-needle” time remains paramount and must be kept as short as possible to increase the chance of a positive outcome.\n\n【62】In this study, intravenous alteplase given 3 to 4.5 hours (median, 3 hours 59 minutes) after the onset of stroke symptoms was associated with a modest but significant improvement in the clinical outcome, without a higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage than that reported previously among patients treated within 3 hours. Although our findings suggest that treatment with alteplase may be effective in patients who present 3 to 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, patients should be treated with alteplase as early as possible to maximize the benefit. Having more time does not mean we should be allowed to take more time.\n\n【63】参考删除-1:<u>Funding and Disclosures\n-----------------------</u>\n\n【64】参考删除-1:<u>Supported by Boehringer Ingelheim.</u>\n\n【65】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Hacke reports receiving consulting, advisory board, and lecture fees from Paion, Forest Laboratories, Lundbeck, and Boehringer Ingelheim and grant support from Lundbeck; Dr. Brozman, receiving consulting and lecture fees from Sanofi-Aventis and consulting fees and grant support from Boehringer Ingelheim; Dr. Davalos, receiving consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, the Ferrer Group, Paion, and Lundbeck and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, Ferrer Group, Paion, and Bristol-Myers Squibb; Dr. Kaste, receiving consulting and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim; Dr. Larrue, receiving consulting fees from Pierre Fabre; Dr. Lees, receiving consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Paion, Forest, and Lundbeck, lecture fees from the Ferrer Group, and grant support from Boehringer Ingelheim; Dr. Schneider, receiving consulting fees from the Ferrer Group, D-Pharm, BrainsGate, and Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Round Table (STAIR) and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and Trommsdorff Arzneimittel; Dr. von Kummer, receiving consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and Paion and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and Bayer Schering Pharma; Dr. Wahlgren, receiving consulting fees from ThromboGenics, lecture fees from Ferrer and Boehringer Ingelheim, and grant support from Boehringer Ingelheim; Dr. Toni, receiving consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim and lecture fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi-Aventis, and Novo Nordisk; and Drs.

The child had been fed with Sanlu brand milk powder since he was 1 week of age. Initial laboratory data revealed markedly abnormal results that included a potassium level of 8.12 mmol per liter, a total carbon dioxide level of 9.0 mmol per liter, a blood urea nitrogen level of 137 mg per deciliter (49 mmol per liter of urea), and a creatinine level of 10.3 mg per deciliter (908 μmol per liter). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral urinary calculi causing acute obstructive renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis was performed, and urine output resumed 42 hours later. The renal-function tests on the third hospital day showed normal results: a potassium level of 4.03 mmol per liter, a blood urea nitrogen level of 16 mg per deciliter (6 mmol per liter of urea), and a creatinine level of 0.8 mg per deciliter (73 μmol per liter). Ultrasonography performed on the 10th hospital day revealed complete obstruction of the right ureter because of a calculus.\n\n【3】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Micrographs from the Patient's Renal-Biopsy Specimens before and after Treatment.\n\n【4】Panels A through D show specimens before treatment; Panels E and F show specimens after treatment. Panel A shows both normal glomeruli and sclerosed glomeruli (arrow). Panel B shows swelling of the renal tubular cells with necrotic nuclei and degeneration (in a view four times the magnification in Panel A). There is evidence of tubular dilatation and presumed crystals (arrow), which are characterized in the image by blue staining on the perimeter. Panel C shows lymphocytic infiltration in the renal interstitium (arrow). Panel D is a transmission electron micrograph showing swollen and dilated intracellular organelles of tubular epithelial cells (in a view 12 times the magnification in Panel A). The cytoplasmic structures are markedly abnormal, and the nucleus is pyknotic (arrow). Panel E shows the results of light microscopy, performed after treatment, of a repeat biopsy specimen (in a view about half the magnification in Panel A). There are normal glomeruli and tubules and neither interstitial inflammatory-cell infiltrates nor crystals in the tubular lumen. Panel F is a transmission electron micrograph, obtained after treatment, showing normal organelles of the tubular cell (in a view 15 times the magnification in Panel A). Panels A, B, C, and E show staining with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\n【5】The parents of the infant requested a percutaneous biopsy of the right kidney, which was performed after they provided written informed consent. The sections showed generalized lymphocytic infiltration in the glomeruli; 2 of 26 glomeruli were sclerotic, with proliferation of fibrous tissue in the glomeruli and Bowman's capsule 删除2:<u>( Figure 1A )</u>. The tubular cells were swollen, and crystals were seen within the lumen 删除2:<u>( Figure 1B )</u>. There was lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis within the renal interstitium 删除2:<u>( Figure 1C )</u>. Transmission electron microscopy showed swollen tubular capillary endothelial cells, marked dilatation and abnormal structure of organelles within some renal tubular epithelial cells, and pyknotic nuclei 删除2:<u>( Figure 1D )</u>. Quantitative analysis with the use of high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the content of the calculi: a combination of melamine (29.2%) and uric acid (52.2%), with the remaining material (18.6%) unidentifiable. No cyanuric acid was present, though it has been reported in animals with melamine toxicity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1,2</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】At a follow-up visit 13 months after discharge, laboratory studies were performed. The blood urea nitrogen level was 10 mg per deciliter (4 mmol per liter of urea), the creatinine level was 0.5 mg per deciliter (44 μmol per liter), the urinary microalbumin level was 1 mg per liter, and a test for urinary protein was negative. Both kidneys appeared to be normal, without evidence of urinary calculi or precipitates on ultrasonography. A repeat percutaneous biopsy of the right kidney revealed no glomerular sclerosis and no glomerular or tubular-cell degeneration or intraluminal crystals 删除2:<u>( Figure 1E )</u>. Transmission electron microscopy revealed no glomerular-cell or basement-membrane abnormalities; the organelles also had a normal appearance 删除2:<u>( Figure 1F )</u>.\n\n【7】The renal damage caused by melamine is generally considered to be caused primarily by obstructive uropathy. In this infant, the tubular damage was prominent at presentation but resolved. We believe that timely treatment of acute melamine toxicity is effective, even in cases of marked obstruction. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3 </a></sup></u> Melamine, which has been detected in various food products, warrants continued global concern. 删除3:<u><sup><a>4</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】参考删除-2:<u>Ning Sun, M.D.  \nYing Shen, M.D.  \nLe-jian He, Ph.D.  \nBeijing Children's Hospital of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China  \nying\\_116sh@sohu.  com</u>\n\n【9】参考删除-2:<u>Financial and other disclosures provided by the authors are available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.</u>\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>4 References</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>1.  1\\.

Such workers were seen as deserving priority because of the risks they incur, the important role they play in caring for people infected with Covid-19, and their risk of transmitting the virus. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【3】Early on, many health care organizations discovered they had more vaccine than they had high-risk employees willing to be vaccinated. Some responded by vaccinating low-risk employees, such as part-time outpatient clinicians, noninterventional radiologists, and even nonclinician researchers working in non-Covid labs. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】I believe that in vaccinating low-risk employees, the leaders of these organizations violated their duty to promote public health. Furthermore, they contributed to an unfortunate narrative: that powerful people in health care are willing to serve their own interests ahead of society’s.\n\n【5】From the outset, U.S. vaccine distribution was dysfunctional. States were given vaccines with little federal guidance on how to allocate them and few resources for distributing them efficiently. States, in turn, allocated doses to large health care organizations, typically with guidelines about whom to vaccinate. In North Carolina, for example, organizations were told that Phase 1a of vaccination was reserved for “healthcare workers caring for and working directly with patients with Covid-19.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>3</a></sup></u>\n\n【6】This allocation criterion left organizations with the challenge of defining high-risk employees. There is no simple way to delineate the border between high-risk and lower-risk employees. Because it is hard to know what level of exposure qualifies as high risk, any cutoff will create resistance among powerful people who wonder why they are not being given priority. If it makes sense to vaccinate interventional radiologists, for example, then it becomes difficult to exclude noninterventional radiologists, if for no other reason than fear of dissension among the ranks.\n\n【7】The border between black and white is often gray, but that doesn’t justify ignoring the border altogether. Yet some health care organizations acted as if the difficulty of drawing a sharp line between high- and low-risk workers justified treating all employees as high-risk. These actions delayed the provision of vaccine to actual high-risk populations. In North Carolina, Phase 1b of the state’s vaccination efforts was delayed when large health care organizations began vaccinating low-risk employees, thereby forcing essential workers and people 75 or older to wait longer to be vaccinated. The organizations behaved as if vaccines were theirs to distribute, rather than recognizing them as scarce public goods.\n\n【8】Some ethicists argue that not only was it proper to vaccinate low-risk employees, but it was also morally laudable for those employees to receive the vaccine. These commentators contend that if a low-risk employee refused a vaccine, it would simply “move horizontally to another similarly low priority employee.” 删除3:<u><sup><a>4 </a></sup></u> This view misunderstands the specifics of vaccine allocation. First, it wrongly considers only the next person who would receive a vaccine, should a low-risk employee decline a vaccination, when clearly shortening the waiting line also helps the high-risk people who are further down the list.\n\n【9】Second, this view mistakenly supposes that the organizations in question had no choice but to vaccinate all their employees because not doing so would risk wasting vaccines. That presupposition ignores the ease with which these organizations could have shifted from vaccinating their low-risk employees to vaccinating high-risk patients who are in their care. In fact, it is hard to imagine any organizations better positioned to improve vaccine allocation than America’s leading health care providers. Health care organizations were entrusted with scarce vaccines; health care leaders were expected to behave nobly.\n\n【10】Trust in the medical profession is already declining, in part owing to concerns about the commodification of medical practice, with many people working in health care enriching themselves even as a growing number of Americans struggle to pay their medical bills. 删除3:<u><sup><a>5 </a></sup></u> Now, in the face of the worst pandemic in a century, some leading American medical centers vaccinated their own low-risk employees even as millions of vulnerable, high-risk Americans remained in harm’s way, waiting patiently in line.\n\n【11】The country deserved better.\n\n【12】Peter A.

Unfortunately, the global supply is meager. Prioritization – deciding who is “at the front of the line” - is of utmost importance. Ubel succinctly summarized: “vaccinating low-risk employees, the leaders of healthcare-organizations violated their duty to promote public health.” I would also like to point out a similar scenario with the recent CDC’s interim COVID guidelines which advice vaccinations even for those who recovered from COVID while we have a strong evidence of seropositivity and likely protection due to natural infection. It is interesting that the rationale for immunization of people who have recovered from COVID is reports of rare reinfections. More so, the data in the vaccine trials do not suggest efficacy among participants with evidence of previous infection. In my opinion, the wisest application of current knowledge and reason would be to not overlook the commonsense approach when there are global vaccine shortages. Swift and appropriate deployment of this valuable resource- the vaccine- can make a real difference to fight against this pandemic.</u>\n\n【35】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Prem raj Pushpakaran  \nMar 15, 2021</u>\n\n【36】参考删除-1:<u>Dr. Prem raj Pushpakaran  \nOther  \nDisclosure: None  \n_India_</u>\n\n【37】参考删除-1:<u>Prioritize healthcare personnel for COVID vaccination</u>\n\n【38】参考删除-1:<u>The vaccine rollout in US is disorganized and ripe for exploitation, yet it's important that healthcare staff get vaccinated for their critical role of keeping the nation’s hospitals and clinics functioning.</u>\n\n【39】参考删除-1:<u>TAKUMA HAYASHI  \nMar 10, 2021</u>\n\n【40】参考删除-1:<u>TAKUMA HAYASHI  \nPhysician, Genetics  \nDisclosure: None  \n_Japan_</u>\n\n【41】参考删除-1:<u>Problems with anaphylactic shock after COVID-19 vaccination in Japan</u>\n\n【42】参考删除-1:<u>In Japan, from February 17, 2021, the clinical studies have been initiated on the health care workers with the COVID-19 vaccination (BNT162 mRNA).

Furthermore, all Japanese who have been found to develop anaphylactic shock are women. Currently, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is also carefully observing the health status of many Japanese with COVID-19 vaccination.

This led to a lot of low risk employees eg. 35 y/o healthy IT personnel who are never in patient care areas receiving the vaccine while a 65 y/o primary care physician seeing 30 patients a day but not affiliated with our system was deemed \"ineligible\". As the weeks progressed, the process did get better. That being said, it is still not where it should be. There are still a lot of inequities.</u>\n\n【51】参考删除-1:<u>*   Next\n*   Prev</u>\n\n【52】参考删除-1:<u>*   1</u>\n\n【53】参考删除-1:<u>Page 1</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "nejm", "batch_name": "20230925", "version": "version0"}

Ephedra can have a substantial effect on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems through direct adrenergic receptor agonism as well as indirect endogenous catecholamine release.\n\n【3】In the 1990s and early 2000s, ephedra was marketed as a weight-loss and energy-enhancement agent in the United States. Classified as herbal supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, ephedra-containing products were largely unregulated with no standardization in strength or purity. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1 </a></sup></u> There is no evidence that ephedra provided any appreciable health benefits except for modest, short-term weight loss. 删除3:<u><sup><a>2 </a></sup></u> Studies have shown an association between ephedra use and hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, seizure, stroke, and sudden death. 删除3:<u><sup><a>3-5</a></sup></u>\n\n【4】The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of ephedra-containing products in April 2004 in response to mounting scientific evidence and the receipt of more than 18,000 adverse-event reports. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ban in 2006, and ephedra sales remain illegal today. 删除3:<u><sup><a>1</a></sup></u>\n\n【5】We analyzed the effect of the FDA ban on ephedra-related adverse events that were reported to regional poison centers in the United States from 2001 to 2013. Ephedra was first listed in the National Poison Data System (NPDS) in 2001. We examined the NPDS to determine the number of annual exposures to ephedra (both as a single ingredient and a component of multibotanical products) that resulted in reports of major effects or deaths. Major effects were defined as life-threatening signs or symptoms or those that resulted in substantial disability or disfigurement.\n\n【6】Figure 1.  Figure 1. Annual Poisonings, Major Effects, and Deaths Associated with Ephedra (2001–2013).\n\n【7】Data from the National Poison Data System show the reductions in cases of ephedra poisoning (Panel A) and exposures resulting in major effects (Panel B) or deaths (Panel C) since the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of ephedra-containing products in 2004.\n\n【8】The number of calls to poison centers related to ephedra poisonings peaked at 10,326 in 2002 and steadily declined to 180 by the end of 2013 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Exposures resulting in major effects also peaked in 2002, numbering 108. Beginning in 2008, there have been 3 or fewer reports of exposures with major effects per year. The number of deaths peaked at 7 in 2004, and there have been no reported ephedra-related deaths since 2008.\n\n【9】There is a direct relation between the FDA's ban on ephedra sales and a sharp reduction in ephedra-related adverse events reported to U.S. poison centers. The number of poisonings resulting in major effects or deaths has decreased by more than 98% since 2002. The 2004 FDA ban has proved to be a very effective means of limiting the availability of ephedra and therefore its potential toxicity in the United States.\n\n【10】参考删除-2:<u>Michele Zell-Kanter, Pharm.D.  \nCook County Hospital (Stroger), Chicago, IL  \nmkanter@cookcountyhhs.  org</u>\n\n【11】参考删除-2:<u>Meghan A.
