Patients who had positive screening results on an immunoglobulin E (IgE) test were recruited from the outpatient clinics of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were divided into the following three groups: asthma (n = 332), combined asthma and allergic rhinitis (n = 165), and allergic rhinitis (n = 18). Serum samples were analyzed for IgE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Significantly elevated titer of dust mite-specific IgE were found in all three groups, with markedly higher levels in the combined asthma and allergic rhinitis group (p < 0.05). Allergen scores were significantly related to the demographic variables of older age (> or = 65 years), female gender, and spring season, with significantly lower scores (p < 0.05). No significant difference in allergen scores was found among cigarette smoking subjects and subjects from residential areas. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant allergic contributors to be, in order of importance, age, gender, and atopic disease category. We conclude that mite allergen exposure is the most significant factor associated with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis in Taiwan. Younger subjects and males had a higher rate of asthma and/or allergic rhinitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Some species of these blood parasites cause severe disease in birds, and heavy infections are often lethal in biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) and other blood-sucking insects. However, information about the vectors of haemoproteids is scarce. This presents an obstacle for better understanding the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions and the epidemiology of haemoproteosis. Here we investigated the sporogonic development of Haemoproteus tartakovskyi, a widespread bird parasite, in experimentally infected biting midges, Culicoides nubeculosus. These biting midges are widespread in the Europe. The insects were cultivated under laboratory conditions. Unfed females were allowed to take blood meals on wild caught siskins Carduelis spinus naturally infected with H. tartakovskyi (lineage hSISKIN1). Engorged females were maintained at 22-23 °C, dissected at intervals, and examined for sporogonic stages. Mature ookinetes of H. tartakovskyi were seen in the midgut content between 6 and 48 h post infection, oocysts were observed in the midgut wall 3-4 days post infection (dpi). Sporozoites were first reported in the salivary gland preparations 7 dpi. In accordance with microscopy data, polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing confirmed presence of the corresponding parasite lineage in experimentally infected biting midges. This study indicates that C. nubeculosus willingly takes blood meals on birds and is a vector of H. tartakovskyi. These biting midges are readily amenable to cultivation under laboratory conditions. Culicoides nubeculosus transmits Haemoproteus parasites infecting parrots, owls and siskins, birds belonging to different families and orders.

{"seq_id": "7e889ffd-8a33-44dc-8fe4-40d1498c88ca", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction \n============\n\n【1】Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most common conditions requiring treatment by ophthalmologists, optometrists, and allergists . While prevalence studies of conjunctivitis alone are limited, epidemiologic data have been derived from studies of the commonly coexisting nasal symptoms or rhinoconjunctivitis and are wide ranging with large global variations . In the United States, the Allergies in America survey conducted in 2006 estimated that 14.2% of the adult population had been affected by allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, while a more recent analysis based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data in a sample size of 20,010 adults found that 40% of participants were affected by allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in a 12-month period . The International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood spanning 52 countries reported that allergic conjunctivitis affects 1.4--39.7% of children and adolescents .\n\n【2】Ocular itching, the hallmark symptom of allergic conjunctivitis, is often accompanied by tearing, conjunctival redness, eyelid swelling, and chemosis . Allergic conjunctivitis is mediated by immunoglobulin E-activated degranulation of mast cells and the release of a cascade of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, in response to allergens . Histamine release and activation of histamine H~1~ receptors in the conjunctiva leads to ocular itching, while stimulation of H~2~ receptors on the ocular surface results in vasodilation and is associated with ocular redness, eyelid swelling, and chemosis . Recent evidence suggests that histamine binding to and activation of H~4~ receptors also play a role in allergic conjunctivitis . Topical ophthalmic antihistamines are the primary treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis. Currently, alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% are the only approved once-daily ophthalmic solutions for allergic conjunctivitis in the United States \\[--\\]. Both olopatadine and alcaftadine are classified as dual-action antiallergic agents, directly inhibiting histamine receptor activation and indirectly reducing allergic responses by stabilizing mast cells .\n\n【3】Clinical studies evaluating alcaftadine and olopatadine as treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis have used the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model to assess clinical efficacy . The CAC model was designed to mimic the signs and symptoms of an ocular allergic response in a controlled setting, providing an alternative to environmental allergy trials that are subject to variable allergen exposures. The model has been established as the standard for demonstrating efficacy and safety of topical ophthalmic antiallergic solutions seeking approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration . CAC testing consists of instillation of the study drug or comparator(s) into the eye followed by an allergen challenge at a predetermined time post-instillation. The effect is then graded using a standardized severity scale, allowing assessment of both the onset of action and duration of effect \\[, --\\].\n\n【4】Two recently completed similarly designed studies are the first to have compared the efficacy and duration of action of once-daily alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% and placebo using the CAC model. The first study demonstrated that alcaftadine 0.25% was safe and effective in preventing signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis at both 16 and 24 h after treatment instillation . Differences in treatment effect between alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% were most pronounced at the earliest time point post-CAC, when alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution was statistically superior to olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution. The second study further assessed treatment outcome and confirmed statistical superiority of treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% relative to olopatadine 0.2% in mean itch reduction at the same time point post-CAC, at 16 h after treatment instillation . A pooled analysis of the data collected from the two studies was completed to further characterize treatment differences between alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solutions.\n\n【5】Methods \n=======\n\n【6】Study Design \n------------\n\n【7】Two multicenter, double-masked, randomized active- and placebo-controlled trials  were conducted between October 2011 and December 2012. Protocols and informed consent forms were approved by an independent review board (Alpha IRB, San Clemente, CA, USA). Studies were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008, and International Conference of Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Subjects provided written informed consent (or assent with a consent form signed by the subject's legally authorized representative) and signed authorization for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act before any study-related procedures or changes in treatment.\n\n【8】Study Eligibility Criteria \n--------------------------\n\n【9】Subject eligibility was identical for both studies. Key inclusion criteria included subjects with a history of ocular allergies and at least one positive skin test within 24 months of the trial start date to one of the following: cat dander, grasses, ragweed, dog dander, cockroach, dust mites, and trees; a best-corrected visual acuity ≥0.6 on the logMAR scale (using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart). Subjects must have had a positive bilateral CAC reaction (defined as ≥2 itching and ≥2 redness in the conjunctival vessel bed) within 10 min of instillation of the last titration of allergen at visit 1 and in at least two of three time points at visit 2. All subjects agreed to avoid disallowed medications and to discontinue contact lens wear for the designated period.\n\n【10】Key exclusion criteria included subjects with any baseline itching or a redness score \\>1 in any vessel bed at each visit; any known allergy, contraindications, or sensitivity to the study medications; systemic or ocular condition in the opinion of the investigator that could affect safety or trial parameters; ocular surgery within 3 months or refractive surgery within 6 months; signs of active allergic conjunctivitis at the start of any visit; presence of an active ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal); or history of herpetic ocular disease. Owing to the potential for randomization into a treatment arm with a pregnancy category C therapeutic , women who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy, lactating, or of child-bearing age and not using a medically acceptable form of birth control for the entire period of the trials were excluded. Subjects planning surgical procedures during the trial period or those with a history of retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, or progressive retinal disease also were ineligible.\n\n【11】Treatment and Assessments \n-------------------------\n\n【12】Assessments from the three identical subject visits of both studies were included in the pooled analysis. At the first study visit (day −21 ± 3) or titration visit, allergens were instilled in each eye followed by the subject rating ocular itching severity at 10 min. Allergen concentrations were increased serially until the scores for both itching and conjunctival redness reached ≥2.0. The maximal allergen concentration used during this titration visit was utilized for all subsequent visits. Itching severity was graded using a five-point scale通用删除7(英):<u> (0--4)</u>, which allowed for half measures \\[, --\\]. Conjunctival redness was scored by the investigator using a five-point ocular redness scale通用删除7(英):<u> (0--4)</u> \\[, --\\].\n\n【13】At the second study visit (day −14 ± 3) or confirmation visit, allergen challenge using the final concentration from the first visit was performed to provide baseline data for those subjects who continued to satisfy eligibility criteria. Subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 min after allergen instillation. Subjects who met the qualifying criteria of post-challenge bilateral itching ≥2 and who also had bilateral conjunctival redness ≥2 at two of the three time points (7, 15, and 20 min) continued to visit 3A approximately 2 weeks after visit 2.\n\n【14】At visit 3A (day 0), subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one drop of masked ophthalmic solution in both eyes: alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution (Lastacaft^®^, Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA), olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution (Pataday^®^, Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA), and placebo: 0.3% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Tears Naturale^®^ II, Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA). Subjects returned approximately 15.5 h after treatment instillation (visit 3B) and were challenged 16 + 1 h after study drug instillation in both eyes using the same allergen and dose that had elicited a positive reaction at visits 1 and 2. The first study also had a fourth visit that was used to assess duration of action at 24 h post-treatment instillation.\n\n【15】Efficacy and Safety Parameters \n------------------------------\n\n【16】The primary efficacy endpoint was ocular itching quantified by the subject at 3 min post-CAC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ocular itching evaluated by the subject at 5 and 7 min post-CAC. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events (elicited and observed) throughout the studies, which were then coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 13.1 .\n\n【17】Data Analysis and Statistical Methods \n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】Both eyes of each subject were used for statistical summaries and analyses. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, was performed at the 5% significance level of type I error for two-sided tests. The last observation carried forward method was used to handle missing and incomplete efficacy data for the primary measure. All secondary efficacy measures were analyzed using observed data only.\n\n【19】The intent-to-treat population, comprised of all subjects who were randomized, was used for the efficacy analyses. A subset of the intent-to-treat population, consisting of subjects who completed the study with no protocol violations, formed the per-protocol population. This population was analyzed as treated using observed data only and was used for confirmatory analyses. The safety population included all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the study treatment.\n\n【20】The primary efficacy measure was summarized by visit, time point, and treatment group using descriptive statistics. The differences in the means between treatment groups were calculated, and mean ocular itching scores for each of the treatments were compared using two-sample t tests. In addition, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test at each time point and repeated measures analysis of covariance model accounting for treatment and repeated time measurements within each visit were performed. Predefined analyses on the primary efficacy data, ocular itch, both at each time point and over all time points, included comparisons of the number of subjects in each group with minimal itch (defined as itch score \\<1), and the number of subjects with zero itch (defined as itch score = 0). Fisher's exact test was conducted for comparisons at each time point and over all time points for each pair of treatments (alcaftadine versus placebo, olopatadine versus placebo, and alcaftadine versus olopatadine). Secondary ocular itch efficacy measures were summarized using descriptive statistics by visit, time point, and treatment group, and statistically analyzed in the same way as the primary measure. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS^®^ software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).\n\n【21】Results \n=======\n\n【22】Subject Demographics and Characteristics \n----------------------------------------\n\n【23】A total of 284 subjects were enrolled in the two clinical studies following screening visits 1 and 2; 96 subjects were randomized to receive alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution, 95 received olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution, and 93 received placebo. Thirteen of the 284 randomized subjects (alcaftadine 0.25%, n = 6; olopatadine 0.2%, n = 5; placebo, n = 2) did not complete the studies. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation across treatment arms were loss to follow-up and adverse events 删除21:<u></u>.

Analysis over all the time points measured (3, 5, and 7 min) also demonstrated a statistically lower overall mean itch score with alcaftadine 0.25% compared with olopatadine 0.2% . Both alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% were superior to placebo for achieving greater reductions in mean itch scores at 3, 5, and 7 min post-CAC and over all time points . Alcaftadine 0.25%-treated subjects consistently demonstrated greater percentage reduction in itching from baseline at 3, 5, and 7 min post-CAC (−81.0%, −74.1%, and −70.6%, respectively) compared with olopatadine 0.2%-treated subjects (−63.2%, −65.7%, and −65.2%, respectively). For both actives, the percentage reduction in itching from baseline was superior over placebo at 3, 5, and 7 min (−23.7%, −24.1%, and −30.2%, respectively).Fig. 2Comparison of mean itch scores at baseline and 16 h after treatment instillation at 3 min post-conjunctival allergen challenge (primary endpoint).

For subjects who met the criteria for minimal itch or zero itch at all three time points (3, 5, and 7 min), significantly higher proportions of subjects achieved overall minimal itch and zero itch in the alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% groups compared with the placebo group . A significantly greater proportion of alcaftadine 0.25%-treated subjects achieved an itch score \\<1 compared with olopatadine 0.2%-treated subjects over all time points (76.1% vs. 58.1%; P = 0.0121); no significant differences were observed in the proportion of subjects achieving zero itch between the two actives .Fig. 4Comparison of overall percentage of subjects with minimal itch and zero itch scores at 16 h after treatment instillation.

A shift to the left in the frequencies of scores indicated improvement in both the magnitude of relief and proportion of subjects whose symptoms were alleviated. Subjects in all three treatment groups (alcaftadine 0.25%, olopatadine 0.2%, and placebo) showed a similar distribution of itch scores at baseline, with the majority of subjects reporting scores between 2.0 and 3.5 over all time points post-CAC 删除21:<u></u>. A significantly larger proportion of subjects who received treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% reported lower itch scores between 0 and 1.0 post-CAC compared with placebo-treated subjects 16 h post-treatment instillation. A greater leftward shift was observed in the alcaftadine group than in the olopatadine group; more subjects receiving alcaftadine 0.25% reported itch scores of 0 and 0.5 删除21:<u></u>.Fig. 5Distribution of itch scores at baseline (a) and 16 h after treatment instillation (b).

A total of 11 (3.9%) subjects, four treated with alcaftadine 0.25%, five treated with olopatadine 0.2%, and two receiving placebo experienced at least one adverse event. No adverse events were considered to be related to study treatment, and no serious adverse events were reported during the course of the studies.\n\n【30】Discussion \n==========\n\n【31】Two similarly designed multicenter studies were conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of alcaftadine 0.25%, olopatadine 0.2%, and placebo in relieving ocular itch and symptoms related to allergic conjunctivitis. These are the first studies to compare the two agents approved for once-daily use for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The first study by Ackerman et al.  showed differences in relief of itch between alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% at the earliest time point measured post-CAC (3 min) . The second study confirmed the treatment outcome differences between alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% in preventing signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis at 16 h post-treatment instillation . The present analysis pools these findings in a large data set and identified additional differentiation over the 3, 5, and 7 min time points.\n\n【32】In the pooled analysis, alcaftadine 0.25%-treated subjects experienced significantly lower mean ocular itch scores than olopatadine 0.2%-treated subjects at 3 min post-CAC (P = 0.0006). In addition, alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution also was superior to olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution in reducing mean itch scores over all time points measured (3, 5, and 7 min; P = 0.0390). A significantly greater proportion of alcaftadine 0.25%-treated subjects achieved minimal itch (itch score \\<1) compared with olopatadine 0.2%-treated subjects over all time points (P = 0.0121). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of subjects with zero itch (itch score = 0). Both alcaftadine and olopatadine were superior to placebo at relieving ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the pooled analysis.\n\n【33】Alcaftadine is unique among ocular antihistamines in that it exhibits antagonistic activity against H~1~, H~2~, and H~4~ receptors (although with lower affinity than H~1~ and H~2~) . The role of H~4~ receptors in allergic conjunctivitis has not been fully elucidated; in vitro studies suggest that histamine binding to H~4~ receptors mediates eosinophil chemotaxis . In this pooled analysis, the distribution of subject-reported itch scores at 16 h post-treatment instillation over all time points showed an improvement with alcaftadine 0.25% relative to olopatadine in the degree of relief and the proportion of subjects whose symptoms are alleviated following allergen challenge, achieving a statistically significant greater percentage of subjects with scores of 0 or 0.5 relative to olopatadine 0.2% on a five-point scale. In addition to this greater magnitude of effect, in a previous study, alcaftadine 0.25% had a rapid onset of action as measured at 15 min post-treatment instillation, which was superior to that of olopatadine 0.1%, and sustained duration of action up to 16 h post-treatment instillation . In a murine model of allergic conjunctivitis, alcaftadine demonstrated a greater effect than olopatadine on eosinophil recruitment and stability of the epithelial junctional protein, zonula occludens-1 . Overall, these in vivo results suggest that differences observed clinically between alcaftadine and olopatadine may reflect a greater ability of alcaftadine to prevent allergen-activated disruption of the epithelial barriers .\n\n【34】Similar to other reports of alcaftadine and olopatadine \\[, \\], treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% was found to be generally well tolerated. While eleven (3.9%) subjects experienced at least one adverse event, none of the adverse events were related to study treatment. In addition, there were no serious adverse events reported at any time during either study.\n\n【35】Limitations are inherent in any pooled analysis, though the two studies pooled in the present analysis demonstrated consistent findings across measures evaluating relief of ocular itching. In addition, both studies were conducted employing the CAC model. Additional long-term studies comparing alcaftadine and olopatadine may further elucidate differences identified in these two studies in the CAC model for allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n【36】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【37】Evidence supports the use of alcaftadine 0.25% for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, a condition affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. Compared with olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution, treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution provided greater relief of ocular itching at 16 h post-administration with a similar safety profile. Additional studies are warranted to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed differences in treatment outcomes between the alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% once-daily ophthalmic solutions.\n\n【38】This research was supported by Allergan, Inc.

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】With the aging of the population, the demand for prosthetic treatment in the stomatognathic system is growing . In toothlessness or multiple teeth deficiencies, removable appliances with an extensive base are still the most common prosthetic solution. The force released in the act of chewing is completely passed by the prosthesis base onto the mucous membrane, the periosteum and bone. This creates the need for taking over by mucosa non-physiological functions, which results in its impaired physiology and increased susceptibility to infection. From the clinical point of view, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) has acceptable mechanical properties, nevertheless attempts have still been made to modify the material so that it would become resistant to microbial adhesion.\n\n【2】Some very promising nanoparticles (NPs) that can be used to modify the biomaterial for denture bases are zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs. Zinc oxide is a multi-functional material being a II-VI semiconductor . Properties such as wide band gap (\\~3.37 eV) or high exciton binding energy (\\~60 meV) make it an attractive material for electronics and optoelectronics . Selective doping of ZnO (NPs, alloys) with ions, for example, Cd^2+^, Co^2+^, Mn^2+^ permits changing its optical, magnetic and antibacterial properties, conductivity and photoluminescence . The development of methods for obtaining nano-ZnO with a controlled shape and size enabled the commencement of research on the use of ZnO nanomaterials for the production of solar cells, gas sensors, switching memory devices and for water filtration . In industry, ZnO is widely used as an ingredient of rubber, pigments, cements, plastics, sealants and paints. It is a component of pharmaceutical formulations and cosmetics, for example, baby powders, toothpastes and tooth dressings, sunscreens and skin protection balms. The advantages of ZnO-NPs application as a ultraviolet (UV) absorber in the field of personal hygiene and sun protection include long-term protection, broadband protection (UVA and UVB) and non-whitening effect on the skin . It is also used in deodorants, medical and sanitary materials, glass, ceramic and self-cleaning materials . The antibacterial and antifungal activity of ZnO-NPs was the major rationale for commencing in 2014 the research on dentures modified by ZnO-NPs, which are supposed to ultimately be characterized by antifungal properties . At present, this issue has gained a growing interest among the scientist around the world and has already been investigated by several research groups \\[,\\].\n\n【3】The intention of our research group was to create new biomaterial for denture bases that could impede the adhesion of microorganisms to their surface, thereby decreasing development of denture stomatitis. It is of great importance for patients with immune system deficiencies (e.g. immunotherapy, AIDS, old age) where local fungal inflammation can lead to pneumonia or systemic fungemia endangering the patient's life . To achieve this goal, the modification of polymethyl methacrylate with zinc oxide nanoparticles was performed. The first article in a series  about new ZnO-PMMA nanocomposites presented the characteristics of ZnO-NPs (mean particle size, density, specific surface area). The minimal inhibitory concentration for standard strain of Candida albicans was determined at the level of 0.75 mg/mL. There, the process of performing nanocomposite was also described and the encountered difficulties presented in uniform distribution of ZnO-NPs in polymer matrix. Nevertheless, the sonication process decreased ZnO-NPs conglomerates, providing more favourable conditions for more homogenic material. Moreover, the SEM taken scans at a magnification of 50 k × confirmed that the material also contained particles smaller than 100 nm meeting the conditions required for nanomaterials. To our best knowledge this was the first successful attempt to produce PMMA resin for bases of dentures modified with nanoparticles of zinc oxide. The second publication  discussed the anti-fungal properties of newly formed biomaterial. These studies evidenced the antifungal activity of PMMA-ZnO nanocomposites. The study of the biofilm deposition on the surface showed that antifungal properties increase with increasing concentration of ZnO-NPs. A 7.5% nanocomposite revealed the lowest total amount of Candida, a 4.6-fold lower than in PMMA without modification. The (2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5-Carboxanilide)(XTT) assay, in conjunction with testing the turbidity of solutions, may indicate the mechanism by which ZnO-NPs exert their effect on the increased induction of antioxidative stress in microorganism cells. The increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause fungicidal action. The aim of this study was to investigate selected properties of nanocomposites, which can influence the microorganism deposition on their surface and better explain the results of the previous publication .\n\n【4】The basic property decreasing the deposition of food debris is the smoothness of the surface expressed by its roughness. A smaller expansion of the surface results in a reduced number of natural niches for C. albicans, which considerably hampers the formation of the fungal biofilm structure . The hardness of the material does not directly affect the deposition of pathogens but becomes an exponent of the resistance supplement to mechanical damage . It occurs during the act of chewing but also during the performance of denture hygiene especially when the patient, against medical advice, uses a substance with a high abrasion index. This can lead to the microdamage of prostheses and thereby increases the roughness parameter.\n\n【5】Another property that affects the deposition of microorganisms is hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the surface. With the increase in hydrophilic property the biofilm formation is reduced . It is believed that the hydrophilic material interferes with the initial phase of microbial adhesion based on electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals forces and hydrogen interactions. Candida species have a very strong affinity to the surface of the acrylic base due to its specific nature but also because of its hydrophobic properties. In the cell wall of Candida there are adhesins, mainly mannoproteins, responsible for adhesion to host cells. Formosa et al.  have shown that depending on the conditions fungal cells can produce adhesins on their surface. Then they change the conformation of structures known as nanodomains, exhibiting hydrophobic properties and giving fungi affinity to all hydrophobic, abiotic surfaces, including acrylic resin material.\n\n【6】Absorbability of the material is also its negative feature. In the first stage of denture use the material absorbs fluids from the oral cavity to its interior. This results in an increase in weight of the material, which does not significantly affect the retention and function of the prosthesis but the liquid absorbed into the interior comprises microorganisms present in the saliva making formation of the fungal biofilm possible . However, some authors  do not notice the correlation between the sorption of water and ease of accumulation of microorganisms. The PMMA porosity, regarded as one of the major causes of the biofilm formation, seems to be of minor importance. Studies conducted by Osica et al.  on the basis of computed tomography revealed an average porosity of PMMA at 0.01%. However, it should be remembered that this parameter varies over time, depending on the length of the prosthesis use and at a later stage it can play a role in the deposition of microorganisms. The process of biofilm formation and the mechanisms responsible for this process are multi-faceted and are the subject of interest to scientists all around the world. In previous articles, we characterized new material  and described antifungal properties of ZnO-PMMA nanocomposite . The aim of this study was to investigate selected properties of ZnO-PMMA nanocomposites which can influence the microorganism deposition on their surface.\n\n【7】2. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【8】2.1. Synthesis and Characteristics of ZnO-NPs \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】ZnO-NPs were obtained using our microwave solvothermal synthesis method that permits a precise size control of the formed ZnO-NPs . This method is characterized by the repeatability and reproducibility of properties of the synthesised ZnO-NPs. The following characteristics were defined for the obtained nanoparticles: morphology, skeleton density, specific surface area (SSA), phase purity and average particle size. The test procedures and the analysers employed in the characterization of ZnO-NPs used in this study were described extensively in our earlier publications . The obtained powder had the following parameters: skeleton density 5.24 ± 0.05 g/cm^3^, specific surface area 39 ± 1 m^2^/g, average particle size (from SSA) 30 ± 0.1, average crystallite size (from Scherrer's formula) 22--25 nm. ZnO-NPs were composed of single spherical crystallites. The ZnO powder contained only the hexagonal phase of ZnO .\n\n【10】2.2. Nanocomposite Preparation \n------------------------------\n\n【11】A procedure of ZnO-PMMA nanocomposite preparation was described in a previously published article . The main steps are described below. A thermally polymerized PMMA resin Superacryl Plus (Spofa Dental, Jiczyn, Czech Republic) was used to manufacture the samples. The recommended mixing ratio was 22 g of powder polymer and 10 mL of liquid monomer, which represents a volume ratio of 3:1. The appropriate amount of solvothermal zinc oxide nanopowder was suspended in liquid monomer of PMMA resin. The mixture was shaken in a Vortex VX-200 shaker (Labnet, Edison, NJ, USA) for 10 min and additionally sonicated for 240 s using an Elmasonic S 10/(H) (30 W, Elma Schmidbauer GmbH, Singen, Germany). Then a calculated amount of PMMA resin powder was added, so that the final 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% mass concentration of ZnO-NPs could be obtained. PMMA resin without ZnO-NPs was used as the control group.\n\n【12】In all the studies described below 3 types of nanocomposites (2.5%, 5% and 7.5%) were used and pure PMMA served as the control group.\n\n【13】2.3. Roughness Assay \n--------------------\n\n【14】The surface roughness was examined using a stylus profiler Dektak XT (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Linear and aerial measurements were made. The former measures were taken in a single line and the latter measures in the area of the sample surface. Linear scans, 5 mm long, were taken step by step every 1 mm for both reference and modified samples. Moreover, topography of nanocomposites surface was imaged by colour three-dimensional (3D) laser microscope (VK-9700K, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The surface area with dimensions of 1416 × 1000 μm was pictured. Examination was performed on 22 samples for each group of material. The data were evaluated for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov assay. Then after checking the homogeneity of variance (Brown-Forsythe assay) one test either Student's t-test for independent samples通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> or Cochran Cox with separate variance estimate test通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> was performed. The level of significance was established at a p-value = 0.05. All data were computed using the Statistica 10.0 program (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA).\n\n【15】2.4. Contact Angle Assay \n------------------------\n\n【16】The hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of the material before and after modification was determined by the contact angle. The value of the contact angle θ was determined by measuring the angle between the tested flat surface and the tangent created by a drop of liquid bordering with that body. Measurements were made at room temperature using a goniometer type ContactAngle^®^ system (OCA DeltaPhysics, Filderstadt, Germany). As a measuring liquid, distilled water was used. The drop volume measurement was 1 mL, dosing rate was equal to 2 mL/s. Examination was performed on 46 samples for each group of material. The data were evaluated for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Then after checking the homogeneity of variance (Brown-Forsythe and Levene assays) one of the tests: t-Student for independent samples通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> or Cochran Cox with separate variance estimate test通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> was performed. The level of significance was established at a p-value = 0.05. All data were computed using the Statistica 10.0 program (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA).\n\n【17】2.5. Absorbability Assay \n------------------------\n\n【18】The measurement method for the water absorbency was elaborated based on standard procedure described in ISO 62:2008. To measure the water adsorption the samples with diameter of 20 mm × 20 mm × 2 mm were placed in liquid medium in a closed container. The chosen solution to perform this study was Fusayama's artificial saliva, which mimics the oral environment. The Fusayama artificial saliva was prepared with the following composition: 0.2 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 0.453 g CaCl~2~·2H~2~O, 0.345 g NaH~2~PO~4~·2H~2~O, 0.0025 g Na~2~S·9H~2~O, 0.5 g urea in 1000 mL of deionized water (pH 7). All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. All solutions were prepared with Milli Q water purified in the Millipore system. The samples were incubated at a human body temperature (37 °C). Subsequently, the samples weight changes were measured at a certain period of time (after 3, 5 and 7 weeks) utilizing a digital balance after slightly drying with a paper towel. Examination was performed on 24 samples for each group of material. The data were evaluated for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Then after checking the homogeneity of variance (Brown-Forsythe and Levene assays) one of the tests: t-Student for independent samples通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> or Cochran Cox with separate variance estimate test通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> was performed. The level of significance was established at a p-value = 0.05. All data were computed using the Statistica 12.0 program (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA).\n\n【19】2.6. Hardness Assay \n-------------------\n\n【20】The hardness was examined according to ISO 868:2003 standard using a Shore durometer with scale D which is appropriate for the measurement of semi-rigid and hard plastics materials. The hardened steel rod configured as a needle pin (30° cone) under an applied force penetrates into the material and the depth of penetration is measured on a scale of 0 to 100. A given force of 44.64 N was applied in a consistent manner for a required period of time (15 s). All measurements were performed at room temperature. Examination was performed on 30 samples for each group of material. The data were evaluated for normal distribution using two independent assays, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Then after checking the homogeneity of variance (Brown-Forsythe and Levene assays) one of the tests: t-Student for independent samples通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> or Cochran Cox with separate variance estimate test通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> was performed. The level of significance was established at a p-value = 0.05. All data were computed using the Statistica 12.0 program (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA).\n\n【21】3. Results and Discussion \n=========================\n\n【22】3.1. Roughness Assay \n--------------------\n\n【23】The study of the roughness of acrylic samples modified by the addition of ZnO-NPs are illustrated in box plot . The Ra parameter for control group was 3.99 µm with SD = 1.25. The results for 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites were: 3.70 µm (SD = 0.75); 3.46 µm (SD = 0.91) and 3.80 µm (SD = 0.93), respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed neither between 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites nor between nanocomposites and the control group. The three-dimensional surface imaging was obtained by 3D laser scans . The typical surface topography of the nanocomposites and pure PMMA was similar, characterized by large and deep grooves that were formed during the sample manufacture process. Depending on the content of ZnO nanopowder in nanocomposites a slight difference in surface smoothness could be observed , nevertheless it is not noticeable for roughness parameter measured on a micrometre scale.\n\n【24】There have been many studies showing positive correlation between the surface roughness and deposition of pathogenic microorganisms on the material's surface . The larger the development of the surface and the larger number of natural niches for microorganisms, the greater the potential for the deposition of C. albicans. These studies demonstrated neither positive nor negative effect of the addition of zinc oxide nanoparticles on the roughness parameter. The results are in line with the research carried out by Li et al.  who also found no statistically significant differences between PMMA and Ag-PMMA nanocomposite. The surface roughness of the samples averaged several micrometres, therefore, it seems unlikely that the additive particles in the nanometre scale could significantly affect the above parameter. Our study shows, however, that even in the same sample, wherein the average roughness is approximately 3 microns, the areas of high surface heterogeneity can be found ( and ). Most likely, this is due to the manufacturing process of the prosthesis and the fact that it reflects of mucosal surface with all anatomic details (palatal folds or small salivary glands). It should be emphasized that the inner surface is not subjected to the polishing process. The prosthesis production procedure itself is not without significance, where the material is polymerized in gypsum form and can penetrate into the micropores of gypsum. Therefore, it is essential to use gypsum of high quality, adequate hardness and mixed in suitable proportions and even foil models to ensure acceptable smoothness of surface retaining all anatomical details. The roughness of the material is one of the key parameters affecting the deposition of microorganisms on the surface of PMMA and after modification of the material with zinc oxide nanoparticles this parameter does not change.\n\n【25】3.2. Contact Angle Assay \n------------------------\n\n【26】The results of contact angle measurements are illustrated in a box plot . In all cases of nanocomposites, a statistically significant decrease in the value of the contact angle was observed compared to the control group. The contact angle parameter for the control group was 98.23 with SD = 7.85. Results for 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites were 86.67 (SD = 5.97); 86.36 (SD = 5.42) and 80.97 (SD = 6.03), respectively. No statistically significant differences between the 2.5% and 5% composites were observed, while in 7.5% nanocomposite the decline was at the level of 17.58% compared to the control group. This demonstrates the increased surface hydrophilicity after the addition of ZnO-NPs.\n\n【27】Hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of materials is assessed on the basis of the contact angle measurement. The larger the angle between the biomaterial surface and liquid drops, the greater the hydrophobic properties exhibited by the biomaterial. The mechanism of microbial adhesion to the prosthesis base consists of two successive phases . One reversible and non-specific uses, among others, electrostatic interaction and van der Waals forces. The other involves specific interactions between the adhesins present in the cell walls of microorganisms and the stereochemically complementar particles on the acrylic plate. Candida cells have on their surface hydrophobic polysaccharides, such as mannan or galactomannan, which interact not only with the epithelial mucosa but also with the surface of biomaterials . In further stages of the biofilm formation the interactions between different species of microorganisms begin to play a greater role followed by a rapid growth of C. albicans. It has been shown that increasing hydrophilicity of the material hinders the process of microbial deposition . Our present study shows that increasing amounts of ZnO-NPs in particular nanocomposites result in an increase in hydrophilic properties of the material. The interaction between water and ZnO nanoparticles leads to both molecular and dissociative adsorption of H~2~O forming a number of polar interactions and thus hydrophilic hydroxyl (--OH) species on the surface of particles . The nanoparticles incorporated into the polymer matrix has a significant impact on the surface chemistry of the resulted nanocomposite, increasing its hydrophilicity. Therefore, original hydrophobic interactions between microorganisms and the denture base may be weakened. This finding has clinical implications, because the reduction of the adhesion of the first colonizing microorganisms can disrupt the formation of biofilm already in its initial phase and thus serve as a prophylactic agent for possible inflammation of the prosthetic base.\n\n【28】3.3. Absorbability Assay \n------------------------\n\n【29】The study of the absorbability of acrylic samples modified by the addition of ZnO-NPs after 3 weeks of incubation are illustrated in the box plot . No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2.5% or 5% nanocomposite and the control group, however the examination revealed statistically significant differences between the 7.5% nanocomposite compared to pure PMMA. All the results were within the range of 1.82--2.03%, which meets the requirements of ISO 20795-1:2013 Dentistry---Base polymers---Part 1: Denture base polymers norm. The lowest result was obtained in 7.5% nanocomposite and it was over 10% lower compared to control. Changes in absorption of examined materials, observed in two consecutive series, were small and after 7 weeks of incubation amounted from 0.13% for 2.5% nanocomposite to 0.01% for 5% nanocomposite . Finally, after 7 weeks the absorbability for the control group was 2.05% with SD = 0.08. The results for 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites were: 2.18% (SD = 0.07); 2.07 (SD = 0.09) and 1.90 (SD = 0.15), respectively.\n\n【30】Absorbability of materials specifies their possible absorption of liquids with suspended organic and inorganic components. In the oral environment, these components may include food debris and micro-organisms present in the saliva biocenosis. The higher the absorption, the higher the risk of colonization of biomaterial structures by pathogenic microorganisms and also the higher the probability of faster and less favourable changes in the colour and fragrance of the test material . Water absorption by weight for acrylic resin used as denture bases averages 2% . All tested materials showed absorption within the range of 1.82 to 2.03%, which meets the requirements of ISO 20795-1,2013 Dentistry---Base polymers---Part 1, Denture base polymers. The highest water sorption occurs during the first 3 weeks of incubation, update every 4 months was a maximum of 0.13%. The lowest water absorption was recorded for 7.5% nanocomposite (10% lower compared to the pure PMMA), which may contribute to the reduced colonization of microbes. Therefore, it could be expected that the base plate made of the above-mentioned biomaterial might be able to survive longer in the mouth, without changes in colour and smell.\n\n【31】3.4. Hardness Assay \n-------------------\n\n【32】The study of the hardness of acrylic samples modified by the addition of ZnO-NPs are illustrated in the box plot . The determined hardness for the control group was 86.1° ShD with SD = 1.92. The results for 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites were 86.2° ShD (SD = 2.29); 88.7° ShD (SD = 1.31) and 91.2° ShD (SD = 1.56), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2.5% nanocomposite and the control group, however the examination revealed statistically significant differences between 5% and 7.5% nanocomposites compared to pure PMMA. Moreover, the highest result was obtained for 7.5% nanocomposite and it was over 5.9% higher compared to control.\n\n【33】The hardness of the material is not directly linked with the deposition of fungal biofilm on the nanocomposite surface. Nevertheless, a possible use of this biomaterial as a dental prosthesis and the prevailing conditions in the oral cavity in which it will be used should be taken into account. It is essential to subject the denture to hygiene treatment after each meal to initiate the effect of mechanical and chemical stimuli. Patients, often against the doctor's advice, use for denture cleaning a toothpaste with a high abrasion index containing unfavourable for PMMA abrasives that may scratch the surface of the denture. Any damage to denture, such as micro-scratches and cracks, caused during hygiene procedures or during chewing, may be natural niches for living microbes, including the most frequently isolated C. albicans in denture stomatitis. The hardness of the material can thus be the exponent of the prosthesis wear resistance capability . According to theoretical considerations the addition of inorganic nanofiller particles to the polymer matrix increases the hardness of the material . The results of this study show that the incorporation of ZnO-NPs to PMMA for 7.5% nanocomposite increases the hardness by 5.92% and this is a statistically significant difference. The revealed increase may hinder the formation of scratches and microcracks on the surface of the prosthesis which explains the reduced deposition of fungal biofilm on the surface of new biomaterials demonstrated in previous publications.\n\n【34】Moreover, the measurement of polymer hardness has been used successfully as an indirect method to assess the degree of conversion of the polymer in acrylic materials conventionally hot polymerized, as well as in composites . The parameter of the material hardness is therefore sensitive to the increased content of residual monomer , one of the causes of allergic reactions and inflammation of mucosa under the denture base. Based on the presented results it can be concluded that in the entire study group the addition of ZnO-NPs to the polymer matrix does not contribute to the reduced hardness of plastic and thereby to the deteriorated degree of the polymer conversion. This observation is of extreme importance since the increased contents of residual monomer could influence not only the tendency to develop inflammation of the mucous membranes but also to exert a negative effect on mechanical properties of a new biomaterial.\n\n【35】4. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【36】This study is a continuation and extension of a previously published work  where anti-fungal properties of ZnO-PMMA nanocomposites, were demonstrated and the fact that they increase with increasing content of these zinc oxide nanoparticles was highlighted. The aim of the work was to investigate some properties of new biomaterials that could explain the origin of these properties. The obtained results of laboratory tests are encouraging. However, they must be clinically validated. It would be now interesting to carry out research to find out whether or not the addition of ZnO-NPs contributes at the same time to deterioration of the material mechanical properties. Therefore, prior to clinical application of the new biomaterial further mechanical and cytotoxic studies are required. Finally, it should be noted that the study showed no significant deterioration in the properties of acrylic resin, which could disqualify nanocomposite for clinical use. The increased hydrophilicity and hardness with absorbability within the normal range can explain the reduced microorganisms' growth on the denture base what has been proven in a previous work. The presented study brings much closer the possibility of clinical use of new nanobiomaterials.\n\n【37】The work was supported by a research project carried out in the years 2017--2018, funded by a statutory grant obtained by the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw.

We investigated the in vitro antihemolytic and antioxidant properties of pearl powder that could protect erythrocytes against 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative damage to membrane proteins/lipids. Human erythrocytes were incubated with different concentrations of pearl powder (50-200 μg/mL) for 30 minutes and then exposed to AAPH for 2-6 hours. We found that AAPH alone time dependently increased the oxidative hemolysis of erythrocytes, while pearl powder pretreatment substantially inhibited the hemolysis in a concentration-/time-dependent manner. AAPH-induced oxidative damage to erythrocyte membrane lipids was evidenced by the elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, pearl powder remarkably inhibited the malondialdehyde formation, and the 200 μg/mL concentration showed almost similar malondialdehyde values to the control. Furthermore, pearl powder suppressed the AAPH-induced high-molecular-weight protein formation and concomitantly increased the low-molecular-weight proteins in erythrocytes. Antioxidant potential that was measured as superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content was significantly dropped by AAPH incubation, which suggests the vulnerability of erythrocytes to AAPH-induced oxidative stress. Noteworthy, erythrocytes pretreated with pearl powder showed restored superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels against AAPH-induced loss.

The stability and DNA binding of four representatives of this family, MATalpha2, engrailed, Antennapedia, and NK-2, and truncated forms of the last two lacking their N-terminal arms have been studied by a combination of optical and microcalorimetric methods at different temperatures and salt concentrations. It was found that the stability of the free homeodomains in solution is rather low and, surprisingly, is reduced by the presence of the N-terminal arm for the Antennapedia and NK-2 domains. Their stabilities depend significantly upon the presence of salt: strongly for NaCl but less so for NaF, demonstrating specific interactions with chloride ions. The enthalpies of association of the homeodomains with their cognate DNAs are negative, at 20 degrees C varying only between -12 and -26 kJ/mol for the intact homeodomains, and the entropies of association are positive; i.e. DNA binding is both enthalpy- and entropy-driven. Analysis of the salt dependence of the association constants showed that the electrostatic component of the Gibbs energy of association resulting from the entropy of mixing of released ions dominates the binding, being about twice the magnitude of the nonelectrostatic component that results from dehydration of the protein/DNA interface, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonding. A comparison of the effects of NaCl/KCl with NaF showed that homeodomain binding results in a release not only of cations from the DNA phosphates but also of chloride ions specifically associated with the proteins.

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Dental caries caused by some pathogens of the oral microbiome is a widespread disease. In the Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study, untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition, affecting 2.5 billion people worldwide . The cause of dental caries is multifactorial. In addition to major microbial species mutans streptococci (predominantly Streptococcus mutans and S. sobrinus), physical, biological, environmental, behavioral, and lifestyle-related factors are risk factors for dental caries .\n\n【2】Recently, next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) analyses have attracted attention for use in microbiome studies, including dental caries. A pyrosequencing (NGS analysis) study revealed genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus were increased in carious dentin compared with healthy dentin . Another study revealed that genera Alloprevotella, Atopobium, Lautropia, Megasphaera, Selenomonas, and Veillonella were enriched in saliva from a high-risk caries group . According to the ecological hypothesis of dental caries , the proportion of acidogenic and aciduric taxa, such as mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus, are increased and lead to demineralization. In addition, this hypothesis suggests that amino acid-degrading microbial taxa, including Prevotella, and Fusobacterium species may also cause the acidic environment required for demineralization . These results indicate that both mutans and non-mutans streptococci may contribute to dental caries. However, many caries studies using sequencing analyses targeted young children with primary dentition, and few studies have focused on young adults and older people . Whether a relationship between the increase in dental caries and oral microbiome exists in these latter populations remains unclear.\n\n【3】In Japan, there remains a high caries prevalence in young adults. Among young adults (20--24 years), 79.4% had caries experience . Thus, it is crucial to prevent dental caries in the general population.\n\n【4】Therefore, we hypothesized that an increase in dental caries during university life is associated with a unique oral microbiome. The purpose of this 3-year prospective cohort study was to explore the relationship between an increase in caries and oral microbiome among Japanese university students. In addition, we investigated the association between other factors and caries increment.\n\n【5】2. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【6】2.1. Study Population \n---------------------\n\n【7】The inclusion criteria were Japanese students who volunteered to receive oral examinations at the Health Service Center of Okayama University both in April 2013 (baseline) and April 2016 (follow-up). We excluded students who provided incomplete responses in their questionnaires.\n\n【8】2.2. Ethical Procedures and Informed Consent \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【9】All study protocols were approved by the ethics committee of Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Okayama University Hospital (no. 1060). All targeted participants gave their informed verbal consent for study participation. This study followed the strengthening the reporting of observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.\n\n【10】2.3. Questionnaire \n------------------\n\n【11】At baseline, students answered questions concerning age, sex, systemic diseases, and oral health behaviors (daily frequency of tooth brushing, use of dental floss, and visits to dental clinics for regular checkups) . Furthermore, at follow-up, four additional questions were included about fluoride dentifrices, knowledge of the effectiveness of fluoride, daily frequency of eating sweets, and smoking during university life.\n\n【12】2.4. Oral Examination \n---------------------\n\n【13】Oral examinations were performed by five calibrated dentists (Daisuke Ekuni, Kota Kataoka, Mayu Yamane-Takeuchi, Shinsuke Mizutani, and Tetsuji Azuma). After counting the number of teeth, the oral hygiene state was evaluated using the Debris Index-Simplified (DI-S) score . The decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) scores was recorded according to the World Health Organization criteria . After the theoretical training, to assess intra- and inter-examiner agreement, DMFT scores were recorded and repeated within a 2-week interval in two volunteers. Data were analyzed using a non-parametric kappa test. The kappa values were \\>0.8.\n\n【14】2.5. DNA Extraction and NGS Analysis \n------------------------------------\n\n【15】At follow-up, unstimulated saliva (\\>1 mL) was randomly collected into sterile ice-chilled 15 mL tubes from students (from 09:00 to 16:00) before the dental examination and frozen at −80 °C until analysis. To prevent possible protein dilution, unstimulated saliva was collected instead of stimulated saliva . A random number list was used for selecting participants for saliva collection. The saliva of selected participants was not collected at baseline. Saliva DNA was collected using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions using sterile equipment and DNA removal reagents for laboratory instruments. Collected DNA was stored at −20 °C for further analysis. For amplified bacterial DNA, V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified using primers 357F (5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 781R (5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) at Okayama University Hospital Biobank (Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan) according to the standard protocol using the MiSeq platform (MiSeq Reagent V3 600 cycles, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Quality of raw sequence reads was checked using FastQC  and analyzed using USEARCH  at the Oral Microbiome Center (Taniguchi Dental Clinic, Kagawa, Japan). After removing chimeric reads, duplicated reads, and short reads \\<400 bp, preprocessed reads of each sample were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% level of nucleotide similarity using UCLUST algorithm to determine the number of OTUs. Furthermore, these reads were analyzed to identify human oral taxa using the Human Oral Microbiome Database .\n\n【16】2.6. Statistical Analyses \n-------------------------\n\n【17】We estimated the sample size for the saliva examination based on a previous study  using G\\Power . The difference in α diversity (Simpson index; caries group: 0.075 ± 0.019, healthy group: 0.099 ± 0.037) was selected as the primary outcome . To calculate the effect size, mean and standard deviation of 0.024 ± 0.018 was considered to detect a difference in α diversity between the two communities. Based on the data, the minimum sample size required was 52 to provide a power of 91% with an alpha of 0.05 by t-test. Participants were divided into two groups based on the change in DMFT score during the 3-year follow-up period; participants with ΔDMFT \\> 0 were categorized into the \"increased group,\" while participants with ΔDMFT = 0 were categorized into the \"non-increased group\" . The normality of the data was confirmed by the histogram and quantile-quantile plot. The Mann--Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test were used to determine the presence of significant differences in variables of oral examination and questionnaire between increased and non-increased groups. Associations between variables and dental caries were examined in a series of logistic regression models, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Logistic regression models were reviewed for goodness-of-fit and validated using the Hosmer--Lemeshow statistic. A p-value \\< 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS .\n\n【18】Alpha diversity was determined using R . The species richness of saliva microbiota of individuals was measured by Chao1 and the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) indices. The diversity of the saliva microbiota was measured by Shannon and Simpson indices. Microbial beta diversity was visualized by principal coordinates analysis using the Calypso software tool . The Mann--Whitney U test was used to assess significant differences in the abundance of taxa between increased and non-increased groups. Rarefaction curves were calculated using Calypso to compare microbial richness among samples. To compare the microbial composition between increased and non-increased groups, relative abundances (%) were calculated from the taxonomic abundance count divided by preprocessed reads. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) methods were used to identify taxa with differentiating relative abundance using the online interface Galaxy . The threshold for the logarithmic LDA score for biomarker discovery was set at 2.0 .\n\n【19】3. Results \n==========\n\n【20】3.1. Participant Characteristics \n--------------------------------\n\n【21】The study flowchart is shown in ; 293 students (follow-up rate: 13.4%; 149 males, 144 females; mean age and standard deviation at baseline: 18.2 ± 0.77 years) were analyzed . At follow-up, the DI-S score of selected students (n = 55) was significantly lower than that of all participants (n = 293; p \\< 0.05, t-test). No significant differences were observed in the other parameters evaluated between selected students and all participants (p \\< 0.05, Mann--Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test).\n\n【22】In all participants, DMFT scores, DI-S score at baseline, and the percentage of students who had knowledge of fluoride at follow-up were significantly higher in the increased group than those in the non-increased group (p \\< 0.05; ). In the logistic regression analysis, increase in dental caries was significantly related to DMFT score (OR: 1.191, 95% CI: 1.033--1.373, p = 0.016) and DI-S score (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.355--6.913, p = 0.007) at baseline.\n\n【23】3.2. Salivary Microbiome Analysis \n---------------------------------\n\n【24】In our study, 3,195,127 quality-filtering reads (58,093 ± 16,532) from 55 saliva samples were used for analysis. A total of 196 OTUs were obtained from saliva samples. Of these, 13 phyla, 21 classes, 32 orders, 48 families, 72 genera, and 156 species were identified. There were no significant differences in the number of each taxonomic level between increased and non-increased groups (p ≥ 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the species richness of individuals between increased and non-increased groups (a; p ≥ 0.05). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in species diversity and bacterial communities between the two groups (b,c; p ≥ 0.05).\n\n【25】3.3. Microbial Composition \n--------------------------\n\n【26】There were no significant differences in microbial composition at class and order levels between increased and non-increased groups. At the phylum level, the increased group had a higher population of Proteobacteria than the non-increased group (; p = 0.029). At the family level, the increased group had a higher population of Prevotellaceae than the non-increased group (; p = 0.007). At the genus level, the increased group had a higher population of Actinobaculum, Dialister, and Alloprevotella than the non-increased group (; p \\< 0.05). At the species level, the increased group had higher populations of Neisseria sicca, Alloprevotella sp. Dialister invisus, Cardiobacterium hominis, Acinetobacter sp. Gracilibacteria (GN02) \\[G-1\\], Neisseria elongate, Actinomyces graevenitzii, Anaerolineae \\[G-1\\], Dialister pneumosintes, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Actinobaculum sp. Corynebacterium matruchotii, Prevotella pleuritidis, and Neisseria sp. than those in the non-increased group (; p \\< 0.05). Low percentages of S. mutans in saliva were detected in both groups. In LEfSe analysis, Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae at the family level and Alloprevotella and Dialister at the genus level were enriched in the increased group compared with the non-increased group .\n\n【27】4. Discussion \n=============\n\n【28】Various groups have provided information about the relationship between dental caries and the oral microbiome \\[,\\]. However, there is less information about this relationship in young adults or university students. In the present 3-year cohort study, the abundance of several taxa was significantly higher in the increased group than that in the non-increased group. In addition, poor oral hygiene and caries experience at baseline were significantly associated with an increase in dental caries during university life.\n\n【29】In this study, the observed taxa number was not significantly different between increased and non-increased groups. Moreover, the microbial structure was similar between the two groups. Jiang et al. reported that the microbial composition was similar between caries progression and non-progression groups among older people . The findings from our study support these results.\n\n【30】The percentages of several taxa were significantly higher in the increased group than those in the non-increased group. In particular, further analysis using LEfSe methods revealed families Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae and genera Alloprevotella and Dialister were significantly enriched in the increased group compared with the non-increased group (LDA scores ≥ 3.0). Prevotellaceae was detected in carious dentin or saliva of participants with caries progression . Furthermore, Eriksson et al. also reported that Veillonellaceae and Dialister were enriched in the saliva of patients with caries progression using the LEfSe method . Alloprevotella was detected in the saliva of children with caries progression using LEfSe . Using non-culture methods, non-mutans streptococci have been detected in carious dentin or saliva . Furthermore, Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae species are known to produce acid . These results indicate that several acid-producing bacteria or non-mutans streptococci may be associated with caries progression, which suggests new targets for preventing caries progression.\n\n【31】In this study, there were no significant differences in microbiome diversities between increased and non-increased groups. Previous studies exploring the oral microbiome to elucidate potential targets for caries prevention mainly targeted children with deciduous dental plaque or saliva. For example, a 2-year cohort study revealed that microbial diversity in saliva did not differ between caries progression and non-progression groups . However, some cohort studies reported that salivary microbiome diversity was significantly different between participants with increased dental caries compared with those with non-increased dental caries . According to these reports, whether salivary microbiome diversity is associated with caries progression remains controversial. Furthermore, few studies included young adults as subjects. A cross-sectional study exploring salivary microbiomes among families, including young adults, reported that dental caries did not impact microbial diversity . While our findings support the results of this study, further cohort studies are required to investigate the relationship between microbiome diversity and an increase in dental caries.\n\n【32】Oral condition is also associated with caries progression. In a cohort study of adult participants in Sweden, DMFT scores of the caries progression group were higher than those in the non-progression group at baseline . In addition, a previous study reported that the increased caries group had worse oral hygiene than that of the non-increased caries group . Here, we demonstrated that DMFT and DI-S scores were associated with an increase in dental caries in the logistic regression analysis, supporting the results of these previous studies.\n\n【33】In this study, a low abundance of mutans streptococci was detected among the two groups. Mutans streptococci are traditionally recognized as the most common cause of dental caries . Several studies also reported that there was no difference in the abundance of these species between caries-active and caries-free groups . Furthermore, Takahashi and Nyvad proposed the \"Ecological Plaque Hypothesis,\" wherein acid-producing bacteria, excluding mutans streptococci, are also considered to lead to an imbalance in mineralization . However, we did not investigate the microbiome in dental plaques of participants with caries. Further studies are therefore required.\n\n【34】In this study, we used saliva samples for microbiome analysis. Saliva collection is non-invasive, simple, and effective for mass examination. Some studies reported that plaque bacteria are released into saliva , and saliva provides a niche for both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria . Furthermore, saliva is a biomarker that reflects oral health and systemic condition . Thus, saliva evaluation has several advantages, especially in large-scale epidemiological studies or caries screening.\n\n【35】Our study has some limitations. First, there may have been selection bias, given the low follow-up rate (13.4%). In addition, the number of participants who had regular dental checkups at baseline and DI-S scores at follow-up differed between selected participants and total participants. However, increased dental caries was not related to these variables in the logistic regression analysis. Therefore, the selection bias might be small in this study. Second, all participants were recruited from among students who attended Okayama University. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable. Third, we could not investigate potential confounders, such as social capital  or socioeconomic status . Fourth, we did not use a specific primer and probe for detecting S. mutans. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, we could detect the taxa using obtained sequencing reads. However, a previous study mentioned that V1--V2 or V3--V4 hypervariable regions (approximately 400--460 bp) is the limit for identifying detailed level of taxa . Therefore, a wider region or specific primer is needed . Fifth, we did not set a specific time for saliva collection; that is, saliva was collected from 09:00 to 16:00. However, we randomly selected participants and collected saliva at the last step of the general health examination. Therefore, we do not consider that eating or drinking affected salivary analysis. Finally, we could not collect saliva at baseline; however, we checked caries increment using DMFT at baseline and follow-up. Although Belstrøm et al. reported the stable condition of the salivary microbiome , we cannot rule out the possibility of changes in the salivary microbiome during the 3-year study period.\n\n【36】5. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【37】Among Japanese university students, non-mutans streptococci bacteria in saliva were associated with increased caries in this 3-year prospective cohort study. However, there were no significant differences in salivary microbiome diversity between increased and non-increased groups.\n\n【38】The authors are grateful to Tetsuji Azuma (Asahi University, Japan), Mayu Yamane-Takeuchi, and Shinsuke Mizutani (Kyushu University, Japan) for data collection; and Toru Takeshita (Kyushu University, Japan) and Kazuyoshi Gotoh (Okayama University, Japan) for technical support.\n\n【39】Y.U.-F. drafted the manuscript.

The exact mechanism(s) of PFD action remain unclear, due in part to the broad effects of this drug on the complex processes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. While PFD is FDA-approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the efficacy of this compound for the treatment of dermal fibrosis has not yet been fully characterized. Dermal fibrosis is the pathological formation of excess fibrous connective tissue of the skin, usually the result of traumatic cutaneous injury. Fibroproliferative scarring, caused by delayed wound healing and prolonged inflammation, remains a major clinical concern with considerable morbidity. Despite efforts to identify a therapeutic that targets the fibrotic pathways involved in wound healing to mitigate scar formation, no satisfactory dermal antifibrotic has yet been identified. We aim to better elucidate the antifibrotic mechanism(s) of PFD activity using an in vitro model of dermal fibrosis. Briefly, cultured human dermal fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1 to induce differentiation into profibrotic myofibroblast cells. A dose-dependent reduction in cellular proliferation and migration was observed in TGF-β1-stimulated cells when treated with PFD. We observed a clear inhibition in the development of essential myofibroblast mechanoregulatory machinery, including contractile F-actin stress fibers containing α-SMA and large super-mature focal adhesions. PFD treatment significantly reduced protein levels of major ECM components type I and type III collagen. PFD targeted the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and mitigated profibrotic gene expression profiles.

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Despite being useful in particulate form (e.g. embedded in polymer matrices) , bioactive glasses are mostly used in the form of scaffolds, with stochastic and non-stochastic open porosity (foams and reticulated scaffolds, respectively) . The manufacturing of these structures is intrinsically conditioned by the control of viscous flow sintering of fine glass particles. More precisely, pressureless glass sintering occurs 50--100 °C above the dilatometric softening temperature  (corresponding to a viscosity of 10^11.5^ Pa·s), in turn placed slightly above the transition temperature T~g~ (but well below \"Littleton\" softening point, indicating gross viscous flow, for a viscosity of approximately 10^6.6^ Pa·s)  and often overlapping with the crystallization temperature . The overlapping is also stimulated by the use of fine particles possessing a wide specific surface: in case of glasses sensitive to surface-induced crystallization, the crystallization temperature is so downshifted, with decreasing powder size, that the devitrification practically nullify the viscous flow  (rigid inclusions provide a significant increase of viscosity in softened glass ).\n\n【2】Sintering with concurrent devitrification ('sinter-crystallization'), for 45S5 bioglass^®^, has a fundamental drawback in limiting the bioactivity . This negative aspect may be overcome by revising the chemical formulation, i.e. producing new bioactive glasses, with two distinct aims: (i) adjusting the amount and nature of crystal phases developed upon firing, in order to achieve the bioactivity of 45S5 with a semi-crystalline material (e.g. Biosilicate^®^ glass-ceramic, developed by Zanotto and coworkers ); (ii) realizing a quite large temperature gap ('processing window') between softening and crystallization, in 'crystallization-resistant bioactive glasses' (including the well-known 13-93 bioactive glass) . BGMS10 glass, the object of the present studies, belongs to the latter type .\n\n【3】Compared to 45S5 bioglass, the bioactive glass BGMS10 contains a lower content of alkali oxides, but it features the presence of magnesium and strontium oxides, thus bringing extra ions (Mg^2+^ and Sr^2+^) with a well established positive impact on biological properties . Previous tests have shown that BGMS10 behaves very similarly to 45S5 in terms of in vitro bioactivity and in vivo biocompatibility .\n\n【4】Once a glass with low crystallization tendency and comfortable processing window is selected, attention must be paid to the manufacturing technique adopted for the obtainment of highly porous, open-celled components, matching the microstructural requirements of materials for bone tissue engineering (e.g. pores well-defined interconnections, with a diameter exceeding 100 μm, to allow effective tissue ingrowth and vascularization ).\n\n【5】A key condition is that the applied technology should not interfere with the microstructural evolution of glass powders upon thermal treatments; in other words, additives and/or particular processing conditions (e.g. use of very fine powders) should not determine changes in the crystallization tendency or cause a viscous collapse of the structures defined in the 'green' state.\n\n【6】The use of sacrificial organic binders is fundamental; among them, photocurable resins are undoubtedly precious in enabling the manufacturing of scaffolds with non-stochastic porosity by means of high-resolution stereolithography 3D printing . When considering suspensions of fine glass particles in photocurable resin (i.e. a bi-phasic mixture), instead of photocurable liquid (a monophasic system), the resolution is obviously conditioned by the particle size and by light scattering at the liquid--particle interfaces ; anyway, highly uniform samples, even with complex geometries, were successfully obtained starting from glass undergoing sinter-crystallization . The sudden increase of viscosity, caused by crystal precipitation, prevented any collapse of cellular structure upon firing. The shape retention had been observed also in stereolithography experiences with bioglass 45S5 ; however, in this specific case, samples exhibited quite poor mechanical properties and were partially crystallized (with a negative impact on bioactivity, as discussed above). The present investigation aims at demonstrating the suitability of stereolithography for the manufacturing of reticulated scaffolds with good shape retention upon firing, despite the absence of crystallization, owing to the use of BGMS10 bioactive glass.\n\n【7】The use of fugitive organic binders is useful also for the obtainment of open-celled foams by gel-casting, i.e. by intensive mechanical stirring and incorporation of air bubbles (with the support of surfactants) in liquids undergoing progressive gelation. Widely applied to bioactive glasses from sol--gel approach  (operating on solutions of metallorganic compounds), the process has been successfully applied to suspensions of glass powders, subjected to gelation according to the addition of a quite complex mixture of organic agents, such as monomers, cross-linkers, and catalysts . Air bubbles are stabilized by the characteristic gelation-induced pseudoplasticity, i.e. by the sudden increase of viscosity upon reduction of strain rate (low viscosity upon intensive stirring, high viscosity when stirring stops). Porous samples are formed already in the 'green' state (dried suspension) before final consolidation by viscous flow sintering.\n\n【8】The present investigation, besides discussing the application of stereolithography 3D printing to BGMS10, aims at disclosing the potential of a simplified approach to gel-casting of bioactive glass foams, deriving from recent experiences on the alkali activation of glass aqueous suspensions . According to alkaline attack, gelation is achieved by formation of an inorganic binding phase (instead of an organic, polymeric phase), consisting of hydrated silicate and/or carbonate compounds, involving ions extracted from the glass (Ca^2+^) and/or from the alkaline activator (Na^+^, K^+^, from NaOH and KOH, respectively). Although highly effective (and flexible, i.e. open to a vast range of glasses ), the process has a substantial drawback in the contamination of the adopted glass operated by oxides in the binding phase, decomposed upon firing; in particular, a surplus of alkali oxides may modify both biological behavior and crystallization (it was observed that alkali activation may widen and shift the crystallization exothermic peak at lower temperature ). With the present paper, we will show the feasibility of a 'hybrid' activation, which recovers the concept of gelation as an effect of glass inclusion in a basic environment, but avoids contamination, owing to the use of an ammonium salt.\n\n【9】2. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【10】The chemical composition of BGMS10 glass is reported in . The glass batch was prepared from analytical grade powder reagents (from Carlo Erba Reagenti, Milano, Italy) and melted at 1450 °C in a Pt crucible, in air. The molten material was suddenly cooled by pouring into deionized water. The drastic quenching provided a number of fragments, subsequently left to dry at 110 °C for 2 h. The frit was later reduced into fine powders, with a size below 38 μm, by dry ball milling and manual sieving.\n\n【11】Samples with non-stochastic porosity were manufactured by using DLP (digital light processing), in analogy with previous experiences . Fine glass powders were suspended in a commercially available photocurable acrylic polymer (Tripropylene glycol diacrylate, Robot Factory S.R.L. Mirano, Italy), already comprising a suitable photo-initiator and photo-absorber, for a solid load of 60 wt. %. The suspension was printed using a printer (3DLPrinter-HD 2.0, Robotfactory S.R.L. Mirano, Italy) operating in the visible light range (between 400 and 500 nm). After cleaning in an ultrasonic bath with isopropanol for 3 min, the samples were subjected to a secondary curing step, in a UV curing chamber (operating wavelength 365 nm, Robot Factory S.R.L. Mirano, Italy), for 15 min. Finally, the samples underwent a preliminary heat treatment in the air (1 °C/min heating rate) at 550 °C for 5 h, aimed at the burn-out of the photo-cured binder.\n\n【12】'Green' glass foam samples were prepared according to frothing of an aqueous suspension of fine glass powders, for a solid loading of 65 wt. %, activated by addition of tetramethyl-ammonium hydroxide (TMAH, (CH~3~)~4~NOH, reagent grade, Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) in a concentration of 1 mol/L. Glass slurries were firstly kept under low-speed mechanical stirring (500 rpm) for 3 h to induce partial dissolution and gelation. Secondly, the slurries were foamed by vigorous mechanical mixing (2000 rpm) for 5 min after the addition of 4 wt. % Triton X-100 (polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether, Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) and subsequently cast in polystyrene moulds (50 mm diameter). Finally, the foams were dried at 40 °C for 24 h, demoulded and subjected to a preliminary heat treatment in air at 350 °C (5 °C/min heating rate) for 1 h for the burn-out of organics.\n\n【13】Both reticulated and foamed scaffolds, after relative preliminary heat treatments, underwent a sintering treatment in air at 750 °C (with heating rate of 1 °C/min up to 500 °C, then with 5 °C/min up to 750 °C) for 1 h, followed by natural cooling.\n\n【14】The evolution of samples was investigated by means of Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR, FTIR model 2000, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA), X-ray diffraction on powders (XRD; Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) and thermal analysis (thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, TG/DSC; Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3^+^, STARe System, Columbus, OH, USA).\n\n【15】The bulk density was computed from the weight-to-volume ratios on regular blocks (cut from bigger foamed samples or directly available from DLP), after careful determinations of weights and dimensions by means of an analytical balance and of a digital caliper, respectively. The apparent and true densities of the various samples were measured by He gas pycnometry (Micromeritics AccuPyc 1330, Norcross, GA, USA), applied on samples in bulk and powder forms. Morphological and microstructural characterizations were performed by optical stereomicroscopy (AxioCam ERc 5s Microscope Camera, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Thornwood, New York, NY, USA) and scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 ESEM, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).\n\n【16】The compressive strength of the porous glass scaffolds was measured at room temperature by means of an Instron 1121 UTM (Instron, Danvers, MA, USA) operating with a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Each data point represents the average value of at least 10 individual tests.\n\n【17】3. Results \n==========\n\n【18】A first series of investigations concerned the application of stereolithography to BGMS10, starting from a diamond cell design recently tested for wollastonite-diopside glass-ceramics , as illustrated by . The particular design, maximizing the bending of thin struts, was chosen specifically to verify the resistance of BGMS10 to viscous collapse upon firing.\n\n【19】The limited morphological changes from samples in the printed state, shown in a,b, to samples after firing, illustrated by c, clearly show that by operating at the lower limit for pressureless sintering (with T~g~ \\~670 °C , the firing temperature ---750 °C, i.e. T~g~ + 80 °C, was in the range of dilatometric softening temperature), a good shape retention could be achieved despite the absence of crystallization (in previous experiments with wollastonite-diopside glass-ceramics  the shape was maintained as an effect of viscosity enhancement operated by intensive crystal precipitation). BGMS10 was evidently a 'long' glass, i.e. not exhibiting an abrupt decrease of viscosity with increasing temperature above T~g~. The fully amorphous state is demonstrated in , and it is consistent with the DSC curve of , displaying the crystallization temperature far above the adopted sintering temperature.\n\n【20】All printed samples were opaque white as an effect of the presence of tiny micropores 删除21:<u></u> and some roughness (d still displays the former glass granules). The circles in c actually evidence some defects likely originating from not optimized debinding, i.e. gas release, from the burn-out of the acrylic resin, overlapping with the sintering phase and leading to some cracks. Since BGMS10 did not undergo crystallization, the viscous flow provided some healing of the same cracks, saving the integrity of samples.\n\n【21】The saving of structural integrity can be understood from the results of mechanical testing. The diamond cell structure had been selected also as an example of 'bending dominated' design . According to Gibson and Ashby , the crushing of brittle solids with such morphology, causing the systematic buckling of the struts, is described by a simple equation: where σ~c~ represents the compressive strength, σ~bend~ is the bending strength of the solid phase, and ρ~rel~ is the relative density (ratio between geometric and true densities). The observed crushing strength  cannot be considered as low; in fact, according to the low relative density (slightly exceeding 0.1, with a total porosity of nearly 90 vol. %), the bending strength of the solid phase, predicted by reversing Equation通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> (σ~bend~ = 5·σ~c~·(ρ~rel~)^−1.5^), is about 71 MPa, in excellent agreement with the bending strength values of silicate glasses  despite the presence of the above mentioned debinding defects.\n\n【22】Much stronger scaffolds  were developed by using a second design, as illustrated by . Cubic samples were derived by the overlapping of smaller cubic cells in a variable number (4 or 6 cells per side, as shown by a and b, respectively). In this case, the application of the model from Gibson and Ashby would not be appropriate, considering the much thicker struts and the lower porosity (from 50 to 62 vol. %). The debinding defects favored by the increased strut thickness, with the new design, were again healed by the viscous flow of BGMS10, as shown by c.\n\n【23】The adopted designs, 'thin-walled' (diamond cell) and 'thick-walled' (cubic cell), may be seen as two 'extreme' solutions in DLP of BGMS10, useful to appreciate the successful combination of densification with retention of both shape and amorphous state. Additional efforts will be undoubtedly dedicated, in the near future, in the manufacturing of scaffolds with different strut length/thickness ratio, different overall geometry and adjusted debinding phase.\n\n【24】The second series of investigations concerned the effectiveness of activation of aqueous slurries by means of the adopted organic base, compared to alkali activation. Suspensions of glass powders in NaOH or KOH solution typically undergo gelation by formation of hydrated silicate and carbonate compounds  that could be detected by means of infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis.\n\n【25】a shows a 'green' foam after the drying step. The new activation was successful in causing the gelation of the glass slurry and stabilization of air bubbles, incorporated by intensive mechanical stirring. According to b, particles were effectively 'glued' together, in analogy with what found with NaOH or KOH solutions. However, the nature of the surface compounds did not correspond with that previously achieved.\n\n【26】The FTIR spectra in  shows many bands in samples after activation ('green' foams) but absent either in the starting glass or in fired foams. Like in the case of NaOH and KOH activation , the bands at 3000--3700 and 1650 cm^−1^ are attributable to hydration of BGMS10 glass (O-H stretching and bending), but there is no clear carbonation (the C-O bond is usually detected by a well-defined peak centered at about 1450 cm^−1^) . The surfactant is clearly distinguishable from the bands labeled with 'S' (particularly that 2900 cm^−1^). Contribution to the IR absorption came also from TMAH 删除21:<u></u>. The band at 1250 cm^−1^ may be attributed again to the activator, being reported for the C-N stretching vibration .\n\n【27】The numerous bands below 1300 cm^−1^ are quite interesting in revealing a more intense silica dissolution than in the cases of attack by NaOH or KOH (at low molarity). The band at 1120 cm^−1^ can be attributed to the stretching vibration of Si-O bonds in free SiO~4~ tetrahedra, as found in colloidal silica ; the bands centered at 900 cm^−1^ finds analogies with silica hydrated gels . Finally, the sharp band standing at 970 cm^−1^ identifies the presence of Si-OH groups of the hydrated gel .\n\n【28】Unlike in previous cases, the activation with TMAH could not be recognized by formation of crystalline phases or by shifts in the peak position of the amorphous halo (typical of the X-ray diffraction of glasses), as shown by . Furthermore, the firing at 750 °C again did not cause any crystallization.\n\n【29】The thermogravimetric plot, shown in a, revealed a continuous weight loss of the dried sample up to the sintering temperature, up to 15 wt. %, i.e. far exceeding the contribution of the surfactant (4 wt. %). Interestingly, the overall loss matched almost perfectly that of a bioactive glass (undergoing sinter-crystallization upon firing) previously activated with NaOH-containing solution (1 M) , reported in b (also displaying the weight loss of Triton X-100). A substantial difference is represented by the fact that with TMAH-induced activation most of the weight loss occurred below 500 °C, while with NaOH more than one-fifth of the total loss was achieved above this threshold. 'High-temperature losses' with NaOH activation were ascribed to the decomposition of calcium silicate hydrated (C-S-H) compounds, known to release water vapor above 500 °C . The losses for TMAH-activated BGMS10 are reasonably due to the evolution of physically adsorbed water (released below 200 °C) as well as condensation of silanol groups formed at the surface of glass particles, upon basic attack. We cannot exclude a minor contribution of organic moieties evolving from TMAH.\n\n【30】Previous experiments on glass--ceramic foams, from the activation of CEL2 bioactive glass , had revealed a substantial stimulation of crystallization, with the distinctive exothermic peak appearing broader and at much lowered temperature, interpreted as the effect of an alkali-enriched transient liquid layer from the decomposition of the binding gel on the surface of softened glass upon firing. The volumetric changes and ionic displacements in softened glass, associated with crystallization, could be somewhat catalyzed by a low viscosity extra phase (alkali rich glasses feature lower activation energy for crystal growth ), progressively dissolving in the same base glass. The differential scanning calorimetry plot shown in  testifies that the crystallization tendency of BGMS10 was not significantly altered by the activation: the exothermic peak had a slight downshift but no broadening. A large exothermic effect was detected between 200 and 400 °C, consistent with the burn-out of organic moieties.\n\n【31】The firing of green foams confirmed the open-celled structure available in the green state . As shown by  (left), wide openings between adjacent cells (above 100 µm) were kept, while the cell walls had intensive densification, by viscous flow of BGMS10, to become nearly transparent. Such transparency was also a confirmation of the complete burn-out of organic additives, much before sintering could take place. Higher magnification details (shown in , right) confirmed the formation of thin (but hollow) membranes. The presence of these membranes and the absence of any crack motivate the far higher strength-to-density ratio of foamed samples, compared to diamond cell scaffolds.\n\n【32】The substantial lacking of any interference of the adopted shaping technologies on the evolution of BGMS10 bioactive glass suggests no change in the biological response compared to previous findings . Anyway, cell tests will be considered, in the near future, for further validation. New investigations will include also the effect of secondary phases, which may benefit, in their stability, from the low sintering temperature. In particular, further studies will concern the use of BGMS10 mixed with hydroxylapatite powders, already tested for the manufacturing of dense discs .\n\n【33】4. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【34】The present study confirmed that BGMS10 bioactive glass, due to its characteristic processing window, could be applied for the manufacturing of highly porous open-celled components without viscous collapse. The viscous flow of BGMS10, although controlled, was effective in providing some healing of cracks developed upon firing of scaffolds with non-stochastic porosity due to the debinding of a commercial photocurable binder. The adopted digital light processing technique allowed for the easy obtainment of samples with different designs (to be further explored in the future). As an alternative to the printed scaffolds, open-celled foams (i.e. structures with stochastic porosity) could be obtained by a facile gel casting method, based on the activation of an aqueous suspension of glass powders, with a strong organic base. The gelation, unlike in previous experiments concerning the activation by means of inorganic bases (alkali hydroxides), had no impact on both chemistry and sintering of BGMS10.\n\n【35】The authors thank Anna Silvia Pianalto for the experimental assistance.\n\n【36】For this paper, E.B. and V.C. formulated research ideas, supervised the experiment on porous BGMS10 glass materials, and planned the structure of the article.

{"seq_id": "58dec63c-28a1-454b-8020-1fbd8c78466d", "title": "", "text": "【0】Systematic reviews of high-quality randomised controlled trials are crucial in evidence-based medicine (EBM), as they are particularly useful for overcoming the difficulties faced by clinicians when they wish to extract and analyse dates to guide their practice. Systematic reviews are of special value in aggregating and synthesising the findings of many separately conducted studies, sometimes with conflicting results . The purpose of the preferred reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (SRMA) guidelines is to aid researchers in the reporting of SRMA (; ). When a review makes an effort to comprehensively identify and trace all of the literature on a given topic (also referred to as a systematic literature review), meta-analysis is a particular statistical strategy for bringing together the results of several studies to produce a single estimate .\n\n【1】Numerous reports and books have been published that describe SRMA, but several predominant problems still exist, as stated below. Dispersed and fragmentary documents that describe SRMA are much more numerous than systematic and comprehensive reports. Additionally, the materials available that introduce the theory of SRMA are much more numerous than those addressing methodology, and the theoretical and methodological papers relevant to SRMA are often independent of each other. Hence, obtaining comprehensive collections of the materials related to SRMA is time-consuming work.The articles and books related to SRMA focus primarily on techniques, but not practices, necessitating the need for a strong background in fields such as mathematics, statistics and computer science. For non-technical readers and the majority of biologists and clinicians, these materials are daunting and will lead to a natural aversion to meta-analysis, thus hindering the wide application of SRMA.Biomarkers (especially disease markers) have been widely applied in biological and clinical analyses. The characteristic of a single marker are usually reported in many articles, and an emergent task is the integration of the effect sizes of markers (i.e. sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic/screening marker or the hazard ratio (HR) and its variance, SE or CI as a prognostic/monitoring marker) using SRMA. Nevertheless, according to our investigations, few articles and software tools are available that fully elaborate a procedure to combine the effect sizes of markers.\n\n【2】To address the above problems, we collected various materials and compiled a protocol using non-technical language as much as possible to guide common audiences in a step-by-step manner to realise SRMA, aiming at effect sizes of biomarkers with zero barriers. Our goal is to make SRMA accessible to most audiences, including biologists, clinicians and novices. We believe that investigators who read our paper will benefit from our protocol.\n\n【3】In this article, given that our protocol only focuses on SRMA of biomarker test accuracy, the following descriptions are not strictly in accordance with the above-mentioned general eight-step method. Based on the characteristics of the effect size of the accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic tests, we provide a five-step workflow.\n\n【4】Steps for SRMA of biomarkers\n============================\n\n【5】Search strategy\n---------------\n\n【6】The goal of the literature search is to be sufficiently exhaustive to develop a comprehensive list of potentially relevant studies. The first step in a meta-analysis is to find all of the pertinent articles on your topic. Important sources of information for meta-analyses include MEDLINE , EMBASE , OvidSP  and CancerLit . The Cochrane Collaboration Controlled Trials Register, established in 1993, is also an important source of studies for a meta-analysis. It includes all of the controlled trials in the MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as the results of manual searches conducted by Cochrane Collaboration volunteers of thousands of journals not indexed by MEDLINE or EMBASE. Before applying the literature search strategy, the basic information and search syntax should be mastered; key words related to your topic should be listed; and the 'associated words\\' for each key word must also be prepared (see  and Literature Searching and Systematic Reviews通用删除7(英):<u> (2013)</u> for more details and  as an example in [Supplementary Materials]).\n\n【7】Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n--------------------------------\n\n【8】Biomarkers are commonly categorised into four types: screening, diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring (surveillance). The first two types of markers are assessed based on sensitivity and specificity in most cases, while prognostic and monitoring markers are estimated based on the HR and its variance or standard error (SE) because they are time-to-event markers. Once the author of a meta-analysis has assembled a large number of studies, it is important to select the right ones. Which studies are included or excluded depends on various factors, such as whether or not there is sufficient information in a study to conduct an analysis, in addition to the study design, dosage used in the study, sample size, patient age, and even the year of the study. The following general criteria are provided only for reference: The study should be an original report (i.e. letters, editorials, case reports, tutorials and reviews are excluded), and both English and non-English studies should be included in case of a publication bias.The study should assess the ability of one or more markers to detect the presence of a particular disease.The study should provide sufficient data to allow estimation of a marker\\'s accuracy, for a diagnostic marker, the study must directly or indirectly provide at least four values, which are the following: the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN), to (re)construct a two-by-two table. 删除21:<u></u> For a prognostic marker, the study must directly or indirectly provide at least two values, the HR, and its variance and/or SE and/or confidence interval (CI). 删除21:<u></u>Combination marker and review articles are excluded.If multiple papers are published based on the same or overlapping data sets, then only the paper with the largest number of specimens, the most detailed results and the longest follow-up time is included.\n\n【9】A minimum of two reviewers perform a first-stage screening of titles and abstracts based on the research question and the study design, population, intervention and outcome to be studied. Based on the initial screening, selected full-text articles are obtained for the second-stage screening. Including two reviewers minimises the introduction of bias by either reviewer. Any study identified by either reviewer should be included. Using the full text, a second-stage screening is performed by at least two reviewers. The studies selected are then submitted for data extraction.\n\n【10】Data extraction\n---------------\n\n【11】Once an appropriate group of studies has been identified, the relevant data from candidate studies must be correctly extracted. To minimise errors, the following conventions should be considered:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> all reviewers must be trained under a consensus standard and then practice using several articles for 'calibration\\'通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> a consensus form or database that constrains entries to the expected range should be determined in advance;通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> at least two independent reviewers should check and extract data from a given article, and if the extracted data are not same, conflicts are resolved by reaching a consensus; and通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u> to prevent bias creeping into a meta-analysis, the reviewers should not be biased in favor of (or against) well-known researchers or prominent journals as far as possible.\n\n【12】For studies related to biomarkers, the reviewers should also pay attention to the following matters in addition to the preceding items. Among the four types of markers, screening and diagnostic markers mainly focus on sensitivity and specificity, while prognostic and monitoring markers are usually focused on the HR and its variance, SE or CI. Consequently, we will classify the markers into two different categories and describe how to abstract relevant information:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> if more than one marker is used in a given study, then the relevant data for each eligible marker must be individually extracted;通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> if one marker has multiple functions (i.e. one marker for one disease is used for screening, diagnosis, prognosis and/or monitoring), then the data sets corresponding to multiple functions must be extracted separately; and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> if there are multiple markers and diseases addressed in one study, then only the relevant data from the marker(s) corresponding to each disease of interest for the author(s) should be extracted.\n\n【13】For screening or diagnostic markers For diagnostic (or screening) markers, the data abstraction phase involves an assessment of study quality.  proposed a set of criteria for Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) that applies well to diagnostic marker studies . Data extraction 删除21:<u></u> with QUADAS assessment is often completed at the same time.\n\n【14】For prognostic or monitoring markers In contrast, data extraction and conversion for prognostic (or monitoring) markers are much more complex than for diagnostic markers because prognostic markers provide time-to-event data, which indicate the distinctions between the two groups of studies, and time to event needs to be scrutinised very carefully since the data may not only be right censored (patient was not followed until the event), but also left censored (patients were not all followed starting from a comparable point). Meta-analyses of this type of marker often require one of two kinds of data, that is, the log of the HR (namely, log~e~(HR)) and its variance or SE or the HR and its CI. For major prognostic marker studies, the two kinds of data cannot be extracted directly.  presented a series of simple methods to extract relevant data from publications with the aim of performing a meta-analysis of survival-type data. The methods focus on approaches for extracting these data from publications and are illustrated throughout this publication with real examples.  summarised 11 methods 删除21:<u></u> that are available for directly or indirectly estimating these data and the approximate normal log~e~(HR) distribution for large samples. In addition,  provided step-by-step guidance for how to calculate an HR and the associated statistics for individual trials, according to the information presented in the trial report.\n\n【15】Statistical methods\n-------------------\n\n【16】When studies used a similar design, we often combine the information they provide to increase precision and to investigate consistencies and discrepancies between the results. There has been great growth in this kind of analysis in several fields in recent years, particularly in medicine. In medicine, such studies usually involve controlled therapeutic trials. We apply the same principles in any scientific area, such as epidemiology, psychology or educational research. The essence of meta-analysis is obtaining a single estimate of the effect size from each similar study. There are many issues and controversies regarding meta-analysis data. First, we have to define two important terms, homogeneity and heterogeneity, to describe the degree of between-study variability in a group of studies. Fixed-effect models consider only within-study variability. The assumption is that studies use identical methods, patients and measurements; that they should produce identical results; and that any differences are only due to within-study variation. Random-effect models consider both the between-study and within-study variability. It is assumed that studies provide a random sample from the universe of all possible studies. If the studies are heterogeneous, then a random-effect model is applied for meta-analysis of the effect size in a group of studies; otherwise, a fixed-effect model is selected 删除21:<u></u>. A meta-analysis will customarily include a forest plot, in which the results from each study are displayed as a square and a horizontal line, representing the intervention effect estimated together with its CI. The area of the square reflects the weight that the study contributes to the meta-analysis. The combined-effects estimate and its CI are represented by a diamond. Biomarkers generally include screening, diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring markers. The first two types of markers correspond to diagnostic tests, and the last two provide time-to-event data. In meta-analyses of the two kinds of tests, there are significant differences in terms of both the combined objects and methods. Hence, descriptions of the two kinds of meta-analyses are provided below.\n\n【17】Analysis of diagnostic (or screening) test accuracy. The meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy represents an area of growing interest. These analyses often consist of three steps: assessment of study quality, creation of forest plots for sensitivity and specificity for each study, and summarisation of estimates of sensitivity and specificity using two types of models.\n\n【18】Quality assessment for diagnostic articles: Quality assessment is as important in systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies as it is in any other type of review, and the methodological quality of each study was assessed as recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. These recommendations were adapted from the QUADAS guidelines (; ). All of the criteria were classified as Yes, No or Unclear based on information available in this publication 删除21:<u></u>. The studies were judged according to the data used for the meta-analysis, which may not include all of the data available in the publication.\n\n【19】Meta-analysis of the accuracy of diagnostic tests: Meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy present many challengers:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> even in the simplest case, a minimum of two summary statistics (sensitivity and specificity) must be addressed simultaneously;通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> meta-analysis methods allow studies to be combined that have applied tests at different thresholds; and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> random-effect methods are recommended when data are heterogeneous (this is the rule for diagnostic studies). Therefore, in a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy, two analysis steps must be completed:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> forest plots for pooling the sensitivity and specificity of all of the selected studies are first created; and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> two statistical methods to calculate summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity are proposed to account for the correlation between sensitivity and specificity across studies caused by the relationship between sensitivity and specificity within each study . The two statistical methods, that is, the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model  and bivariate model , are statistically rigorous .\n\n【20】Meta-analysis of the accuracy of prognostic (or monitoring) tests. For prognostic (monitoring) markers, as described above, there are two types of extracted data: the HR and its CI (lower limit and upper limit); and log~e~(HR) and its variance (var\\[log~e~(HR)\\]) or standard error (SE\\[log~e~(HR)\\]=the reciprocal of the square root of var\\[log~e~(HR)\\]). Among the existing meta-analysis software tools, RevMan 5.1 ( and MetaDisc 1.4  cannot be used to implement a meta-analysis of the accuracy of prognostic tests. The mada package in the R language can be used to perform meta-analysis of prognostic test accuracy, but the R language requires complete user-entry of codes. In contrast, the mode of operation of STATA involves an interface of window plus commands that can be used by common audiences, making the performance of a meta-analysis using STATA 删除21:<u></u> much easier than using the R language. Next, we will use non-technical language to interpret how to perform a meta-analysis of the accuracy of prognostic tests.\n\n【21】Meta-analysis of prognostic test accuracy: Meta-analysis is a two-stage process involving the estimation of an appropriate summary statistic for each of a set of studies, followed by the calculation of a weighted average of these statistics across the studies .\n\n【22】The summary statistics from each study can be combined using a variety of meta-analytical methods, which are classified as fixed-effect models in which studies are weighted according to the amount of information they contain, or random-effects models, which incorporate an estimate of between-study variation (heterogeneity) in the weighting. A meta-analysis will customarily include a forest plot, where the results from each study are displayed as a square and a horizontal line, representing the intervention effect estimate together with its CI. The area of the square reflects the weight that the study contributes to the meta-analysis. The combined-effect estimate and its CI are represented by a diamond. Here, we present updates to the metan command in STATA to perform a meta-analysis of prognostic test accuracy. metan provides methods for the meta-analysis of studies with two groups, and either fixed-effect or random-effect models can be fitted . The following is the syntax for metan: metan \\[varlist\\] \\[option\\]. In [Supplementary Materials] document, we used two different data types as examples 删除21:<u></u> to present the metan command for the meta-analysis of prognostic test accuracy.\n\n【23】Publication bias regarding prognostic test accuracy: Publication bias is the phenomenon of studies with uninteresting or unfavorable results being less likely to be published than those with more favorable results . If a publication bias exists, then the published literature is a biased sample of all studies on a topic, and any meta-analysis based on it will be similarly biased. Funnel plots are commonly used to investigate publication and related biases in meta-analyses . metabias performs the ) adjusted rank correlation test for publication bias as well as the  regression asymmetry test for publication bias. As options, it provides a funnel graph of the data or the regression asymmetry plot. The Begg adjusted rank correlation test is more popular in common applications for publication bias analysis 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【24】Non-parametric trim and fill analysis of publication bias. Meta-analysis is a popular technique for numerically synthesising information from published studies. One of the many concerns that must be addressed when performing a meta-analysis is whether selective publication of studies could lead to a bias in estimating the overall meta-analytical effect and in the inferences derived from the analysis. If a publication bias appears to exist, then it is desirable to consider what the unbiased data set might look like and then to re-estimate the overall meta-analytical effect after any apparently 'missing\\' studies are included. Duval and Tweedie\\'s 'non-parametric 'trim and fill\\' method\\' is designed to meet these objectives . The command metatrim is used to implement the Duval and Tweedie non-parametric 'trim and fill\\' method 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【25】Cumulative meta-analysis of prognostic test accuracy: In a cumulative meta-analysis , the pooled estimate of the treatment effect is updated each time the results of a new study are published. This makes it possible to track the accumulation of evidence related to the effect of a particular treatment. The command metacum performs a cumulative meta-analysis (using fixed- or random-effect models), and optionally, the results can be graphed. A user supplies the preceding two types of data on prognostic test accuracy. The full metacum command is very similar to the metan command. The detailed commands are as follows:\n\n【26】metacum lnhr lnll lnul, eform label (namevar=studyid) title (\"random-effect model\") boxsca (0.9) random effect (Hazard Ratio)\n\n【27】(The output and forest plot are omitted)\n\n【28】metacum logehr selogehr, eform effect (Hazard Ratio) title (\"Fixed-effect meta-analysis\") boxsca(0.9) label (namevar=paperno)\n\n【29】(The output and forest plot are omitted).\n\n【30】Subgroup for prognostic test accuracy: Dividing results between different types of patients and outcomes requires cautious interpretation. If these analyses are to be conducted, then more subgroup analyses must be performed. It is often more reliable to assume that the overall result is as good an estimate (if not a better one) for a particular group of patients than that obtained by examining those patients within the meta-analysis. In prognostic test data, it is very common for the data to be classified into disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) subgroups, as in the data in Example data 1. In fact, performing both subgroup analyses in meta-analysis in STATA is very simple, and a major addition to metan is the ability to perform stratified or subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses in meta-analysis may be used to investigate the possibility that treatment effects vary between subgroups. Subgrouping in meta-analysis can be completed by adding one option: by (grouping variable name), to all meta-analysis commands for diagnostic or prognostic test accuracy (all examples are omitted).\n\n【31】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【32】In EBM, SRMA have been widely applied in biological and medical research. Moreover, the most popular application of meta-analysis in this field may be to assess diagnostic (sensitivity and specificity) and prognostic (the HR and its precision) test accuracy. With the growth of clinical renal studies, an increasing number of these types of summary publications will certainly become available to nephrologists, researchers, administrators and policy makers who seek to keep abreast of recent developments. To maximise the advantages of these studies, it is necessary for these individuals to have a simplified version of a protocol to aid them in rapidly conducting meta-analyses of the accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic tests. In this article, we first presented a simplified and practical protocol to guide non-professional academicians and clinicians to perform systematic reviews of diagnostic and prognostic accuracies in a step-by-step manner, and we confirmed that once an individual studies our article, even a novice, they are soon able to accomplish complex systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The protocols have been successfully tested by clinicians without meta-analysis experience.\n\n【33】[Supplementary Information] accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "ae93f77c-e39f-4e37-917b-97750756b2db", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction \n============\n\n【1】In recent years, a number of small molecules have been identified that control stem cell differentiation and/or cell reprogramming. Surprisingly, only a few metabolites have been identified in this context, possibly because their relevance has been underappreciated. The \"physiological\" compounds identified so far include epigenetic modifiers or regulators of the cell energy/redox status acting on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. For example, saturated fatty acids and the acylcarnitines were shown to improve embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation . Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, increases the efficiency of cell reprogramming by inhibiting histone deacetylases . Finally, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), a redox controller and a cofactor for histone demethylases, is a key regulator of stem cell differentiation and reprogramming . However, it has recently become evident that also some naturally occurring amino acids can regulate stem cell behavior. Indeed, it has been shown that通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> ESC self-renewal depends on L-threonine catabolism  and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> L-proline (L-Pro) forces ESCs toward an epiblast stem cell (EpiSC)-like state  and regulates ESC metastability . L-Pro is particularly interesting because its mitochondrial oxidative catabolism is linked to cell survival/cell death in cancer cells  and to life span extension in C. elegans . Here, we provide evidence that physiological concentrations of L-Pro are sufficient to convert ESCs into mesenchymal-like, highly motile, invasive pluripotent stem cells, which acquire metastatic potential in vivo. This previously unforeseen embryonic-stem-cell-to-mesenchymal-like transition (esMT) is fully reversible either after L-Pro withdrawal or by addition of vitamin C. Most remarkably, L-Pro extensively remodels both the transcriptome and the epigenome, thus acting as a potent signaling metabolite in pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【2】Results \n=======\n\n【3】L-Pro Modifies ESC Morphology Inducing Extensive Cytoskeletal Rearrangements \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Mouse ESCs grow as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent flat colonies in the presence of L-Pro . Examining different growth conditions, we found that this L-Pro-induced morphological transition markedly increased by lowering the cell-plating density to 50 ESCs/cm^2^ ( available online). Notably, clonal L-Pro-induced cell (PiC) colonies showed three distinctive zones (A):通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> a \"central zone\" or \"colony core\" consisting of polygonal-shaped, tightly adherent cells;通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> a \"peripheral zone\" at the external margin of the colony, consisting of less-cohesive spindle-shaped cells; and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> a \"surrounding zone,\" forming a crown of mesenchymal-like cells scattered around the colony. These latter cells were characterized by a large nucleus with prominent nucleoli and a highly polarized mesenchymal shape with large and flat lamellipodial protrusions extending at the leading edge and needle-like trailing structures on the rear (A). Alterations of cell shape and the formation of lamellipodial protrusions are primarily driven by actin cytoskeleton remodeling . Accordingly, we found that mesenchymal-like PiCs displayed long and polarized F-actin stress fibers frequently terminating in large and mature focal adhesion complexes. Presumably, as a consequence of this actin cytoskeleton-driven shape transition, also the microtubules organized into an extended network typical of mesenchymal motile cells (B and 1C). Thus, ESCs undergo a morphological transformation, which is reminiscent of changes associated with the acquisition of persistent and directional cell locomotory properties.\n\n【5】L-Pro Induces a Motile Phenotype in ESCs \n----------------------------------------\n\n【6】To test directly the possibility that L-Pro is sufficient to induce changes in adhesive and motile properties of stem cells, the ESC-to-PiC phenotypic transition was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy (D; [Movies S1], [S2], and [S3]). Control ESCs formed compact colonies from which, occasionally, individual cells in direct contact with the substrate extended transient and short-lived cytoplasmic protrusions that appeared to direct the collective mode of locomotion of the entire colony 删除30:<u>([Movie S1])</u>. Cell divisions were visualized as transient swellings or \"bubbles\" that sporadically protruded from the colony. Within 1--3 days of plating, L-Pro-treated ESCs formed, as expected, spherical colonies; however, by day 3 onward, single, highly motile cells started to scatter, detaching from the colony margins through the extension of highly dynamic and prominent protrusions (D; [Movies S2] and [S3]). Importantly, these now freely motile, single PiCs maintained the ability to divide and frequently re-established dynamic and reversible cell-cell contacts with cells in the colony core. Consistent with the acquisition of directed cell motility, PiCs, but not ESCs, were able to migrate efficiently through porous membranes in transwell migration assays in response to gradients of fetal bovine serum (FBS) or toward different chemoattractants, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) (E and 1F). Thus, L-Pro is sufficient to promote the transition of ESCs toward a motile mesenchymal-like phenotype.\n\n【7】L-Pro Induces Remodeling of the ESC Transcriptome \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】To elucidate whether a diverse transcriptional program is the basis of the morphological and motility differences between ESCs and PiCs, we compared their gene expression profiles. We found ∼1,500 L-Pro-dependent, differentially regulated protein-coding genes (A and 2B; ). Gene ontology analysis revealed that L-Pro-regulated genes were functionally very diverse (C), but the pluripotency-associated factors (Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) remained, as expected, unchanged. Interestingly, whereas genes involved in L-Pro uptake (Slc38a2), synthesis (Aldh18a and P5cr), or catabolism (Prodh) were not affected , both procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer (Pcolce) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4/CD26), which regulate L-Pro recycling, were significantly downregulated. DPP4, which cleaves X-Pro dipeptides generating free L-Pro, was the most L-Pro-repressed protease . In contrast, expression of the DPP4 inhibitor, glypican 3 (Gpc3), was induced. Thus, ESCs respond to increased extracellular levels of free L-Pro by repressing genes involved in L-Pro recycling. Remarkably, PiCs and EpiSCs  shared 33% of differentially expressed protein-coding genes with respect to ESCs (D). However, Cer1, Asb4, Foxa2, Gata6, Sox17, and Stra8, which are among the most upregulated genes in EpiSCs, did not change in PiCs. Similarly, the developmental pluripotency-associated genes Dppa3, Dppa4, and Dppa5 that are repressed in EpiSCs were, instead, expressed at comparable levels in PiCs and ESCs . Moreover, the transcription factor Rex1 (Zfp42), which is silenced in epiblast cells just after implantation and is strongly repressed in EpiSCs, was only weakly downregulated in PiCs . Notably, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PiCs, like ESCs, were REX1 positive (≥95%) and that REX1 expression persisted in the mesenchymal-like PiCs scattered around the colony (A and S2B). These data indicate that the morphological changes of PiCs are likely driven by a specific transcriptional program that is significantly different from the program induced in EpiSCs. Indeed, a significant set of genes regulated by L-Pro were either transcription factors or cofactors (∼12%; C; ), among them several Krüppel-like factors (Klfs), which are key regulators of cell differentiation and reprogramming. Of note, whereas Klf2, Klf4, and Klf5 were all downregulated by L-Pro, the expression of Klf6 and Klf7 increased. Interestingly, PiCs and Klf2/Klf4/Klf5 triple knockdown ESCs  shared ∼29% of differentially expressed genes (D), thus suggesting that modulation of Klfs might be relevant for PiC specification.\n\n【9】Gene ontology analysis of the PiC expression profile denoted a consistent overrepresentation of genes in six Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, all related to cell shape and motility (E). In keeping with the altered cytoskeleton architecture, 9% of L-Pro-regulated genes were structurally and/or functionally related to the cytoskeleton, whereas 12.8% were related to cell adhesion, cell junction, or cell motility (C; ). In line with the idea that cell motility/invasion is associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, ∼11% of the L-Pro-regulated genes were extracellular proteins, including secreted proteases, as well as modulators of their proteolytic activity . These significant sets of genes regulated by L-Pro likely define the molecular signature that is required to direct and sustain the acquisition of the PiC motile phenotype. The PiC expression profile was also enriched in genes associated with six cancer-related KEGG pathways (E; ), among which there are members of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activator (JAK/STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, as well as the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pathway . Collectively, these findings support the possibility that L-Pro may promote the acquisition of features typical of invasive cancer cells.\n\n【10】PiCs Are Invasive and Metastatic Pluripotent Stem Cells \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】To directly test PiC invasiveness, we first evaluated the effect of L-Pro on cell invasion in transwell assays. PiCs, but not ESCs, were able to migrate through Matrigel-coated transwells. More relevantly, \\>65% of migrating PiCs efficiently invaded a three-dimensional-Matrigel plug (A). Interestingly, the migratory and invasive properties of PiCs at 500 cells/cm^2^ (PiCs^500^) were strongly reduced compared to PiCs^50^ generated at clonal density, i.e. 50 cells/cm^2^ (≥70%; B). This latter finding supports the key role of the seeding density in defining the motile PiC phenotype. Moreover, PiCs generated from the feeder-independent E14Tg2a ESCs showed a highly motile/invasive phenotype, thus ruling out the possibility of an ESC line-specific effect of L-Pro .\n\n【12】We then asked if the migratory and invasive phenotype of PiCs correlated with metastatic potential in vivo. To this end, enhanced GFP (EGFP)-labeled ESCs or PiCs were injected intravenously into immunodeficient mice. The metastatic B16-BL6 melanoma cells were used as a positive control. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after injection, and the histology of liver and lung tissues was examined for macroscopic abnormalities. Whereas the ESC-injected mice showed morphologically normal tissues with no evidence of tumor masses, large teratomas were clearly visible in the lungs of PiC-injected mice (C). Moreover, teratomas were EGFP-positive confirming that they originated from the exogenous cells (D). These data provide direct evidence that PiCs have acquired metastatic properties and indicate that L-Pro-induced stem cells acquire two of the most decisive pathological traits of the so-called \"migrating cancer stem cells,\" i.e. stemness and invasiveness.\n\n【13】L-Pro Induces an Embryonic-Stem-Cell-to-Mesenchymal-like Transition \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Our data are also consistent with the possibility that L-Pro-induced morphological and motility phenotypes contribute to the acquisition of cell plasticity, likewise canonical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) . Thus, we hypothesized that L-Pro might trigger an EMT-like process in ESCs, namely an esMT. EMT is characterized by the induction of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin (N-cad), vimentin (Vim), and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (Mmp2), and the concurrent downregulation of E-cadherin (E-cad), a major component of cell adherens junctions . N-cad, Vim, and Mmp2 were all upregulated in L-Pro-treated ESCs (A). The transcription factor brachyury (T) was also strongly induced (A and 4D). Notably, the expression of T has recently been associated with EMT during metastasis . N-cad transcripts were detected from day 2 onward during the esMT, whereas T transcripts were induced at day 3 (B), in a timeframe that correlated with the onset of the motile phenotype (D). At the protein level, both N-CAD and T accumulated later on (C). E-CAD, instead, was expressed at comparable levels in ESCs and PiCs (E and 4F). Accordingly, the expression of the E-cad transcriptional repressors, Snail and Slug, were not significantly altered (E). Nevertheless, altered trafficking and cell surface distribution of the E-CAD protein can also contribute to its functional downregulation . In line with this notion, we observed a reduction of E-CAD protein at cell-cell junctions, accompanied by an accumulation of E-CAD in perinuclear vesicular-like compartments from day 3 of the esMT (G and 4H).\n\n【15】To assess if L-Pro-induced esMT might impact on the differentiation potential, we compared both the cardiac and neuronal differentiation kinetics of PiCs and ESCs. Despite the fact that PiCs, but not ESCs, expressed high levels of the panmesodermal marker brachyury, the kinetics of cardiac markers expression were comparable in the two lines (A). On the other hand, whereas neuronal and glia markers displayed similar levels in PiCs and ESCs, their kinetic of expression was delayed in PiCs (B). These data suggest that L-Pro-induced esMT does not promote or anticipate cardiac differentiation, whereas it slightly delays neural differentiation. Finally, to identify critical factors involved in the L-Pro-induced esMT, we focused our attention on the protein kinase domain-containing, cytoplasmic (PKDCC) kinase. Pkdcc was the most highly upregulated protein kinase-coding gene in L-Pro-treated ESCs and was induced from day 2 onward (I; ). Pkdcc is required for the round-to-flat shape transition of chondrocytes occurring during bone development  and is involved in the control of protein export from the Golgi . Of note, E-CAD accumulated in the Golgi complex in PiCs (H). Interestingly, we observed that transient Pkdcc-silencing inhibited the acquisition of the flat morphology in L-Pro-treated cells (J). Thus, L-Pro is sufficient to promote the esMT that is dependent, at least in part, on Pkdcc.\n\n【16】L-Pro Alters the Epigenetic Signature of ESCs \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【17】To gain clues as to the mechanism through which the simple exposure to a nonessential amino acid induces dramatic changes in gene transcription and ESC behavior, we hypothesized that L-Pro might act as an epigenetic modifier. Consistent with this idea, the silencing of Jmjd1a, a H3K9 demethylase, forces ESCs toward a PiC-like phenotype, i.e. flat morphology, sensitivity to trypsin digestion and upregulation of Fgf5 and T . We therefore tested whether L-Pro is sufficient to alter methylation levels of various critical histone lysine residues in ESCs. L-Pro augmented the global levels of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, as well as the levels of H3K36me3 (A, left panel). In contrast, the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were unaltered (A, right panel). More relevantly, L-Pro triggered a genome-wide reprogramming of H3K9 and H3K36 methylation status. H3K9 methylation was significantly altered at 16,621 sites, with the highest increase in methylation occurring at noncoding intergenic regions of the genome (B, [S5]A, and S5B). Genes showing PiCs-enriched H3K9me3 occupancy at proximal and distal regulatory regions are reported in C. H3K9 methylation status changed in a significant fraction (27%) of the 1,521 L-Pro-deregulated genes (p \\< 0.05; C, upper panel). Moreover, those genes displaying a modified H3K9 methylation status were enriched in pathways relevant for the esMT process (C, lower panel). Consistently, genes downregulated in PiCs displayed an increase in H3K9me3 at regulatory regions (D). Noteworthy, repetitive elements were frequently detected at sites displaying increased H3K9me3, suggesting an induced local heterochromatin spreading into nearby genes that influences their expression (D). Remarkably, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed the highest H3K9me3 enrichment at constitutive heterochromatin, i.e. pericentromeres and gene deserts, indicating that L-Pro induces heterochromatin reorganization toward more dense structures in the nucleus (B and S5D).\n\n【18】Differentially expressed genes that were not altered in the H3K9me3 profile might be regulated by additional epigenetic marks. Consistently, ChIP-PCR analysis revealed a significant enrichment of the H3K27me3-repressive mark at promoters of L-Pro-downregulated genes (E). Conversely, L-Pro-upregulated genes showed reduced levels of H3K27me3 and increased levels of the H3K4me3-permissive mark. Consistent with a global H3K9 methylation gain, we detected an overall increase of H3K9 methylation at both promoter and gene body regions (E).\n\n【19】We also investigated the whole-genome profile of H3K36me3 and observed 8,648 significant peaks altered by L-Pro treatment (E). Intragenic regions of differentially methylated clusters of loci were H3K36me3-increased in PiCs relative to ESCs (F), and a significant fraction (41%; p \\< 0.05) of PiC-specific genes showed significant H3K36me3 changes according to the transcriptional status (F and 5G). Notably, L-Pro induced H3K36me3 enrichment at noncoding regions, in line with recent evidence that H3K36me3 might promote heterochromatin formation (G; ). Collectively, our findings support a role of L-Pro as a genome-wide inducer of H3K9 and H3K36 methylation in pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【20】Vitamin C Reverts the PiC Phenotype and Induces H3K9 and H3K36 Demethylation \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Increasing evidence indicates that demethylation of H3K36 and H3K9 is required for an efficient somatic/pre-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) to iPSC transition . This crucial step in cell reprogramming is controlled by vitamin C, which is a cofactor of H3K9 jumonji demethylases  and a key regulator of stem cell differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming . We thus tested the effect of vitamin C on the PiC phenotype. Remarkably, vitamin C almost completely reverted the esMT at the morphological level, promoting a mesenchymal-like-to-embryonic-stem-cell transition (MesT), even in the presence of L-Pro. Remarkably, vitamin C mimicked the phenotype caused by L-Pro removal (A). To rule out the possibility that vitamin C induced selection of ESCs rather than PiC-to-ESC reversion, freshly generated PiCs (P~0~) were directly plated at low density and the frequency of domed and flat colonies was assessed in the different culture conditions. When PiCs were plated in the presence of L-Pro, about 10% of the colonies showed a domed phenotype (ESCs; A and S6B), which corresponds to the degree of heterogeneity observed in freshly generated PiCs. Indeed, PiCs culture consistently display 10%--15% of domed (ESCs) and 85%--90% of flat (PiCs) colonies . Remarkably, when PiCs were plated either in the absence of L-Pro or in the presence of L-Pro plus vitamin C (A and S6B), the percentage of domed colonies (ESCs) increased up to 50%. Importantly, the total number of colonies generated in the different culture conditions was comparable. Moreover, the migratory and invasive properties of the vitamin C-treated PiCs (ESCs^Rev^) resembled the one of ESCs (B). Finally, both the frequency and the timing of appearance of flat colonies were comparable in L-Pro-treated ESCs and ESCs^Rev^ (C and 6D), thus ruling out the possibility that ESCs^Rev^ were primed for PiC formation. All together these findings provide evidence that vitamin C reverts both the morphological and the functional phenotype of PiCs toward that of ESCs. At the molecular level, vitamin C repressed L-Pro-induced T expression and reverted L-Pro-induced downregulation of Inhbb expression (E). Furthermore, vitamin C inhibited the L-Pro-induced increase in H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels to an extent that was comparable to that observed following L-Pro withdrawal. Thus, vitamin C induces the MesT by remodeling the epigenetic signature of PiCs (F). To get insight into the epigenetic mechanism underlying vitamin C-induced reversion of the PiC phenotype, we knocked down Jmjd1a. To this end, PiCs were transfected with either shRNA constructs targeting different regions of the transcript (Jmjd1a- shRNA1 and shRNA2) or control shRNAs (Jmjd1a- shRNA1mut and Luciferase shRNA), as previously described . Of note, neither the morphology nor the expression of pluripotency markers was altered in Jmjd1a KD (≥70% gene silencing; D) compared to controls PiCs . We thus plated Jmjd1a KD and control PiCs in the presence or the absence of vitamin C and analyzed the frequency of flat and domed colonies. The frequency of appearance of domed colonies was nearly identical in vitamin C-treated Jmjd1a KD and control PiCs (E). Notably, the effect of vitamin C mimicked the one achieved by L-Pro removal (E). These data indicate that downregulation of Jmjd1a is not sufficient to prevent vitamin-C-dependent PiC-to-ESC reversion. Remarkably, neither glutathione nor N-acetyl-L-cysteine were able to revert PiCs toward an ESC phenotype (C), thus excluding the possibility that vitamin C acts in this process through its antioxidant activity.\n\n【22】Discussion \n==========\n\n【23】How metabolites regulate stem cell biology represents a major challenge and is still poorly understood. Here, we uncover an unexpected role of L-Pro as a key regulator of mouse ESC migratory and invasive phenotype, revealing that L-Pro is a potent epigenetic modifier. L-Pro, and in particular its mitochondrial catabolism, has become an important area of study being at the crossroads of key metabolic pathways, including citric acid cycle, polyamines biosynthesis, and urea cycle . Despite that L-Pro is a nonessential amino acid , we demonstrate that the addition of L-Pro in ESC culture medium is sufficient to induce a previously unforeseen esMT, which converts compacted/clustered ESCs into scattered, freely motile pluripotent stem cells. Of note, this phenotype was not observed in previous studies , most likely because it markedly increased when ESCs are seeded at clonal density in the presence of L-Pro. Accordingly, PiCs generated at higher density (PiCs^500^) showed poor migratory and invasive properties compared to PiCs generated at clonal density (PiCs^50^) indicating that seeding density strongly influences the EMT-like phenotype of PiCs.\n\n【24】The L-Pro-induced esMT is accompanied by a global remodeling of the ESC transcriptome, which nicely correlates with the phenotypic variation observed. Indeed, genes involved in the control of cell cytoarchitecture, adhesion, and migration/invasiveness are largely affected by L-Pro. Notably, despite this extensive remodeling of the transcriptome, expression levels of the pluripotency-associated factors (Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) and the developmental pluripotency-associated gene Dppa3 (Stella) are comparable in PiCs and ESCs. Furthermore, PiCs, like ESCs, are REX1 (Zfp42)-positive (≥95%) and show similar in vitro differentiation kinetics. This molecular signature and the fact that PiCs strictly depend on LIF for self-renewal  suggest that they define a population of inner cell mass-like cells that have acquired a motile and invasive phenotype.\n\n【25】Interestingly, L-Pro-induced esMT is accompanied by a significant increase in H3K9 and H3K36 methylation levels as well as by a global remodeling of the H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 marks. This L-Pro-induced esMT is fully reversible either after L-Pro withdrawal or by addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), promoting a MesT and inducing the reduction of H3K9 and H3K36 methylation levels.\n\n【26】To the best of our knowledge, only three metabolites, L-threonine, butyrate, and vitamin C, have been identified so far that act as epigenetic modulators of ESC self-renewal and/or somatic cell reprogramming . Interestingly, L-threonine, which is the only amino acid among these metabolites, influences H3K4me3 by controlling the abundance of S-adenosylmethionine, leaving other lysine residues unaltered . This intriguing specificity is also exerted by L-Pro that conversely influences the global level of trimethylation of lysines K9 and K36, which would likely exert a wider effect on gene expression. This is consistent with the extensive molecular and phenotypic variations induced by L-Pro on ESCs, as, for instance, the striking acquisition of motility and invasiveness. Most remarkably, L-Pro-induced global increase of H3K9 and H3K36 trimethylation preferentially occurs at noncoding intergenic regions and constitutive heterochromatin. Whereas H3K9me3 is a well-known repressive heterochromatic mark, the H3K36me3 deposition within heterochromatin domains has only recently emerged. H3K36me3 might thus contribute to the establishment of a transcriptionally unfavorable chromatin conformation by recruiting repressive complexes . Our data suggest that L-Pro can induce heterochromatization, increasing H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 especially at pericentromeric and gene desert regions, and imply that there is a hierarchy of target chromatin regions and associated noncoding elements that are more sensitive to the effect of L-Pro in ESCs.\n\n【27】Thus, our findings add to the emerging evidence that metabolites are key mediators of epigenetic regulation of stem cell fate and strengthen the role of the amino acids in this process. Yet how metabolites control chromatin modifiers in space and time, translating a dynamic metabolic state into a histone code, is still a key unresolved question . Interestingly, it has been recently proposed that the concentration of metabolites and their biosynthetic enzymes may localize to chromatin subdomains promoting the clustering of relevant DNA and histone modifications at specific genomic loci . It is thus tempting to speculate that specific histone-modifying enzymes might sense the presence of L-Pro and eventually translate this signal into different histone maps. Interestingly, we have shown that vitamin C, which is a cofactor of the Jumonji-family histone demethylases, antagonizes the effect of L-Pro on H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels. Of note, knockdown of Jmjd1a (H3K9 demethylase) does not prevent vitamin C-induced PiC-to-ESC reversion. However, because many other vitamin C-regulated histone modifier enzymes might be involved in this process, further studies are needed to reveal its molecular nature.\n\n【28】We believe that our findings have several implications for stem cell biology. First, it has been shown that the reprogramming process initiates through a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)  and that vitamin C-dependent decrease of H3K9/H3K36 methylation levels promote somatic/pre-iPSC to iPSC transition . Thus L-Pro and vitamin C exert opposite effects on H3K9 and H3K36 methylation status, regulating antagonistic cellular processes relevant for cell reprogramming. Recently, it was reported that vitamin C also promotes Tet-mediated DNA demethylation . It will be thus interesting to investigate the effect of L-Pro on DNA methylation.\n\n【29】Second, the L-Pro/vitamin C-regulated esMT-MesT switch is reminiscent of the transient EMT-MET switch that has been proposed as a driving force of metastasis, largely influenced by microenvironment . Indeed, it is proposed that induction of EMT confers migrating properties to cancer stem cell . How this occurs is still poorly defined. Interestingly, the ECM is mostly composed of collagen (80%) and is considered as a reservoir of mobilizable L-Pro . Here, we suggest that L-Pro, which is released from ECM degradation during tumor invasion, may act as environmental cue of the EMT to control tumor dissemination. Moreover, L-Pro metabolism is dysregulated in cancer  and L-Pro synthesis is associated with tumor progression and aggressiveness , yet the mechanisms remain largely unsolved. Although much work remains to be carried out to assess the in vivo relevance of L-Pro as signal molecule, our findings contribute to elucidating its role in regulating stem cell behavior and provide insights into the mechanisms by which metabolites control stem cell fate.\n\n【30】Experimental Procedures \n=======================\n\n【31】Cell Cultures \n-------------\n\n【32】Wild-type TBV2 (129/SvP), β-actin/EGFP TBV2 and E14Tg2a (E14) mouse ESCs were cultured as described .

Bones and nails, eyes and kidneys are the systems commonly involved. Renal involvement is the most common and serious manifestation of the disease involving 40% of the affected individuals. LMX1B gene located in the chromosome 9 is considered to be responsible for the various manifestations of the disease. The management involves early identification of the systems involved and appropriate treatment.\n\n【2】Case report \n===========\n\n【3】A 22 year old young male from Nepal was symptomatic for the 2 months with intermittent nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and breathlessness. His symptoms increased progressively during past 10 days with facial puffiness, pedal edema, decreased urine output and breathlessness. He denied orthopnoea, PND and any symptoms suggestive of seizures, hematuria, pyuria, lithuria. There was no family history of similar illness. Ten years back he had a fall from height and fracture of spine for which an ORIF was done.\n\n【4】Assessment \n----------\n\n【5】A physical examination performed revealed a pulse rate of 86/ minute with a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg. He was pale and his jugular venous pressure was elevated to around 7cm. There was bilateral pitting pedal edema. He had deformed nails in all 10 fingers and toes more prominent in the thumbs . He had deformed knee joints along with fixed flexion deformity of bilateral hip joints. Examination of his chest revealed fine crepitations in the basal region. His cardiovascular system examination showed normal heart sounds with functional systolic murmur in the pulmonary area with no pericardial rub. His abdominal and CNS examinations were normal. Fundus examination showed grade II hypertensive retinopathy.\n\n【6】![Clinical picture showing dysplastic nails in all digits](PAMJ-09-31-g001)\n\n【7】He was worked up for his renal failure. His urea and creatinine were 20 mg% and 28% respectively. His initial ABG showed metabolic acidosis. His 24 hr urine protein revealed nephrotic range (3 g/ day) of proteinuria with no active sediments in the urine routine examination. His USG KUB revealed right kidney of 9.9 cm with ill defined corticomedullary junction a non-visualized left Kidney (ectopic / absent). X-Ray of B/L knee joint showed dysplastic patellae  and X-Ray of the pelvis showed B/L iliac horn . A computerised tomogram of B/L kidneys was done which revealed the presence of both shrunken left and right kidneys (7 cm each). Considering his entire clinical picture consisting of nephrotic range proteinuria, azotemia, uraemia, dystrophic nails, and deformed knee joints with dysplastic patella with iliac horn in the X-ray of pelvis, Nail patella syndrome was diagnosed.\n\n【8】![X-Ray of the knee showing absent of patella](PAMJ-09-31-g002)\n\n【9】![X-Ray of pelvis showing bilateral iliac horns](PAMJ-09-31-g003)\n\n【10】Management \n----------\n\n【11】This young male was managed with renal replacement therapy (RRT) initially in the form peritoneal dialysis later followed by hemodialysis. After RRT, he showed symptomatic improvement. He is being managed conservatively as a patient with Nail patella syndrome with chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis.\n\n【12】Discussion \n==========\n\n【13】Nail-patella syndrome (NPS) (otherwise known as Fong′s Disease, Hereditary Onychoosteodysplasia (HOOD) or Turner-Kieser Syndrome) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder related to ABO blood group. The gene responsible for nail- patella syndrome is located in chromosome 9q34 and is termed as LMX1B. This gene is responsible for the normal dorsoventral patterning of the limb and normal development of the glomerular basement membrane in the kidney . Being an autosomal dominant disorder, the chance to have an affected child is 50% per pregnancy. Though the incidence of disease varies, it is roughly estimated to occur in 1 in 50,000 newborns.\n\n【14】Nail- Patella syndrome is usually characterized by nail dysplasia, patellar apoplasia/hypoplasia, iliac horns, elbow dysplasia, and frequently primary open angle glaucoma and progressive nephropathy. The phenotypic expression of the disease varies greatly between each individual due to variable penetrance.\n\n【15】Nail-ostial manifestations \n--------------------------\n\n【16】Most of patients with Nail Patella Syndrome have affected fingernails, which may be partly or completely missing (80-100% of cases). Thumbs are affected severely as compared to other fingers, and the severity decreases in severity toward the little finger. The crescent \"moons\" at the base of the nail are often triangular. The distal most joint which is actually closer to the nail may not have creases over it. Sometimes, fingers might seem to be double-jointed. Some of these patients with Nail Patella Syndrome are unable to fully straighten their joint. Tendon and ligaments may be misplaced, and webbing sometimes forms around the elbow. One of the characteristic manifestations of nail patella syndrome is aplasia (absence) or hypoplasia (underdeveloped) patella. If patella is present, it will be hypoplastic, and it may be located more distally than usual leading to recurrent dislocation. The hypoplastic patella may be ovoid, triangular or irregular in shape. Abnormal projections of bone from the superior (upper) portion of both sides of the hip bone (bilateral iliac horns) are reported. These exostoses (′horns\\\") of the ilia are often evident. These \\\"horns\\\" are very specific to this disease, but are seen in only 30-70% of these patients. They may be visible, palpable or impalpable, depending on size. Other bony manifestations described are hypoplasia of the scapulae, talipes (club foot) or \"twisted feet\", hypoplasia of the first ribs, dislocation of the head of the radius, prominent outer clavicle, malformed sternum (Pectus Excavatum), scoliosis, and lordosis. There is also aplasia of pectoralis minor, biceps, triceps and quadriceps.\n\n【17】Kidney manifestations \n---------------------\n\n【18】The incidence of renal impairment in NPS is approximately 40% . This is one of the most serious manifestations of NPS. Though it is common in adults, it has been described to occur in children also. The clinical manifestations include protienuria with or without hematuria, and hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure can occur. The glomerular changes by light microscopy are quite non-specific, varying in degrees of focal and segmented sclerosis and often segmented thickening of the capillary wall. Sometimes, the microscopy reveals a unique lesion consisting of a moth-eaten appearance of the glomerular basement membrane. This condition is said to be a generalised disorder of the mesenchyme. The course is rather benign with renal failure a late feature. Annual urine screening is recommended. Kidney biopsy is rarely required to diagnose the disease. If a transplant is deemed necessary, it should be noted that recurrence after transplant does not happen.\n\n【19】Ophthalmological manifestations \n-------------------------------\n\n【20】It is not very late that researchers at the University of Michigan Health System have found strong evidence of a link between open angle glaucoma and NPS. Studies suggest indirect evidence that the genetic location of the two conditions may be located at the same chromosomal site. Based on this study, it was advisable to have eye check-up in these patients regularly. Other ocular abnormalities that have been reported are keratoconus, microcornea, microphakia, cataracts and ptosis\n\n【21】Other manifestations \n--------------------\n\n【22】Dental Problems, hyperthyroidism, irritable bowel syndrome, tilted uterus, smaller stature, and cleft lip/palate are some manifestations that are considered to occur in these patients with NPS.\n\n【23】Radiographic Features \n---------------------\n\n【24】Pelvis: Small iliac wings with bilateral horns (seen up to 70% of cases) arising from the central area of the iliac wings, directed posterolaterally, located at the site of attachment of gluteus medius muscles .\n\n【25】Limbs: Patellae may be absent or hypoplastic. They may be irregularly ossified or dislocated. Disproportionate prominence of medial condyle of femur may be seen. Radial head may show hypoplasia with lateral inclination of radial head which may be associated with radial subluxation or dislocation. Lateral humeral epicondyle and capitellum may be hypoplastic. Other features like clinodactyly, camptodactyly equinovalgus deformity of hind foot, calcaneovalgus deformity, forefoot supination and lateral subluxation of tarsal-metatarsal joints and ball-and-socket type of ankle joint may be seen .\n\n【26】Chest: Hypoplastic scapula with glenoid dysplasia, thickening and convexity of lateral border of scapula may be seen. A conical spine like projection may occasionally be seen in the lateral aspect of clavicle which is called \"clavicular horn\" .\n\n【27】Joints: Finger joints may show laxity with asymmetrical development of joint (hypoplasia or hyperplasia)\n\n【28】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【29】The multi system involvement of NPS clearly indicates the need for the physicians of different specialties to have a thorough knowledge about the syndrome to appropriately identify the condition and also for the early detection of other system involvement to prevent the associated complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Impurities in ppm concentration in bulk can segregate under high temperature and/or aging process to GBs region at extremely higher concentration^^, and result in a dramatic reduction/enhancement of the ductility and strength of materials^^. It has become increasingly important to gain a deep understanding of impurities effects on GB cohesion at the microscopic level for developing new materials. Besides, first principle calculations are promising and cost-effective research strategy widely used in recent years to study the role of segregated impurity atoms in metals and alloys. In the last two decades, numerous efforts have been devoted in determination of impurities impact on nickel grain boundaries using computational methods. The commitment to the GB research topic, was motivated by the industrial challenges facing fabrication and aging of nickel based materials. Also experimental studies were constrained to investigate one impurity alone without the influence of other impurities^,^. In the literature, there are mainly four systematic studies on the effect of impurities in Nickel ∑5 GBs based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations^,--^. The first one is by Všianská and Šob^^, where systematic first-principle study was performed to study the segregation of sp-impurities at ∑5(210) (GB) and通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> free surface (FS). Local atomic volumes, interlayer distances and magnetic moments, for both clean and segregated impurities to GB/FS, were analyzed. Furthermore, they calculated the strengthening/embrittling energy according to the Rice--Wang model^^. The second work was published by Razumovskiy et al.^^, where the segregation and free surface energies of some alloying elements (Ta, Re, Hf, W, Zr) to GB were computed with DFT and considered Hf and Zr as \"minor alloying additions\". The third work as achieved by Sanyal et al.^^ using DFT, has determined decohesion properties of Ni ∑5(210) grain boundary with B, C, S, Cr, and Hf dopants. The relative stability of the considered sites was evaluated and the cohesive energies were calculated. The latest study, performed by Razumovskiy et al.^^, investigated the influence of 4d and 5d transition metal alloying elements as well as B, Bi, S and Cr on the GB strength in Ni within the framework of the Rice--Wang approach and by calculating the ideal work of separation. All the aforementioned studies have defined the qualitatively enhancing or embrittling effect of impurities in Nickel grain boundaries by calculating the segregation energies.\n\n【2】Although a considerable number of elements have been studied theoretically, it is hard to make a comparison and draw conclusions from the available results in the literature due to model differences, impurity concentrations, and calculation approaches basis. Since we are trying to understand the mechanisms and effects of different impurity atoms which involve very small energy differences, it is important to conduct calculations on equal discrepancies for all impurities i.e. using the same model and approximations for each type of targeted physical property calculation. This should allow us to make sensible comparisons and draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n【3】Models and Computational Details \n================================\n\n【4】Models used in Ni Σ5(210) STGB and通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> surface \n------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Face centered cubic FCC Σ5(210) 〈001〉 GB is formed by tilting two symmetric grain by 53.1° with respect to a common 〈001〉 tilt axis with the boundaries plane parallel to通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u>^^. Since we are calculating different properties (segregation energy, surface energy and the tensile strength) for all 19 impurities, we used different models depending on the calculated properties and the required impurity concentration 删除21:<u></u>.Figure 1(a) Fully relaxed clean grain boundary, (b) isolated impurity atom in 1 × 1 nm box to calculate the energy of isolated impurity. (c) Fully relaxed clean grain boundary with the impurities deep in the bulk region, (d) fully relaxed grain boundary with segregated impurity atoms in interstitial site 0. (e) Fully relaxed grain boundary with segregated impurity atoms in substitution site 1. (f) Relaxed free surface with segregated impurity atoms. (g) Nickel single crystal supercell with the same number of atoms and approximate size used to have the energy of one Ni atom in the bulk.\n\n【6】For segregation energy calculations, and due to the remark of Šob et al.^^, which states \"calculations of segregation energies at interfaces are often unreliable when the bulk solid solubility of the segregate is lower than that corresponding to one solute atom per computational repeat cell. The calculated energy of a solute in the bulk cannot be used when evaluating segregation energies\", we used a 2 × 2 unit cell model that generated 80 atoms distributed on 11 layers with P1 symmetry \\[see Fig. [1(c)]\\]. Thus, the interaction between impurities is negligible. For the calculation of impurity segregation energy to the surface, we also used 2 × 2 Ni unit cell model with 60 atoms distributed over eight layers \\[see Fig. [1(f)]\\]. The GB unit cell used in tensile strength calculations has 44-atoms, i.e. one impurity per two-repeated GB unit cell \\[see Fig. [1(a)]\\]. We have to mention that in order to get relevant and comparable total energies, and for each above calculated property for all considered impurities, we used the same calculation parameters, the same GB unit cell size and the same number of atoms per model. This allowed us to calculate the energy difference when the impurity segregates to the surface, bulk and GB for each property. Furthermore, all calculations were carried out with P1 symmetry by forcing symmetry breaking of models, in order to get relevant and comparable total energies\n\n【7】The calculated Ni-lattice constant is 3.518 Å (the experimental value is 3.524 Å). Dimensions of the unit cell of GB model are then 3.5 × 4.3 × 24.5 Å^3^ 删除21:<u></u>. We used 2 × 1 × 1 model for tensile strength calculation and 2 × 2 × 1 cell unit model for segregation energy. The unit cell has a vacuum region, with a width set to 1 nm for segregation calculations and 1.5 nm for tensile strength calculations.\n\n【8】Computational details \n---------------------\n\n【9】We used pseudopotentials plane wave method for total energy calculations as implemented in Cambridge serial total energy package (CASTEP)^^ with Norm-conserving pseudopotentials (NCP) and 720 eV cutoff energy for all calculations. Local density approximation LDA CA-PZ was used for the exchange-correlation potentials (CA-PZ: Ceperley--Alder^^, data as parameterized by Pedrew-Zunger^^). For the present of GB unit cells, we considered k-points sampling on different models as follow: 4 × 4 × 1 k-points for the 80-atom model and 3 × 5 × 1 for the 44-atom model. These parameters lead to an adequate accuracy of 0.1 meV/Å per atom. A precision of 1 meV was thus sufficient for calculating energy differences. For density of states and population analysis calculations, we used 5·10^−7^ eV as strict criteria for total energy tolerance, together with 6 × 6 × 2 in k-point sampling. Nickel GBs with transition metal impurities poses unique challenges in electronic structure calculations^^. After several tryouts, norm conserving pseudopotentials and (LSDA) were found to be the best combination that give well converged energies to the required tolerance in all cases and in agreement with the observations reported in ref.^^.\n\n【10】Results and Discussion \n======================\n\n【11】Effect of light elements in NiΣ5 GB and its free surface \n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The calculated segregation energies of the 8 impurities to Ni Σ5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> symmetrical tilt grain boundary are presented in Table . These energy values correspond to an energetically minimum position. These positions are picked up from the segregation energy calculations in different possible sites in surface (sites 9, 10, 11) and in the GB region (sites 0, 1, 2, 3) 删除21:<u></u>. Some of the minimal positions used, especially in GB region, were extracted from the literature. For example, Yamaguchi et al.^^ have reported that site 2 is the most stable for sulfur system. Results published in refs^,^. have predicted an interstitial segregation of all six nonmetallic elements and substitutional for Aluminum. In the present work, we used site N°7 to calculate the binding energy of an impurity in the bulk, and make it as reference in segregation calculation. For each configuration, we performed structural relaxation of the impurities atoms, mainly 5 to 6 close neighboring Ni atoms while fixing the rest of the Ni atoms of the system.Table 1The Binding energy E~b~ of 8 light impurities in the Bulk and in the most stable Ni Σ5GB.Formation energiesSegregation energiesBulkGBotherFSotherGBotherSurfotherRWEPOtherB−5.94−8.82−7.14−7.08−6.30−2.08.−1.14.−0.94−0.84S−4.40−6.63−4.72−6.01−5.78−1.77−1.4\\−2.67−2.32\\0.8921.06/0.99\\C−7.23−9.82−8.2−9.29−7.87−1.71.−2.06.0.34−0.33O−4.10−6.79−5.79−7.27−6.66−2.25.−3.17.0.910.87N−4.79−8.29−7.5−7.74−7.85−2.83.−2.95.0.120.35P−3.89−6.18−6.45−5.71−6.44−1.72−1.6\\−1.82−1.53\\0.10−0.01/−0.07\\Al−5.51−5.78.−5.61.0.05−0.22\\−0.10−0.19\\0.16−0.30Si−7.44−8.63.−7.67.−0.71−0.76−0.39−0.35−0.32−0.41In the right side the Segregation Energy E~seg~ of impurities to the grain boundary and to the surface together with the Rice Wang embrittling potency.

Our results are in good agreement with literature data. According to the Rice--Wang model, large negative value of the binding energy of the impurity at the GB means stronger bonding between the impurity and nickel atoms^^. Light elements have high segregation energies to the GB especially N by −2.8 eV, and higher segregation to the surface was observed for S and Si elements. However, phosphorus shows a weak segregation to the FS and GB. Boron has the highest enhancing potency of 2.84 eV, which is according to the Rice-Wang embrittling potency (RWEP) considered as the best enhancer^^.\n\n【14】In order to fully investigate the effect of impurities segregation in Ni GB, we need to further calculate two fundamental values: the cohesive energy (E~coh~) and the theoretical tensile strength (TTS). As mentioned in Tahir and Janisch work^^, cohesive energy (from ab-initio calculations) alone is not sufficient to describe fracture processes. In the present work, E~coh~ and TTS were calculated for 8 light elements (N, B, C, Al, Si, P, O and S), with the 44 atoms model. Results are gathered in Table [S1] (Supplementary Information). It is important to mention that in all considered cases the interlayer separation distance is parallel to the z-direction of the GB model 删除21:<u></u>. Figure [3(a)] shows the evolution of the calculated cohesive energies as a function of the separation distance between the two grains in the tensile process fitted to the Rose universal binding curve for Al, Si, P, S. Figure [3(b)] shows the TTS change versus the separation distance between the two grains. The maximum tensile strength is located around 0.5 A.Figure 3(a) Cohesive energy in J.m^−2^ and (b) tensile stress in GPa of the NiΣ5(210)GB as a function of the separation distance for Al, Si, P and S. The interlayer distances of a perfect bulk in « c » direction is taken as a reference for separations in all configurations.\n\n【15】Effect of transition metal elements in NiΣ5 GB and surface \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The purpose of the present sub-section, is to present a systematic ab-initio study the transition metal elements effects belonging to 4^th^ to 7^th^ columns of the periodic table, namely: Tc, Ti, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Mn, Hf, Ta, W, V and Re, on Ni Σ5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> tilt GB and surface. For these impurities, we calculated segregation energy, strengthening/embrittling energy, cohesive energy, binding energy and the tensile strength. Based on these identification factors and by comparing our results with data from the literature we aim to conclude this section with a clear answer on the effect of these impurities on Nickel GB. Table  reports the calculated binding as well as segregation energies to the surface and to the Ni Σ5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> GB for the considered 11 transition metal impurities. It is well known that the impurity segregates to energetically minimum position. This stable position is identified from the results of segregation energy calculations in different possible sites: in surface sites 9, 10, 11, and in the GB region: sites 0, 1, 2, 3 删除21:<u></u>. Here Again, some of the minimal position sites, especially those of the GB region, are extracted from the previous works in literature. Razumovskiy et al.^^ found that site1 is more stable than the interstitial site 0 for all the transition metals cases he considered in in study. This is obviously in good agreement with our present results. From the detailed study of vanadium impurities^^, we concluded that site 1 is the most stable 删除21:<u></u>, which is also confirmed by previous studies especially by Yamaguchi et al.^^, who considered site 1 for transition metal elements. On the other hand, results presented in Table  show that Zr, Hf and Ta have the strongest binding energies, while Mo, V, Cr have the weakest one. The values of Mn binding energies to the GB and FS show an embrittlement effect. In the next section, we will report a detailed electronic structure study of the effect of Mn in order to explain this situation. A first remark that arises from Table , is that Zr has the highest GB segregation energy, but weak RWEP. This situation corroborate the well-known role of Zr in Nickel based alloys^^. Moreover, Nb, Re, W have also high segregation energies to the GB with large RWEP, which makes them potential candidates to play a role as strengthening agents to Ni GB. These results are in good agreement with other works^,^. It is worth mentioning that segregation energy of Mo and Ti are calculated for the first time, and hence can be considered as theoretical predictions. Furthermore, Ti has an acceptable embrittling potency (−0.34 eV) which leads to remarkable tensile strength . Cr and Mo have large positive segregation energies. Simultaneously, they present good TTS and reasonable cohesive energy. This leads to consider the value of segregation energy as doubted since the nonmagnetic results found by Young et al.^^ have shown more acceptable segregation energy results. Among the considered 11 transition elements, Mn shows an abnormal behavior as it has large RWEP.Table 2The Binding energy E~b~ of 12 transition metals impurities in the Bulk and in the most stable NiΣ5 GB site (generally site 1).Binding energies (eV)Segregation energies (eV)BulkGBFSGBotherSurfotherRWEPotherTi−7.83−7.99−7.65−0.16.0.18.−0.34.V−3.48−4.1−3.86−0.62.−0.38.−0.24.Cr−3.43−1.04−4.251.7−0.02^b^−0.54−0.61^2^2.24−0.53^b^Mn−3.020.21−0.203.2+0.19^b^2.8+0.39^2^2.7−0.2^2^Zr−7.88−9.10−8.59−1.22−1.94^a^--1.02^b^−0.72−1.77^a^--1.01^b^−0.51−0.17^a^ + 0.08^b^Nb−5.38−6.14−5.52−0.76−0.49^b^−0.14−0.03^b^−0.62−0.46^b^Mo−3.18−3.21−3.21−0.45.−0.2.−0.25.Hf−8.51−8.68−8.68−0.78−1.65^a^−0.17−1.16^a^−0.61−0.49^a^--0.8^c^Ta−9.02−8.68−8.68−0.57−0.93^a^0.340.13^a^−0.91−1.05^a^W−6.50−6.05−6.05−0.13−0.45^a^0.450.87^a^−0.57−1.32^a^Re−5.72−5.25−5.25−0.11−0.12^a^0.471.21^a^−0.58−1.33^a^In the right side the Segregation Energy E~seg~ of impurities to the grain boundary and to the surface together with the Rice Wang embrittling potency.

RWEP values are changing considerably as function of the period 删除21:<u></u>. The more we move away from Ni in period 4, the higher the RWEP is. We can also see that there is no linear relation between the size of impurity and segregation energy, in contrast to the light elements case.Figure 4Segregation energies to the GB and surface calculated for the considered 11 transition metal impurities, the order is baed on the periodic table lines.</u>\n\n【18】We further present here results and discussion of two fundamental properties: cohesive energy and theoretical tensile strength (TTS), calculated for (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Tc) impurities in Nickel GB in substitution site1, as summarized in Table [S1]. Figure [5(a)] shows results for evolution of the cohesive energies, fitted to Rose universal binding curve, as a function of the separation distance for 4 impurities of the 4^th^ row of the periodic table namely Ti, V, Cr, Mn. Figure [5(b)], displays the calculated TSS for the considered transition metal impurities. It is evident to see that Mn and Mo elements are not good enhancers. In fact, Mn presents embrittling effect, while Mo has no effect on the TTS although it increases the cohesive energy of the grain boundary to 4.71 eV 删除21:<u></u>. With close segregation energies, RWEPs for Mo, Ti and Mn are −0.42, −0.34 and +3.03 respectively. So, from the segregation point of view the behavior is the same, but their mechanical effect on Ni GB is quite different. Mo has approximately no effect on the GB with 27 GPa, whereas Ti is an enhancer with 31 GPa, and Mn is the only embrittling transition metal to the GB with 25 GPa 删除21:<u></u>. Further explanation of Mn effect using electron density difference will be discussed in the following section.Figure 5(a) Cohesive energy in J·m^−2^ and (b) tensile stress in GPa of the Ni Σ5(210)GB as a function of the separation distance for the period 4: Ti, V, Cr and Mn.\n\n【19】To summarize, Fig.  groups calculated values of cohesive energy together with tensile strength of the considered 19 elements in one plot. Although a correlation between the TTS and cohesive energy seems to appear for most of the elements, cases like Mn, Hf and Zr show an enhancement of cohesive energy with weakening in TSS, which confirm the results of Tahir et al.^^. More discussion about the impurities effect separately can be found in ref.^^.Figure 6(red) the value of cohesive energy in Jm^−2^ with function of impurity type in Ni ∑5(210) grain boundary. (black) the values of the calculated tensile strength for the same conditions. Impurity concentration is at 0.5 atm/ML. The blue triangle refer to a case when cohesive energy and tensile strength disagree in defining the enhancing/embrittling effect.\n\n【20】How B, S, V, Nb, Mn and W affect nickel ∑5 grain boundary? \n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Segregation energy and tensile strength calculations can provide us with an insight on the enhancing and the embrittling effects of impurities in the GB, but they cannot provide us with the answer of the question: why? The scrutiny of the electronic structure based on density of states, electron density difference and population analysis can help us to answer why an impurity is an enhancer or embitterer. Presently, we study the effect of Tungsten and Manganese as they were found the most enhancing/embrittling impurities for our metallic case. The choice is based on their different influence on Ni GB. From section III.2, we found that Tungsten is an excellent enhancer, and Manganese is an embrittler. Both of them form a metallic bonding. The question is: why we found a considerable difference in cohesive energy that made Tungsten strong enhancer and Manganese embrittler?\n\n【22】On one hand and from a structural point of view, it is clear from Table [S2] and Fig. that Mn caused to expansion of GB and enlarges the distance between site 3 and its symmetrical position site 3′ which expands from 2.53 Å for pure Ni GB to 2.83 Å when Mn has impurity in site 1, Fig. On the other hand, Tungsten results in only 2.54 Å for Ni2-W and 2.7 Å for Ni4-W and form a 2.75 Å bond length between Ni3-Ni3′ 删除21:<u></u>. We observe that tungsten did not cause much expansion of GB even though its atomic radius is larger than Mn's (193 pm for W and 161 pm for Mn). This effect is not related to bond type because both of them are metal, nor to the size of impurity atom. From the electron density difference, we can see strong perturbation of the charge around tungsten, which is not the case for Mn and that means a weaker bond.Figure 7The charge density difference (in electrons/Å^3^) of the Ni∑5(210) GB with substitutional segregated Manganese impurity (in purple) in site 1. Contours start from 0.1 to −0.1 e/a.u^3^. Distances in Å.Figure 8The charge density difference (in electrons/Å3) of the Ni∑5 GB with substitutional segregated Tungsten impurity (in red) in site 1. Contours start from 0.1 to −0.1e/a.u^3^. Distances are in Å.\n\n【23】To further investigate the properties of GB, we analyzed the magnetic moment of two cases in order to elucidate its effect on Ni GB properties^,^ as displayed in Fig. Tungsten induces a strong reduction of the magnetic moment of nickel atoms around it in the GB and generates magnetically dead layers as shown in Fig. This is not the case for Mn that produces the weakest perturbation of Ni magnetic moment. Moreover, we noticed a different behavior as far as the change of the magnetic moment for the isolated atom (m~Mn~ = 5 μ~B~, m~W~ = 3 μ~B~) and its magnetic moment in the GB (m~Mn~ = 2.31 μ~B~, m~W~ = −0.03 μ~B~). The change in magnetic moment of impurities in the GB equal to m~Mn~ = 5.2 μ~B~ and m~W~ = 0.06 μ~B~. The value of the magnetic moment for the pure Nickel single crystal calculated with population analyses in CASTEP was found to be 0.74 μ~B~. This value is larger than the experimental one (i.e. 0.61 μ~B~) and close to previous DFT studies^^. These high values of magnetic moment are also in the GB models compared with previous works, but they reproduce the same shifted results with the order of atoms position in Ni GB model (generally higher by 0.12 μ~B~). We consider that the main reason for this shift is due to the Norm-conserving pseudopotentials, as they are known to overestimate the magnetic moment^^. It should be noted that because we are doing a systematic and comparative study, all impurities effects were calculated under the same conditions, therefore our results of magnetic moment should be taken for comparison purpose only. The presence of impurities in the substitutional position induces the creation of magnetically dead layer in the GB region with different amounts 删除21:<u></u>. Site N°7 was considered in segregation energy as the reference point for the bulk. It is also valid as a magnetic reference for entering the bulk region. As we can see here, the value of its magnetic moment corresponds to that of pure Ni single crystal (0.74 µ~B~). After that in site N°8, all points meet together in the same value which means that the magnetic impurity effect on the Ni GB model is vanishing.Figure 9The magnetic moment values of Ni atoms labeled by sites number at the NiΣ5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> GB with substitutional segregated W, Mn, V, Nb and clean GB. The line at 0.74 µ~b~ represent the calculated value of magnetic moment of Ni crystal. Number of atoms are indicated in Fig.\n\n【24】To get some trends from the obtained results, we compared the loss of magnetic moment in the GB region and the TTS for Mn, W, V and Nb. We define Δm as the difference between the magnetic moment of impurity in the GB and when isolated. We plotted Δm versus TTS in Fig. We see clearly the larger Δm is, TTS increases. Tungsten has the highest Δm followed by, Nb, V and then Mn 删除21:<u></u>. This trend is not applicable for non-metal impurities (B and S) because they are non-magnetic elements. It should be noted that Δm has a positive value for the enhancing element W, Nb, V. It has a negative value for weakening element (Manganese), because Mn atom gains a magnetic moment of 0.04 μ~B~ thus Δm = −0.04 μ~B~. This important result lead us to directly relate the sign of Δm to the strengthen/embrittling effect. This sign trend is also valid even for the non-metals elements, such as sulfur (Δm = −0.06 μ~B~) and boron (Δm = +0.08 μ~B~). This approach differs from the approach of Tian et al.^^. In fact, in their work, they were interested in the magnetic moment of the bulk and found it to reduce much of the energy release upon fracture, and not the variation of magnetic moment of the impurity itself.Figure 10Theoretical tensile strength TTS (in GPa) versus magnetic moment difference between isolated atom and atom in Ni GB Δm (in magneto Bohr, μ~B~).\n\n【25】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【26】A systematic study on the effect of combination of light and transition metal elements in grain boundary has allowed us to find and discuss some trends between the cohesive energy and TTS. The comparison of our results conducted on the effect on Ni GB of eight light elements to those in the literature (theoretical and experimental data) have shown a good agreement. Our main contribution was to determine, the cohesive energy of: O, Si, Al, N in Ni∑5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> GB and the tensile strength values which was uncovered topic for C, O, Al, Si, N in Ni∑5通用删除7(英):<u> (210)</u> GB. Furthermore, we explored new insights to predict if an impurity is an enhancer or embitter. Our major finding is based on the loss or gain of magnetic moment (and not the atoms in the matrix) of the impurity, as an isolated atom and when in the GB. The higher the loss, the more the impurities consolidate the GB. The gain in the magnetic moment for the impurity causes embrittlement. Further investigations are recommended to check out the validity of the theoretical approach on different magnetic systems. A study about the segregation energy variation and tensile strength with function of impurities electronegativity, and co-segregation of the most enhancer element (Tungsten) and the most embrittler (Sulfur) in NiΣ5 grain boundary is presented in the Supplementary Materials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "4d79ec1e-0bb7-43de-bd4c-f9f090509ef9", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic, non-fermentative, Gram-negative, and ubiquitous Gammaproteobacterium. This bacterium has environmental origins (water, soil), but is known to cause a diverse range of infections in humans (; ). It is usually considered as a pathogen with reduced virulence, but it can cause a broad spectrum of nosocomial infection complications with a considerable mortality rate of up to 37.5% . The most common clinical manifestations caused by S. maltophilia include respiratory tract infections (; ) and bacteremia (; ).\n\n【2】Stenotrophomonas maltophilia exhibits high levels of intrinsic resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics (e.g. carbapenems and aminoglycosides). In addition, several mechanisms are able to contribute to acquired antimicrobial resistance (e.g. against fluorchinolones, polymyxins) resulting in a multi-drug resistance profile (; ). S. maltophilia is recognized by its ability to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces including glass and plastics like polystyrene (; ), as well as on host tissues such as bronchial epithelial cells . These characteristics make S. maltophilia an emerging global multi-drug-resistant opportunistic pathogen .\n\n【3】In addition to nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients, S. maltophilia is able to chronically colonize the airways of CF patients in a manner similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. It was shown that chronic S. maltophilia infection is an independent risk factor for pulmonary exacerbation in CF patients, associated with decline in FEV1 and a threefold increased risk for death or lung transplantation within the CF patient population (, ).\n\n【4】Molecular typing studies uncovered a high degree of genetic diversity between most S. maltophilia strains from hospitalized individuals as well as between those from CF patients (; ). The molecular typing methods used so far include amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), 16S rRNA sequencing, multi locus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive element palindromic (rep)-PCR, and gyrB sequencing, each producing varying results with no commonly accepted standard or defined nomenclature .\n\n【5】In contrast to these classical typing techniques that only interrogate a small part of the genome, next generation sequencing technologies allow for the near complete analysis of a bacterial genome, i.e. whole genome sequencing (WGS). This method provides a single-base-pair resolution between isolates, making it the ultimate molecular typing method for bacteria . Recent studies have demonstrated that analysis of bacterial genomes based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) enables the definition of relatedness between epidemiologically associated isolates and tracking of bacterial evolution over time, including in long-term S. maltophilia colonization of CF patients (; ). A very recent study found that the bacterial adaptation of S. maltophilia to the CF lung is associated with consistent genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity . Here, we performed WGS based phylogenomic analyses of a diverse collection of human isolates (mainly from CF and intensive care unit patients), and 22 environmental isolates. The collection represents the known diversity of S. maltophilia and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, including representatives of phylogenetic groups previously defined by traditional genotyping methods . The phylogenomic classifications have been linked with underlying diseases, phenotypical assays for biofilm formation, extracellular proteolytic activity and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pattern characterization.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods \n=====================\n\n【7】Strain Collection\n-----------------\n\n【8】In total, we analyzed 89 S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila strains, including 58 isolates collected by different institutes, as well as 31 strains chosen from a recent publication, which compared traditional genotyping methods, i.e. rep-PCR, gyrB sequencing, MLST, AFLP, and 16S rRNA sequencing, as respective group representatives . Altogether, 67 (75%) strains in the collection were isolated from human samples and 22 (25%) from environmental sources. For the phylogenetic analysis, we also included the data from five fully sequenced genomes of S. maltophilia strains, namely K279a (NC_010943.1), D457 (NC_017671.1), JV3 (NC_015947.1), R551-3 (NC_011071.1), and S. rhizophila DSM14405 (CP007597.1). These strains were included as reference and control strains .\n\n【9】The 58 isolates were collected and provided by various institutes in Germany. One human isolate was provided by the University Hospital Muenster (Barbara Kahl), 41 human isolates and 8 environmental isolates by the University Hospital Essen (JS), 7 environmental strains were from the University of Hamburg (WS), and 22 human and 6 environmental isolates were provided by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology . In addition, one human isolate was provided by the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Microorganisms (LMG11112), one human and one environmental isolate by the Leibniz Institute DSMZ -- German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSM-50170 and DSM-14405), and one human isolate by Wolfgang Streit (K279a), originally obtained from the  laboratory.\n\n【10】Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions\n---------------------------------------\n\n【11】All S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila strains used in the present study are listed in Supplemental Table S1. The strains were grown at 37°C or 30°C in either lysogeny broth (LB) or Brain Heart Infusion media. Escherichia coli strains SY327 \\[Δ(lac pro) argE(Am) recA56 rif^R^ nalAλ pir\\]  and DH5α \\[F^-^ Φ80lacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169 recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rK^-^mK^+^) phoA supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1λ^-^\\] were routinely cultured at 37°C in LB medium. Chloramphenicol at concentrations of 30 and 60 μg/ml, kanamycin (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (50 μg/ml), or norfloxacin (5 μg/ml) were added to the media as required.\n\n【12】Genomic DNA Isolation\n---------------------\n\n【13】The RNA-free genomic DNA of S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila strains was isolated from 1-ml overnight cultures using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\n\n【14】Whole Genome Sequencing and Data Analysis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【15】From extracted genomic DNA, sequencing libraries were constructed with the Nextera XT kit and run on the HiSeq (2 × 150 bp) or MiSeq (2 × 250 bp or 2 × 300 bp) sequencing platforms (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States). Reads were mapped to the genome of S. maltophilia K279a (GenBank ID: NC_010943.1) with the alignment program BWA, and the mappings were refined with the GATK and Samtools toolkits. For a variant detection in the mapped reads, we employed Samtools and Perl scripts to filter for minimum thresholds of at least four reads in both forward and reverse orientation indicating an allele with a Phred score of at least 20 and an allele frequency above 75%. For phylogenetic analysis, variant positions were combined, supplementing the joint list with the respective information from the original mappings where necessary. SNP positions with a clear base call in all isolates and fulfilling our thresholds in at least 95% of the isolates were concatenated to a sequence alignment. From this, we calculated a maximum-likelihood tree with FastTree  with a general time reversible substitution model, 1,000 resamples and Gamma20-likelihood optimization to account for the rate of heterogeneity among sites. The consensus tree was rooted with the \"midpoint root\" option in FigTree, and nodes were arranged in increasing order. We built a NeighborNet splitstree using the program Splitstree4  with default settings. Based on the set of SNP positions, isolates were also grouped together by a maximum distance of distinct SNP positions to the nearest group member.\n\n【16】For a genome-wide alignment of fully finished genomes of S. maltophilia strains K279a (NC_010943.1), D457 (NC_017671.1), JV3 (NC_015947.1), R551-3 (NC_011071.1), and S. rhizophila DSM14405 (CP007597.1), we employed Mauve using the progressive algorithm with default settings  .\n\n【17】Biofilm Formation Assay\n-----------------------\n\n【18】Qualitative assessment of biofilm formation among S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila isolates was performed according to  with the following minor modifications. The microtiter plates (96-well plates, round-bottom, Sarstedt, Nürmbrecht, Germany) were pretreated with acetone for 10 s to enhance biofilm adhesion. All S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila isolates were cultured overnight in 96-well microtiter plates in LB. Each isolate was diluted in fresh LB to achieve a cell density equivalent of 10^8^ CFU/ml. A total of 100 microliters of each diluted culture was transferred into the wells and incubated at 37°C (human isolates) or 30°C (environmental isolates) for 24 h. Culture supernatants were discarded, and plates were allowed to dry at 60°C for 1 h. Quantification of biofilms was performed by staining the samples with a 2% solution of crystal violet and subsequent solubilization with 30% acetic acid. The crystal violet solution (125 μl) was added to each well, incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min and carefully washed three times with water to remove excess dye. The plate was dried at RT overnight. Finally, the dye was dissolved with 125 μl of 30% acetic acid for 15 min and transferred to a flat bottom microtiter plate. The absorbance of solubilized crystal violet was measured at OD~550~ using 30% acetic acid as a reference.\n\n【19】Protease Assay\n--------------\n\n【20】Extracellular proteolytic activity was assessed using red-fluorescent BODIPY TR-X casein from the EnzChek Protease Assay Kit as a substrate in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, United States). Overnight cultures of S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila strains were diluted with fresh medium to an OD~600~ of 0.05 and then allowed to continue growth under aerobic conditions with agitation (200 rpm) for 6 h. At this point, the cultures were adjusted again with fresh medium to an OD~600~ of 0.05 and grown for an additional 16 h, followed by measurements of the optical densities of the suspensions at 600 nm and sedimentation of the cells by centrifugation. The assay for secreted proteolytic activity was performed in a total volume of 200 μl with 10 μl of culture supernatants in white 96-well Nunc MicroWell polystyrene plates with cell culture surface coating (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). The change in fluorescence was measured at 37°C for a period of 110 min using the GloMax-Multi+ Detection System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The basal fluorescence level of the negative control was subtracted from the fluorescence measured for each sample. Protease activity is expressed as fluorescence change in the culture supernatant of a bacterial culture with an OD~600~ of 1.0.\n\n【21】Construction of an Unmarked S. maltophilia K279a ΔrmlBACD Deletion Mutant\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Standard recombinant DNA methods were used for nucleic acid preparation and analysis . KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen, Nottingham, United Kingdom), Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega), High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research, Tustin, CA, United States), as well as DNA restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase and DreamTaq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as advised by the manufacturers. To construct an S. maltophilia K279a mutant defective in biosynthesis of the O-side chain of the LPS, the entire rmlBACD (smlt0647-smlt0650) operon coding for synthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, the immediate precursor for rhamnose residues of the O-repeating units, was deleted. The mutagenesis method is based on the pGPI-SceI/pDAI-SceI-SacB system, which was originally developed for bacteria of the genus Burkholderia (; ) and recently used for the generation of unmarked deletion mutants of S. maltophilia . Briefly, for deletion of the genomic region containing the rmlBACD operon of S. maltophilia K279a, the knockout plasmid pUDK021 was constructed in E. coli SY327, a cloning host for plasmids containing the R6Kγ origin of replication. As a first step, the primer pair KOsmltrmlBACD1/KOsmltrmlBACD2 删除21:<u></u> and genomic DNA of S. maltophilia K279a was used as a template to amplify a 733-bp fragment of the flanking region upstream of rmlB (smlt0647). The PCR product was digested with SphI/KpnI and cloned into the SphI/KpnI sites of pGPI-SceI-XCm, yielding plasmid pUDK020. The flanking region downstream of rmlD (smlt0650) of 725 bp was then obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA of S. maltophilia K279a with primers KOsmltrmlBACD3 and KOsmltrmlBACD4 删除21:<u></u>, followed by digestion of the PCR product with KpnI/XbaI and cloning into the KpnI/XbaI sites of pUDK020 to yield pUDK021. Successful construction of the plasmids was verified by DNA sequence analysis of the inserts. Using E. coli DH5α carrying the plasmid pRK2013  as a helper strain and E. coli SY327/pUDK021 as the donor strain, the deletion plasmid pUDK021 was transferred to S. maltophilia K279a by triparental mating as described previously (; ). The K279a co-integrants were selected at 37°C on LB agar plates containing 60 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 5 μg/ml norfloxacin to counter-select against the E. coli helper and donor strains. Due to the activity of the pyrocatechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by the xylE reporter gene of the deletion plasmid, the development of a bright yellow color after spraying the biomass with 0.45 M pyrocatechol confirmed the integration of pUDK021 into the genome of co-integrants. The helper plasmid pDAI-SceI-SacB was then introduced into the K279a co-integrants by triparental mating with DH5α/pRK2013 and DH5α/pDAI-SceI-SacB as helper and donor strains, respectively. The selection for exconjugants was performed at 30°C on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml tetracycline and 5 μg/ml norfloxacin, followed by screening for excision of the deletion plasmids, i.e. the inability of pyrocatechol to turn the color of the exconjugants bright yellow and sensitivity of the strains to 60 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Finally, the plasmid pDAI-SceI-SacB was cured by sucrose counter-selection as described . The deleted region of the resulting S. maltophilia K279a ΔrmlBACD mutant was verified by PCR and DNA sequence analysis .\n\n【23】The LPS preparations from proteinase K-digested whole-cell lysates of S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila isolates were separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS--PAGE) gels and stained with silver nitrate according to the method of . The lysates were prepared from the biomass of overnight cultures grown on agar plates. For immunoblots, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against heat-inactivated S. maltophilia K279a cells was produced by Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium. In order to use the antiserum for detection of homologous O-serotypes, the immune serum was adsorbed with heat-killed cells of the herein constructed S. maltophilia K279a ΔrmlBACD mutant as previously described . The LPS samples were electrotransferred from SDS--PAGE gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by incubation of the blots with adsorbed anti-K279a antibody. The immunoblots were then treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G (H+L) (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and developed in the presence of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate substrate (Promega).\n\n【24】Results\n=======\n\n【25】In total, 89 S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila isolates were sequenced successfully, with at least 240 Mbp sequence data generated per sample. Mapping to the K279a genome resulted in a mean coverage depth of 77.0-fold (range 35.6--222.4) of covered regions, and a mean coverage breadth of the reference sequence of 79.0% (range 41--100%). Fully finished genomes of five strains were added as controls and references K279a (NC_010943.1), D457 (NC_017671.1), JV3 (NC_015947.1), R551-3 (NC_011071.1), and S. rhizophila DSM14405 (CP007597.1). For the full analysis of all 94 datasets of this study, 1,928,889 bp out of the 4,851,126 bp of the K279a reference genome complied with the chosen thresholds and were used to derive a set of 408,860 SNP positions for the calculation of phylogenetic trees.\n\n【26】Group definition with a threshold of a maximum distance of 50.000 distinct SNP positions to the nearest group member resulted in 12 groups/clades in the S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila phylogeny (designated groups 01--12), which correspond well with GyrB, AFLP, rep-PCR (with the notable exception of rep-3), and MLST typing results 删除21:<u></u>. The 12 groups are separated by large SNP differences in line with independent environmental acquisition 删除21:<u></u>. While both, a genome-wide genome alignment comparison of the five fully completed genomes (S. maltophilia K279a, D457, JV3, R551-3, and S. rhizophila DSM14405) and a NeighborNet splitstree built from the detected SNP positions of the 94 strains, indicate some genomic rearrangement, the distinction into separate groups remains stable in the NeighborNet tree . Strikingly, the phylogenetic groups we defined almost exclusively comprise either isolates from the environment or human. Indeed, 9 out of the 12 groups were comprised entirely of human or environmental isolates, and the remaining three groups contained at least 75% either human or environmental isolates 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【27】![Maximum-likelihood tree calculated from the 408,860 aligned SNP positions of the 94 datasets of S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila.

In general, the majority of the isolates formed biofilms on a plastic surface in microtiter plates. Only 19 strains failed to form detectable biofilms. Surprisingly, a large fraction of the environmental isolates \\[11 (50%)\\] did not form biofilms. This is in contrast to the clinical isolates, from which only 8 strains (12.5%) failed to form biofilms under the same experimental conditions. With respect to protease secretion, we noticed that only 9 isolates failed to produce significant amounts of protease, but no correlation with respect to the SNP analysis or their origin was detected.\n\n【35】To obtain a deeper understanding of subgroup clonality, we performed a targeted analysis of 73 strains from which at least 75% of the K279a genome sequence could be recovered.

Overall, the isolates are separated by large SNP distances, reflecting their environmental occurrence. However, excluding full genome datasets, we identified four groups of strains for which group members were at a maximum distance of 25 distinct SNP positions from each other, possibly indicating transmission between patients: G1 (ICU02, ICU06, ICU98, ICU119), G2 (U7, U8), G3 (Sm527, Sm530), and G4 (Sm297, Sm454). In the cases of the ICU strain cluster (G1) and the CF groups (G3, G4), a spatio-temporal association was present, indicating that these patients were infected by the same strains presumably based on patient-to-patient or environment-to-patient transmission.\n\n【36】![Maximum-likelihood tree built from 649,312 SNP positions of the set of 73 S. maltophilia strains marked as K279a-like in Figure .

In spite of a significant heterogeneity of the LPS banding patterns, we have been able to assign 46 strains to a total of 16 LPS groups on the basis of electrophoretic mobility of the main bands, with at least two identical profiles within a group. Isolates with apparent unique LPS patterns or rough-type LPS lacking O-repeating units were ignored. Furthermore, the S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila strains were screened with a polyclonal antiserum against the O-antigen of S. maltophilia K279a. In order to obtain an antibody specifically directed against the O-antigenic chain of S. maltophilia K279a, a ΔrmlBACD deletion mutant of the strain lacking the gene cluster for dTDP-rhamnose synthesis was constructed. The polyclonal antibody against heat-inactivated S. maltophilia K279a wild-type cells was then adsorbed with heat-killed cells of the ΔrmlBACD mutant. Both the loss of O-substituted LPS in S. maltophilia K279a ΔrmlBACD and the O-specificity of the adsorbed immune serum was confirmed by SDS--PAGE and immunoblot analysis . Immunoblot analyses of Stenotrophomonas spp. indicated serological cross-reactivity of the O-specific K279a antiserum with the O-antigens of 10.6% (10, including S. maltophilia K279a) of all isolates and 13.7% of isolates herein assigned to the group of 73 K279a-like strains, which suggested that these isolates expressed a structurally similar or even identical O-specific polysaccharide . The serological cross-reactivity of the members of LPS-profile groups 02 and 03 was in good agreement with the phylogenetic tree 删除21:<u></u>, for which positive detection was restricted to clustered isolates closely related to K279a of LPS group 02, with the sole exception of strain DSM50170 displaying a unique LPS banding pattern. We also found that each group of K279a-like strains with a maximum distance of only 25 distinct SNP positions could be classified into separate LPS groups, each with an identical banding pattern to derive LPS groups 09 (ICU02, ICU06, ICU98, ICU119), 08 (U7, U8), 12 (Sm527, Sm530) and 03 (Sm297, Sm454), with the LPS of Sm297 and Sm454 showing, in addition, serological cross-reactivity with the O-specific K279a antibody.\n\n【38】Discussion\n==========\n\n【39】Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is becoming increasingly relevant as a nosocomial pathogen. We used WGS to dissect the phylogenetic relationship of a set of 89 S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila isolates from human and environmental sources. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed a highly diverse population with deep branches separating groups of strains. Notably, these groups correspond well to those identified by traditional genotyping methods. Despite a generally conserved genome structure , groups were distinguished by thousands of distinct SNP positions, with a reduced diversity within a \"supergroup\" of most human-derived K279a-like isolates 删除21:<u></u>. Interestingly, 9 out of the 12 groups consisted exclusively of either human (6 groups) or environmental isolates (3 groups). Out of the three remaining groups, two reflected the total ratio (75% human to 25% environmental isolates), and one comprised mostly environmental strains (80%). These data are in line with a previous MLST study from Germany which also found overrepresentation of some genogroups among human and environmental strains . Taken together, these results suggest a correlation between association with human diseases and genetic background. The identified groups may also differ with regard to their pathogenic potential, e.g. a higher pathogenic potential in strains closely related to the group defined by reference strain K279a. Alternatively, the strains within the very same lineage might have a higher potential to colonize humans and cause infectious diseases in comparison with others. The K279a reference strain also used in other studies was originally isolated from a septic patient's blood sample .\n\n【40】In contrast to our findings,  detected that genomic data from environmental and clinical S. maltophilia isolates did correlate neither to their origin nor to their antibiotic resistance profile. However, this study was limited to a small number of isolates (n = 14 in total; n = 5 from clinical origin). Another recent study also addressed the question of specific phylogenetic branches . A total of 10 environmental and 10 clinical isolates were sequenced and a large core genome with similar distributions of genes including virulence determinants was found. No specific evolutionary branches were detected. It was postulated that the evolution of S. maltophilia is based on the strain-specific acquisition of genes during adaptation to different microniches .  revealed that, even within the lungs of one individual CF patient, the S. maltophilia isolates separated into several lineages with distinct phenotypes distinguished by adaptive mutations . This study also showed that mutations within certain strains were associated with specific pulmonary locations indicating selection driven by the micro-environment.\n\n【41】Another recent study investigated 91 S. maltophilia isolates from 10 CF patients over a period of 12 years using genotypic and phenotypic methods . SNP-based and pangenome analysis showed three major lineages whereas phenotypic results (growth rate, biofilm formation, motility, mutation frequency, antibiotic susceptibility, and in vivo virulence) did not correlate with genomic data.\n\n【42】While our findings confirm a large genome diversity among environmental and human S. maltophilia isolates, their capacity to colonize CF-patients appears to be higher for certain defined groups. Furthermore, at least in few instances, we detected likely events of nosocomial transmission or acquisition from the same origin as already observed for Mycobacterium abscessus  This warrants further investigations into transmission of S. maltophilia in the community and hospital setting to determine scale and universality of this phenomenon, as well as its importance for disease severity. Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that the unequal distribution of human isolates in the S. maltophilia phylogeny is based on special virulence features of strains from groups associated with human infection.\n\n【43】One potential virulence factor is the O-specific polysaccharide that is the most variable part of the LPS molecule and determines the serological specificity of LPS and Gram-negative bacteria. It has further long been recognized that the O-polysaccharide is a fairly stable phenotypic marker that can be used to distinguish between groups of strains within a given species (; ). The enormous variability of O-polysaccharide structures has been attributed to evolutionary mechanisms that enabled alterations of the most exposed surface structure to maintain advantageous adaptations to particular environmental niches or evade niche-specific selection pressures or escape-specific antibody-based immunity. In fact, the structural diversity of O-polysaccharides reflects an extensive polymorphism at the genetic level, including gene mutations, genetic exchange events between different microorganisms, as well as recombination processes . Varying numbers of repeating units in the O-specific polysaccharide result in unique ladder-like banding patterns of LPS separated by SDS--PAGE. Thereby, comparative LPS profiling and O-serotyping are valuable tools for epidemiological studies with high discriminatory power . Here, we show that cross-reactivity of an antiserum raised against the O-antigen of K279a correlates well with our phylogenetic analysis, with only two subgroups of closely related strains expressing the K279a-like O-side chain antigen, apart from one isolate, DSM50170, with a distinctly different gel profile.\n\n【44】However, the serological cross-reaction with DSM50170 indicates that the O-specific polysaccharide of K279a and reactive K279a-like isolates is similar to the structure of the O8-antigen of DSM50170, which consists of a branched tetra-saccharide with three rhamnopyranosyl residues in the main chain and 3-O-methylxylose as the substituent (; ). Of note, a total of 31 different S. maltophilia O-serotypes and 16 O-antigenic structures have been described thus far, showing that most of the O-antigen repeating units of the S. maltophilia LPS have been branched tri- and tetra-saccharides of rhamnose, fucose, xylose, and glucose (; ). While the LPS-based approach aimed to complement our WGS data has identified a number of closely related isolates, we herein confirm previous results on the variability of O-repeating unit structures within the genus Stenotrophomonas, which in fact reflects the versatility of the bacterium to adapt to various environmental niches.\n\n【45】The capability to form biofilms as well as to secrete proteolytic enzymes differed between individual strains but failed to correlate with the distinct groups, and was also not particularly high in groups containing only human isolates. These results are in accordance with a previous study including CF isolates . The distribution of both properties, present or absent, across all groups suggests that both phenotypic traits can be universally present in the species complex but are not relevant for the pathogenic potential of a strain. However, both biofilm formation and proteolytic activity can be of relevance for isolates living in the environment or the human host depending on the individual niches.\n\n【46】A previous study combining comparative genomics, transcriptomics and physiological approaches with S. rhizophila DSM14405, a plant-associated S. maltophilia strain, and the human S. maltophilia K279a found habitat-specific genes in human vs. environmental strains . Therefore, a systematic comparison of the pangenome of the highly diverse S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila species complex would be interesting. A prerequisite and ideal tool for this comparison would be the construction of a whole genome MLST scheme. Thereby, potential virulence factors could also be identified, which likely correlate either with the human or with the plant host.\n\n【47】In this context, it should be noted that the strain collection may have introduced a systematic bias since the majority of the human isolates analyzed were obtained at one site (University Hospital Essen, 41 out of 67 isolates). Similarly, the number of environmental isolates tested in this study was rather small, with just 22 sequenced strains, compared to the number of clinical isolates. In summary, WGS provided a high-resolution phylogeny of the S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila species complex. Our results indicate the presence of branches of strains adapted to the human host, predominantly CF patients, with the potential of human-specific virulence and pathogenicity. The reason for increased virulence, however, remains elusive, and needs to be investigated in future studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A decision-analytic model was created to explore economic benefits from a third-party payer perspective of the use of 5ARIs in preventing PCa in men with different risk factors for developing the disease. A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of men annually through health states (e.g. healthy male, benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], PCa, PCa recurrence) over a man's lifetime. Men with risk factors were treated with a 5ARI and compared with patients given no chemoprevention. Men from the general population were examined along with higher-risk men who had been referred to a PCa centre. Baseline risk was estimated via published risk data, risk factor analyses and risk equations. Clinical efficacy, morality, costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes of the model included number of prostate cancers, incremental costs, incremental QALYs, incremental cost per QALY and number needed to treat. Along with sensitivity and scenario analyses, a validation of outcomes was performed. All costs were valued in $US, year 2009 values. Costs were discounted at 3% per annum.

Over the study period (13 months) 1526 email responses were received from 171 clinicians reporting 33 known and 10 new cases. The incidence was calculated at 0.85/million children/year. The majority of patients were female (23/31, 74% with a median age of 8 years (range 22 months-17 years). Male patients were older (median 11 years, range 6-17 years, p = 0.03). None had a family history of autoimmune disease. Behavioral change and neuropsychiatric features were present in 90% of the 31 children who fulfilled selection criteria. Seizures and movement disorders each occurred in 67%. EEG was encephalopathic in 28/30 (93%); extreme delta brush was not recognized. CSF showed pleocytosis in 45%; 67% had oligoclonal bands. Antibodies detected included antistreptolysin O, IgM Epstein-Barr, antinuclear, antibasal ganglia, and voltage-gated potassium channel-complex. MRI was normal in 65% and showed high signal changes in cortical and subcortical areas in 23%. Typical NMDAR-Ab encephalitis was reported in 24 children and a partial phenotype without encephalopathy in 7. Autonomic features included cardiac arrest in one and hypoventilation in 3. Steroids were prescribed for all patients, 22 (71%) received IV immunoglobulin, 9 (29%) received plasma exchange, and 10 (32%) received second-line immunotherapy. Of 23 diagnosed early, 18 (78%) made a complete recovery compared with only 1 of 8 (13%) diagnosed late (p = 0.002). Seven patients relapsed with 4 needing additional second-line immunotherapy. One (1 of 31, 3%) patient diagnosed late, after 6 months, responded to initial immunotherapy and was subsequently diagnosed and treated for ovarian teratoma with no relapse. \n\n【1】COMMENTARY. Pediatric NMDAR-Ab encephalitis often presents with neurological rather than psychiatric symptoms, the more common presentation in adults with the disease. Patients diagnosed and treated early with immunotherapy have a better prognosis than those treated late . Anti-NMDAR Abs in CSF is the diagnostic marker for NMDAR encephalitis, and the diagnosis may be supported by the EEG pattern \"extreme delta brush.\". This pattern named because of its resemblance to the EEG of premature infants is reported in 30% of adult patients with NMDAR encephalitis. Extreme delta brush is associated with more severe neurological/behavioral symptoms, prolonged hospitalization and increased days of cEEG monitoring.\n\n【2】In pediatric patients with behavioral disorders and abnormal movements, early EEG patterns may be suggestive of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Consecutive polygraphic video-EEG recordings in 9 children with NMDAR encephalitis were analyzed and in 6 patents, the waking EEG showed preserved background activity and either focal or unilateral hemispheric slowing. The outcome with focal EEG slowing was more favorable than in the 3 children with diffuse slowing. Unilateral abnormal movements contralateral to the hemispheric slowing were also indicative of milder clinical severity when compared with generalized abnormal movements and diffuse slowing .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

This study tested whether the Good Sports program reduced the incidence of drink driving and whether reductions are related to the level of program implementation. An adoption versus nonadoption pilot study was undertaken with 65 cricket and 48 Australian Football League clubs (N = 1,968 individuals). Associations between the stage of accreditation (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and the likelihood of driving with an illegal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) were examined. Alcohol-use diary accounts were used to calculate BAC before driving home from the club. The percentage of club members driving at least once in the previous week with a BAC estimate greater than .05% (the legal limit in Australia) was lower in clubs that had achieved Stage 2 Good Sports accreditation (7%, 95% CI [5%, 9%]) than those that had not (8%, 95% CI [6%, 9%]), but this was not significantly different. However, multilevel modeling identified a larger number of the safe-transport strategies, implemented as part of Stage 2 accreditation, which were associated with a significantly lower probability of drink driving. Being a risky drinker at the club, and the average number of risky drinkers at the club, was also predictive of drink driving. The findings of this pilot study suggest that implementation of the Good Sports program is likely to have a significant effect on harms associated with drink driving in Australia and elsewhere. Further community studies will be required, however, to examine precisely how the program is achieving improvements and whether it can be refined to have a greater impact in both Australia and overseas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Therefore, the assessment of hydrolyzed keratin/soy protein films processed by casting and compression moulding was carried out by means of the analysis of physicochemical, thermal, mechanical, optical and surface properties. It was observed that the incorporation of hydrolyzed keratin, obtained from a simpler, environmentally friendlier and more sustainable extraction method, resulted in the improvement of the thermal stability of the films, irrespective of the processing method employed.

The production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the retina is increased, and this finding has been correlated with an increase in blood-retinal barrier permeability, suggesting that IL-1beta might have an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. However, in this context, no attention has been given to interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI), which is the receptor responsible for IL-1beta triggered effects. Therefore, we investigated the effect of high glucose and IL-1beta on the IL-1RI regulation in retinal endothelial cells. A time-dependent downregulation of IL-1RI protein levels was detected in retinal endothelial cells exposed (1-24h) to high glucose, mannitol or IL-1beta. Long-term exposure (7days) to high glucose or mannitol also decreased IL-1RI protein content. IL-1RI downregulation was due to its activation by IL-1beta, since it was inhibited by the presence of anti-IL-1RI or anti-IL-1beta antibodies. Moreover, IL-1RI downregulation was prevented by lysosome inhibitors, chloroquine and ammonium chloride, but not by proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and lactacystin. We also found that IL-1RI translocates to the nucleus after high glucose or IL-1beta treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that high glucose, probably due to osmotic stress, and IL-1beta downregulate IL-1RI in retinal endothelial cells. The downregulation of IL-1RI is triggered by its activation and is due, at least partially, to lysosomal degradation. High glucose and IL-1beta also enhance the translocation of IL-1RI to the nucleus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "1be51e76-0142-489f-92d4-a85c41ff09de", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background \n==========\n\n【1】The health care system of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia faces resource constraints to provide quality health services to the people. The shortage of health care resources may be related to poor economic performance, rapid population growth, and a decline in public spending. Moreover, in Sub-Saharan Africa, communicable, maternal, nutritional, and new borne diseases continue to dominate and putting stress on the already scarce health care resources of these countries .\n\n【2】Hospitals consume a larger proportion of the total public health budget. Even though the percentage vary from country to country, hospitals in Sub-Saharan African countries consume a larger proportion of public health care resources. The situation in Ethiopia is like other Sub-Saharan countries. Hence, the efficiency of hospitals need to be given due attention as the budget they consume is enormous.\n\n【3】It is recognized that improved efficiency is one of the main goals of health systems . Health policy makers in Africa have also stressed the need to utilize the scarce health sector resources efficiently . A growing number of countries in Africa have undertaken health facility efficiency study to guide the development of interventions to reduce wastage of scarce health system resources.\n\n【4】Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been used to analyze technical efficiency of hospitals in several Sub-Saharan African countries. Different studies have used different inputs and outputs to measure efficiency. For instance, studies conducted in Eritrea , Botswana , Benin  and Burkina Faso  are among the few. Most of the studies focused on measuring the first stage of efficiency analysis. Few studies conducted the second stage analysis to examine the determinants of technical (in) efficiency using panel data. This study uses panel data for six-year-round (that is between 2007/08 to 2012/13) data for each hospital. Panel data enables analysis hospitals productivity changes. The benefit of having multiple observations  on the same units allows controlling for unobserved heterogeneous characteristics of hospitals. And thus, facilitate causal inference . The second stage analysis involves converting the DEA efficiency score into inefficiency score and running regression against some factors. In this regard,  analyzed technical efficiency and productivity in South Africa using panel data.\n\n【5】In the case of Ethiopia, few studies have been conducted to examine the efficiency of hospitals. A study by  examined technical efficiency of the health centers in Ethiopia. Other study in Ethiopia is by  which used Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) to analysis the technical efficiency of 8 selected public hospitals. These few studies focused on the first stage of efficiency analysis. Therefore, this study seeks to analyze the technical efficiency and productivity of hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. This study also examines factors that determine the inefficiency of hospitals. The findings will deepen understanding of the extent of inefficiency and its causes in eastern Ethiopia. In the rest of the paper, methods and materials, result and discussions, and conclusion and recommendations are presented.\n\n【6】Methods \n=======\n\n【7】This study was conducted on selected hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. The selected hospitals are from Eastern Hararghe (Oromia region), Harari region, Somali region, and Dire Dawa administration council. The included hospitals are both public and private. Panel data were collected from 12 hospitals for the period 2007/08 to 2012/13. The inputs include beds, health staff and drug supplies while the outputs include outpatient visits, inpatient days, and surgery.\n\n【8】Method of data analysis \n-----------------------\n\n【9】### Data envelopment analysis (DEA) \n\n【10】Data envelopment analysis (DEA) involves the use of linear programming methods to construct a non-parametric piece-wise surface (or frontier) over the data . DEA is based upon a comparative analysis of observed producers to their counterparts . First,  coined DEA which had an input-oriented model with constant return to scale (CRS). Subsequently, variable returns to scale (VRS) model was also developed and introduced to the DEA literature by . Furthermore, chance-constrained efficiency analysis was also integrated  to the DEA model.\n\n【11】#### CRS vs. VRS models \n\n【12】The assumption of CRS may not be feasible due to the presence of imperfect competition, government regulations, and constraints on finance that force firms to run at suboptimal scale . For this reason,  developed a variable return to scale (VRS) which enables to capture the magnitude of scale effect. Linear programming model of VRS is like the CRS with some modification.\n\n【13】The mathematical relationship between VRS and CRS efficiency measurements is given by $\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _=_(SE) $$\\end$ . \"SE\" denotes scale efficiency. This means that CRS technical efficiency of a firm can be decomposed into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency (SE).\n\n【14】#### Malmquist productivity index \n\n【15】It is the measure of the relationship between the outputs of a hospital and the inputs used to produce those outputs. Productivity increase is manifested by rise in output per health worker hour and/or the use of more and/ or better health technology. In general, a productivity index is defined as the ratio of an output quantity index to an input quantity index, i.e. $\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _t=\\frac $$\\end$; Where: Pt is a productivity index; time t = 0. T; Y~t~ is an output quantity index and X~t~ is an input quantity index. Each index represents accumulated growth from period 0 to period t.\n\n【16】The DEA-based Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is often opted to study efficiency and productivity changes over a given period. The model is preferred for several reasons: it does not require information on the prices of inputs and outputs rather on quantities of inputs and outputs; imposition of functional form of production technology is not required; it easily accommodates multiple hospital inputs and outputs; and it can be broken down into the constituent sources of productivity change - i.e. efficiency changes and technological changes .\n\n【17】Malmquist-DEA is applied to panel data to calculate indices of changes in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), technology, technical efficiency, and scale efficiency. The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) takes a value of more than one for productivity growth, a value of one for stagnation and a value of less than one for productivity decline. The output-oriented MPI is defined as the geometric mean of two periods' productivity indices, subsequently broken down into various sources of productivity change .\n\n【18】### Specification of the DEA model \n\n【19】The DEA model adopted is based on \\[--\\]; and many other model specifications that are applied in the health sector.\n\n【20】### The constant returns to scale (CRS) model \n\n【21】The efficiency score of decision-making units that employs multiple input and output is defined as:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ Effeciency=\\frac $$\\end$$\n\n【22】Following , if there are n hospitals, each with m hospital inputs and s hospital outputs, the relative efficiency score of a given hospital P is obtained by solving the following model:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ Efficienc_P= Max\\frac{{\\displaystyle _^s}_r_}{{\\displaystyle _^m}_i_} $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ s. t:\\ \\frac{{\\displaystyle _^s}_r_}{{\\displaystyle _^m}_i_}\\le 1;\\  j=1;2;\\dots;

In variable returns to scale, the data are enveloped more closely than the CRS model. The main advantage of the VRS model is that it enables an inefficient firm to be relatively compared to efficient hospitals of the same size only. Therefore, the relative efficiency score of hospital p can be obtained by solving the following equation:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ Max\\  Effecienc_P= Ma_{u_r_i}{\\displaystyle _^s_r_+_0} $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ S. t:{\\displaystyle _^s_r_}-{\\displaystyle _^m_i_+_0\\le 0;_i} $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i_=1 $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ __i>0; _r,_i $$\\end$$\n\n【33】Where:\n\n【34】$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _0 $$\\end$ = is the convexity constraint and its sign determines the returns to scale.

An improvement of efficiency occurs from period t to period t + 1 if the ratio is greater than 1 (one). The output-oriented DEA model was estimated for CRS DEA and VRS DEA models.\n\n【43】### Selection of input and output variables \n\n【44】The ultimate measure of output is an improvement in the quantity and quality of life. However, practical difficulties limit the use of outcomes approach . Hence, hospital output is measured as an array of intermediate output (health services) that improves health status . In this study, we included three output and three inputs based on the literature on health sector technical efficiency . The outputs include outpatient department visit, inpatient days, and number of surgery. The inputs include total health staff, cost of drug supply, and capital input proxied by total beds.\n\n【45】### Specification of the regression model \n\n【46】The DEA efficiency scores will be analyzed by regressing them against some characteristics of the hospitals to examine how these factors affect the (in) efficiency of hospitals. The censored Tobit model was used since the dependent variable is censored at zero from below. Like the studies of  and , in this study also the DEA scores are transformed into inefficiency scores using the following formula:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ Inefficiency\\  score = \\left(\\frac\\right)-1 $$\\end$$\n\n【47】The model is specified in the following form:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i^=_i_i + _i; $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i = _i^\\  if\\ _i^ > 0;\\  and $$\\end$$ $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i = 0\\  if\\ _i^\\le 0 $$\\end$$\n\n【48】Where:\n\n【49】u ~i~ \\~ N (0, δ ^2^);\n\n【50】$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i $$\\end$ = the observed inefficiency score;\n\n【51】$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i $$\\end$ = a $\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ K x $$\\end$ l vector of unknown parameters; and\n\n【52】$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ _i $$\\end$ = a $\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ K x1 $$\\end$ vector of explanatory variables.\n\n【53】Therefore, the empirical regression model is specified as:$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ INEFF = _0+_1 L\\  size + _2 B O R + _3 Teacstat + _4 dcstaf + _5 opinpdays+_6 impdoc + _i $$\\end$$\n\n【54】The variables in the model are defined as follows:\n\n【55】INEFF: inefficiency scores.\n\n【56】Size : The natural logarithm of numbers of bed is taken as a proxy to measure hospitals' size.\n\n【57】BOR: It is the ratio number of inpatient days multiplied by 100 and divided by the available hospital beds multiplied by number of days in a year.\n\n【58】Teachstat : It is teaching status dummy variable.

We converted the efficiency results into inefficiency score using equation eight通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>. Thus, we used this inefficiency score as dependent variable and run it against the above defined independent variables. Some of the determinants of the hospital facility technical efficiency include average length of stay, outpatient visit as proportion of the inpatient days, bed occupancy rate, doctors to staff ratio, teaching status of the hospital, proportion of inpatients per medical doctor, and bed size ).\n\n【64】The data \n--------\n\n【65】Regional bureaus of health collect data on inputs and outputs and other health related data. The study was conducted based on the data obtained from these bureaus of health of each respective region (Oromia, Harari, Dire Dawa Administrative City Council, and Somali) in Eastern Ethiopia. The study used panel data of six year-round starting from 2007/08 to 2012/13 for each hospital. Having this panel data enables us analysis hospitals productivity changes overtime and allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneous characteristics of hospitals.\n\n【66】Result and discussions \n======================\n\n【67】Results of the study \n--------------------\n\n【68】### Basic characteristics of hospitals \n\n【69】All (that is 12) hospitals in the Eastern Ethiopia are included in the study, except one for which the data was incomplete. The data collected covers the time between 2007/08 and 2012/13. Table  summarizes the basic characteristics of all hospitals and their respective average yearly inputs for the study period. Among the hospitals, eight were publicly owned while four were privately owned. In Harari region, 5 hospitals were selected for the analysis. Among the hospitals, Hiwot Fana, Jugal, Police and Army were public hospitals while Yimaj hospital was privately owned. From Dire Dawa, five hospitals were included: Dilchora and France hospital were public hospitals whereas Bilal, Yemariamwork and ART hospitals were privately owned. The other public hospitals considered in the analysis were Bisidimo and Karamara hospitals from East Hararghe zone of Oromia and Somali regions respectively. Regarding their year of establishment, France and Hiwot Fana hospitals were among the oldest hospitals where as ART and Yemariamwork were the youngest.Table 1Basic characteristics of hospitals and average yearly inputs 2007/2008--2012/2013Name of hospitalEstablishmentStaffAverageHealthAdministrativeTotalSalaryDrugRecurrentBedFrance1911142337591,637381,532414,24868Hiwot Fana19412251964216,406,0471,765,6626,278,350204Jegol19511511122633,495,719831,1163,899,048118Dilchora1951184772627,646,7672,600,8748,027,77085Karamara19562141403547,608,0261,401,9882,045,428193Bisidimo195856137194280,2001,100,000317,410116Police196569721412,222,641484,0501,083,95382Army197573771502,519,660593,8101,327,65097Yemariamwork\\2007151228550,832580,028651,80129ART\\2007205251,914,318560,2971,168,41928Yimaj\\2006451055982,006113,5723,877,60654Bilal\\20004350931,576,0753,470,0002,840,75940Source: own computation\n\n【70】Taking the average for the study period, Hiwot Fana hospital had the highest total staff which is 421 (196 administrative and 225 health staff) followed by Karamara, whereas ART had the lowest total staffs (5 administrative and 20 health staff) followed by Yemariamwork hospital.\n\n【71】Regarding the average yearly expenditure on salary, Dilchora hospital incurred the highest followed by Karamara hospital. The lowest expenditure on salary was incurred by Bisidimo. With respect to expenditure on drug, Bilal incurred the highest while Yimaj incurred the lowest. On the other hand, the average for yearly recurrent expenditure of the hospitals revealed that Dilchora hospital incurred the highest followed by Hiwot Fana. The lowest recorded was for Bisidimo followed by France.\n\n【72】The average number of bed for the study period revealed that Hiwot Fana had the highest number of bed followed by Karamara and Jugal. The lowest recorded was for ART followed by Yemariamwork hospital.\n\n【73】In this study, three major outputs of hospitals were considered for technical efficiency evaluation of hospitals. These three outputs were total yearly outpatient visit, total yearly inpatient days and total surgery performed in the respective hospitals. From Table , we can see that Dilchora had the highest average total outpatient visit followed by Hiwot Fana and Karamara hospitals. The lowest was recorded by Yemariamwork followed by ART and Yimaj.Table 2Hospitals average outputs 2007/2008--2012/2013NameFranceHiwotfanaJegolDilchoraKaramaraBisidimoPoliceArmyYemariamworkARTYimajBilalOutpatient visits874035,42426,19164,27228,484748814,57912,51856025797683212,256Inpatient days630826,52013,78944,23324,1223914720753541979138479148838Surgery1939491356382510083114918410272443393Source: various reports of hospitals and own computation\n\n【74】When we consider the total average yearly inpatient days, Dilchora had the highest average yearly inpatient days followed by Hiwot Fana and Karamara.

Regarding inputs, on average over the sample period public hospitals accounted for about 123, 120 and 1,144,879 numbers of health staff, bed, and amount of birr of drug expenditure, respectively. From the above data, we can see that the share of the public in terms of average outputs and inputs is higher than the private hospitals except in drug expenditure.\n\n【77】### Technical and scale efficiency \n\n【78】To separate the technical and scale efficiency in the health service production process which is often nonlinear, it is appropriate to assume output oriented variable returns to scale BCC model. Hence for this study we estimate the efficiency of hospitals assuming the variable returns to scale BCC model .\n\n【79】Tables  and  presents individual hospital's technical and scale efficiency for the year 2007/08 to 2012/13. It reveals that in year 2007/08 and 2008/09 out of 12 hospitals 3 (25%) registered a constant return to scale technical efficiency (CRSTE) score of 100%. Therefore, 9 (75%) of hospitals in both 2007/08 and 2008/09 period has been run inefficiently given the assumption of constant return to scale.Table 4Hospital's technical and scale efficiency for 2007/08 to 2009/102007/082008/092009/10HospitalsCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSFrance0.520.720.72DRS0.710.860.83DRS0.570.810.70DRSHiwot Fana0.540.550.99DRS0.550.590.93DRS0.860.880.98DRSJegol0.850.900.94DRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSDilchora0.760.770.99DRS0.750.780.96DRS0.971.000.97DRSKaramara0.981.000.98IRS0.391.000.39IRS0.581.000.58IRSBisidimo1.001.001.00CRS0.781.000.78DRS1.001.001.00CRSPolice0.851.000.85IRS0.831.000.83IRS0.701.000.70IRSArmy1.001.001.00CRS0.891.000.89DRS1.001.001.00CRSYemariamwork0.260.310.84DRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSART0.620.700.88IRS0.190.240.77DRS0.470.520.92DRSYimaj0.961.000.96DRS0.730.820.89IRS1.001.001.00CRSBilal1.001.001.001.001.001.00CRS0.831.000.83DRSMean0.780.830.930.730.860.860.830.930.89SD0.240.220.090.250.230.170.200.150.15Min0.260.310.720.190.240.390.470.520.58Max1.001.001.001.001.001.001.001.001.00Source: Own computation Table 5Hospital's technical and scale efficiency in 2010/11 to 2012/13Hospitals efficiency 2010/11Hospitals efficiency 2011/12Hospitals efficiency 2012/13HospitalsCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSCRSTEVRSTEScaleRTSFrance0.710.710.99DRS0.721.000.72DRS0.791.000.79DRSHiwot Fana0.710.710.99DRS0.530.540.99DRS0.560.620.90DRSJegol1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSDilchora1.001.001.00CRS0.800.800.99DRS0.670.690.97DRSKaramara0.521.000.52IRS0.641.000.64IRS0.661.000.66IRSBisidimo0.751.000.75DRS0.861.000.86DRS0.821.000.82DRSPolice1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSArmy0.851.000.85DRS1.001.001.00CRS0.751.000.75DRSYemariamwork1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSART0.520.540.97DRS0.580.640.91DRS0.500.650.77DRSYimaj1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRS1.001.001.00CRSBilal0.881.000.88DRS0.540.670.81DRS0.731.000.73DRSMean0.830.910.910.800.890.910.790.910.87SD0.180.160.150.200.180.130.180.160.13Min0.520.540.520.530.540.640.500.620.66Max1.001.001.001.001.001.001.001.001.00Source: Own computation\n\n【80】On the other hand, 6 (50%) hospitals in the year 2007/08 and 7 (58.33%) of hospitals in the year 2008/09 registered a variable return to scale technical efficiency (VRSTE) score of 100%.

For example, in the year 2012/13, if inefficient hospitals were concerned with the output side, the inefficient hospitals would have increased outpatient visit by 3554, inpatient days by 1837 and surgery by 770 to become efficient. If hospitals were concerned with the level of inputs, the inefficient hospitals should have decreased their bed by 93 to be efficient. Specifically, Bisidimo hospital should increase outpatient by 3554 while army and police hospitals should also increase inpatient days by 511 and 1326, respectively. Moreover, army and police hospitals should also have increased the number of surgery operated by 365 and 404, respectively in 2012/13. This is if hospitals are concerned with output side. If the hospitals are concerned with level of input, Army, Police, and Bisidimo Hospitals should have reduced their bed size by 29, 7 and 57, respectively to be efficient.Table 6The Required Change in input and output to Make Inefficient Hospitals EfficientYearOutputInputValuesOutpatient visitImpatient daysSurgeryBedDrug expenditureHealth staffRequired Change in input and output for all Hospitals for study period2007/08Total842426,2912711771,007,94670Mean7022191226683,99562008/09Total11,31015,5995186721,872,24716Mean94213004326156,02112009/10Total0865938130626,18457Mean072231152,18252010/11Total365632560118015Mean305271010012011/12Total69798142877170689,65914Mean582678731457,47212012/13Total355418377709500Mean29615364800Total33,92363,78395816624,196,035172Mean471886133958,2782Source: Own computation\n\n【88】### Malmquist Total Factor Productivity (MITFP) change \n\n【89】The study analyzed the differences in productivity over time based on Malmquist Total Factor Productivity (MTFP) index taking the year 2007/08 as the technology reference 删除21:<u></u>. Table  presents the Malmquist index summary of annual geometric means. In the last row (last column), we observe that on average MTFP decreased slightly by 3.6% over period 2007/08-2012/13. On average, the deterioration in MTFP was due to technical change rather than efficiency change. Hospital efficiency was increased by 1.2%, technical change decreased by 4.7%. The efficiency change was attributed to an increase in pure efficiency of 2.4% and a decline in scale efficiency of 1.2%.Table 7Malmquist index summary of geometric annual means (Output oriented)YearEfficiency change \\[A = (C\\D)\\]TE change \\[B\\]PE change \\[C\\]SE change \\[D = (A/C)\\]MITFP change \\[E = A\\B\\]2008/090.9231.011.0360.8910.9322009/101.230.7911.1231.0960.9732010/111.010.8980.991.020.9072011/120.9381.0440.9490.9880.9792012/130.9881.0471.0310.9581.034Mean1.0120.9531.0240.9880.964Source: Own computation\n\n【90】MTFP change was 1.034in 2012/13. This shows that hospital productivity grew by 3.4% in 2012/13 compared to the reference year 2007/08. MTFP change was the highest in 2012/13 (MTFP = 1.034) and the lowest was in 2010/11 (0.907).\n\n【91】Table  provides a summary of the annual geometric mean values of the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) and its components for each hospital. Five (42%) out of 12 hospitals had MPI score greater than one, indicating growth in productivity. The hospitals include Karamara, Jugal, Bilal, France and Yemariamwork and their respective score is 0.6, 0.6, 7.7, 1.9 and 21.1%. The productivity growth in France was attributed to technical change only. Meanwhile, the productivity growth in Karamara, Jugal and Bilal was due to improvements in efficiency only. However, productivity change in Yemariamwork is due to both efficiency and technical change.Table 8Malmquist Index Summary of firm meansYearEfficiency change \\[A = (C\\D)\\]TE change \\[B\\]PE change \\[C\\]SE change \\[D = (A/C)\\]MITFP change \\[E = A\\B\\]Karamara1.060.951.071.001.01Army1.010.961.030.980.97Jugal1.030.971.021.011.01Police0.980.980.981.000.95ART0.930.901.000.930.84France1.001.021.001.001.02Yemariyam work1.031.171.001.031.21Yimaj1.000.971.001.000.97Dilchora1.000.791.001.000.79Bisidimo1.120.851.140.990.95Bilal1.100.981.071.031.08Hiwot Fana0.910.951.000.910.86Mean1.010.951.020.990.96Source: Own computation\n\n【92】On the other hand, 7 (58%) out of the 12 hospitals had Malmquist index score of less than one, indicating deterioration in productivity. Overtime productivity regression in Yimaj, Dilchora, Army and Bisidimo hospitals was due to deterioration in technical progress. However, productivity regression in the case of Police, ART and Hiwot Fana hospitals was due to decline in efficiency and technical progress.\n\n【93】#### Pure efficiency change \n\n【94】In Table , it is showed that 5 hospitals had an average pure efficiency change (PECH) score of greater than one. Hospitals registering a pure technical efficiency increase included Karamara (6.7%), Army (2.5%), Jugal (2.2%), Bisidimo (13.5%), and Bilal (7.4%). On the other hand, ART, France, Yemariamwork, Yimaj, Dilchora and Hiwot Fana hospitals registered a PECH score of one, indicating no change in efficiency at those hospitals between 2007/08 and 2012/13. However, Police hospital experienced a decline in PECH by 2.2%. The average PECH score for the entire sample was 1.024 during the study period, implying that PECH reduced efficiency by 4.2%.\n\n【95】#### Scale efficiency change \n\n【96】Scale efficiency change (SECH) is expressed as a value less than, equal to, or greater than one if a hospital scale of production contributes negatively, not at all, or positively, respectively, to productivity change . The scale of production in Jugal, Yemariamwork and Bilal contributed positively to TFP change by a factor of 1.2, 3.2 and 2.6%, respectively.\n\n【97】France, Yimaj and Dilchora hospitals had a scale efficiency index value of one通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> meaning that those hospitals' scale of production did not contribute to MTFP change. On the other hand, the SECH score for 5 hospitals was less than one通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> indicating that the scale of production in Karamara, ART, Army, Police and Hiwot Fana hospitals contributed negatively to productivity change by 0.5, 7.3, 1.8, 0.3 and 9%, respectively. The average SECH score for the entire sample was 0.988 indicating that the scale of production on average reduced efficiency change by 1.2%.\n\n【98】#### Technical change \n\n【99】Ten hospitals (83%) registered technical change (TECH) of less than one indicating a decline in technical progress. The lack of technological progress in Karamara, Army, Jugal, Police, ART, Yimaj, Dilchora, Bisidimo, Bilal, and Hiwot Fana led to decrease in TFP (Total Factor Productivity) of 5.3, 3.8, 2.7, 2.3, 9.6, 2.8, 21.3, 2.2, 5.6 and 5.4%, respectively. France and Yemariamwork hospitals registered technical progress between the period t and t + 1 of 1.9 and 17.3%, respectively.\n\n【100】### Tobit regression model results \n\n【101】In this study, we used random effect Tobit model. The panel data is for 6 periods running from 2007/08 to 2012/13. To analyze the determinants of inefficiency of hospitals, the technical efficiency score of hospitals was converted to inefficiency score of hospitals. Subsequently, the inefficiency score was used as a dependent variable and regressed against hypothesized determinants (Size, Teachstat, BOR, Dcstaf, Opvinpdays and impdoc) using a censored Tobit model. Table , indicates that among the explanatory variables included in the analysis, four of them (Teachstat, Dcstaff, Opinpdays, impdoc) were found statistically significant while the remaining two were insignificant.Table 9Summary of the Censored-Tobit regression analysisExplanatory variablesCoefficientStd.

This implies that being a teaching hospital reduces the expected efficiency score by 3.03.\n\n【103】The proportion of Dcstaff (medical doctors to the total staff) is negatively related with inefficiency and statistically significant at one通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> % level of significance. This implies that for a one unit increase in Dcstaff (medical doctors to the total staff ratio); there is a 3.75 unit decrease in inefficiency score.\n\n【104】The coefficient for Opinpdays (outpatient visits to inpatient days ratio) has a negative sign that is consistent with our a priori expectation and significant at 10% level of significance. A one unit increase in the ratio of outpatient visit to inpatient days would lead to a decrease in hospital expected inefficiency score by 1.75.\n\n【105】The coefficient of the Impdoc (proportion of inpatients treated per medical doctor) is negatively related to inefficiency score and statistically significant at one percent level of significance. It shows that the number of inpatients per medical doctor has negative relationship with inefficiency score. This implies that a one percent increase in the ratio of inpatient per doctor would drop the predicted value of inefficiency score by 3.25%.\n\n【106】Discussions \n-----------\n\n【107】### Technical and scale efficiency of the hospitals \n\n【108】The average Variable Returns to Scale Technical Efficiency (VRSTE) scores of hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia were 91, 89, 91, 83, 86 and 93% during the period, respectively. This finding implies that if run efficiently the hospitals could have produced 9, 11, 9, 17, 14 and 7% more output (outpatient department visit, impatient days and number of surgery) for the same volume of inputs. The average VRSTE of hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia exhibit similarity with hospitals in Northern and Western Cape Provinces (82--82.8%) , Kwazulu Natal province of South Africa (90.6%) , and Kenya (84%) . On the other hand, the average VRSTE scores were higher than those of Angola (65.8--67.5%) , Ghana (61%) , Zambia (67%) , Benin (63.3--85.8%)  and Namibia (62.7--74.3%) . But it is lower than those for Uganda (90.2--97.3%) .\n\n【109】The average scale efficiency scores were 93%, 86%, 89%, 91%, 91%, 87% in the respective years between 2007/08 and 2012/13. These average scale efficiency scores were within the range of those for Angola (81--89%) , Kenya (90%) , and South Africa (Eastern, Northern and Western Cape Provinces) (82.5--90%) . However, it is higher than those for Benin (41.9--73.6%) , Ghana (81%) , Namibia (73.2--83.7%) , and Zambia (80%) . Moreover, the average scale efficiency scores for Botswana were lower than those of Kwazulu-Natal Province of South Africa (95.3%) , and Uganda (97.5%) .\n\n【110】### The required change in input and output to make inefficient hospitals efficient \n\n【111】Table  shows the required change in input reduction or output increase to make inefficient hospitals efficient for the study period. In this vein, if inefficient hospitals were concerned with the output side, the inefficient hospitals would have increased outpatient visit, inpatient days and surgery to become efficient. If hospitals were concerned with the level of inputs, the inefficient hospitals should have decreased their bed to be efficient.\n\n【112】Accordingly, the finding suggest that for hospitals with outputs that fall short of DEA targets, health policymakers could improve efficiency by improving access to and utilization of underutilized maternal and neonatal health and other services that has been underutilized. This may call for a multi-pronged strategy involving: Utilizing health promotion strategies and techniques such as: social mobilization, advocacy; social marketing; information, education, and communication (IEC); regulation and legislation; partnerships and alliances with public, private, non-governmental organization and civil society: and inter-sectoral action to address determinants of health to improve the use of underutilized health services .\n\n【113】It is also possible to provide access to universal health services through pooled pre-paid contribution collected based on ability to pay through the tax based funding . The other alternative, if it is not possible to solve the inefficiency problem through the improved utilization of hospital health services, is to transfer the excess health staff, beds and drugs to health clinics, health posts and other health stations located in remote areas. However, an efficiency analysis of these lower level health facilities should guide this.\n\n【114】### Total factor productivity change \n\n【115】The average MTFP of 0.964 for hospitals in eastern Ethiopia was comparable to those obtained in China inland of 0.985 , Greece of 0.986--0.988 , Ireland country of 0.977 , South Africa of 0.879 , and Taiwan 0.788 . Unlike hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia, several countries hospitals had an average MTFP score greater than one signifying productivity growth. Portugal had 1.042  Ireland regional hospitals had 1.028 , India district hospital had 1.235 , Angola municipal hospital had 1.045  and China coastal hospitals had 1.121 .\n\n【116】Technical progress registered by hospitals may have been the result of applying better techniques with regard to both physical and human capital which allowed greater output with health system inputs held constant. This improvement could also have resulted from increases in motivation and/or skill of the health workforce.\n\n【117】Technical progress (or regression) depends on different factors. These factors may include: the availability of appropriate health technology which require minimum skill with accompanying inputs and institutional changes. The existence of close cooperation of health policy makers and the hospital management is also essential. Moreover, it is also important to equip the relevant health workforce so that they will be able to use the new technology efficiently .\n\n【118】### Determinants of inefficiency of hospitals \n\n【119】Random effect Tobit model showed that teaching status of the hospital (Teachstat), medical doctor total staff ratio (Dcstaff), outpatient visits to inpatient days ratio (Opinpdays), and proportion of inpatients treated per medical doctor (impdoc) significantly determine the hospitals inefficiency in the study area.\n\n【120】Accordingly, the fact that teaching status of the hospital (Teachstat) has hospital is positively effect on inefficiency score of the hospital implies that being a teaching hospital reduces the expected efficiency. This might be related to the focus that these teaching hospitals are given in terms of materials and other necessary inputs. These teaching hospitals offer specialized services that attract patients. The hospital that provides both health services and training are less efficient than other hospitals. This finding may explain that teaching hospitals are a place where knowledge, skills, and experience are obtained through practical training, learning, and demonstration in the hospital. Doing these learning and teaching alongside with provision of the health services may complicate and adds to inefficiency of the hospitals. This is may be because of teaching hospitals may not get focused on the activities as they care for both the academics and health services provision. Moreover, teaching hospitals care much the training, education, skills, that their staffs and students must acquire from the hospital.\n\n【121】The fact that the proportion of medical doctors to the total staff (Dcstaff) negatively related to inefficiency implies that for an increase in ratio of medical doctors to the total staff there is a decrease in inefficiency score of hospitals. In the hospital, medical doctors are the staffs that have the highest level of education and training, and this may positively increase the efficiencies of the hospital. It may also be related to the spillover effect of the doctors to the other staffs. Additionally, this might be related to the improvement that might occur in facilitating service delivery associated with increasing of doctors as their quantity is few in developing country compared to the number of patient each serve. In contrast to this result, a study conducted in West Bengal in India by  discovered that doctor staff ratio negatively affected the technical efficiency of hospitals.\n\n【122】The negative relation between outpatient visits to inpatient day ratio (Opinpdays) and hospital inefficiency score indicates that an increase in the ratio of outpatient visit to inpatient days would lead to a decrease in hospital expected inefficiency score of hospitals. This result also agrees with the result obtained by  in the study of determinants of technical efficiency of hospitals in Eritrea. Similarly,  also discovered the same result in the case of determinants of technical efficiency of hospitals in South Africa.\n\n【123】The proportion of inpatients treated per medical doctor (Impdoc) is negatively related to inefficiency score of hospitals. This shows that the number of inpatients per medical doctor has negative relationship with inefficiency score. This implies that an increase in the ratio of inpatient per doctor would drop the predicted value of inefficiency score of hospitals. This finding may explain that there is a need to efficiently use available doctors and hospitals that provide health services. By doing so, efficiency and standard ratio of inpatients to the doctors can be maintained.\n\n【124】Conclusion and recommendation \n=============================\n\n【125】This study attempts to analysis technical efficiency of hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. To achieve the objective of the study DEA, MTFP, and Tobit model are used. The DEA used to estimate the efficiency score of hospitals, MTFP used to analyses productivity change of hospitals and Tobit model used to analysis factors that determine inefficiency of hospitals.\n\n【126】Estimate of DEA indicates that under a VRS assumption, 6 (50%), 5 (42%), 3 (25%), 3 (25%), 4 (33%) and 3 (25%), while under a CRS assumption, 9 (75%), 9 (75%), 8 (67%), 7 (58%), 7 (58%) and 8 (67%) of the 12 hospitals were run inefficiently between 2007/08 and 2012/13. The results also indicate that 9 (75%), 9 (75%), 7 (58%), 7 (53%), 7 (58%) and 8 (67%) of the 12 hospitals were scale inefficient between 2007/08 and 2012/13. The estimate of the MTFP indicates that among the 12 hospitals, 7 (58%) experienced MTFP deterioration over the six years. The Tobit model indicates that teaching hospital is less efficient than other hospitals. The Tobit regression model further indicates that medical doctor to total staff ratio, the proportion of outpatient visit to inpatient days, and the proportion of inpatients treated per medical doctor were negatively related with technical inefficiency of hospitals.\n\n【127】Based on the findings, the following policy recommendations are forwarded. Further improvements can be made in the hospitals' efficiency by taking the following policy measures.➢ Hospitals should monitor their services delivery efficiency and need to identify inputs that are underutilized. This may help hospitals identify which input need to increase or decrease or transfer to other health services facilities so that the use of underutilized health sector services will be promoted.➢ Hospitals should monitor their services delivery efficiency and need to identify output that fall short of targets. This may help hospitals identify which output/services need to increase or decrease so that they may deliver better services. In this regard, it is crucial to institutionalize efficiency monitoring of health facilities within health management information system. This can be implemented by either having section with in structure of each hospital that study the efficiency or regularly hiring study agent. By doing so hospitals may maintain their pure efficiency, scale efficiency and/or technical efficiency and thereby total factor productivity in delivering the service would increase.➢ Policy interventions that increase utilization of underutilized hospital outpatient health services and reduce the average length of stay, increase doctor to other staff ratio and the number of inpatients treated per doctor would contribute to improve the technical efficiency of hospitals. This may be achieved by provision of the capacity building like training for the staff members of the hospitals on efficient resource utilization and service delivery. Increasing the health staffs that considers the population of the study area and standard of the health staff to patient ratio may help improve the efficiency of the hospitals. This can be achieved through hiring additional health staffs, and upgrading the capacity of the existing staffs through provision of on job training.\n\n【128】We are immensely grateful to the East Hararghe Zone, Harari Region, and Dire Dawa city council Hospitals for their cooperation in data collection.

IV. A post-coupling technique.\nA post-coupling semipermeable membrane technique for determining the activity of acid phosphatase in sections of skeletal muscle has been developed and investigated for its reproducibility and validity. Cryostat sections of unfixed muscle mounted on dry dialysis membranes are first incubated for 1-4 at 37 degrees C on a gelled medium containing 4 mM naphthol AS-BI phosphate buffered at pH 5. They are next transferred to another gel containing only hexazotised Pararosanaline and incubated for a further 30 min. Finally, they are treated with 70% ethanol, dried in air, and mounted. The final reaction product (FRP) deposited within muscle fibres is mostly distributed as a fine reticular network, tentatively identified as sarcoplasmic reticulum. Large FRP \"granules' of the kind observed with Meijer's simultaneous coupling membrane technique are not formed. The method is reproducible and valid in terms of several working criteria. For example, the mean absorbance of the FRP at its absorption maximum increases linearly with incubation time; and in model sections containing various amounts of a subcellular fraction rich in acid phosphatase, the mean absorbance after a constant incubation time is proportional to the enzyme concentration. FRP is formed at approximately twice the rate it is deposited in the simultaneous coupling method. The most important advantage of the post-coupling method over the simultaneous coupling method is that the inhibition of the enzyme by coupling reagents is avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In this study, we report our institutional experience with FNA of the thyroid bed and propose practical diagnostic categories. A retrospective chart review of all thyroid bed FNAs between April 2008 and January 2013 was performed, and a cohort of 39 patients was retrieved. The cytology diagnoses were divided into 5 categories including nondiagnostic, inflammatory/reactive, bland follicular cells, suspicious for neoplasm/malignancy, and malignant. The follow-up histologic and/or clinical findings were collected for each category. The 39 patients included 9 males and 30 females (ages 15-79 years). Prior thyroidectomies were due to papillary thyroid carcinoma (31 cases), follicular carcinoma (3 cases), medullary carcinoma (1 case), Hürthle cell carcinoma (1 case), malignancy unspecified (1 case), follicular adenoma (1 case), and multinodular goiter (1 case). Overall, 33% (13 cases) of thyroid bed FNAs were nondiagnostic, and 10% (4 cases) were categorized as \"inflammatory/reactive.\" None of the patients in these 2 categories demonstrated evidence of clinical recurrence.

We investigated the identity, production, and mechanism of the action of PIF. PIF activity was demonstrated in supernatants from nine of 44 phytohemagglutinin-stimulated interleukin 2 (IL 2)-dependent T cell lines and clones derived from purified T4+ cells, but was not found in supernatants from 26 lines and clones derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T8+ cells. In addition, PIF was produced by four of four antigen-specific T cell lines and clones after stimulation with the appropriate antigen and antigen-presenting cells, and by HUT-102, a human T cell lymphotropic virus type I-transformed T cell line. PIF from all of these sources caused significant inhibition of U937 proliferation. This proliferation-inhibiting activity co-purified with phagocytosis-enhancing activity in sizing procedures and isoelectric focusing, which yielded an estimated m.w. of 35,000 to 55,000 and an estimated isoelectric point of 5.0 to 6.0 for PIF. In contrast, IL 2, recombinant interferon-alpha, and recombinant interferon-gamma had no effect on phagocytosis by U937 cells, and antibodies to interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma did not block the phagocytosis-inducing activity of PIF-containing supernatants. PIF appears to be a distinct lymphokine produced by a subset of T4+ lymphocytes, possibly those that proliferate in response to antigen.

The current means of acquiring these properties in the in vivo and ex vivo states is fraught with problems, including limited accessibility and unknown boundary conditions in the former, and unnatural behavior in the latter. This paper presents a new testing method where a whole porcine liver is perfused under physiologic conditions and tested in an ex vivo setting. To characterize the effects of perfusion on the viscoelastic response of liver, indentation devices made force and displacement measurements across four conditions: in vivo, ex vivo perfused, ex vivo post perfused, and in vitro on an excised section. One device imposed cyclic perturbations on the liver's surface, inducing nominal strains up to 5% at frequencies from 0.1 to 200 Hz. The other device measured 300 s of the organ's creep response to applied loads, inducing nominal surface stresses of 6.9-34.7 kPa and nominal strains up to 50%. Results from empirical models indicate that the viscoelastic properties of liver change with perfusion and that two time constants on the order of 1.86 and 51.3s can characterize the liver under large strains typical of surgical manipulation across time periods up to 300 s. Unperfused conditions were stiffer and more viscous than the in vivo state, resulting in permanent strain deformation with repeated indentations.

An article that is felt to have greater importance and higher impact by the scientific community is more likely to be cited and therefore may be more influential on current healthcare practice. Articles and journals can be ranked based on the number of citations they receive. Bibliometric analysis also reveals topics of current interest, identifies potential novel techniques and shows historical developments in that subject . Medical researchers have used bibliometric analysis to identify the most influential papers in their clinical specialties, including orthopaedic surgery  and oncology .\n\n【2】Worldwide, the prognosis of oesophageal cancer, including gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (OC), is poor. Overall 5-year survival in the UK is approximately 13 % . As a part of the diagnostic pathway, patients undergo a variety of staging investigations to assess the extent of disease. Radiological staging is performed to further inform management decisions by the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). Accurate radiological staging is vital to ensure the most appropriate treatment is selected. Currently, OC is staged according to the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) Tumour Node Metastasis (TNM) 7th edition .\n\n【3】In the UK, patients with OC are initially staged with CT of the thorax and abdomen to exclude irresectable disease or distant metastases.

This study demonstrates that accuracy of staging was the most frequently studied topic (n = 63) 删除21:<u></u>. Accurate staging investigations are vital to inform appropriate treatment decisions, providing the best chance of survival for the patient whilst minimising harm from over- or under-treatment. The most cited article was Flamen et al. which investigated the use of PET in potentially operable OC.\n\n【25】The OC staging pathway is complex, utilising various modalities with different strengths and weaknesses. PET/CT is superior to CT for detection of distant metastases and influences the change of MDT management decisions in up to 38 % of patients , whereas EUS is superior to CT for T-staging . Comparison of techniques allows a modality to be tested against the perceived \"gold-standard\" staging investigation. This may reflect the desire for a simplified staging pathway with fewer investigations or the desire to increase evidence and awareness of a particular modality, thus introducing potential publication bias.\n\n【26】Influential articles are more likely to be cited by the scientific and clinical community. These citations form the basis of a journal's impact factor. The impact factor quantifies the average number of citations per manuscript published within that journal during a specific time period. Therefore, journals with a higher impact factor are recognised as being of higher quality and more likely to contain influential articles.\n\n【27】Radiological OC staging appeals to specialist radiologists and other members of the upper gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer MDT, and its clinical impact is great. The overall median 2014 and 5-year impact factors were 5.238 and 5.225, respectively, demonstrating that this field of research, often producing novel results, in a specific cancer population is not likely to be published in high-impact journals. The Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) had the highest 5-year impact factor (16.971) of articles in the 100 most cited.\n\n【28】In total, only 29 of the 100 most cited articles were published in radiology-related journals. This could represent the desire to achieve publication in a high-impact journal. The majority of radiology-related journals have impact factors \\<5.00. Only 16 % of the top 100 articles were published in radiology-related journals with a 5-year impact factor \\>5.00 (Radiology, Journal of Nuclear Medicine and European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging). It may also reflect a lack of research conducted by radiologists, which is supported by evidence from a National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) survey in 2012, which commented upon the lack of academic radiologists .\n\n【29】Many of the first authors (n = 65) are not affiliated to radiology departments, according to Thomas Reuters Web of Science citation indexing database. It is possible the authors work closely with a radiologist as part of the specialist Upper GI cancer MDT or have a clinical radiologist as a named co-author.\n\n【30】EUS was the most commonly investigated modality overall. This may be a reflection of the current reliance and importance of EUS for T and N staging, considered the current \"gold standard\" .\n\n【31】Despite EUS being the most frequently investigated modality, the ten articles with the highest citation rates all investigated functional PET imaging. The CT component of the PET/CT examinations provided attenuation correction for PET data. Many PET/CT topics of research are relatively novel and have been described in other types of cancer. One of these topics, texture analysis, is the subject of the article with the highest citation rate . Novel subjects are less likely to be published in high-impact journals, but may well be considered influential and provide the catalyst for future research.\n\n【32】Four of the PET/CT articles with the highest citation rates \\[, \\] investigated its use in assessing treatment response. There is significant interest in the capability of metabolic imaging to assess for early treatment response, but these techniques have not been standardised for use outside of clinical research studies . PET/CT scanning is expensive, and costly research could potentially only produce marginal long-term benefits for patients. The paradox of healthcare is that innovation increases expense, rather than producing more cost-effective and efficient processes, as is the case in industry . These articles however are likely to be highly influential in forthcoming years, as the use of PET/CT increases in cancer imaging.\n\n【33】This bibliometric analysis has a number of limitations. Citation rates can be misleading because of various biases, e.g. institutional, language or self-citation bias. Older articles tend to accrue more citations compared to newer research. We attempted to adjust for this by calculating a citation rate, which may provide information regarding the importance and potential influence that the research has. This in itself has limitations as the likelihood of citation rises with increasing numbers of published articles in peer-reviewed journals. Only articles written in English were included, which may have excluded some frequently cited research in other languages. Also, this study concentrated on radiological staging rather than other techniques such as endoscopy and laparoscopy.\n\n【34】The expanding volume of published literature has increased significantly over the past few decades. Between 1978 to 1985 and 1994 to 2001, the annual number of Medline articles increased by 46 %, particularly in the area of clinical research . The annual rate of publication growth in PubMed Medline was 5.6 % between 1997 and 2006, equating to a \"doubling time\" of 13 years . This may explain the higher citation rate of PET/CT compared to that of EUS, as PET/CT is a more recent innovation. Overall, there are now more articles published per annum compared to previous years. This would therefore potentially increase the citation rate as a matter of course, not necessarily reflecting higher importance.\n\n【35】As expected, the older articles only described CT and perhaps a review of the last 10 years of literature only may be more reflective of contemporary staging practice. Another limitation is that only the first and senior authors of the articles were included in the current analysis. It is possible that these authors contributed to other articles in this list, but would not have been counted during analysis. These authors may therefore be under-represented in terms of published article numbers and have had a greater influence on current OC staging.\n\n【36】Of the 29 articles comparing imaging techniques or modalities, 17 studies correlated imaging findings and histopathological diagnosis, widely regarded as the \"gold standard\". Limitations exist in radiological studies that compare new findings against a potentially inaccurate alternative imaging test. In this current study, articles that did not compare against pathological results included those investigating radiotherapy planning techniques and the diagnosis of distant metastases. In these studies, tissue was not necessarily sampled. There are several reasons why pathological confirmation is not possible. These include patients undergoing non-surgical management, which is true of the majority of cases of OC, and in situations where it would be unethical to obtain tissue purely for research purposes, such as in patients with unequivocal distant metastases.\n\n【37】There are further limitations of studies comparing imaging findings to histopathological specimens. Comparison of pre-treatment imaging characteristics in patients receiving neo-adjuvant therapy prior to surgery can be inaccurate, as the chemotherapy or radiotherapy may alter the morphology of the tumour. In this situation, a direct comparison is often not possible.\n\n【38】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【39】This bibliometric analysis describes the 100 most cited articles in the field of radiological OC staging investigations. Common topics of investigation include the accuracy of staging, comparison of modalities, treatment response and assessment of lymph nodes for metastases. The majority of articles are published outside of radiology-related journals, which may reflect the desire for high-impact publications or perhaps a lack of radiologists conducting imaging research. This study provides an understanding of research that has influenced current OC staging and citation rates may suggest important topics for future research, particularly validation studies of innovative techniques in larger patient populations.\n\n【40】KF would like to acknowledge the support of the Wales Clinical Academic Training (WCAT) fellowship programme.

{"seq_id": "5754dab3-1d80-4a7d-830a-a4d84cf6ffe3", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction \n============\n\n【1】Impulsivity encompasses a wide variety of behavioural phenomena, often described as a predisposition towards rapid, unplanned responses to internal or external stimuli with a diminished regard for their negative consequences . In its pathological form, impulsivity represents one of three main symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder \\[ADHD; DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association \\]. Treatment of ADHD relies on typical psychostimulant drugs, notably amphetamine and methylphenidate, which act to increase both noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity in the brain by blocking the noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) transporters . However, despite their clinical efficacy, the precise mechanism of action of these treatments is poorly understood.\n\n【2】Clues to the aetiology of ADHD have mainly emerged from brain imaging studies in affected individuals, which strongly implicate brain DA dysfunction. For example, PET studies demonstrate impaired presynaptic DA function in the prefrontal cortex , dysfunction of the dopamine transporter , and decreased DA D2/ D3 receptor availability . Further insights have emerged from animal models of impulsivity (Fernando and Robbins ), for example in rats exhibiting high impulsive behaviour assessed using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT), which show a reduced density of DA D2/D3 receptors in the ventral striatum . However, the relative involvement of DA D2 and DA D3 receptors in modulating behavioural impulsivity is largely unknown. In a recent study, infusions of the DA D3 receptor preferring antagonist nafadotride in the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAcb) further exacerbated impulsive behaviour in high impulsive (HI) rats. In contrast, infusions of the same compound in the core subregion of the NAcb reduced impulsivity . Since DA D3 receptors are present in low abundance in the NAcb core relative to the shell (Booze and Wallace ; Curran and Watson ), these findings suggest separable roles of DA D2 and D3 receptors in the control of impulsivity. To test this possibility, we investigated the effects of the selective DA D2 receptor agonist sumanirole  on impulsive responding in rats selected on the 5CSRTT. We hypothesized that HI rats would respond differentially to sumanirole if DA D2 receptors were selectively downregulated in these animals. For comparison, we also tested the effects of the DA D2/3 receptor agonist quinpirole in rats selected for extreme impulsivity phenotypes (HI and low impulsive 'LI') on the 5CSRTT, as well as methylphenidate and the selective DAT inhibitor GBR 12909 (Heikkila and Manzino ).\n\n【3】Interest has also focused on the brain noradrenergic system as a potential target for the treatment of ADHD (Biederman and Spencer ). Atomoxetine is the first non-stimulant-based medication with proven efficacy in ADHD , which acts by blocking the uptake of NA in the brain , thereby facilitating noradrenergic modulation of limbic cortico-striatal circuitry . Atomoxetine has been shown to be effective in reducing impulsivity in rats on the 5CSRTT (Blondeau and Dellu-Hagedorn ), delay discounting impulsivity, and impulsive behaviour on a stop-signal reaction time task . Although the primary mechanism of action of atomoxetine is well understood, the downstream effects of increased synaptic NA function are poorly characterised. These effects may involve postsynaptic α2-adrenoceptors as guanfacine, a selective α2-adrenoceptor agonist, possesses clinical efficacy in ADHD  and improves response inhibition in rodents . In the present study, therefore, we compared the effects of atomoxetine and guanfacine in LI and HI rats, specifically to investigate whether these compounds produce quantitatively similar effects on spontaneously high levels of impulsivity in rats.\n\n【4】Methods and materials \n=====================\n\n【5】Subjects \n--------\n\n【6】Subjects were three cohorts of male Lister hooded rats (Charles River, Margate, UK) weighing 275--300 g at the start of each experiment and maintained at 85% of their free-feeding weight. Subjects were housed initially in groups of four with controlled temperature and humidity conditions under an alternating light/dark cycle (red lights on from 7.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m.) and with water available ad libitum. The first cohort of rats (eight HI, seven LI) was treated with methylphenidate, atomoxetine and guanfacine, in that order, and each following a washout period of 1 week. The second cohort was treated with quinpirole (eight HI, eight LI), whilst the third cohort (seven HI, seven LI) was treated with sumanirole and GBR 12909 (again separated by a 1-week washout period). Three rats were excluded from the study (two LI rats from the second and third cohorts and one HI rat from the first cohort) due to unstable performance on the 5CSRTT prior to the drug challenges.\n\n【7】Behavioural training \n--------------------\n\n【8】Subjects were trained to detect the spatial location of a brief light stimulus presented in one of five open apertures and to refrain from responding at inappropriate times, as described previously . A correct response was rewarded with the delivery of a single 45-mg sucrose pellet in the rear magazine (Noyes dustless pellets, 45 mg; Sandown Scientific, UK). An incorrect nose poke response in a non-illuminated aperture or a failure to respond within the set time period resulted in no reward delivery and a timeout period of 5 s that was occasioned by the house light being extinguished. A premature response, taken as a measure of impulsivity (Robbins ), was recorded for responses made in any aperture before the visual cue light had been presented; again, this led to a 5-s timeout period. Subjects were trained to a level of at least 80% accuracy with an intertrial interval (ITI) of 5 s, stimulus duration (SD) of 0.5 s and a limited hold period of 5 s to make a response. Each cohort of rats then underwent a screening procedure to select rats exhibiting extreme impulsivity phenotypes (LI and HI). During these sessions the ITI was extended to 7 s to promote the occurrence of a premature response . The long ITI (LITI) session consisted of 100 trials and was followed by two baseline days (ITI 5 s, SD 0.5 s) and two further days where rats remained in their home cage. This schedule was repeated three times at weekly intervals. The number of premature responses for each LITI session was averaged and ranked. Rats were designated high or low impulsive rats based on the criteria of premature responses greater than or equal to 50 premature for all three LITI sessions ('HI') or premature responses less than or equal to 30 for all LITI sessions ('LI'), as adopted previously . Rats were then individually housed and stabilised on the 5CSRTT for five consecutive days prior to drug testing.\n\n【9】Drugs \n-----\n\n【10】(R)-Quinpirole, guanfacine hydrochloride and methylphenidate hydrochloride were commercially sourced (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and dissolved in 0.9% saline. Atomoxetine hydrochloride was a generous gift from Eli Lilly Inc. and was dissolved in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline. Sumanirole ((R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H-imidazo\\[4,5,1-ij\\]quinolin-2(1H)-one (Z)-2-butenedioate) was synthesized by Mu-Fa Zou in the Medicinal Chemistry Section, NIDA-IRP, NIH, Baltimore, USA, using the published synthesis  and was dissolved in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline. GBR 12909 dihydrochloride was purchased from Sigma (Germany) and dissolved in distilled deionised water.\n\n【11】Behavioural testing \n-------------------\n\n【12】Drugs were injected in a volume of 1 ml/kg using a Latin square design. Methylphenidate, atomoxetine, guanfacine and GBR 12909 were administered intraperitoneally, 20 min before behavioural testing on the 5CSRTT. Quinpirole and sumanirole were injected subcutaneously 90 and 15 min, respectively, before behavioural testing. Test sessions consisted of 100 trials, an SD of 0.5 s and an ITI of 5 s and were generally 25 min in duration.\n\n【13】Data analysis \n-------------\n\n【14】Behavioural data were subjected to a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the SPSS statistical package (v19).

GBR 12909 significantly increased premature responding (dose---F~(2.250,\\ 27.00)~ = 3.618, p \\< 0.05; Fig. [1e]), an effect that did not significantly interact with baseline levels of impulsivity, although there was a tendency for this compound to reduce impulsivity in HI rats at the lowest dose tested. No other behavioural measures were significantly affected by GBR 12909, including omissions, response latencies and accuracy.\n\n【22】Atomoxetine \n-----------\n\n【23】Atomoxetine produced a significant reduction in premature responding (dose---F通用删除7(英):<u>~(4,\\ 52)</u>~ = 5.312, p = 0.001; group × dose \\[F通用删除7(英):<u>~(4,\\ 52)</u>~ = 2.539 p = 0.051\\]; Fig. [2a]), and a significant increase in the number of omissions \\[F~(2.290,\\ 29.766)~ = 6.375, p \\< 0.005; Fig. [2b]\\]. These effects were inseparable with doses of atomoxetine affecting premature responding in HI rats also significantly increasing omissions (i.e. 1 and 3 mg/kg).

Selective inhibition of the NA and DA transporters by atomoxetine and GBR 12909, respectively, decreased and increased impulsive behaviour on the 5CSRTT, whereas methylphenidate, a compound used widely to treat ADHD, was without significant effect. Activation of DA D2-like receptors by the D2/3 receptor agonist quinpirole and the selective D2 receptor agonist sumanirole resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in impulsivity that, at lower doses (0.01 mg/kg quinpirole and 0.1 mg/kg sumanirole), was selectively mediated and devoid of effects on attentional accuracy as well as the speed and rate of responding 删除21:<u></u>. Higher doses of quinpirole and sumanirole resulted in more general effects on performance and behavioural output. However, these non-specific effects differed between HI and LI rats with sumanirole producing less pronounced effects on omissions (a gross measure of inattention) than quinpirole. Moreover, the slowing of responding produced by higher doses of quinpirole and the concomitant rise in omissions was blunted in high impulsive rats compared with low impulsive rats. By contrast, the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, guanfacine, produced qualitatively and quantitatively similar effects on behavioural performance in rats selected for high and low impulsivity compared with atomoxetine. Taken together, the present results indicate that high impulsivity in rats can be remediated by direct and indirect NA and DA agonists. These effects appear dissociable from the potential confounding influence of behavioural activation mechanisms, specifically following low doses of quinpirole and sumanirole.\n\n【30】Previous research has established that high impulsivity of rats on the 5CSRTT predicts the escalation of cocaine, nicotine and sucrose self-administration , and also a tendency towards compulsive cocaine seeking and to relapse . High impulsive rats also show reduced DA D2/3 receptor binding in the ventral striatum, including the NAcb, but not the dorsal striatum  and reduced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core . High impulsivity is remediated by the DA D2/3 receptor antagonist nafadotride infused in the nucleus accumbens core but exacerbated by infusions of the same compound in the shell subregion . This evidence together with findings that DA D2 receptor antagonism in the nucleus accumbens core reduces impulsivity produced by systemic amphetamine as well as selective PFC lesions  highlights an important role of DA-ergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens core in regulating impulsive-like behaviour.\n\n【31】Similar to recently reported effects of full and partial D2/3 receptor agonists in selected impulsive rats , systemic administration of sumanirole and quinpirole resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in impulsivity. Although floor effects in the low impulsive group may have had a bearing on these results, low doses of sumanirole were effective in selectively reducing premature responding in high impulsive rats. Sumanirole is a highly selective D2 receptor agonist possessing a 200-fold greater affinity for D2 than D1, D3 and D4 receptors  and thus may be a useful compound to determine whether D2 rather than D3 receptors are selectively disrupted in high impulsive rats. Our results show that sumanirole and quinpirole produce a broadly equivalent profile of effects on impulsivity, omissions and speed of responding with one exception; high impulsives were less sensitive to the effects of quinpirole on omissions. The origin of this possible divergent response is unknown and plausibly may also have been detected in rats treated with higher doses of sumanirole. Previous research indicates that the direct administration of quinpirole in the nucleus accumbens core, an area with a low abundance of D3 receptors , does not increase omissions even after relatively high doses . Indeed, microinfusions of the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride in the core leads to a significant increase in omissions on the 5CSRTT . Moreover, although quinpirole likewise increased omissions on this task when infused in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), this effect was no different between low and high impulsive rats . Thus, the differential increase in omissions induced by quinpirole in HI and LI rats appears to be mediated by structures other than the nucleus accumbens core and OFC.\n\n【32】The neural loci underlying the reduction in impulsive behaviour following quinpirole and sumanirole administration remain to be clarified but putatively may involve the PFC (including the OFC), nucleus accumbens and DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area . In a recent study, intra-OFC quinpirole administration in low and high impulsive rats produced a generalized disruption in performance on the 5CSRTT with effects on premature responding, accuracy, omissions and response latencies . Such effects suggest that D2/3 receptors in this region do not play a selective role in impulse control. The disruptive effects of intra-OFC quinpirole in this setting could potentially be mediated through effects on postsynaptic D2/3 receptors since mesocortical DA neurons are deficient in (or lack) presynaptic autoreceptors . However, the same is not true of mesolimbic DA neurons innervating the nucleus accumbens, which are subject to regulation by D2/3 autoreceptors . Thus, the decrease in impulsivity caused by low-dose quinpirole and sumanirole may be due, in part, to diminished DA release in the nucleus accumbens, leading in turn to a reduction in behavioural activation (Robbins and Everitt ). A plausible candidate for this effect is the postsynaptic D1 receptor as blockade of these receptors in the core, but not the shell, of the nucleus accumbens reduced impulsivity on the 5CSRTT , whereas administration of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 in the core had the opposite effect .\n\n【33】Systemic administration of atomoxetine, a selective NA reuptake inhibitor , and guanfacine, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist , resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in impulsivity but at doses which also increased omissions and adversely affected the speed of responding. Such non-specific effects are consistent with reports of sedation in animal studies  and clinical subgroups treated with guanfacine . At higher doses, atomoxetine also appeared to exhibit sedative effects as reflected by increased response latencies, omissions as well as reduced general activity . However, lower doses have been shown to selectively reduce impulsivity on a broad range of tasks, including the 5CSRTT , stop-signal reaction time task and the delay discounting paradigm . The lack of selective effects of atomoxetine in the present study may be due to the inclusion of high impulsive rats, which exhibited a more pronounced response than low impulsive rats (in terms of omissions and response latencies) to a moderate dose of atomoxetine (1 mg/kg). Atomoxetine and guanfacine are postulated to facilitate PFC function and improve sustained attention by indirectly or directly stimulating postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors  reflected in the similar behavioural effects of these compounds in the present study. Table 1Summary of the main behavioural effects of direct and indirect noradrenergic and dopaminergic agonists on the behavioural performance of rats on the five-choice serial reaction time task↑ Increase with respect to vehicle, ↓ with respect to vehicle, − no change with respect to vehicle. Note that the effects on premature responding for quinpirole and sumanirole occur at doses with no effects on response latencies or omissions.\n\n【34】The primary effects of methylphenidate in the brain are to increase NA and DA neurotransmission by blocking the NA and DA transporters . Consistent with earlier findings , selective blockade of the DA transporter by GBR 12909 in the present study resulted in a significant increase in premature responding. Based on previous evidence, this effect was most likely mediated by the activation of D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, in particular within its core subregion. Thus, in addition to the prominent role for D1 receptors in impulsivity , D2 receptors also powerfully modulate the effects of stimulant drugs such as d-amphetamine on impulse control . This interaction has recently been localised to the nucleus accumbens core as demonstrated by the complete blockade of d-amphetamine-induced impulsivity on the 5CSRTT by intra-core infusions of the D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride . Moreover, the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride strongly attenuates the elevation in premature responding induced by PFC lesions when directly administered in the nucleus accumbens core .\n\n【35】In the present study, methylphenidate did not significantly affect premature responding in high and low impulsive rats. Previous studies report increased impulsivity in rats treated with methylphenidate when tested with the usual constant ITI in the 5CSRTT , and our present findings indicate that this was indeed the case for low impulsive rats with a near doubling in the frequency of premature responses following the administration of methylphenidate. In the less common variant of the task when premature responses are recorded but not punished, methylphenidate has the opposite effect and reduces impulsivity . Earlier evidence also indicates that low-dose methylphenidate improves visual attention and lowers impulsivity in rats selected for poor baseline performance on the 5CSRTT . Thus, the effects of methylphenidate on impulse control are evidently dependent on baseline levels of impulsivity, consistent with the rate-dependent effects of this compound in children (Robbins and Sahakian ). Such a relationship seen in this study with methylphenidate suggests at least two mechanisms, which may not be mutually exclusive. Firstly, the effects of NA, which functions to inhibit impulsive responding, may be greater in high impulsive rats or at least sufficient to cancel out the DA-enhancing effects of methylphenidate. Secondly, the behavioural activating effects of DA are blunted in high impulsive rats. This second mechanism would be compatible with the finding of reduced D2/3 receptor availability in high impulsive rats  if indeed such effects were localised to the nucleus accumbens core. Finally it should be noted that we observed a large inter-individual response to methylphenidate in high impulsive rats, especially at higher doses. This variation may reflect differences in the extent of the primary neurochemical deficit in hyper-impulsive rats in terms of NA and DA function or polymorphisms of the NA and DA transporter genes which may underlie variation in the clinical response to methylphenidate .\n\n【36】In conclusion, the main findings of this study indicate that dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms have divergent functional roles in the modulation of hyper-impulsivity in rats on the five-choice serial reaction time task. In contrast to the direct and indirect NA receptor agonists guanfacine and atomoxetine, the selective D2/3 receptor agonists sumanirole and quinpirole attenuated impulsivity on this task at doses that did not produce excessive sedation. The differential effects of quinpirole in high impulsive rats are consistent with D2/3 receptor dysfunction in this subset of animals, which may have relevance for the elucidation of neural vulnerability mechanisms underlying stimulant addiction.\n\n【37】This study was supported by the Wellcome Trust Programme grant to TWR, JWD, Barry J.

The hierarchical relationship among members of this large class, which comprises a single order and a single family, has proven difficult to determine based upon 16S rRNA gene trees and morphological and physiological characteristics. This work reports detailed phylogenetic and comparative genomic studies on >100 halobacterial (haloarchaeal) genomes containing representatives from 30 genera to investigate their evolutionary relationships. In phylogenetic trees reconstructed on the basis of 32 conserved proteins, using both neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood methods, two major clades (clades A and B) encompassing nearly two-thirds of the sequenced haloarchaeal species were strongly supported. Clades grouping the same species/genera were also supported by the 16S rRNA gene trees and trees for several individual highly conserved proteins (RpoC, EF-Tu, UvrD, GyrA, EF-2/EF-G). In parallel, our comparative analyses of protein sequences from haloarchaeal genomes have identified numerous discrete molecular markers in the form of conserved signature indels (CSI) in protein sequences and conserved signature proteins (CSPs) that are found uniquely in specific groups of haloarchaea. Thirteen CSIs in proteins involved in diverse functions and 68 CSPs that are uniquely present in all or most genome-sequenced haloarchaea provide novel molecular means for distinguishing members of the class Halobacteria from all other prokaryotes. The members of clade A are distinguished from all other haloarchaea by the unique shared presence of two CSIs in the ribose operon protein and small GTP-binding protein and eight CSPs that are found specifically in members of this clade. Likewise, four CSIs in different proteins and five other CSPs are present uniquely in members of clade B and distinguish them from all other haloarchaea. Based upon their specific clustering in phylogenetic trees for different gene/protein sequences and the unique shared presence of large numbers of molecular signatures, members of clades A and B are indicated to be distinct from all other haloarchaea because of their uniquely shared evolutionary histories. Based upon these results, it is proposed that clades A and B be recognized as two new orders, Natrialbales ord. nov. and Haloferacales ord. nov. within the class Halobacteria, containing the novel families Natrialbaceae fam. nov. and Haloferacaceae fam. nov.

However, sometimes it may cause subfibular pain and may be associated with chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI). We hypothesized that os subfibulare could interrupt the talofibular space causing impingement, resulting in chronic pain and functional instability around the lateral malleolus. The purposes of this study were to analyze morphologic characteristics of os subfibulare, and to evaluate the clinical significance of the os subfibulare in patients with CLAI. Between November 2011 and April 2015, 70 patients who had both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among 252 patients who visited our hospital with the symptom of lateral ankle instability were included in this study. The location of the ossicle was classified into 3 zones in reference to the attachment site of the lateral ankle ligaments. The impingement was classified into 2 groups according to the presence of talofibular encroachment. Digital radiographs were used to measure the ossicle width and shape determined by the length and width on an magnetic resonance (MR) image. The most common shape of ossicles was oval, and the most common location of ossicles was at the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) attachment site. Sixty-one percent of patients showed talofibular impingement on coronal MR images. In 48 cases, the dimension of fibula plus os subfibulare was larger than that of the contralateral normal fibula. The larger size and talofibular impingement of the ossicle were associated with greater need for operative treatment in patients with ankle instability. The morphologic analysis of the os subfibulare revealed that there might be impingement of the talofibular space by the ossicle in some patients. We suggest that morphologic characteristics of the os subfibulare should be considered when selecting treatment options in patients with CLAI and os subfibulare.

As has been shown in other susceptible locations, vessel geometry, flow division rates, and pulsatility may result in hemodynamic conditions which influence the preferential localization of disease in the abdominal aorta segment. Pulsatile flow visualization was performed in a glass model of the aorta constructed from measurements of angiograms and cadaver aortas. Flow rates and pulsatile waveforms were varied to reflect typical physiological conditions. Under normal resting conditions, the flow patterns in the infrarenal aorta were more complex than those in the suprarenal location. Time varying vortex patterns appeared at the level of the renal arteries and propagated through the infrarenal aorta into the common iliac arteries. A region of oscillating velocity direction extended from the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation along the posterior wall. Dye became trapped along the posterior wall, requiring several cardiac cycles for clearance. In contrast, there was rapid clearance of the dye in the anterior aorta. Under postprandial conditions, the flow patterns in the aorta were basically unchanged. Simulated exercise conditions created laminar hemodynamic features very different from the resting conditions, including a decrease in dye residence time. This study reveals significant time-dependent variations in the hemodynamics of the abdominal aorta under differing physiologic conditions. Hemodynamic factors such as low wall shear stress, oscillating shear direction, and high particle residence time may be related to the clinically seen preferential plaque localization in the infrarenal aorta.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

ABMS often manifests in solids with aromatic groups, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and inhomogeneously broadens the NMR peaks of all nuclei in the sample. Inhomogeneous peaks with full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼1 ppm typically result from ABMS broadening and the low spectral resolution impedes the analysis of solid-state NMR spectra. ABMS broadening of solid-state NMR spectra has previously been eliminated using 2D multiple-quantum correlation experiments, or by performing NMR experiments on diluted materials or single crystals. However, these experiments are often infeasible due to their poor sensitivity and/or provide limited gains in resolution. 2D 1H-13C HETCOR experiments have previously been applied to reduce susceptibility broadening in paramagnetic solids and we show that this strategy can significantly reduce ABMS broadening in diamagnetic organic solids. Comparisons of 1D solid-state NMR spectra and 1H and 13C solid-state NMR spectra obtained from 2D 1H-13C HETCOR NMR spectra show that the HETCOR spectrum directly increases resolution by a factor of 1.5 to 8. The direct gain in resolution is determined by the ratio of the inhomogeneous 13C/1H linewidth to the homogeneous 1H linewidth, with the former depending on the magnitude of the ABMS broadening and the strength of the applied field and the latter on the efficiency of homonuclear decoupling. The direct gains in resolution obtained using the 2D HETCOR experiments are better than that obtained by dilution. For solids with long proton longitudinal relaxation times, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) was applied to enhance sensitivity and enable the acquisition of 2D 1H-13C HETCOR NMR spectra. 2D 1H-13C HETCOR experiments were applied to resolve and partially assign the NMR signals of the form I and form II polymorphs of aspirin in a sample containing both forms.

Persistence of, or repeated exposure to certain microbial pathogens, leads to chronically elevated levels of several etiologic inflammatory mediators, including the cytokines IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL-6 and IL-17 , that are considered to contribute to the onset of inflammatory diseases. Production of these cytokines typically ensues via host cell signalling cascades following the engagement of innate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed primarily by cells of the innate immune compartment, by pathogen-specific ligands, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) . Importantly, recent studies with gene-knockout mice and also human TLR polymorphisms have confirmed that TLR signaling in response to pathogen contact can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis . The mechanisms that underlie inflammatory cytokine induction following engagement of the TLR receptors have been well studied for a number of cytokines and commonly result in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a Rel-family transcription factor, followed by its binding to DNA sequences associated with the promoters of their target genes such as IL-12 . In addition to NF-κB activation, TLR signaling may also activate mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways that lead to activation of the transcription factor activating protein 1 (AP-1) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) signalling .\n\n【2】In contrast, whilst macrophage IL-17 production has been demonstrated to be important in allergic inflammation , pathways that culminate in the regulation of this proinflammatory cytokine in macrophages, however, have not yet been characterized.\n\n【3】Unlike most microbial pathogens, insect stages (promastigotes) of the protozoan trypanosomatid parasite Leishmaniaenter macrophage host cells in a way that eludes immediate \\\"classical\\\" proinflammatory activation. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that upon LPS stimulation of macrophages, IL-12 is actively suppressed by Leishmania. Leishmania major-infected C57/BL6 mice, also show an initial \\\"silent\\\" phase of parasite replication that persists in the dermis for up to 5 weeks  prior to disease resolution, indicating parasite-mediated immune evasion occurs in vivo. Experimental infections with L. amazonensisalso show early impairment of inflammatory responses . Importantly, microarray experiments also showed that infection of the human monocyte line, THP-1, with Leishmaniasuppressed the IFNγ-induced expression of many host genes .\n\n【4】Cameron et al.  showed that the suppression of LPS-induced IL-12 by L. mexicanacorrelated with degradation of the innate immune signaling MAP kinases JNK and ERK, and also components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating that Leishmaniamay promote a generalized abrogation of the inflammatory response.\n\n【5】Additional mechanisms that have been proposed for Leishmania\\'s ability to suppress inflammatory activation include the engagement of suppression-associated macrophage surface receptors such as complement receptor 3 (CR3) and the elaboration of suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 . Indeed, studies of macrophages from CR3-deficient mice have confirmed that CR3 engagement is involved in IL-12 suppression during Leishmaniainfection even in the presence of IFN-γ stimulation .\n\n【6】Although some progress toward understanding how Leishmaniasuppresses macrophage inflammatory responses has been made, our knowledge of the extent to which Leishmaniamodulates macrophage cytokine responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved, remains limited.\n\n【7】To further our understanding of host inflammatory responses modulated by Leishmania, we have explored the inflammation-suppressive effects of both L. majorand L. amazonensisin the context of macrophage infection during TLR4 stimulation, upon a broader range of cytokines than previously studied. These parasites represent two related but distinct microbes responsible for clinically distinct forms of leishmaniasis. Specifically, we studied the modulatory effects of L. majorand L. amazonensisupon the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-1α and TNF-α, the primary Th1-inducing proinflammatory cytokine, IL-12, and the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4,-13, -6,-10 and IL-3 . We also assayed for the macrophage inflammatory chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). We find that, although LPS-induced IL-17 and IL-12 are repressed by both Leishmaniaspecies, LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1α responses are enhanced. In addition, we determined that both Leishmaniaspecies suppress LPS-induced IL-6, -13 and -3. Furthermore, L. amazonensisalso suppressed LPS-induced IL-4 and IL-10 whereas both Leishmaniaspecies augmented LPS-induced MIP-1α and MCP-1 production. Our findings suggest, at least in the context of TLR4 stimulation, that Leishmaniapromastigotes do not promote generalized proinflammatory suppression and instead appear to target specific cytokine signalling pathways downstream of the TLR4 receptor, to selectively modulate cytokine and chemokine production during macrophage parasitization.\n\n【8】Methods\n=======\n\n【9】Isolation and Culture of Peritoneal Macrophages\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Peritoneal cells were isolated by lavage from C57/BL6 mice that were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory essentially as described previously , with the exception that RPMI-1640/10% FBS was used for peritoneal lavage.\n\n【11】The peritoneal cells were stained with macrophage markers F4/80, CD14, CD11b and CD 205 then analysed by flow cytometry to confirm their macrophage phenotype and adjusted to a cell density of 4 × 10^5^/ml.\n\n【12】Parasites\n---------\n\n【13】Promastigotes of L. majorstrain WHOM/IR/-/173 and L. amazonensisstrain IFLA/BR/67/PH8 (kindly provided by Dr David L.

Stationary phase parasites were centrifuged at 1300 × g and resuspended in RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS prior to addition to macrophage monolayers.\n\n【14】Macrophage Treatment\n--------------------\n\n【15】0.8 ml aliquots of macrophages (4 × 10^5^/ml) were incubated for 2 hr on 4-well glass chamber slides, washed to remove non-adherent cells, then co-incubated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml), followed by the addition of stationary phase promastigotes (20:1 parasite: macrophage), or 6 μm latex beads (Sigma) (20:1 bead: macrophage), as indicated in the Results. At 2, 8 or 19 hr timepoints, 200 μl of culture supernatant was removed and centrifuged to remove particulates prior to multiplex cytokine analysis.\n\n【16】Following removal of the 19 hr culture supernatants, the macrophages were washed twice with PBS and stained using Diff-Quik (DADE-Behring) as described previously , evaluated microscopically (approximately 200 fields observed) and infection/uptake rates determined to be 74%, 79% and 82% for L. majorand L. amazonensis, and latex beads respectively.\n\n【17】Multiplex cytokine analysis\n---------------------------\n\n【18】Multiplex cytokine analyses that were performed using a Bio-Plex kit (Bio-Rad) in accordance with manufacturer\\'s instructions and analysed using a Luminex machine (Luminex Corporation).\n\n【19】ELISA assays\n------------\n\n【20】Duplicate culture supernatants were removed at the 19 hr timepoint and assayed for cytokine production using ELISA kits from R&D systems, in accordance with manufacturers\\' instructions.\n\n【21】Results\n=======\n\n【22】Leishmania suppresses IL-17, IL-12 and IL-3 following induction with LPS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Despite recent interest in IL-17, a key cytokine involved in a variety immune responses, including the induction of other cytokines, its production from macrophages in the context of Leishmaniainfection has not been characterized. We therefore investigated the release of IL-17 from macrophages during infection with Leishmaniaalone, or during Leishmaniainfection in the presence of LPS. Although incubation of macrophages with either L. majoror L. amazonensisalone did not induce IL-17 production, nor significant levels of any other cytokine we assayed, stimulation with LPS alone caused significant IL-17 induction compared to controls, as shown in Figure [1A]. However, co-incubation of the macrophages with LPS in the presence of L. majoror L. amazonensisresulted in 7.1-fold and 13.1-fold suppression of IL-17, respectively, relative to LPS alone 删除21:<u></u>. To confirm that this suppression was not merely a consequence of non-specific phagocytic uptake, we also analysed IL-17 production from LPS in the presence of 6 μm latex beads that were of comparable size to Leishmania. In contrast to incubation with LPS and Leishmania, co-incubation of LPS with latex beads caused less than two-fold suppression compared to LPS alone 删除21:<u></u>, indicating these effects were Leishmania-specific. Since L. mexicanahas previously been shown to suppress LPS-induced IL-12 production , we also analysed the macrophage LPS-induced IL-12 response in the presence of L. majorand L. amazonensis, or latex beads as a non-specific phagocytosis control. As shown in Figure [1B], L. majorand L. amazonensissuppressed peak levels of LPS-induced IL-12 p40 subunit 3.3-fold and 4.7-fold respectively, supporting previous findings . In contrast, latex beads suppressed IL-12p40 production only 1.4-fold. Since it is the IL-12p70 heterodimer (IL-12p40/IL-12p35) that induces Th1 responses, we also sought to compare its regulation with IL-12p40. Although less striking than the down-regulation of IL-12 p40, Leishmania amazonensismediated 2-fold down-regulation of LPS-induced IL-12p70 at 19 hrs, whereas L. majorand latex beads, both showed modest suppression 删除21:<u></u>. We also investigated the effects of Leishmaniaupon the induction of IL-3 since IL-3 production may promote intracellular survival because it has been associated with differentiation of monocytes into macrophages that are less responsive to IFNγ than macrophages differentiated with GM-CSF .

When such responses become dysregulated or chronically activated, however, they contribute to the development of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and arthritis. Although significant advances, such as the identification of TLRs and their associated intracellular signalling pathways, have contributed substantially to our understanding of how inflammatory responses are activated, critical gaps remain in our understanding of how some microbes avoid and even suppress host inflammatory responses. Previous studies have identified Leishmaniaas a eukaryote protozoan microbe that circumvents the classical host innate immune response, and also actively suppresses macrophage responses to strong inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial LPS \\[,-\\]. These studies have typically been limited to analyses of a relatively low number of cytokines, and in general have not distinguished between the specific effects of Leishmaniauptake and non-specific effects of generalized phagocytosis upon LPS-induced macrophage activation. We sought to further explore the modulatory effects of Leishmaniaupon LPS-induced macrophages by determining the specific effects of two clinically distinct species of Leishmaniaupon the kinetics of a broader repertoire of cytokine and chemokine responses elicited by LPS-activated macrophages.\n\n【39】Consistent with previous observations, our studies demonstrate that Leishmaniaefficiently evades robust activation of many cytokines and chemokines. In the context of LPS-induction, we found that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-12 and IL-3, and the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13 were all suppressed to varying degrees by both L. majorand L. amazonesis. For each of these cytokines, the suppressive effects were more pronounced with L. amazonensisthan L. major. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the increased suppressive effects we observed for L. amazonensiswere due to their marginally increased level of uptake compared to L. major, we feel it is unlikely that such a subtle increase in parasite uptake would lead to the striking increases in cytokine suppression we observed.\n\n【40】Although the latex bead controls were moderately suppressive at the peak of the LPS response, we found that in general, Leishmaniawere significantly more so. Another interesting finding of our study was that whilst Leishmaniasuppressed some LPS-induced responses, such as IL-4 and IL-13 at timepoints when the LPS response was maximal (usually 19 hrs), these responses were actually augmented by Leishmaniaat the 8 hr timepoint. This observation is reminiscent of the refractory period observed with Toxoplasma gondii-induced IL-12 production in dendritic cells , and may therefore not represent true suppression.\n\n【41】Although IL-17-producing Th17 cells have been the subject of intensive study recently and IL-17 production is critical for the expansion of innate immune cells, only one report has described the importance of macrophage-derived IL-17 in inflammatory disease . Indeed, our study is the first to investigate the impact of Leishmaniaupon LPS-induced IL-17 production in macrophages. Our observations that both L. majorand L. amazonensispromastigotes strongly and specifically suppress LPS-induced IL-17 production, provide a new model for studying mechanisms of IL-17 regulation.\n\n【42】Although we observed suppression of both IL-12p40 and IL-12p70, IL-12p40 suppression was more striking. Interestingly, our finding that L. majorand latex beads had similar mildly suppressive effects suggests that phagocytic uptake alone contributes significantly to suppression of LPS-induced IL-12p70 during L. majorinfection. Our findings with L. amazonensisdiffer from those of Cameron et al. which showed its close relative, L. mexicana, caused a more dramatic suppression of LPS-induced IL-12p70. Instead, our data are more comparable to previous findings with L. major-infected human monocytes . These different observations may be attributable to distinct pathobiological properties known to exist even amongst closely related Leishmaniaspecies.\n\n【43】L. majorbut not L. amazonensisshowed augmentation of LPS-induced IL-1α. Interestingly, IL-1α can promote Th1 responses that ameliorate disease progression in susceptible BALB/c  whilst Th1-biased C57BL/6 mice that are resistant to L. majorremain susceptible to L. amazonensis. Whether or not the differences in macrophage responses elicited by L. amazonensisversus L. majorunder our conditions contribute to the increased severity of disease typically associated with L. amazonensiscompared to L. major, remains to be determined.\n\n【44】Production of IL-10 by Leishmaniaalone was not strikingly increased above controls, however at 8 hrs post treatment, both Leishmaniaspecies significantly augmented LPS-induced levels of IL-10. Since IL-10 suppresses production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, it is interesting that a classical proinflammatory stimulus such as LPS also induces IL-10. Indeed, these data are consistent with recent findings  and may reflect IL-10-mediated negative feedback regulation. Since IL-10 is a strong suppressor of host cytokine production and promotes disease progression in leishmaniasis , it is possible that the cytokine-suppressive effects we observed could be attributable to Leishmania-augmented IL-10 production. We feel this is unlikely however, since although IL-10 is a potent suppressor of macrophage TNF-α , the increased levels of IL-10 released by LPS/Leishmaniain our study did not prevent augmentation of TNFα production. Furthermore, in contrast to both L. majorand L. mexicana, absence of IL-10 does not protect against L. amazonensisinfection , suggesting that L. amazonensisemploys IL-10-independent immunomodulatory mechanisms.\n\n【45】Although these studies provide new insight into the regulation of macrophage inflammatory responses by Leishmania, it should be emphasized that they were performed in vitrousing peritoneal macrophages to identify novel mechanisms of macrophage inflammatory modulation. How these in vitrofindings translate to in vivomodels of Leishmaniainfection has not yet been clarified. It is possible, for example, that peritoneal macrophages may behave differently to the inflammatory macrophages found at infection sites in the skin during Leishmaniainoculation. Further, the metacyclic-enriched promastigote population inoculated during natural infection may have different effects upon macrophage responses than the less-defined heterogenous population of stationary phase parasites used in our studies. It is also important to emphasize that Leishmaniaamastigote stages may elicit different macrophage responses than promastigotes. As such, future studies with purified metacylic organisms and distinct macrophage populations will be helpful in determining the extent to which our novel findings pertain to Leishmaniainfection in vivo.\n\n【46】We also emphasize that studies of promastigote-mediated modulation of LPS-induced cytokine responses may have limited relevance in the context of natural Leishmaniainfections, since Leishmaniapossesses no known TLR4 agonists and there are no data confirming that TLR4 agonists are introduced into the sandfly bite site. Instead, however, these studies may be relevant for the design of protective adjuvant-based vaccination strategies against Leishmania, using TLR agonists to promote optimal inflammatory cytokine profiles that may facilitate sustained Th1 responses required for protective immunity against this pathogen.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n===========\n\n【48】We have explored the cytokine-modulatory effects of two clinically distinct species of Leishmaniaupon the kinetics of a range of LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory responses. We find both suppression and promotion of LPS-induced responses, indicating the selective suppression and augmentation of specific cytokine induction mechanisms. Our studies provide foundations to pursue functional studies to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the distinct cytokine responses to Leishmaniathat we observed. Such investigations of Leishmania-mediated modulation of host cytokine responses will advance our understanding of inflammatory responses and likely promote new avenues for therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.\n\n【49】Abbreviations\n=============\n\n【50】TLR: Toll-like receptor; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells; CR3: complement receptor 3; IL-: interleukin; MIP-: macrophage inflammatory protein; MCP-1: macrophage chemotactic protein-1.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In practical applications, however, communication systems frequently encounter non-Gaussian noise environments, for instance, underwater acoustic noise and low-frequency atmospheric noise. Of all channels with power-constrained noise, the capacity of a Gaussian channel is the smallest. Thus, the capacities of non-Gaussian channels are of great interest. Moreover, from theoretical and practical viewpoints, a very interesting topic is the investigation of the channel capacity with very weak input signals, e.g. deep space communication channels and qubit depolarizing channels. A very noisy channel was introduced by Reiffen, and extended by Gallager and Majani to model many physical communication channels operating at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \"Very noisy\" channels with very low capacity are of significant interest to communications, since Shannon's theorem guarantees reliable communication as long as the capacity is nonzero. Following the approaches developed in and using a power series of characteristic functions, Nirenberg derived a simple formula of the capacity for the coherent threshold channel with an optimum receiver. For memoryless channels with very weak inputs, Kullback, Verdú and Prelov explicitly expressed the asymptotic expressions of the channel capacity closely related to the Fisher information matrix. Recently, Kostal and Lansky presented an approximate expression for the information capacity in a broad class of discrete-time channels under the constraint of vanishing input amplitude or power, which allows us to analyse the capacity of channels with memory in a convenient way.\n\n【1】In this paper, under the assumption of low SNR, we will further derive the capacity of a very noisy communication channel, wherein the optimum receiver may be unavailable and noise is not restricted to be white. Based on the central limit theorem, we argue that, for sufficiently large observation times and with the constraint of weak signal energy, the receiver output tends to be Gaussian distributed, and the channel capacity is then computed by a simple formula being directly related to the Fisher information of the noise distribution. We demonstrate the enhancement of capacity via stochastic resonance will not occur in very noisy communication channel with an optimum receiver, but it can occur with generalized correlation receivers suited for practical implementation. Finally, we compare the asymptotic capacity expressions of this noisy communication channel with other capacity formulas in refs ,\n\n【2】Results\n=======\n\n【3】Channel capacity for coloured noise\n-----------------------------------\n\n【4】For the M-ary communication channel shown in , the observation data vector X contains the additive noise vector Z and the signal vector S~m~, With the assumptions of white noise and very low SNR, Nirenberg derived the capacity for the coherent threshold channel with an optimum receiver. We briefly present the conclusions of ref.  for reference . However, the idealized assumption of white noise is unpractical, and the coloured noise has practical significance. We here further derive a general asymptotic expression of the channel capacity for coloured noise, which applies to not only the optimum receiver but also an arbitrary correlation receiver.\n\n【5】In the case of coloured noise and for very low SNR, the conditional probability function can be expanded to the first order\n\n【6】where the operator and the statistic . Here, from an information theory point of view by Reiffen and Gallager, the module indicates the channel is very noisy in the sense that the channel output is almost independent of the input. For M equiprobable signals S~m~, the receiver takes the maximum likelihood rule\n\n【7】to optimally choose mth signal. Substituting [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u>] into [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u>], the optimum receiver\n\n【8】enables us to decide if the mth signal was transmitted. For clarity, we state that the statistic Γ(s~m~, x) and the maximum likelihood decoding rule of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u>] compose an optimum correlation receiver. The channel output is the decoding signal ω~m~ of the receiver, as shown in .\n\n【9】Then, supposing the zero-mean E~S~(s) = 0 and extending the very noisy vector channel , the mutual information between the input signal space Φ and the channel output space Ω is given by\n\n【10】where the Fisher information matrix of the noise distribution is defined as\n\n【11】It is noted that J(f~Z~) is also called the Fisher information of a location parameter or the shift-invariant Fisher information, which can be viewed as a special case of the Fisher information measuring the statistical information contained in data about an unknown parameter. Therefore, with the energy constraint of E~S~(s^T^s) ≤ ε and for the standardized vector , the channel capacity can be expressed as\n\n【12】where Λ is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix J(f~Z~) and u takes the corresponding eigenvector.\n\n【13】For positive definite matrixes A, and an arbitrary column vector , the inequality X^T^(A − B)X ≥ 0 is abbreviated as . Then, for the positive semidefinite matrix\n\n【14】and the noise covariance matrix ∑~Z~ = E~Z~(zz^T^), we have\n\n【15】where the equality occurs for N-dimensional Gaussian distribution with its Fisher information matrix . Thus, [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (7)</u>] indicates the maximum eigenvalue of is less than that of Fisher information matrix of non-Gaussian noise. This result extends the conclusion of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (36)</u>] by Nirenberg, and also confirms that, in terms of the channel capacity, zero-mean Gaussian noise is the worst case given that the noise vector has a fixed covariance matrix.\n\n【16】However, we note the channel capacity of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (6)</u>] is achieved by the optimum receiver of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u>]. In many practical cases, the optimum receiver may be not implementable for the unknown noise distribution or the non-closed form of distributions (e.g. α-stable noise). Thus, we further consider the generalized correlation receiver\n\n【17】where the coefficient vector and the function g(x) is not restricted to be memoryless. For the zero-mean vector of E~Z~\\[g(z)\\] = 0 (for a shift in mean) under f~Z~ and for very low SNR, g(x) can be expanded to the first-order\n\n【18】Then, for a large observation size N, the statistic T~m~ has the mean and the variance . Using the Cholesky decomposition of the symmetrical matrix V = E~Z~\\[g(z)g(z)^T^\\] = LL^T^, the output SNR of the receiver can be calculated as\n\n【19】by optimally choosing . Then, we argue that, for sufficiently large observation times and with the constraint of weak signal energy, the receiver output tends to be Gaussian distributed, and the capacity can be approximately calculated as\n\n【20】where Λ~g~ is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix . Observing\n\n【21】and for the positive semidefinite matrix\n\n【22】we have\n\n【23】with and the equality occurring for . This inequality通用删除7(英):<u> (13)</u> indicates that the eigenvalue Λ of J(f~Z~) is not less than the eigenvalue Λ~g~ of the matrix . Therefore, based on [equations (6]),  and , we find\n\n【24】which extends the conclusion of ref.  to the case of coloured noise. In addition, the equality in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (13)</u>] also demonstrates the receiver of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>] is optimal when , i.e. the optimum receiver of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u>].\n\n【25】We argue that the asymptotic capacity expression of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>] has a broader applicability for an arbitrary correlation receiver operated in coloured or white noise environments. As a simple check for the consistency of the results from [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>] to [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (14)</u>], we consider the case of white noise. Immediately, due to the statistical independence of g(z), the expectation matrices and V = E~z~\\[g^2^(z)\\]I. Here, the derivative g′(z) = dg(z)/dz and I is the unit matrix. Therefore, the matrix in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>] has N identical eigenvalues , and the channel capacity becomes\n\n【26】where the eigenvalue Λ = J(f~z~) corresponds to the Fisher information matrix J(f~Z~) in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (6)</u>]. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and integration by parts , and the equality in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (15)</u>] occurs when that specifies the optimum receiver in the presence of white noise.\n\n【27】Conditions for noise-enhanced capacity\n--------------------------------------\n\n【28】Since the emergence of the concept of stochastic resonance, the employment of noise in enhancing the performance of nonlinear systems has become an interesting option. Initially, the mechanism of stochastic resonance manifests itself as a time-scale matching condition for the noise-induced characteristic time of systems and the signal period. Later, the notion of stochastic resonance has been widened to a number of different mechanisms, e.g. aperiodic stochastic resonance and suprathreshold stochastic resonance. For such stochastic resonance effects, there is no matching time-scale that corresponds to the input aperiodic or information-carrying random signal, but the system performance still reaches a maximum at an optimal non-zero noise level. Therefore, the noise-enhanced effect, instead of stochastic resonance, becomes a more appropriate term for describing the enhancement effect of system responses via the addition of noise. Here, if the channel capacity reaches a maximum at an optimal non-zero noise level, then the noise-enhanced capacity effect occurs. Otherwise, upon increasing the noise level, the channel capacity monotonically decreases, this is to say, the noise-enhanced capacity effect does not exist.\n\n【29】There are two approaches for varying the noise in stochastic resonance. One is tuning the noise level but not changing the noise type, and the other is adding extra noise to a given noisy signal, while the extra noise type may be different form the original one. Next, we will demonstrate the occurrence or nonoccurrence condition of the noise-enhanced capacity effect by the above mentioned methods.\n\n【30】First, we will prove that no noise-enhanced capacity effect exists for tuning the scaled noise level in an optimum receiver. For the scaled noise vector Z = DZ~n~, the covariance matrix ∑~Z~ can be factored as ∑~Z~ = DD^T^ and the standardized noise vector Z~n~ has a covariance matrix being the unit matrix . A well-known scaling property of the Fisher information matrix is\n\n【31】which implies the largest eigenvalue Λ of J(f~Z~) is a monotonically decreasing function of Λ~n~/det(∑~Z~) for the determinants det^2^(D) = det^2^(D^T^) = det(∑~Z~). Here, the largest eigenvalue of is Λ~n~ that is a fixed quantity for Z~n~. For such a channel with its optimum receiver, [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>] indicates the channel capacity monotonically decreases as the noise intensity increases. Thus, no noise-enhanced capacity phenomenon will occur by tuning the noise level.\n\n【32】For instance, we consider a threshold receiver based on the function g(x) = sign(x) and the Laplacian white noise with its distribution . We note that the threshold receiver is optimum for the Laplacian noise, and satisfies the equality condition in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (15)</u>]. In this case, the channel capacity in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (15)</u>] can be calculated as , which monotonically decreases as the noise level σ increases. Thus, there is no noise-enhanced capacity effect.\n\n【33】Secondly, we usually have a given signal corrupted by noise, and the initial noise level is unadjustable. We will prove that the addition of extra noise cannot further improve the channel capacity achieved by the optimum receiver. Under this circumstance, we add an extra noise vector W, independent of Z and S~m~, to the observation X, and the updated data vector is\n\n【34】where the composite noise vector U = Z + W with its distribution f~U~. In this case, we should employ the statistic to specify the optimum receiver, and the corresponding capacity is then given by\n\n【35】with the largest eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix J(f~U~). For any nonsingular matrix , the Fisher information matrix inequality holds for\n\n【36】we then find the largest eigenvalue Λ of J(f~Z~) is not less than the largest eigenvalue of J(f~U~) and\n\n【37】This result of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (20)</u>] clearly shows that stochastic resonance cannot further improve the channel capacity achieved by the optimum receiver, regardless of adding white or coloured noise vector W.\n\n【38】Thirdly, we note that the above two negative conditions of the noise-enhanced capacity effect arise with the optimum receiver matched to the distribution of the background noise. By Contrast, if the generalized correlation receivers of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>] are not optimal for the background noise, stochastic resonance may play an important role in the enhancement of capacity. For example, we consider non-scaled Gaussian mixture noise vector W with its distribution\n\n【39】where the variance and parameters μ, ζ ≥ 0. A useful coloured noise model of the first-order moving-average as\n\n【40】where the correlation coefficients are ρ~1,2~ and is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random vector. For small values of ρ~1,2~ , the dependence among noise samples Z~n~ will be weak. The signum function g(x) = sign(x) is adopted to construct the generalized correlation receiver of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>], which is not optimal for the coloured noise Z. The optimum receiver indicated in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u>] for the coloured noise Z is rather complicated, since the distribution f~Z~ does not have a tractable analytic expression. Using the approach developed in ref. we have the expectation matrix\n\n【41】with the unit matrix I and , and the matrix V becomes tridiagonal with elements\n\n【42】for , and other elements are higher-order infinitesimal of ρ~1~ + ρ~2~ . Then, we calculate the largest eigenvalue of the matrix as\n\n【43】where the error function . In , we show the capacity per signal energy C~g~/ε = Λ~g~/2 in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>] versus the noise parameters μ and ζ in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (21)</u>]. Here, the correlation coefficient ρ~1~ = 0.2 and ρ~2~ = 0 in the coloured noise model of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (22)</u>]. We regard the parameters ±μ as the peak locations of the Gaussian mixture distribution in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (21)</u>], while the parameter ζ as the noise level. It is then clearly shown in that , upon increasing ζ for a fixed value of μ (the noise variance also increases), the noise-enhanced capacity effects exist. The corresponding maxima of C~g~/ε versus optimal values of ζ are also marked by squares in .\n\n【44】We emphasize that the above noise-enhanced capacity effect is an illustrative case of stochastic resonance that exists for a suboptimal receiver not matching the background noise. However, this mismatch condition is not the decision criteria for the occurrence of the noise-enhanced effect, since the example illustration is under the assumptions of a small signal and a correlation receiver with a large observation size. Beyond these restrictive assumptions, the noise-enhanced effect has been frequently observed. For instance, the noise-enhanced effect has been demonstrated for non-weak signals in threshold neurons, where an optimal matching condition is inapplicable to the neuronal model immersed in complex noisy environments. It is sufficiently recognized that a well-established criterion for the noise-enhanced effect is to observe an optimal noise level at which the system response can be optimized.\n\n【45】Discussion\n==========\n\n【46】In this paper, we analyse the capacity of a very noisy communication channel with correlation receivers. With the weak signal energy constraint and for very low SNR, we generalize an asymptotic expression of capacity achieved by the optimum receivers in a coloured noisy environment. Moreover, for the case when the optimum receiver is unavailable in practice, a capacity formula is presented for the communication channel with a generalized correlation receiver. We further discuss the occurrence condition of the noise-enhanced capacity effect in the considered communication channel.\n\nA similar asymptotic expression of capacity is also obtained in memoryless or memory additive-noise channels. We emphasize the asymptotic capacity expressions of [equations (6]) and  are different from that in previous literature. In , for the channel output Y = g(X), these studies assume the conditional probability density as f~Y\\|S~(y\\|s). Then, the Fisher information matrix is defined as\n\n【48】with the operator . Then, for the zero-mean signal vector E~S~(s) = 0 and the weak signal energy ε, the mutual information between the input space Φ and the output space Ψ is approximated as\n\n【49】which is different from the mutual information I(Φ, Ω) of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u>] based on the Fisher information matrix J(f~Z~) of the noise distribution f~Z~. It is shown in  that the receiver multiplies nonlinear transformation g(x) with optimized coefficients, and obtains a cumulative statistic T~m~ that decides whether the mth signal S~m~ is sent or not. Then, the considered communication channel chooses an optimal signal S~m~ from the signal space to maximize the average mutual information. Since the receiver collecting the weighted nonlinear outputs as the statistic , and for any nonlinear function g, the distribution of T~m~ tends to be Gaussian. This leads to the asymptotic expressions of capacity of [equations (6]) and . We recognize the asymptotic capacity expressions in [equations (6]) and  have application in the context of a very noisy communication channel with a correlation receiver. As a new analytical result of the channel capacity, it has theoretical significance and deserves some exposition.\n\nWe also note that, for the linear transfer function of Y = Z + S, the conditional probability density f~Y\\|S~(y\\|s) = f~Z~(y − s), the Fisher information matrix of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (27)</u>] becomes\n\n【51】where the differentiation operator with respect to S is equivalent to differentiation with respect to Z. Therefore, for the linear additive-noise channel, the considered communication channel has the same capacity as that denoted in refs ,\n\n【52】Besides a linear channel capacity defined and calculated by Shannon, only a few analytical results exist for a variety of different nonlinear channel models. We argue that our asymptotic capacity expression for a nonlinear channel may be valuable for practical channels and coding techniques developed for communication applications in order to approach the established linear Shannon limit, and deserves further extensive study. We here only consider a single correlation receiver for detecting the weak signal, however recent studies in general provide evidence that, besides an optimal noise intensity, an optimal network configuration exists, at which the best system response can be obtained. Thus, an interesting extension for future work is to investigate the capacity of a very noisy communication channel with receivers connected in various network configurations.\n\n【53】Methods\n=======\n\n【54】Very noisy communication channel model\n--------------------------------------\n\n【55】Consider a coherent M-ary communication channel transmitting M possible signals S~m~ for , as shown in . In an interval, the observation vector\n\n【56】where contains the noise vector and the signal vector . Then, a receiver multiplies the transformation g(X) with optimized coefficients, resulting in a cumulative statistic T~m~(X) for deciding whether the mth signal S~m~ is sent or not. The capacity C of a communication channel is given by the maximum of the mutual information I(Φ, Ω) between the input signal space Φ and the channel output space Ω\n\n【57】where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution f~S~ over the signal space Φ.\n\n【58】Nirenberg's approach for white noise\n------------------------------------\n\n【59】The white noise Z has the multivariate distribution with zero-mean and variance . Let the statistically independent signal components be constrained to satisfy , and the total signal energy has a constraint . Then, for very low SNR of , the conditional probability density can be approximated as\n\n【60】with the first two terms of Taylor series. Here, and the statistic . Using the maximum likelihood rule, the conditional probability density on the knowledge that the mth signal satisfies\n\n【61】which leads to the optimum receiver\n\n【62】to decide if the mth signal was sent.\n\n【63】To simplify the mathematical manipulations, Nirenberg assumes the even noise distribution function f~z~(z) = f~z~(−z) and a very noisy channel  yielding the mutual information between the output space Ω and the input signal space Φ as\n\n【64】where the Fisher information of the noise density f~z~ and the expectation . Since the same bias does not affect the decision of inequality of [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (34)</u>], it may be conveniently assumed to be zero. Then, over the class of signal distributions f~S~, the channel capacity is computed as\n\n【65】which is applicable to various white noise types.\n\n【66】Furthermore, for a fixed noise variance and an arbitrary noise density function f~z~, where the equality occurs for Gaussian distribution with its Fisher information . Accordingly, the additive Gaussian noise channel is the worst one, and has the minimum capacity, as indicated in [equation通用删除7(英):<u> (36)</u>]. It is well known that, for very low SNR of , the capacity of Gaussian vector channel is approximately calculated as\n\n【67】which accords well with equation通用删除7(英):<u> (36)</u>.\n\n【68】Additional Information\n======================\n\n【69】通用删除5(英):<u>How to cite this article: Duan, F. et al.

Given the importance of the products of the INK4/ARF locus in tumor suppression, transcription from the locus is tightly governed. Over the last decade, intense study to elucidate the regulation of this locus exposed that the genes encoded in the INK4/ARF locus are controlled both independently as well as in a coordinated manner.\n\n【1】A known regulatory site responsible for the coordinated silencing of all three genes in the INK/ARF locus is positioned in close proximity to the p15^INK4b^ gene called Regulatory Domain (RD). Interaction of the CDC6 protein with the RD triggers recruitment of histone deacetylases, which increase methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) and in turn cause heterochromatinization of the p15^INK4b^, p16^INK4a^ and ARF promoters leading to their silencing. In this context, we recently reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcription cofactor E6AP (also known as UBE3A) acts as a positive regulator of the INK4/ARF locus . Mechanistically, we demonstrated that E6AP inhibits CDC6 expression by interacting with E2F1 and reducing its ability to bind to the CDC6 promoter and induce its transactivation 删除21:<u></u>. Importantly, this novel regulatory pathway is clinically relevant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), since we showed that patients with the E6AP-low/CDC6-high/ p16^INK4a^-low expression endure the worst overall survival. This correlation predicts the prognostic value of this expression signature.\n\n【2】![Schematic model illustrating the molecular mechanism proposed for E6AP stimulation of the expression of the genes encoded in the INK4/ARF locus](oncotarget-08-106147-g001)\n\n【3】A key finding from our work is that the ability of E6AP to modulate E2F1 transcriptional activity is not limited to the CDC6 gene, as we demonstrated that the levels of other E2F1 gene targets were also altered in E6AP-deficient cells. In accord with these findings, we recently published an independent report showing that in prostate cancer cells, E6AP reduces the ability of E2F1 to bind to p27 promoter and to induce its transcription .\n\n【4】A particularly intriguing regulator of the expression of the tumour suppressors encoded in the INK4/ARF locus is the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ANRIL (antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus). ANRIL gene is transcribed in the antisense orientation relative to the INK4/ARF gene cluster. ANRIL promotes the epigenetic repression of its neighbor tumor suppressors in the INK4/ARF locus by physically interacting with the Polycomb proteins Suz12 and Cbx7, which in turn recruit the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 to the locus, leading to histone modification and silencing of the locus .\n\n【5】The contribution of ANRIL to cancer development has attracted much attention in recent years, and ANRIL oncogenic role is now solidly established in a variety of carcinomas. This is the case for NSCLC, where multiple recent papers convincingly demonstrate that high ANRIL levels correlate with poor prognosis (i.e. ). In this context however, very little is known about the mechanisms of ANRIL regulation. The only hints come from two independent groups that reported that ANRIL is transcriptionally activated by E2F1 . This finding, together with our recently published data showing that E6AP regulates the expression of the INK4/ARF locus, and that E6AP modulates E2F1 transcription activity, prompt us to speculate that E6AP could maintain expression levels of the tumor suppressor genes in the INK4/ARF locus by inhibiting ANRIL in an E2F1-dependent manner. We propose a model wherein E6AP promotes activation of the INK4/ARF locus by repressing the expression of the two key negative regulators of the locus, CDC6 and ANRIL. Further studies will be required to establish the relevance of the E6AP/E2F1/ANRIL/ p16^INK4a^ axis in NSCLC, as well as in other cancers. Nevertheless, we believe this opens potential new therapeutic options in the light of the recent interest that therapeutics based on lncRNAs targeting are attracting in the context of cancer .\n\n【6】In summary, our paper by Gamell et al. raises another potential regulatory mechanism of the INK4/ARF locus that is relevant in NSCLC, and opens new potential avenues for identification of novel pathways in NSCLC pathogenesis. An interesting future frontier will be to integrate all these pathways involved in the regulation of the INK4/ARF products to design better treatment strategies to ultimately improve outcomes of cancer patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

We investigated the role of ALK5 in tooth germ mesenchymal cells (TGMCs) from the lower first molar tooth germs of day 15.5 embryonic mice. Human recombinant TGFβ3 protein or an ALK5 inhibitor (SD208) was added to the cells. Cell proliferation was inhibited by SD208 and promoted by TGFβ3. We found that SD208 inhibited TGMCs osteogenesis and dentinogenesis. Both canonical and noncanonical TGFβ signaling pathways participated in the process. TAK1, P-TAK1, p38 and P-p38 showed greater expression and SMAD4 showed less expression when ALK5 was inhibited. Our findings contribute to understanding the role of TGFβ signaling for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from dental germ and suggest possible targets for optimizing the use of stem cells of dental origin for tissue regeneration.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Due to its ubiquitous nature, it poses a significant global health threat. Its name derives from arsenikon, the Greek name of yellow pigment. Based on the periodic table of chemistry, arsenic has been classified in the same group that includes nitrogen and phosphorus, both of which are essential chemical elements in cells . The typical physical-chemical specific feature of arsenic to interact with biological tissue may result in its various and significant biological effects. Exposure to arsenic results in cancers of several human systems, such as integumentary, respiratory, hepatobiliary, and urinary systems . In addition, arsenic exposure may contribute to the occurrence of multiple atherosclerotic vascular diseases, such as cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular diseases . On the other hand, arsenic does have some benefits in treating specific diseases, such as lymphoma and leukemia. For example, arsenic is the drug of choice in patients of acute promyelocytic leukemia due to its biological effects in blast cell differentiation and immune cell activation .\n\n【2】Environmental exposure to arsenic can result from natural or anthropogenic routes. It enters the human body in several ways, such as oral ingestion, respiration, or skin absorption . Oral ingestion with arsenic-contaminated water is the most common source . To date, there remain more than 100 million people exposed to arsenic at levels higher than 50 µg/L through drinking water or via industrial sources . For example, several decades ago in Taiwan, the residents of southwestern coastal areas often drank arsenic-contaminated groundwater and developed arsenic-induced cancers and vascular diseases several decades after arsenic exposure . In addition, industrial exposure may also contribute to hazardous health problems. In 2014, the estimated worldwide production of arsenic was about 45,000 tons, most of them from China .\n\n【3】Chronic arsenic exposure induces several diseases , including cerebral vascular diseases , cardiovascular diseases , peripheral vascular diseases , and are associated with several infections, including pneumonia, hepatitis B infections, fungal skin infections .\n\n【4】Cutaneous manifestation often presents after exposure to arsenic about more than 20 years . However, not all people exposed to arsenic develop skin cancers, suggesting that the dysregulated immunity caused by arsenic in susceptible patients may contribute to the progression of arsenic-induced cancers.\n\n【5】2. Skin Manifestations and Skin Cancer due to Chronic Arsenic Exposure \n======================================================================\n\n【6】Arsenic leads to profound effects on many organs . In addition to its direct toxicity, arsenic is a class I carcinogen as declared by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and its carcinogenic effects may be mediated by abnormal DNA repair, aneuploidy, and other cellular mechanisms . Skin is considered to be the most susceptible organ, and it is usually the first manifestation of arsenic toxicity . In addition, only a certain proportion, ranging from 17--66%, of individuals exposed to arsenic contract cutaneous diseases, such as hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, Bowen's disease, and arsenic keratosis. Furthermore, only around 1% of the individuals develop squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or other cutaneous malignancies . Individual immune dysregulation might explain why only a certain proportion of susceptible individuals develop adverse health effects.\n\n【7】Bowen's disease, as squamous cell carcinoma in situ, is the most common skin cancers induced by arsenic. Clinically, typical Bowen's disease is mainly associated with sun exposure and tends to be solitary, whereas arsenic-induced Bowen's disease (As-BD) is distributed in sun-protected skin and tends to be multifocal . However, there is no morphological discrepancy between classical and arsenic-induced Bowen's disease in their pathological features, which include full-layered epidermal dysplasia, increased epidermal thickness, individual dyskeratosis, and moderate dermal infiltrates . Variegated hyperpigmentation and punctate keratosis on palms and soles are the most significant clinical characteristics of arsenic-induced skin lesions . These clinical features are often used as diagnostic clues to indicate chronic arsenic exposure. In addition, mucous membrane melanosis and conjunctiva congestion are minor dermatological presentations caused by exposure to arsenic.\n\n【8】Arsenic contributes to the formation of two important categories of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A high prevalence of NMSCs due to chronic arsenic exposure was noticed in the southwest of Taiwan, where the entire prevalence rate for cutaneous malignancies was 10.6/1000 . Additionally, drinking arsenic-contaminated water has also contributed to arsenic-induced skin malignancies in Bangladesh, China, and India . The association between inorganic arsenic in drinking water and miscellaneous malignancies has been well-confirmed after exposure to high concentration . However, the epidemiologic evidence has suggested a threshold for the connection between inorganic arsenic exposure and malignancies . Based on the epidemiological evidence mainly generated from the field study in Taiwan, in 2001, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) raised a more strict criterion for arsenic levels in drinking water, by decreasing the acceptable arsenic level in drinking water from 50 to 10 μg/L .\n\n【9】3. Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Arsenic-Induced Carcinogenesis \n==================================================================\n\n【10】The precise pathophysiological mechanism by which arsenic induces carcinogenesis remains unclear, although increasing of oxidative stress, chromosome abnormalities, with uncontrollable growth, and aberrant immune developments, might be possible mechanisms of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis . First, 8-Hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major form of oxidative DNA damage, was obtained from urine and skin tissue of arsenic exposed individuals . Early genetic effects including DNA strand breaks, micronuclei in cord blood, and nitrative DNA damage were found in arsenic exposed patients . In addition, oxidative damages and mitochondrial mutations might play a role in arsenic-induced skin malignancies . Arsenic affects DNA repair machinery, which leads to oxidative DNA damage and mutations by the impairment of nucleotide excision repair, DNA ligase, DNA base excision repair, and DNA strand break rejoining . Rather than the unrecoverable DNA damage, arsenic also affects a bunch of epigenetic regulations. For example, Chanda et al. showed that DNA hypermethylation of the critical promoter region of the p53 gene and p16 gene was present in the DNA from arsenic-exposed individuals . Zhou et al. suggested a possible mechanism by which carcinogenesis is induced by arsenic via the dysregulated histone methylations that are involved in gene silencing and activating marks . Liao et al. showed that un-methylation at −56 and −54 bp CpG in the cyclin D1 promoter as a predictor for invasive malignancies from carcinoma in situ in individuals with arsenic-induced cancers . It was also reported that arsenic could regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to mediate cell growth .\n\n【11】In As-BD lesions, keratinocytes (KC) are the significant biological target. Abnormal cell proliferation and dysregulated energy homeostasis of keratinocytes are important in the mechanism and development of As-BD lesions. Lee et al. reported that arsenic can regulate the prolongation of glycan residues of membrane glycoproteins, which may be crucial in carcinogenesis induced by arsenic . Besides, mtTFA up-regulation, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and augmented mitochondrial functions induce cell proliferation in arsenic-induced skin cancers, indicating that mitochondria become a significant part in the induction of proliferation . Lee et al. further showed that oxidative destruction and mutations in mtDNA might contribute to arsenic skin malignancy . Moreover, expression of cytokeratin 14 (CK14) and the N-terminal truncated p63 isoform (ΔNp63, proliferation regulator) enhanced in As-BD, which contributes to abnormal growth in arsenic-induced skin malignancies . Recent studies showed that epigenetic dysregulation may play an important role in arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis . Wu et al. revealed overexpression of has-miR-186 contributed to chromosomal instability in arsenic exposed tissue, including dysregulate chromatid segregation and induced aneuploidy .\n\n【12】4. Immune Response in Arsenic-Induced Skin Cancers and its Involvement in Carcinogenesis \n========================================================================================\n\n【13】As discussed earlier, not all of the humans exposed to arsenic develop cutaneous malignancies, suggesting that dysregulated immunity caused by arsenic in susceptible individuals contributes to the development of arsenic-induced cancers.\n\n【14】4.1. Overview of Skin Immunity \n------------------------------\n\n【15】The human immune system includes two different functional groups: innate and adaptive immunity . These two classifications have distinct characteristics of recognition receptors and differ in the speed at which they respond to a possible threat to the host. The innate immune systems include macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which lead to a rapid, but not lasting, response against the pathogens . On the other hand, T and B lymphocytes were included in the adaptive immune system, which bears particular antigen receptors encoded by rearranged genes of T cell receptors and immunoglobulins . Adaptive immunity develops more slowly compared to that of innate immunity. It can create and sustain memory of an immune reaction. Thus, it can also provide a rapid and robust reaction facing immunologic challenge. Based on the cell engagement and antibody production, the innate and adaptive immunity could be both categorized into cellular or humoral immunity, respectively .\n\n【16】4.2. Arsenic-Induced Dysregulated Immune Responses \n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】As-BD, the most common carcinoma in situ due to chronic arsenic exposure, is featured with multiple and recurrent cutaneous manifestations. Besides, it may cause impairment of immunity in susceptible patients . In mice, the production of immunoglobulins, proliferation of T lymphocytes, phagocytosis of macrophages, and their nitric oxide release ability were impaired in arsenic-exposed mice . In zebrafish, Nayak et al. demonstrated that arsenic suppresses the overall innate immune system at an acceptable arsenic concentration in drinking water . Monocytes and macrophages are also potential targets of arsenic. Lemarie et al. illustrated that an inorganic trivalent form of noncytotoxic level of arsenic trioxide (As~2~O~3~), significantly impairs proliferation of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. It was also reported that arsenic induces rapid cell rounding and loss of actin reorganization, mostly via the Ras homolog gene family member A-associated kinase pathway . Other studies have also reported that As~2~O~3~ significantly deteriorates the releasing of IL-12 and IL-23 from activated individual dendritic cells and decrease the activation of T-helper (Th) cells . Moreover, an impaired macrophage function and delayed-type hypersensitivity response were also presented in arsenic-exposed individuals with skin manifestations .\n\n【18】In mice, transplacental studies of arsenic revealed that the offspring had a dose-dependent effect of the number of lung, liver, ovary, and adrenal tumors in adulthood . Maternal exposure of arsenic augments oxidative stress in the placenta. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF-, and IFN- were increased through the enhancement of oxidative stress . Lymphocyte function deteriorated and may contribute to the smaller size of thymic and decreasing function in newborns and infants . In children, it is reported that arsenic exposure decreases the Th1 cytokine levels in the plasma and increases total concentrations of IgG and IgE in the plasma . All of these immune deregulations could associate with the enhanced risk of immune dysregulation and infections in arsenic-exposed children. In adults, chronic arsenic exposure may lead to the deterioration of macrophage ability and impairment of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes .\n\n【19】In human patients with arsenical cancers, impaired immunity does not only occur systemically, but also locally in As-BD skin lesions. Our group has shown that arsenic causes selective apoptosis of circulating CD4^+^ cells systemically in the peripheral blood. Once the surviving CD4^+^ cells are infiltrated into the local As-BD skin lesion, the soluble FasL from lesional keratinocytes triggers further CD4^+^ cell apoptosis through its binding to Fas in CD4^+^ cells. Moreover, we have also reported that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from cancer cells impairs activation and antigen presentation of Langerhans cell (LC) along with dysregulated T-cell activation in As-BD lesions . Abnormal immune activation of LC and CD4^+^ cells provides a plausible mechanism for the impaired tumor surveillance in As-BD .\n\n【20】5. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【21】Arsenic is a ubiquitous element on the Earth. Due to its characteristic chemical and physical features, its biological and health effects are profound. Chronic arsenic exposure leads to many cancers in susceptible populations. Skin cancer is the most common and earliest arsenical cancer. The pathognomonic feature of arsenical skin cancer featuring abnormal epidermal keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, dysplasia, and abnormal dermal inflammatory infiltrates may involve mitochondrial regulations associated with energy generation, ROS production, cell proliferation, DNA damage, and mutations, as well as immune regulations. The dysfunctional and impaired immune regulation might attribute to the differential susceptibility in arsenic-exposed humans. The impaired systemic and regional immune responses in arsenical carcinogenesis make it as a good model for early chemical carcinogenesis.\n\n【22】Conceptualization, C.H.-L. and H.-S.Y. methodology, H.-W.H.

From the viewpoint of employees, the working environment has obviously worsened. For example, deregulation and liberalization enhanced globalization and international competition, forcing firms to become flatter and more flexible to improve efficiency, which in turn led to employee wage cuts, low promotion prospects, job insecurity and job dissatisfaction^)^.\n\n【2】Job dissatisfaction may have a variety of negative effects not only on employees, but also on customers and organizations. For employees, job dissatisfaction is a potential risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease and mortality^)^ and is associated with burnout, job quitting and early retirement, ^)^. For customers, employee job dissatisfaction results in a decrease in service quality and an increase in customer dissatisfaction^)^. For organizations, job dissatisfaction may ultimately deteriorate the overall performance of an organization as a consequence of decreased productivity and increased expenses resulting from absenteeism and job quitting^)^.\n\n【3】Interestingly, Marmot et al.^)^ reported that there were socioeconomic inequalities in job dissatisfaction among British civil servants: the low employment grade employees (i.e. low socioeconomic status) were more dissatisfied with their jobs than the high employment grade employees. Kawada and Otsuka^)^ recently reported that job dissatisfaction is more likely among blue collar workers than among white collar workers. In addition, there is some evidence that more females than males have job dissatisfaction^)^. Because the majority of employees belong to low to middle employment grades and the number of female employees is increasing, understanding the causes of the socially unequal distribution of job dissatisfaction and tackling the problems associated with these inequalities may have positive effects on employee motivation, productivity and health. However, research evaluating the causes of socioeconomic and gender inequalities in job dissatisfaction is lacking.\n\n【4】Previous studies have suggested that low decision latitude, high job demands, long work hours, shift work, and low social support from supervisors and colleagues are associated with job dissatisfaction,^)^. Work-family conflicts, conflicts between the demands of work and family roles, are also associated with the intention to quit and job dissatisfaction among health care workers^)^. Individuals with the Framingham type A behaviour pattern, as characterised by a sense of time urgency, hard-driving work and hostility^)^, are more likely to have job dissatisfaction than those with other types of behavioural patterns^)^. In addition, individuals with negative affectivity, as characterised by negative psychological reactions to events in daily life^)^, tend to have job dissatisfaction^)^. However, a comprehensive research on the associations of work, family and personality characteristics with job dissatisfaction is still lacking.\n\n【5】Among Japanese civil servants, psychosocial stress at work, work hours and work-family conflicts were not socially equally distributed: low grade employees had low job control and low social support at work, while high grade employees had high job demands, longer work hours and a high level of work-family conflict^)^. In addition, more females than males had low job control, high job demands, long work hours, shift work, an unmarried status and a high level of work-family conflict^)^. There is some evidence that type A behavior pattern is more common among high grade employees and among women and that negative affectivity is more common among low grade employees and among men, ^)^. Such socioeconomic and gender inequalities in work, family, and personality characteristics may contribute to socioeconomic and gender inequalities in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【6】The purpose of this study is, therefore, to examine the following research questions in a population of Japanese civil servants:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> whether there are employment grade and gender differences in job dissatisfaction;通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> whether work, family and personality characteristics are associated with job dissatisfaction and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> whether and how much employment grade and gender differences in job dissatisfaction can be explained by work, family and personality characteristics.\n\n【7】Methods \n=======\n\n【8】Participants\n------------\n\n【9】The Japanese civil servants study (the JACS study) is an international collaborative study conducted in association with the British civil servants study (the Whitehall II study) and the Helsinki Health Survey (HHS)^)^. Phase I of the survey was conducted between 1998 and 1999. Phase II was conducted in 2003. The participants of this study were all civil servants 20--65 yr of age working at a local government in Japan at the time of each survey. The participants consisted primarily of administrative workers, clerical workers and professional and technical workers; all were non-industrial employees.\n\n【10】A postal questionnaire with a cover letter explaining the research aim, a request for voluntary participation and the anonymity of the data and publication was sent to the participants through the personnel section of the local government department. The participants completed their questionnaires and returned them to the personnel section in sealed envelopes. Then, the researchers opened the envelopes, and the datasets were built. In phase II of the survey, data regarding the grades of employment were made available; therefore, this study uses data from the second phase.\n\n【11】In phase II, altogether, 4,272 participants (response rate: 79.2%) responded. Participants who did not answer one or more questions about personal attributes, work and family characteristics, personality traits, job satisfaction and long-standing illnesses were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 3,812 participants (2,537 males and 1,275 females) represented the study population. The differences in personal attributes between the study population and the excluded subjects indicated that older subjects and females were slightly underrepresented in this study population. The mean age of the participants was 42.7 yr (standard deviation: 10.2 yr). For the analysis, we divided participants into 5 age groups: those aged 20--24, 25--34, 35--44, 45--54, and 55--64^)^.\n\n【12】The Japanese civil servants study was conducted under the control of the Safety and Health Committee of the local government, as a part of the annual health checkups regulated by the Industrial Safety and Health Law. The study was set up in 1998 before the Ethics Guidelines for Epidemiological Research was enforced. Considering the declaration of Helsinki and a global trend in ethical considerations for epidemiological research, the civil service organized an ad hoc committee to discuss the content and ethical aspects of the study. The review board comprised ordinary members of the Safety and Health Committee, labor representatives and personnel representatives. The study was approved by the committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. All subjects participated voluntarily.\n\n【13】Questionnaire\n-------------\n\n【14】The questionnaire items were chosen from among those used in the Whitehall II study. A Japanese version was developed using translation/back-translation method^)^.\n\n【15】Grade of employment\n-------------------\n\n【16】The grade of employment was determined based on the questionnaire information and hierarchically ranked in the following manner: the highest grade employees with an employment grade of section leader or higher and professional equivalents; intermediate grade employees with an employment grade lower than section leader and professional equivalents; the lowest grade employees with no particular administrative title and professional equivalents.\n\n【17】Work characteristics: psychosocial stress, work hours and shift work\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The job demand-control-support model^)^ was used to evaluate psychosocial work stress. Based on its use in the Whitehall II study, this self-reported questionnaire consists of 25 items (15 items for job control, four items for job demand and six items for social support at work)^)^. The response categories range from 0 (often) to 3 (never). After all items were recorded in the same direction, scores for each scale were calculated by summing the item scores. A higher score for each scale indicates high job control, high job demands or high social support at work. In this study, the reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha^)^) was 0.79 for job control, 0.69 for job demands and 0.83 for social support at work. For group comparisons, a reliability coefficient of more than 0.50 is considered acceptable^)^. All scales were grouped into tertiles for the analysis.\n\n【19】With respect to shift work, the participants were asked to answer whether they were engaged in shift work (yes or no). Regarding work hours, the participants answered this question according to one of 10 response categories ranging from less than six hours to 14 h or more. The participants were grouped into four groups: those reporting working less than seven hours, seven to nine hours, nine to 11 h or 11 h or more.\n\n【20】Family characteristics: family structure and work-family conflicts\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】As for the marital status, the participants were grouped into unmarried participants (including never married, divorced, separated and widowed participants) and married participants (including cohabiting participants). As for nurturing young children, the participants were grouped into two groups according to whether they nurtured young children less than 15 yr of age.\n\n【22】The questions regarding family-work conflicts consisted of eight items (four items for family-to-work conflict and four items for work-to-family conflict)^)^. Each question had three response categories ranging from 0 (never) to 2 (often). Each scale score was calculated by summing the item scores. A high score for each scale indicates a high level of conflict. Both the work-to-family conflict and the family-to-work conflict variables were grouped into tertiles for the analysis. In this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.82 for family-to-work conflict and 0.73 for work-to-family conflict.\n\n【23】Personality characteristics: type A behaviour pattern and affect balance\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The Framingham type A questionnaire consists of 10 items with two to four response categories and a score range of 0--1 for each item, yielding a total score of 0--10^)^. The participants were grouped into those with a type A behaviour pattern, who scored over the median of the score distribution in this study population, and those with a type B behaviour pattern, who scored at the median level or below^)^. In this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.82.\n\n【25】The affect balance scale consists of 10 items (five items for positive affect and five items for negative affect) with four response categories and a score of 0--3 for each item^)^. The affect balance score was calculated as the positive affect score minus the negative affect score, yielding a total score of −15 to 15. The participants were grouped into those with a positive affect, who scored 0 or higher, and those with a negative affect, who scored less than 0. In this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.67 for the positive scale and 0.68 for the negative scale.\n\n【26】Job satisfaction\n----------------\n\n【27】Global job satisfaction was evaluated using a single-item measure by asking whether the participants were satisfied with their job as a whole taking everything into consideration^)^. The participants rated their job satisfaction according to one of four response categories: very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied. For the analysis, the participants were divided into two groups: those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied with their jobs. In our previous study of Japanese civil servants, the single-item overall job satisfaction measurement was found to be moderately to strongly correlated with facets of job satisfaction, including satisfaction with take-home pay, work prospects, coworkers, physical working conditions, management of one's department, how one's abilities are used and the interest and skill involved in the job^)^. In that study, age, work hours and the facets of the job satisfaction measurement accounted for 67.9% of the variance observed in the overall measurement.\n\n【28】Long-standing illnesses\n-----------------------\n\n【29】Participants with long-standing illnesses may be more likely to report that they are exposed to stressful work or family characteristics and that they are dissatisfied with their job due to their negative prospects for their work. To control the potential confounding effects of long-standing illnesses, the participants were asked to answer yes or no to a question regarding whether they had a long-standing illness.\n\n【30】Statistical analysis\n--------------------\n\n【31】A logistic regression analysis was performed to examine通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> whether there were employment grade and gender differences in job dissatisfaction,通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> whether work, family and personality characteristics contribute to job dissatisfaction and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> whether and how much employment and gender differences in job dissatisfaction can be explained by work, family and personality characteristics. To clarify which characteristics contributed more to employment grade differences in job dissatisfaction than other characteristics, we calculated the age-adjusted model, and then each of the work, family and personality characteristics was added to the age-adjusted model. In the fully-adjusted model, all of age, work, family, and personality characteristics were simultaneously entered. To clarity which characteristics contributed more to gender differences in job dissatisfaction, we calculated the age- and grade-adjusted model, and then each of these characteristics was added to the model. In the fully-adjusted model, all of age, grade, and these characteristics were simultaneously entered. There is some evidence of gender differences in job dissatisfaction^)^, statistical analyses on employment grade differences in job dissatisfaction were performed separately by gender.\n\n【32】The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

Model 1 is adjusted for grade and age. Model 2 is adjusted for grade, age and work characteristics (control, demand, support, work hours and shift work). Model 3 is adjusted for grade, age and family characteristics (marital status, young children, family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict). Model 4 is adjusted for grade, age and personality characteristics (type A behaviour pattern and affect balance). Model 5 is adjusted for grade, age, work, family characteristics, personality characteristics and long-standing illness. shows the grade differences in job dissatisfaction following adjustment for work, family and personality characteristics among males. In the age-adjusted model, in comparison with the highest grade employees, the OR for job dissatisfaction was 1.58 for the intermediate grade employees and 1.90 for the lowest grade employees. The grade differences were reduced and were no longer significant after adjusting for work characteristics (Model 2). Being middle-aged and having low job control, high job demands and low social support were strongly associated with job dissatisfaction. Long work hours and shift work did not have links with job dissatisfaction. To clarify which work characteristics were most important in reducing the grade differences, each of the work characteristic variables was added to Model 1. The largest reduction was observed when job control was added to the Model 1 (the OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction decreased from 1.90 to 1.09), followed by social support (OR=1.67), shift work (OR=1.89), work hours (OR=1.90) and job demands (OR=2.00).\n\n【36】When the family characteristic variables were added to Model 1 (Model 3), the associations between employment grade and job dissatisfaction were slightly strengthened. The association between being middle-aged and job dissatisfaction weakened. Among the family characteristic variables, work-to-family conflict exhibited the strongest links with job dissatisfaction, followed by family-to-work conflict and being unmarried. Nurturing young children was not associated with job dissatisfaction. To clarify which family characteristics contributed to the changes observed in the grade differences, each of the family characteristic variables was added to Model 1. The inclusion of each of the family characteristic variables hardly changed the grade differences: the OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction was 1.84 for family-to-work conflict, 1.89 for the marital status, 1.90 for nurturing young children and 2.06 for work-to-family conflict.\n\n【37】When the personality characteristic variables were added to Model 1 (Model 4), both a type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity were associated with job dissatisfaction, and the grade differences were reduced only slightly. The OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction increased to 2.01 when the type A behaviour pattern was added to Model 1 and decreased to 1.16 when negative affectivity was added to Model 1. In the fully-adjusted model (Model 5), the grade differences in job dissatisfaction were not significant. Being middle-aged and having low job control, low social support, a high level of work-to-family conflict, a type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity remained significant.\n\n【38】Table 3.Grade differences in job dissatisfaction after adjustment for work, family and personality characteristics among females (n=1,275)Percentage of job\\\ndissatisfaction %Model 1\\\n(Age-adjusted)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 2\\\n(Model 1+ work)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 3\\\n(Model 1+ family)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 4\\\n(Model 1 + personality)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 5\\\n(Fully-adjusted)\\\nOR (95%CI)GradesGrade I10.01.001.001.001.001.00Grade II38.53.73 (0.82--17.0)2.89 (0.60--13.9)4.58 (0.99--21.2)3.95 (0.84--15.6)3.40 (0.67--17.1)Grade III38.93.54 (0.79--15.8)2.38 (0.50--11.4)5.29 (1.16--24.1)3.72 (0.81--17.1)2.88 (0.58--14.4)Age20--2425.71.05 (0.54--2.02)1.33 (0.66--2.70)0.78 (0.38--1.61)1.01 (0.51--1.99)1.09 (0.49--2.41)25--3442.52.24 (1.43--3.48)2.46 (1.53--3.96)1.76 (1.08--2.87)2.20 (1.38--3.49)2.18 (1.28--3.71)35--4441.62.15 (1.36--3.38)2.22 (1.37--3.59)1.75 (1.06--2.88)2.11 (1.32--3.39)2.11 (1.23--3.61)45--5440.12.02 (1.29--3.15)1.83 (1.15--2.92)1.80 (1.14--2.86)1.82 (1.15--2.89)1.74 (1.07--2.83)55--6423.31.001.001.001.001.00ControlLow46.83.38 (2.31--4.94)2.87 (1.93--4.27)Intermediate39.42.33 (1.62--3.35)2.08 (1.43--3.03)High21.51.001.00DemandLow28.41.001.00Intermediate34.21.37 (0.98--1.90)1.13 (0.79--1.61)High50.92.62 (1.81--3.79)1.78 (1.18--2.68)SupportLow48.82.21 (1.60--3.06)2.12 (1.51--2.98)Intermediate36.51.30 (0.95--1.79)1.35 (0.97--1.89)High28.71.001.00Work hours\\<7 h41.31.61 (0.93--2.80)1.92 (1.08--3.43)7--9 h31.91.001.009--11 h47.61.61 (1.20--2.17)1.36 (1.00--1.87)11\\< h48.11.81 (1.14--2.87)1.56 (0.96--2.53)Shift workNo34.51.001.00Yes43.00.97 (0.74--1.27)0.85 (0.64--1.14)Marital statusMarried37.21.001.00Unmarried41.11.59 (1.15--2.20)1.49 (1.05--2.12)Children under 15 yrNo38.61.001.00Yes37.90.75 (0.54--1.04)0.79 (0.56--1.12)Family-to-work conflictLow31.41.001.00Intermediate37.51.27 (0.90--1.79)1.25 (0.86--1.81)High44.91.45 (1.04--2.01)1.36 (0.96--1.93)Work-to-family conflictLow23.61.001.00Intermediate30.01.34 (0.92--1.95)1.16 (0.78--1.73)High50.23.10 (2.15--4.46)2.00 (1.30--3.07)Type A behaviour patternType A45.12.15 (1.66--2.78)1.47 (1.07--2.01)Type B27.01.001.00Affect balanceNegative48.93.01 (2.34--3.87)2.27 (1.73--2.98)Positive24.01.001.00Long-standing illnessNo38.11.00Yes39.11.13 (0.84--1.51)Grade I: highest grade employees; Grade II: intermediate grade employees; Grade III: lowest grade employees; OR: odds ratio; 95%CI: 95% confidence interval.

Model 5 is adjusted for grade, age, work, family characteristics, personality characteristics and long-standing illness. shows the grade differences in job dissatisfaction following adjustment for work, family and personality characteristics among females. In the age-adjusted model, in comparison with the highest grade employees, the OR for job dissatisfaction was 3.73 for the intermediate grade employees and 3.54 for the lowest grade employees; however, the grade differences were not statistically significant. The grade differences were reduced after being adjusted for work characteristics (Model 2). Being middle-aged and having low job control, high job demands, low social support and long work hours were associated with job dissatisfaction. There were no significant associations between shift work and job dissatisfaction. To clarify which work characteristics were most important in reducing the grade differences, each of the work characteristic variables was added to Model 1. The largest reduction was observed when job control was added to Model 1 (the OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction decreased from 3.54 to 1.67), followed by social support (OR=2.81), shift work (OR=3.26), work demands (OR=4.77) and work hours (OR=5.01).\n\n【39】When the family characteristic variables were added to Model 1 (Model 3), the associations between the employment grade and job dissatisfaction strengthened and became statistically significant. The association between being middle-aged and job dissatisfaction weakened. Among the family characteristic variables, work-to-family conflict exhibited the strongest association with job dissatisfaction, followed by family-to-work conflict and being unmarried. Females nurturing young children tended to have lower ORs for job dissatisfaction; however, the association was not significant. To clarify which family characteristics contributed to the changes observed in the grade differences, each of the family characteristic variables was added to Model 1. The largest increase was observed when work-to-family conflict was added (the OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction increased to 4.87), followed by family-to-work conflict (OR=3.73), the marital status (OR=3.61) and nurturing young children (OR=3.55).\n\n【40】When the personality characteristic variables were added to Model 1 (Model 4), the grade differences in job dissatisfaction slightly increased and both a type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity demonstrated links with job dissatisfaction. The OR of the lowest grade employees for job dissatisfaction increased to 4.47 when a type A behaviour pattern was added to Model 1 and decreased to 3.30 when negative affectivity was added to Model 1. In the fully-adjusted model (Model 5), the grade differences were not significant, and low job control, high job demands, low social support and being unmarried remained significant.\n\n【41】Table 4.Gender differences in job dissatisfaction after adjustment for work, family and personality characteristics (n=3,556)Prevalence of job\\\ndissatisfaction %Model 1\\\n(Age -adjusted)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 2\\\n(Model 1 + grade)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 3\\\n(Model 2+ work)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 4\\\n(Model 2+ family)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 5\\\n(Model 2 + personality)\\\nOR (95%CI)Model 6\\\n(Fully-adjusted)\\\nOR (95%CI)SexMen21.21.001.001.001.001.001.00Female31.41.32 (1.14--1.52)1.24 (1.07--1.44)1.04 (0.88--1.24)0.97 (0.83--1.13)1.16 (0.99--1.35)0.95 (0.79--1.14)Age20--2418.91.03 (0.61--1.71)0.85 (0.50--1.43)1.28 (0.73--2.23)0.74 (0.42--1.29)0.86 (0.50--1.49)1.15 (0.63--2.12)25--3425.41.93 (1.52--2.46)1.57 (1.20--2.05)2.01 (1.50--2.68)1.33 (0.99--1.79)1.57 (1.18--2.08)1.85 (1.34--2.56)35--4427.82.00 (1.57--2.54)1.63 (1.26--2.12)1.85 (1.40--2.45)1.35 (1.01--1.82)1.59 (1.21--2.09)1.71 (1.25--2.35)45--5424.01.90 (1.50--2.40)1.69 (1.33--2.16)1.65 (1.28--2.12)1.57 (1.22--2.02)1.61 (1.25--2.07)1.59 (1.22--2.08)55--6418.51.001.001.001.001.001.00GradesGrade I15.51.001.001.001.001.00Grade II23.71.62 (1.20--2.18)1.26 (0.92--1.73)1.58 (1.17--2.15)1.52 (1.12--2.08)1.23 (0.88--1.70)Grade III26.01.77 (1.33--2.35)1.06 (0.77--1.44)1.90 (1.42--2.55)1.58 (1.17--2.14)1.07 (0.75--1.43)ControlLow29.43.94 (3.21--4.85)3.23 (2.60--4.91)Intermediate24.42.29 (1.88--2.80)2.02 (1.64--2.48)High18.81.001.00DemandLow19.11.001.00Intermediate24.51.25 (1.04--1.49)1.01 (0.83--1.22)High33.72.21 (1.79--2.72)1.43 (1.13--1.81)SupportLow28.62.56 (2.11--3.10)2.39 (1.96--2.92)Intermediate23.81.53 (1.26--1.86)1.49 (1.22--1.82)High20.31.001.00Work hours\\<7 h26.51.22 (0.93--1.61)1.21 (0.91--1.62)7--9 h20.11.001.009--11 h30.51.30 (1.09--1.57)1.10 (0.91--1.34)11\\< h38.01.40 (1.07--1.83)1.14 (0.86--1.51)Shift workNo32.81.001.00Yes40.71.07 (0.88--1.83)0.98 (0.80--1.20)Marital statusMarried33.41.001.00Unmarried38.11.40 (1.14--1.71)1.30 (1.05--1.62)Young childrenNo34.11.001.00Yes34.90.87 (0.73--1.05)0.90 (0.74--1.09)Family-to-work conflictLow17.41.001.00Intermediate22.21.24 (1.04--1.49)1.27 (1.05--1.55)High37.81.34 (1.11--1.63)1.23 (1.00--1.51)Work-to-family conflictLow15.51.001.00Intermediate26.31.21 (1.00--1.47)1.11 (0.90--1.37)High42.22.58 (2.12--3.14)1.91 (1.51--2.42)Type A behaviour patternType A43.61.94 (1.68--2.25)1.49 (1.25--1.77)Type B25.61.001.00Affect balanceNegative45.03.29 (2.82--3.84)2.44 (2.07--2.88)Positive19.11.001.00Long-standing illnessYes21.61.00No30.31.09 (0.92--1.29)Grade I: highest grade employees; Grade II: intermediate grade employees; Grade III: lowest grade employees; OR: odds ratio; 95%CI: 95% confidence interval. Model 1 is adjusted for sex and age. Model 2 is adjusted for sex, age and grade. Model 3 is adjusted for sex, age, grade and work characteristics (control, demand, support, work hours and shift work). Model 4 is adjusted for sex, age, grade and family characteristics (marital status, young children, family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict). Model 5 is adjusted for sex, age, grade and personality characteristics (type A behaviour pattern and affect balance). Model 6 is adjusted for sex, age, grade, work, family characteristics, personality characteristics and long-standing illness. shows the gender differences in job dissatisfaction before and after adjustment for work, family and personality characteristics. In comparison to males, the age-adjusted OR of females for job dissatisfaction was 1.32 (Model 1). The inclusion of the employment grade to the model (Model 2) slightly attenuated the gender difference (OR=1.24). Lower grade employees tended to have job dissatisfaction. When controlling for work characteristics (Model 3), the gender difference was no longer significant (OR=1.04). Low job control, high job demands, low social support and long work hours were independently associated with job dissatisfaction. There were no significant relationships between shift work and job dissatisfaction. To clarify which work characteristics were most important in reducing the gender differences, each of the work characteristic variables was added to Model 2. When either shift work or work demands was added to Model 2, the OR was reduced to 1.14, followed by job control (OR=1.18), work hours (OR=1.22) and social support at work (OR=1.26).\n\n【42】When the family characteristic variables were added to Model 2 (Model 4), the gender differences in job dissatisfaction were no longer significant (OR=0.97). Both high levels of work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict were strongly related to job dissatisfaction. To clarify which family characteristics were most important in reducing the gender differences, each of the family characteristic variables was added to Model 2. The largest reduction in the gender differences was observed when work-to-family conflict was added to Model 3 (OR=1.03), followed by family-to-work conflict (OR=1.12), nurturing young children (OR=1.23) and the marital status (OR=1.23).\n\n【43】When the personality characteristic variables were added to Model 1 (Model 5), the gender differences were no longer significant, and males were found to be more dissatisfied with their jobs than females. The OR of females for job dissatisfaction decreased to 1.06 when a type A behaviour pattern was added to Model 1 and increased to 1.32 when negative affectivity was added to Model 1.\n\n【44】The Hosmer-Lemeshow tests validated the final models (Model 5 in  and and Model 6 in ).\n\n【45】Discussion \n==========\n\n【46】This study showed that low grade employees have job dissatisfaction. Various work, family and personality characteristics were significantly associated with job dissatisfaction. Among these characteristics, low job control, low social support and negative affectivity were the three major explanatory factors of grade differences in job dissatisfaction. This study also showed that there are gender differences in job dissatisfaction. Various work, family and personality characteristics were found to more or less contribute to gender differences in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【47】Associations of work, family and personality characteristics with job dissatisfaction\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】Previous studies reported that employees with limited job control, high job demands, long work hours, shift work, poor social support at work, work-family conflicts, type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity were more likely to have job dissatisfaction, ^)^. The findings from this study are consistent with previous studies.\n\n【49】It is worth noting that the strength of the associations between job dissatisfaction and being middle-aged, having high job demands and working long hours were reduced considerably, particularly among males, after adjusting for work-family conflicts and family structure. This may partly reflect that high demands, long work hours, work-family conflicts, and raising young children were more accumulated among those of middle age in this study. This attenuation of the associations indicates that:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> long work hours and high job demands are potential causes of work-family conflicts;通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> work-family conflicts are more important causes of job dissatisfaction; and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> demanding long work hours themselves may not be a major cause of job dissatisfaction. In addition, the attenuation of the associations between job dissatisfaction and age and work characteristics observed after adjusting for family and personality characteristics is not explained primarily by collinearity among the variables because the work, family and personality characteristic variables were not strongly correlated.\n\n【50】Socioeconomic inequalities in job dissatisfaction\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【51】This study showed that low grade employees have job dissatisfaction, consistent with previous research, ^)^. In addition, the magnitude of the grade differences decreased, increased or hardly changed after adjustment for each of the work, family and personality characteristics. The different patterns in changes observed in the grade differences observed before and after adjustment can be explained by the combination of patterns observed in the grade differences in work, family and personality characteristics and the patterns observed in the associations between these characteristics and job dissatisfaction. In fact, in this study, high grade employees were more common among senior age groups, and their work and family characteristics also differed from those of other age groups, suggesting that there are grade differences in work, family, and personality characteristics.\n\n【52】It was reported that a low employment grade is associated with low job control, low job demands, low social support and shift work^)^. There were no significant grade differences in long work hours among males, whereas high grade female employees had longer work hours. Meanwhile, low job control, high job demands, low social support and long work hours were associated with job dissatisfaction in this study, while shift work had no significant links with job dissatisfaction. Therefore, the relatively large reduction in the grade difference in job dissatisfaction observed after adjustment for job control and social support may be explained by the combination of a predominant distribution of these work characteristics among low grade employees and the strong associations between these work characteristics and job dissatisfaction. The little changes observed in the grade differences after adjusting for shift work may be attributable to the combination of a predominant distribution of shift work among low grade employees and a lack of significant associations between shift work and job dissatisfaction. The rather large increase observed in the grade difference after adjusting for work hours and job demands may be attributable to the combination of a predominance of these work characteristics among high grade employees and the strong associations between these work characteristics and job dissatisfaction.\n\n【53】In this study, the grade differences in job dissatisfaction hardly changed following adjustment for family characteristics among males, while the differences increased among females. The gender differences in the changes in the grade differences observed after adjustment for family characteristics may be attributable to the gender difference in grade differences in the family characteristics. Among males, there were no significant grade differences in any of the family characteristics, except for the marital status, in our previous study^)^; therefore, making adjustments for family characteristics may have resulted in the little change observed in the grade differences in job dissatisfaction among males, even if some of the family characteristics were associated with job dissatisfaction. Among females, disadvantaged family characteristics were more common among high grade employees in the previous study; however, these participants were found to be more satisfied with their jobs in this study. Therefore, in females, making adjustments for family characteristics may have resulted in an increase in the grade differences in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【54】In this study, the grade differences increased following adjustment for a type A behavior pattern and decreased following adjustment for negative affectivity. The different patterns in changes observed in the grade differences may be explained by the different patterns in the grade differences between a type A behavior pattern and negative affectivity. While negative affectivity has been reported to be more common among low grade employees^)^, a type A behavior pattern was more common among high grade employees^)^. Because both personality characteristics were significantly associated with job dissatisfaction, making adjustments for a type A behavior pattern may have resulted in an increase in the grade difference, and the opposite may be true for negative affectivity.\n\n【55】Overall, in both males and females, low job control, low social support and negative affectivity were the three major explanatory factors of the grade differences in job dissatisfaction. According to the Local Public Service Act, local civil servants must obey the laws, regulations and orders of superiors; therefore, the level of job control each civil servant has may be highly influenced by his or her employment grade. Well-educated individuals such as civil servants may have a certain degree of confidence in their thinking and decision-making at work; therefore, rejection and limited acceptance of their work by superiors may result in negative feelings toward their work and be a potential source of grade differences in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【56】Gender inequalities in job dissatisfaction\n------------------------------------------\n\n【57】In this study, females were more likely to have job dissatisfaction than males, consistent with the existing data^)^. The gender differences observed in job dissatisfaction were attenuated significantly and were no longer significant after adjusting for work, family and personality characteristics. However, the magnitude of the changes in the gender differences observed after making the adjustments differed among the variables. Among the work characteristic variables, all of the variables, except for social support, contributed to reducing the gender differences in job dissatisfaction. This can be explained by the fact that通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> high demands at work, long work hours and shift work were more common among females than males in our previous study^)^ and were significantly associated with job dissatisfaction in this study and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> there were no significant gender differences in low social support at work in the previous study, although low social support was associated with job dissatisfaction in this study.\n\n【58】Among the family characteristics, family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict contributed more to reducing the gender differences in job dissatisfaction than the marital status and nurturing young children. These results can be explained by the fact that通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> the gender difference was much larger for family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict than the marital status and nurturing young children in our previous study^)^ and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> the associations between family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict and job dissatisfaction were much stronger than those observed between the family structure variables and job dissatisfaction in this study.\n\n【59】Among the personality characteristics, although both a type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity were associated with job dissatisfaction, the gender differences were reduced following adjustment for a type A behaviour pattern and increased following adjustment for negative affectivity. The different patterns in changes observed after making the adjustments can be explained by the fact that there are gender differences in the prevalence of a type A behaviour pattern and negative affectivity: a type A behaviour pattern is more common among females than males, while the opposite is true for negative affectivity^)^.\n\n【60】Overall, the gender difference in job dissatisfaction can be explained by the combined effects of the degree of gender differences in each work, family and personality characteristic variable and the associations between these variables and job dissatisfaction. In Japan, although gender equality policies have been more intensively introduced in public sectors than private sectors, gender differences in work and family characteristics remain and may be potential sources of gender differences in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【61】Methodological limitations\n--------------------------\n\n【62】It should be mentioned that there are several methodological limitations that may affect the interpretation of the results of this study. First, this study is a cross-sectional study; therefore, it cannot be used to determine the causal nature of the associations observed between job satisfaction and age, gender, employment grade, work characteristics, family characteristics, personality traits and illness. However, reverse causation may not be the major direction because job satisfaction is an overall result of how employees think about their work and family characteristics.\n\n【63】Second, it may be difficult to generalize the results of this study, as the participants were working civil servants. Civil servants comprise a narrow-ranged population in terms of age, education, payment and job security. In addition, gender equality policies are more strictly implemented in civil service workplaces than in non-governmental workplaces. Therefore, it should be noted that the prevalence of job dissatisfaction and grade and gender differences in job satisfaction may be much larger in general working populations.\n\n【64】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【65】This study showed that low grade employees and females have job dissatisfaction. The grade differences were explained largely by job control, social support at work and negative affectivity. The gender differences were explained by a wide variety of work, family and personality characteristics. Reducing socioeconomic and gender inequalities in work and family environments may be sometimes difficult but is important for reducing socioeconomic and gender inequalities in job dissatisfaction.\n\n【66】We are indebted to all the civil servants at the local government for their participation in this study and also to Ms Yasuko Yamazaki, Ms Yoriko Yoshida, and Ms Noriko Annen for their valuable clerical support.

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) are thin films formed upon the adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in a layer-by-layer (LbL) fashion . Typically, PEMs are thin, yet mechanically robust. The thickness and mechanical strength of PEMs can be varied within a wide range, and typically vary between nm to several µm and between a few kPa to several MPa , respectively. This is possible by simply varying the number of deposited polyelectrolyte layers and/or intrinsic properties of polyelectrolytes, such as the charge density, molecular weight and structure \\[,\\]. Other factors can be employed to even induce post-preparative changes of the film properties: For example, the ionic strength and charge-to-size ratio of specific ions , pH stimulation , organic solvent  or inorganic/organic ions exposed to PEMs  have been shown to influence the thickness and mechanical strength of PEMs. Such tunable physical properties of PEMs make them suitable candidates for surface coatings , biological substrates  and electrochemical separators . For the latter type of application, PEMs combined with a suitable electrolyte solvent can tremendously improve the transport of ions through the multilayer. An interesting class of such a solvent is given by ionic liquids (ILs). In the past decade, several studies have reported the potential of ILs in battery systems as they are a good solvent of conductive ions and typically have a large electrochemical window . Earlier, we have shown that PEMs can be swelled with aqueous IL solutions, the swelling is controlled by the IL's hydrophobicity , and the corresponding IL uptake can be controlled by stimulating a charge-excess in PEMs . Similar to organic solvents  and inorganic ions , IL solutions induce swelling in PEMs, which is likely to influence their thickness and viscoelastic properties, i.e. the viscosity and elasticity. These physical properties describe whether a swollen multilayer is thin yet robust enough for a potential application as electrochemical separators. More importantly, changes in the multilayer thickness and viscosity/elasticity on the IL-induced swelling reflect the underlying molecular interactions, providing a better understanding of the microscopic processes governing swelling.\n\n【2】Experimentally, it is challenging to simultaneously extract viscoelastic parameters from in-situ swelling experiments, and often complementary techniques/methods, e.g. ellipsometry and nano-indentation are employed for such purposes . In this work, we employed the Kelvin-Voigt model to PEMs swollen with an IL solution by using the corresponding frequency (Δf) and dissipation (ΔD) shifts measured by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Because the quartz sensor used in QCM-D has piezoelectric properties, the acoustic wave propagated through a film adsorbed on the sensor is sensitive to the mechanical strength of the film . The dependence of the Δf and ΔD shift on the thickness and mechanical strength of a film adsorbed on a quartz sensor are well established , and varies slightly with the measurement conditions, for example, the presence of bulk liquid, and the mechanical property of the adsorbed film, e.g. rigid vs. viscoelastic . For a viscoelastic film, a suitable model is the Kelvin-Voigt, which has previously been used to describe relatively rigid viscoelastic films, such as PEMs . This modeling provides a platform to extract the film thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus (elasticity) from a single kinetic data set of QCM-D, allowing a reliable comparison of the parameters over different swelling cycles/steps of PEM. In recent years, multiple studies have implemented Kelvin-Voigt modeling to examine these parameters of PEMs during the layer assembly at different ionic strengths of the polyelectrolyte and/or washing solution  and upon the pH-induced swelling of the assembled layers . However, the QCM-D-based Kelvin-Voigt modeling has not been implemented to characterize the post-preparative swelling of PEMs as a function of the concentration of salt solutions, particularly organic salt solution. Furthermore, the existing studies of PEMs have focused on the modeled thickness, and on either the viscosity or elastic modulus of the multilayers. In this study, we have analyzed all three Kelvin-Voigt parameters for PEMs swollen with aqueous solutions of an IL in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, we used PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayer systems and two water-soluble ILs, i.e. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIM) and 1-Hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (HMIM). The PEM swelling was performed with increasing concentrations of aqueous IL solution in reversible cycles. We realized that the modelling requires that one takes into account the concentration-dependent viscosity of the IL solutions. The results show a monotonic increase of the multilayer thickness upon swelling with increasing IL concentrations, while the multilayer viscosity and elastic modulus show a non-monotonic change. Interestingly, these trends were observed in the case of swelling with IL and not with inorganic salt, i.e. NaCl. The changes in the modeled data can be divided into three concentration regimes of IL, which are controlled by the uptake of ions of IL and hydration water, modulating the hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic shielding in PEMs.\n\n【3】2. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【4】2.1. Polyelectrolytes \n---------------------\n\n【5】We used branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (M~W~ \\~25,000 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) (M~W~ \\~ 100,000−200,000 g/mol, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) (M~W~ \\~ 120,000−200,000 g/mol, Polysciences, Hirschberg, Germany) and poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSS) (M~W~ \\~ 70,000 g/mol, Acros, Geel, Belgium). PSS was dialyzed and lyophilized, removing low molecular weight components, the other polymers were used as received. The polyelectrolytes were dissolved in a 0.25 M NaCl solution in ultrapure water, attaining a final polymer concentration (in terms of the monomer unit) of 10 mM. All solutions were adjusted to pH 6.5 by the addition of either 0.1 M NaOH or HCl (Honeywell Fluka, Bucharest, Romania). An aqueous solution of 0.25 M NaCl at pH 6.5 was used as a washing solution. All solutions were based on ultrapure water ($\\mathsf$ \\> 18 MΩcm) purified in a Milli-Q Academic purification stage (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).\n\n【6】2.2. Ionic Liquids (ILs) \n------------------------\n\n【7】1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIM) (purity \\> 98%, dry) and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (HMIM) (purity \\> 98.5%, dry) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). They are water-soluble ILs, and were dissolved in ultrapure water at different molar concentrations for the swelling experiments.\n\n【8】2.3. Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) \n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation detection having four parallel flow chambers (E4, QSense, Göteborg, Sweden) was employed to monitor the assembly and swelling of PEMs on a gold-coated quartz crystal (fundamental frequency of 5 MHz, QSense). Prior to use, the crystals were cleaned by heating them in a cleaning solution for 20 min at 70 °C. The cleaning solution is a mixture of 25% ammonia solution (Acros), 35% hydrogen peroxide (VWR), and ultrapure water at a 1:1:5 volume ratio. QCM-D shifts were acquired only after establishing a constant baseline with ultrapure water at 20 ± 0.02 °C. Polyelectrolytes and IL solutions were injected to the quartz crystals at a flow rate of 200 and 50 µL/min, respectively. Five normalized overtones (3^rd^ to 11^th^) of the QCM-D responses, i.e. the frequency (Δf) and dissipation (ΔD) shifts, were acquired.\n\n【10】2.4. Assembly of PEM \n--------------------\n\n【11】Polyanion and polycation solutions were alternatively injected to the quartz crystals through the flow cells, to form PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS multilayers. A plateau in the Δf and ΔD shifts of QCM-D indicates the accomplishment of a polyelectrolyte layer. The washing solution was injected after an adsorption time of \\~10--15 mins to remove any excess salt and/or polymer. After the adsorption of 10 polyelectrolyte layers, the film was washed with ultrapure water at pH 6.5.\n\n【12】2.5. Swelling Cycles of PEM with IL Solutions \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The swelling measurements were done by injecting IL solutions to PEMs adsorbed on the quartz crystal in QCM-D. Since the solution exchange in the QCM-D flow cell takes \\~5 min at a flow rate of 50 μL/min, the IL solutions were flowed for 15 min, and then incubated at a zero flow rate until the Δf and ΔD shifts reached a plateau. The plateau is defined by an absolute change in Δf and ΔD by less than ±2 Hz and ±10^−6^, respectively. Typically, such a plateau was reached within 1 h from the injection of the IL solution. Otherwise, the observation was continued up to 8 h. Only in a few cases of swelling, no plateau was reached, even after this time. After each swelling step, ultrapure water was injected until a new plateau was reached, representing the deswelling of the multilayer. Such a swelling and deswelling step forms one swelling cycle. A series of swelling cycles with a successively increasing IL concentration was performed for each multilayer, employing EMIM, HMIM or NaCl solutions. All swelling cycles were repeated and averaged over at least three different multilayer samples.\n\n【14】2.6. Kelvin-Voigt Modeling \n--------------------------\n\n【15】While the Δf shift of QCM-D in a first approximation represents the mass of an adsorbed film on a quartz crystal, the ΔD shift expresses the rigidity/softness of the adsorbed film. Although these relations are straightforward in the case of a rigid film in contact with a gas phase, yielding the Sauerbrey equation , they are somewhat complex for viscoelastic films in contact with a viscous bulk liquid, e.g. PEMs in the hydrated or swollen state. The dependence of QCM-D shifts on the thickness, viscosity and elasticity of hydrated or swollen PEMs can be computed by considering the bulk liquid effect and using a suitable model for multilayer viscoelasticity such as the Kelvin-Voigt model . Equations通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u>,通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> represent the corresponding relation/dependence, where the viscosity and elastic modulus of the adsorbed film is formulated with the Kelvin-Voigt model:$$\\Delta f \\approx - \\frac{2\\pi\\rho_d_}\\left\\{ {\\frac{\\eta_}{\\delta_} + d_\\rho_\\omega - 2d_\\left( \\frac{\\eta_}{\\delta_} \\right)^\\frac{\\eta_\\omega^}{\\mu_^ + \\omega^\\eta_^}} \\right\\}$$ $$\\Delta D \\approx \\frac{2\\pi f\\rho_d_}\\left\\{ {\\frac{\\eta_}{\\delta_} + 2d_\\left( \\frac{\\eta_}{\\delta_} \\right)^\\frac{\\mu_\\omega^}{\\mu_^ + \\omega^\\eta_^}} \\right\\}$$ in the above equations, f, $\\rho$, μ, η and d designate the resonance frequency (for the given overtone), density, elastic modulus, viscosity and thickness, respectively, and $\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac}$ ($\\omega$ = 2πf is the angular frequency). The subscripts 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the quartz crystal, adsorbed film and immersion liquid (water or IL solution), respectively.\n\n【16】We used the Kelvin-Voigt modeling feature of the Q-Tools software , which allows to compute the Δf and ΔD shifts according to the above-mentioned equations and then to perform the least-square fitting of the measured QCM-D shifts. The density ($\\rho_$) and viscosity ($\\eta_$) of the immersion liquid, and the density of the PEM ($\\rho_$) were kept as fixed parameters in the modeling. The parameters to be determined, i.e. the thickness (d~1~), viscosity ($\\eta_$) and elastic modulus ($\\mu_$) of the PEM were kept free while performing the modeling. The parameters of the quartz crystal are constant and were taken into account in the Q-Tools software during the modeling.\n\n【17】Concerning the PEM layer formation, the modeling was performed for the time covering the assembly of 10 layers, including the final washing step with water. Here, a dilute polymer solution or water is the bulk liquid in contact with the adsorbed film. The density and viscosity of pure water were therefore used as fixed parameters, and a well-reported mass density of the PEM (1070 kg m^−3^)  was used as the third fixed parameter .\n\n【18】For the swelling cycles in the IL solution, the modeling was only performed for data acquired during the exposure of the multilayer to the IL solution. Here, it was found that the viscosity of the IL solution, which is in contact with the film, has a major impact, since the Kelvin-Voigt modeling results of swollen multilayers were most sensitive to the viscosity of the bulk liquid, $\\eta_$, as observed from the corresponding least-square fit . Therefore, the viscosity of IL solutions was measured using a Rheometer (MCR 102, Anton Paar). The concentration-dependent values were used as the fixed parameter $\\eta_$ of the solution phase, while modeling PEMs swollen with the respective IL concentration. Other fixed parameters were the same as used in the case of modeling hydrated PEMs . Using the fixed and free parameters, we performed the modeling over the 3^rd^ to 11^th^ QCM-D overtones as a global fit of all overtones with a joint set of parameters. The same approach was used for the modeling of PEMs swollen with NaCl solutions.\n\n【19】3. Results \n==========\n\n【20】3.1. Bulk Liquid Viscosity \n--------------------------\n\n【21】At the concentrations of the IL and salt solutions employed for swelling, the salt affects the liquid viscosity rather strongly, which has to be taken into account in the Kelvin-Voigt model.  shows the liquid viscosity data as obtained by rheological measurements. The viscosities increase linearly with the salt content. In addition, they scale with the cation hydrophobicity in the order HMIM \\> EMIM \\> Na. This indicates that it is hydrophobic interactions that cause the viscosity enhancement. Note that the anion (Cl^−^) is the same for all three salts.\n\n【22】3.2. Kelvin-Voigt Modelling to Extract Thickness and Viscoelastic Parameters of PEM \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The 7^th^ overtone of the frequency and dissipation shift is given in a,b for the two layer systems investigated. In all cases, five overtones were fitted with the model, while for clarity we display here only one exemplary overtone. A full data set for a multilayer swelling at a given IL concentration including all fitted overtones is given in the supporting information .\n\n【24】We first analyze the data during the layer formation, which is completed with the final flushing with pure water 删除21:<u></u>. Up to this point, the QCM-D traces show a step-wise decrease in the frequency, Δf (mass uptake, black line) and alternating changes in the dissipation, ΔD (damping, blue line), confirming the layer-by-layer assembly of the PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers. Moreover, the frequency shifts extracted from the fits with the Kelvin-Voigt model ('modeled' QCM-D traces, red lines) are in agreement with the measured QCM-D shifts on the layer assembly. The same holds for the dissipation data.\n\n【25】The thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus determined from the modeling show a stepwise increase on the assembly of subsequent layers (up to 600 and 350 min in c,d, respectively). Upon the final washing step with pure water , the thickness of the assembled layers decreases slightly along with a substantial increase in the film viscosity and elastic modulus. The removal of excess salt upon the final washing step with pure water is likely to be the reason behind the lowering of the film thickness and enhancement in the film viscoelasticity. According to our modeled data (c,d, and ), the assembled PSS/PDADMAC film is thicker and more viscoelastic in comparison to PSS/PAH, possibly because of the longer persistence length of PDADMAC (more rigid polymer). The thickness and elastic modulus of the PEM determined from our modeling are similar with those reported in the literature for similar multilayer systems. By employing techniques such as ellipsometry , or atomic force microscopy , multiple studies had shown that the thickness of PEMs assembled from about 10 layers of synthetic polyelectrolytes at an ionic strength of \\~0.25 M NaCl, pH of 6.5 and relative humidity of 100% varies between \\~25 to 50 nm. On the other hand, the viscosity and/or elasticity of hydrated PEMs were determined via an adhesion/force measurement using atomic force microscopy  or an acoustic impedance measurement using QCM  or upon performing the Kelvin-Voigt modeling of QCM-D data . These studies report a viscosity of \\~0.05 kg m^−1^ s^−1^ and an elastic modulus of \\~2 to 5 MPa for multilayers assembled from about 10 adsorbed layers of polyelectrolytes. The agreement of our modeled data with these reported values in the literature validates the Kelvin-Voigt modeling performed in this study.\n\n【26】3.3. Modeling of PEM Swollen with EMIM Solution \n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【27】To the right-hand side of the arrow, a,b show the measured QCM-D shifts of PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS on the subsequent exposure to the EMIM solution and water. This reversible swelling cycle (IL solution/water) was performed with a stepwise increase of the EMIM concentration in subsequent swelling cycles, as indicated by the values in the graphs. A decrease in Δf (mass uptake) and an increase in ΔD (damping) upon exposure to the EMIM solutions indicate an overall mass increase of the multilayers. The process appears to be reversible up to a certain EMIM concentration 删除21:<u></u>. a,b also display the agreement between the measured and modeled QCM-D shifts of the PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers swollen with the EMIM solutions. Time-traces of the corresponding modeled thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus obtained are shown in c,d. Here, the modeling was only performed within the duration at which the multilayer is in contact with an EMIM solution, resulting in the non-continuous lines in a,b. To further analyze the salt dependence of the modeled parameters, we have extracted the thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus of the PEMs from these time-traces. The equilibrium values for each salt concentration were extracted at the time-point prior to the injection of water, resulting in an increase of Δf and decrease of ΔD 删除21:<u></u>, and are given in  in dependence of the EMIM concentration.\n\n【28】3.4. Thickness of PEM upon Swelling with EMIM Solutions \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】The salt concentration-dependent equilibrium thickness of the films upon swelling increases with the EMIM concentration . For both PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers, the thickness of the swollen film reaches up to \\~1.5 times the film thickness of the non-swollen condition at zero EMIM concentration. In the case of PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS, the film thickness begins to decrease at ≥1.25 M EMIM concentration, indicating a partial dissolution of the multilayer (a). Such a dissolution of PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers was not observed (b). These results match with the qualitatively discussed extent of swelling (change in the Δf shift) of the multilayers and the stability limit concentration (c~stab~) of EMIM for the swollen multilayers reported in our earlier work . The absolute change in the Δf shift (mass uptake) and the modeled thickness at c~stab~ for the PSS/PADADMAC multilayers is relatively higher, indicating a larger uptake of IL in PSS/PADADMAC as compared to PSS/PAH. This is likely to be the reason behind the lower stability limit for the former multilayer.\n\n【30】3.5. Viscosity and Elastic Modulus of PEM upon Swelling with EMIM Solutions \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Unlike the thickness, the viscosity and elastic modulus of the swollen multilayers show a non-monotonic change with an increasing EMIM concentration (a,b). Their standard error is higher compared to that of the modeled thickness data. This probably arises from the coupled dependence of Δf and ΔD on µ~1~ and η~1~, while their dependence on d~1~ is simply linear (see Equations通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u>), resulting in a relatively high sensitivity of these modeled parameters on the statistical deviation in the measured QCM-D shifts. Nevertheless, both the viscosity and elastic modulus of the PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers increase by two- to four-fold at around 0.25 and 0.5 M EMIM concentration, respectively. Above this EMIM concentration, both the viscosity and elastic modulus drop to the initial viscoelasticity, i.e. of the hydrated multilayers. With a further increasing IL concentration, the film viscoelasticity either stays constant (PAH) or decreases further (PDADMAC).\n\n【32】3.6. Viscoelastic Parameters for Different IL and Salt \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Furthermore, we performed the modeling in cases of multilayer swelling with aqueous solutions of another IL, i.e. HMIM and also an inorganic salt, i.e. NaCl.  presents the modeled thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus of swollen PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS vs. either the IL or NaCl concentration. The modeled data show fundamentally different trends between the cases of ILs and inorganic salt. In particular, for the IL solutions, the changes in the thickness, viscosity and elasticity of PEMs upon swelling can be divided into three concentration regimes of IL. In the first regime, which is between 0 to 0.5 M EMIM and 0 to 0.25 M HMIM, respectively, the thickness of the multilayer shows a small increase, whereas the film viscosity and elasticity increase by about four-fold. In the second regime, the multilayer stretches up to \\~1.5 and \\~2 times the hydrated film thickness, between 0.5 to 1.25 M EMIM and 0.25 to 0.7 M HMIM, respectively. In this concentration regime, both the film viscosity and elasticity either stay constant or slightly decrease (a,b). In the third regime, which is above 1.25 M EMIM and 0.7 M HMIM, the film thickness shows a small drop, and the film viscosity and elasticity continue to clearly decrease below the initial values of the hydrated multilayer, indicating a partial dissolution of the multilayer (a,b). In contrast, in the case of NaCl, the thickness of the swollen multilayers increases more or less linearly up to 1 M NaCl and then levels off (c). The film viscosity stays more of less constant, and the elastic modulus decreases slightly with an increasing NaCl concentration. Overall, the changes in the film parameters of the multilayer are monotonous without showing distinct concentration regimes upon swelling with the NaCl solution.\n\n【34】4. Discussion \n=============\n\n【35】Employing the Kelvin-Voigt modeling, we have investigated three physical parameters, i.e. the thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus of PEMs in the hydrated and swollen state. As described in the results section, the viscoelastic parameters can be varied over a wide range depending on the salt type and concentration. The general behavior pointed out in  can be divided into three concentration regimes of IL . The thickness data in a,b are consistent with our previous qualitative description based on the frequency shift data vs. IL concentration . At low IL concentrations (first regime) the films slightly swell with an increasing IL concentration; then, in a second regime, the swelling effect becomes steeper, until at a limiting concentration (c~sw~) a final thickness is reached, which forms the transition to the third regime. The modeled thickness data show a similar behavior to the previous frequency shift data, because the thickness (d) and Δf are strongly related (see Equation通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u>). Although the frequency shift data represent only the fast kinetics, i.e. initial 5 mins from the IL injection , the corresponding shift contributes to \\>80% of the total frequency shift, particularly for the swelling cases (in the first and second regimes) of the PSS/PDADMAC multilayers.\n\n【36】It is interesting that the behavior of the viscosity and the elastic modulus also show distinct features according to these three regimes. Our results show that the PEMs become both more viscous and elastic (by two- to four-fold) in the first IL concentration regime. However, the values of these parameters drop to the initial values with small changes with an increasing IL concentration in the second regime and further in the third regime. Below, we will discuss these results in terms of a molecular interpretation.\n\n【37】At the assembly conditions, the PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS and PEI(PSS/PAH)~4~PSS multilayers are charge-neutral and contain roughly 40% (v/v) water, i.e. in-situ water of PEMs . Hydrated ions of IL or salt are driven into the multilayer by a difference in the chemical potential inside and in the solution, which is generated upon exposure to an IL solution. The influx of the IL solution in the PEMs reaches an equilibrium via the exchange of hydrated ions of IL and the in-situ water of the multilayer. Because of this exchange, the overall water content in the PEM shifts, i.e. it may either increase or decrease compared to the in-situ water content of the PEM. As a simple means to compare the softness and thus the water content of different films with different QCM-D frequency shifts, an analysis of the ratio of ΔD to Δf was proposed . For our present data, the ΔD to Δf ratio vs. IL concentration is non-linear , indicating a non-linear increase in the water content of the PEM upon swelling with an increasing IL concentration. On the other hand, the uptake of the IL cation, as quantified in our earlier work , shows a linear dependence on the IL concentration.\n\n【38】4.1. Viscoelastic Properties in First Regime \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【39】With the above information, we can argue that in the first concentration regime of the IL, the uptake of ions in the PEM is relatively low, and the overall water content in the PEM stays more or less the same as in the hydrated PEM (Scheme 1 of ). This leads to an overall small increase in the multilayer thickness. The large increase in the film viscosity and elastic modulus in this regime was observed in the cases of both ILs, but not for the case of NaCl (c). This indicates that the mechanical properties of the PEM are sensitive to the uptake of IL solutions, or in other words they are specific to the interactions between the PEM and IL. Here, one plausible argument is that favorable hydrophobic interactions between the incorporated organic cation of the IL and polyelectrolytes of the PEM result in the increased film viscosity and elastic modulus . In fact, since all three salts contain chloride as an anion, any differences in the film properties have to be attributed to the nature of the respective cation, based on the fact that the cations are indeed taken up by the film. In this regard, HMIM, which has a hexyl group, is more hydrophobic than EMIM, and a larger hydrophobicity effect is expected. This is evident in the fact that, while a similar increase in the multilayer thickness is observed at a comparable IL concentration 删除21:<u></u>, the viscoelastic parameters in the first regime are higher for HMIM compared to EMIM, if the same concentrations are compared (compare a,b).\n\n【40】4.2. Viscoelastic Properties in Second Regime \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Above, we discussed that the uptake of the IL cation in the swollen PEM increases linearly with an increasing IL concentration spanning over the different IL concentration regimes. Accordingly, the hydrophobic interactions in the swollen PEM would be expected to increase over the IL concentration regimes, resulting in a continuous increase in the multilayer viscosity and elasticity. However, we observed an opposite trend, indicating that another interaction, i.e. most likely electrostatic interactions between the incorporated IL ions and the polyelectrolytes, plays a role here. The assembly strength of the swollen PEM may loosen with an increased uptake of small extrinsic IL ions due to the screening of the Coulomb attraction between the polyions, lowering the mechanical strength of the PEM. Small inorganic ions are known to exert such a screening effect. For example, Jaber et al. have shown a decrease in the multilayer elasticity upon their treatment with NaCl solutions , and we also observed a small decrease in the elastic modulus of the PEM upon swelling with the NaCl solutions (c). Thus, we argue that the extent of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the PEM and IL determines the observed changes in the thickness, viscosity and elastic modulus of the PEM swollen with a given IL concentration: Small amounts of hydrophobic ions contribute to the film stability by the additional hydrophobic interactions, enhancing the viscosity and shear modulus 删除21:<u></u>. At a larger ion content, however, the screening of the polyelectrolyte crosslinking becomes effective, yielding softer films with fewer new internal interactions 删除21:<u></u>. Consistent with this, the hydration water content in the PEMs is relatively high in the second regime, as indicated by the high ΔD to Δf ratio  and the larger slope in the thickness vs. IL concentration . This increased water content may also contribute in lowering the film viscoelasticity of the swollen PEMs.\n\n【42】4.3. Viscoelastic Properties in Third Regime \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【43】In the third IL concentration regime, the IL uptake reaches a level at which the charge pairs between two or more polyelectrolyte layers are further shielded, resulting in a partial dissolution of the swollen multilayer (Scheme 3 of ). Interestingly, the limiting IL concentration of the third regime, i.e. 1.25 M EMIM and 0.7 M HMIM for PEI(PSS/PDADMAC)~4~PSS extracted from the viscoelastic data matches with our earlier reported stability limit concentration (c~stab~) of the respective ILs extracted from the raw data of Δf.\n\n【44】5. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【45】In conclusion, this article shows the application of the Kelvin-Voigt modeling to obtain the thickness and mechanical properties, i.e. viscosity and elastic modulus of PEMs swollen with an IL solution from their corresponding QCM-D shifts. The changes in the modeled parameters as a function of the IL concentration can be distinguished in three concentration regimes of ILs. In the first regime, the multilayers become more viscous and also more elastic, along with a minimal increase in their thickness. In the second regime, the PEMs' thicknesses increase steeply but their viscosity and elastic modulus drop to the initial values. In third regime, the PEMs' thicknesses almost level off, and their viscosity and elastic modulus decrease further. Our data show that changes in the modeled parameter of the PEMs in accordance to these regimes are specific to ILs, which are organic salts. We argued that, while hydrophobic interactions between the IL and PEM contribute to the increased viscosity/elasticity in the first regime, the electrostatic shielding effect upon a large uptake of IL ions competes with the hydrophobic interactions in the second regime, screening the charge pairs between polyelectrolytes in the PEM. The latter essentially affects/modulates the assembly strength between polyelectrolytes in PEMs, resulting in an increase of the thickness and a drop in the viscosity and elasticity of the multilayers. These competing effects are specific to large hydrophobic ions and do not occur upon swelling with a simple salt such as NaCl.\n\n【46】In addition to an intrinsic interest, the determination of PEM thickness and viscosity and/or elasticity, and finding the correlation between them at a swollen condition is crucial for their application in various fields. For the application as an electrochemical separator, PEMs doped with ILs or conductive ions must be thin yet mechanically robust enough. Our results present the correlation between the thickness and viscosity/elasticity of PEMs doped with ILs of different concentrations, which may provide the basis to obtain a good balance between the thickness and mechanical strength of the swollen films for their potential applications.\n\n【47】The following are available online at <https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/11/8/1285/s1>, Figure S1: QCM-D time traces upon reversible swelling of PEM with ionic liquid solutions, Figure S2: the sensitivity of the modeling on the fluid viscosity and Figure S3: the ratio of dissipation to frequency vs. ionic liquid concentration used for PEM swelling.\n\n【48】###### \n\n【49】删除28:<u>Click here for additional data file.</u>\n\n【50】Conceptualization, N.P. and M.S.

The number of dengue cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) has increased steadily from an average of less than a thousand cases per year globally in the 1950s to over 3.34 million in 2016^,^. Moreover, a recent study estimated that 390 million dengue infections occur each year^^ while another indicated that 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk of infection^^. The number of cases is still increasing as the disease spreads to new areas and explosive outbreaks occur. This global expansion of dengue virus (DENV) can be due to several causes, including environmental and climate factors. Climate is an important determinant of vector-borne disease epidemics as it directly influences the abundance and distribution of the vector. Together with environmental factors such as the degree of urbanisation, climate variations may result in the geographic expansion of mosquitoes and dengue into new areas^^.\n\n【2】Studies have shown that a positive association exists between temperature and dengue transmission^--^. One possible reason is that warmer temperatures lead to a higher abundance of Aedes mosquitoes by increasing their survival and development rates^,^. Furthermore, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP; the time required for viruses to become transmissible after the initial infection of a mosquito) of DENV may be shortened under warmer conditions^,^, resulting in increased efficiency of viral transmission by allowing more mosquitoes to transmit the virus after exposure. The effect of rainfall amount on dengue incidence, on the other hand, is more controversial. Rainfall has been generally thought to be a positive predictor of dengue vector abundance as it provides essential mosquito habitats^,^. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that excess rain may also flush away eggs, larvae or pupae of mosquitoes and remove mosquito breeding sites^,^, hence negatively effecting dengue incidence. Another study has found that dry seasons followed by a period of excess rainfall can lead to a high risk of dengue outbreaks, indicating that either positive or negative effects can occur, however, with different time lags^^. Therefore, a better understanding of how rainfall affects dengue infection rates in areas with large outbreaks or increasing incidence could provide better projections of climate effects on dengue expansion.\n\n【3】The South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions, two of the six WHO regions, together have accounted for nearly 75% of the current global burden of dengue infections^^. A rapid increase of dengue incidence has been recently observed near the centre part of the Western Pacific region, such as in Guangzhou (the capital city of Guangdong province in southern China) and southern Taiwan^,^. Hong Kong, located geographically close to both Taiwan and Guangzhou, has a typical East Asian subtropical monsoon climate, characterised by higher temperatures and copious amounts of rain in the spring and summer months^^, which may favour dengue vector abundance and cause outbreaks later during or after summer. Despite the successful dengue control measures introduced after the first local case was identified in Hong Kong in 2002^^, there has been a gradual increase in dengue incidence after 2014 with the highest number of dengue so far recorded in 2018. Identifying the role of climate variables, particularly the effects of rainfall, on recent distribution trends in Hong Kong is urgently needed in order to understand the recent large outbreak and geographical expansion of dengue in the Western Pacific region or globally. However, the effects of pre-summer rainfall on dengue incidence around southern China are often ignored since the rainfall season normally has a lead time up to three to five months before the outbreaks. These lag effects were often not considered in many of the previous studies in this region^--^.\n\n【4】This study aims to enable prediction the annual number of dengue cases using seasonal monthly temperature and rainfall data before summer and assessing the effects of climate variability on the recent increase of dengue incidence in Hong Kong. Additionally, given that all dengue outbreaks/infections in Hong Kong occurred as either local clusters or sporadic cases in certain areas instead of large regional scale epidemics, the study utilised a generalized linear mixed model that contains area-specific random effects to account for environmental factors which are difficult to measure and fixed effects to account for climate effects on dengue transmission. Understanding how the climate may affect annual dengue incidence is important in order to forecast future possible dengue outbreaks, thereby allowing for more effective mosquito control measures in each region, leading to early preparedness and prevention of dengue.\n\n【5】Results \n=======\n\n【6】Area-specific dengue cases in Hong Kong \n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】After the first local case of dengue fever was discovered in 2002, a large dengue outbreak occurred in the same year and another in 2018 while sporadic cases mainly occurred between 2014 and 2017. We divided Hong Kong into 3 areas: (i) New Territories-South (NTS), (ii) New Territories-North (NTN), and (iii) Hong Kong Island & Kowloon (HKL), based on the administrative districts, the population density, and the usage of the Mass Transit Railways . The existence of spatial heterogeneity of dengue infections was observed between the defined areas 删除21:<u></u>. For example, HKL and NTS together consisted of all the infections during 2018 outbreak, while HKL and NTN contained all the sporadic cases from 2014 to 2017. Note the special case of the year 2002 when 17 out of 20 locally acquired dengue cases, which included one case transmitted via blood transfusion, were all located around a construction site on an island geographically at the centre of the three areas . After the blood transfusion case was removed, the remaining cases were equally assigned to the three areas with one extra case assigned to NTN.Figure 1The area division: New Territories - South (NTS; light blue), New Territories - North (NTN; orange), and Hong Kong & Kowloon (HKL; green) along with the selected automatic weather stations (white circles) and rainfall stations (light yellow circles). The grey lines indicate the official district borders. As Ma Wan Island (red) is located at the center, all the 17 non-blood transfusion cases on that island are assigned into the 3 areas in our study: 5 cases in NTS, 6 cases in NTN, and 5 cases in HKL. The inset provides annual local case numbers from 2002 to 2018.\n\n【8】Climate predictors selection \n----------------------------\n\n【9】In order to select suitable climate parameters for area-specific annual dengue forecasting, we compared 4 models with different combinations of temperature (either monthly mean or minimum; indicated by T~mean~ or T~min~) and rainfall (either monthly total or maximum; indicated by R~tot~ or R~max~). These climate parameters were suggested by the prior studies conducted in nearby countries^,^, but their association with recent dengue outbreaks in Hong Kong is still unknown and the effects of rainfall on dengue spreading are mixed. Furthermore, spatial differences in the climate data were not considered when the effects of monthly climate predictors were analysed^^. Thus, all the climate data within the studied years from 2002 to 2018 were retrieved from 11 weather stations and 2 automatic rainfall stations across the defined areas , with the averages from January to August shown in Fig. In general, the highest temperatures and the highest rainfalls were recorded between June and August and after April, respectively.Figure 2The monthly climate data for the whole of Hong Kong from 2002 to 2018. (a) Monthly mean and monthly minimum temperature, and (b) monthly total and monthly maximum rainfall from January to August for the years 2002, 2003--2017 combined, and 2018 are shown. Climate data were retrieved from 11 weather stations and 2 automatic rainfall stations across the three pre-defined areas.\n\n【10】Since most of the local (indigenous) dengue cases occurred during the summer seasons starting in or after August 删除21:<u></u> and in Hong Kong mosquitoes are not commonly observed during the winter until March^,^, for each combination of climate parameters we used monthly climate predictors 删除21:<u></u> from March to August in the 3 defined areas to forecast area-specific annual dengue cases using a Poisson mixed effects model. The predictors were first normalised in order to compare the effects between each predictor. The stepwise algorithm based on the Akaike Information Criterion with a correction (AICc) was used to select the monthly predictors for each model . The best-fitting model was determined according to both the AICc and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).Figure 3The number of monthly reported local dengue cases from 2002 to 2018.

The best-fitting model, Model: T~mean~ + R~tot~ was used as our predictive model for dengue cases while Model: T~mean~ + R~max~ was used as an alternative model as both the △AICc and △BIC results were equal to only 1 for Model: T~mean~ + R~max~.

The random intercepts represent different levels of effects resulting from unobserved area-specific factors, which may include varying land usages or population densities between different areas.Table 1The AICc and BIC of each model with the selected predictors.

For LOOCV, the observation in one area in a given year was removed before refitting the model. The best-fitting model successfully predicted the major outbreaks by year and by area using LOOCV 删除21:<u></u>. 42 out of a total of 51 (82.4%) total observations by year and by area (annual incidence rates in 17 years and 3 areas) were within the 95% confidence interval of the annual incidence predicted by our model. Note that the upper and the lower bounds of the confidence intervals were rounded to the nearest integer when assessing the prediction accuracy of observations in Table S. 5 out of 6 observations of area-specific outbreaks in 2002 and 2018 were able to be predicted. Although the 2018 outbreak in NTS was not predicted, the model still identified an outbreak (defined as the annual number of dengue cases  \\>  2) in that area. When LOYOCV was used, the model predicted outbreaks (defined as the annual number of dengue cases  \\>  2) in 5 years (i.e. the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2015 and 2018), which include the two major outbreak years (2002 and 2018) and a year with sporadic cases通用删除7(英):<u> (2015)</u> 删除21:<u></u>.Figure 5Comparison between observed and predicted number of annual dengue cases. (a--c) Observed and predicted number of annual dengue cases in each pre-defined area (NTS, NTN, and HKL) with 95% confidence intervals using leave-one-out cross-validation.

(d) Observed and predicted number of annual dengue cases in the whole Hong Kong area (ALL) with 95% confidence intervals using leave-one-year-out cross-validation.\n\n【14】The best-fitting model produced an MSE~tr~ of 0.592, an MSE~va~ of 3.538 and an MSE~ratio~ (MSE~va~∕MSE~tr~) of 5.976 using LOOCV 删除21:<u></u>. Both the MSE~va~ and the MSE~ratio~ of the best-fitting model were the lowest compared with the alternative (Model: T~mean~ + R~max~), fixed effects (same predictors as the best-fitting model but without random effects), and full models, indicating the best prediction performance among all the tested models. The alternative model using T~mean~ and R~max~ produced an MSE~tr~ of 0.672 and an MSE~va~ of 5.143, which confirmed that the chosen best model fitted the data better than the alternative. The fixed effects model performed similarly to but slightly worse than the best-fitting model. The full model, including all predictors, had the lowest MSE~tr~ value but the highest MSE~va~ and the highest MSE~ratio~, indicating an overfitting phenomenon. The best model also performed better than the other models when the Normalised Mean Squared Error (NMSE) was used. When LOYOCV was used, the MSE~ratio~ (12.629) of the best-fitting model was slightly higher than that obtained from LOOCV results. Although the fixed effects model can perform similarly or slightly better according to the MSE~va~ (or NMSE~va~), the best-fitting model performed better than the other models according to the MSE~ratio~ (or NMSE~ratio~) . These results demonstrate that while working with a small number of dengue observations in Hong Kong, a mixed effects model with AICc-selected variables can reduce model overfitting.Table 3The mean squared errors (MSE) and normalised mean squared errors (NMSE) of each model tested using leave-one-out cross-validation. The MSE and NMSE for the training and the validation sets, and the ratios of the MSE and NMSE of the validation set to that of the training set, respectively, are listed. The best-fitting model (Model: T~mean~ + R~tot~) was compared with the alternative model (Model: T~mean~ + R~max~), the fixed effects model (same predictors as the best-fitting model but without random effects) and the full model (mixed effects with all predictors).MSENMSETrainingValidationRatioTrainingValidationRatioBest-fitting0.5923.5385.9760.0320.1865.813Alternative0.6725.1437.6530.0360.2717.528Fixed effects0.5513.5436.4300.0290.1866.414Full0.408189.393464.1990.0229.968453.091\n\n【15】Effects of climate variables \n----------------------------\n\n【16】The predictive model showed that all monthly mean temperature predictors (T~3~, T~4~, T~5~, and T~7~) were positively correlated with the number of annual cases, while monthly total rainfall predictors (R~4~, R~5~, and R~6~) were all negatively correlated. These behaviors were also found in the stepAICc results of the other 3 models with different climate parameter sets , confirming the positive correlations of the temperature and the negative correlations of the early rainfall predictors with the number of annual cases. Among all the temperature predictors, T~7~ (the mean temperature in July) was the most significant predictor (p \\< 10^−8^) and its regression coefficient had the highest magnitude, indicating the strongest effect. The coefficients of the 3 rainfall predictors (from April to June) were of similar magnitude, indicating a much longer delayed effect of rainfall compared to temperature. In the NTS and HKL areas, relatively high values for T~3~, T~5~, and T~7~ and relatively low values for R~4~ and R~5~ were found in 2018, which may explain the the outbreak in 2018 in those two areas.\n\n【17】We further examined the marginal effects of the 4 predictors (T~7~, R~4~, R~5~, and R~6~) with the greatest magnitude of regression coefficients on the relative risk RR . RR was defined as the number of annual cases divided by the average number of annual cases.

If the rainfall is lower than 200 mm (per month) between May and June, or lower than 100mm in April, a higher relative risk of dengue incidence is observed.\n\n【18】Discussion \n==========\n\n【19】This study is the first to explore the association between seasonal climate variables and dengue incidence while taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of the dengue cases in Hong Kong. After dividing Hong Kong into 3 areas, a Poisson mixed effects model was fitted using the monthly temperature and rainfall data from the early months of the year to forecast annual dengue incidence in the defined areas. Given that most of the dengue infections occurred in August and September, the model successfully predicts annual dengue incidence using seasonal weather data from the preceding months. Instead of using a distributed lag model, our approach allows us to capture the impact of the weather in each month on the annual number of dengue cases, which is more suitable for regions affected by seasonal epidemics^^.\n\n【20】Because most of the outbreaks occurred in August and September, the period of the delay of climate effects can be estimated. Our results showed that the temperature is positively associated with the relative risk within time lags of at least 1 or 2 months (from T~7~ to the start of the outbreak), which is consistent with previous studies^,--^. These lagged effects could be caused by the incubation periods of dengue viruses and the mosquito's reproductive life cycle. The delayed effect of rainfall from between 3 and 5 months (from R~4~, R~5~ and R~6~ to the start of the outbreak) in our study is also consistent with recent findings that rainfall can be negatively associated with the risk of dengue outbreaks with a lead time up to 5 months^^.\n\n【21】The three defined areas NTS, NTN, and HKL in our study were selected to reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the dengue cases in Hong Kong. This spatial heterogeneity may be caused by area-specific factors other than climate variables; for instance, urbanisation, transportation, population density, etc. could all contribute to the expansion of dengue. For the purpose of our study, as we mainly focus on the impact of climate, those area-specific factors were considered as random effects in our model. Introducing random effects into the model can lead to higher accuracy of parameter estimation especially when the dataset contains non-independent observational units that are hierarchical in nature^^.\n\n【22】The significance of understanding the climate-dengue association lies in three aspects. First, being a highly populated region with more than 50 million people travelling to the city annually^^, infectious diseases can spread rapidly not only within Hong Kong but also to other countries due to its high level of contact mixing within- and between-countries^--^. Therefore, whether an even larger dengue outbreak will occur in Hong Kong in the future has become a primary global health concern.\n\n【23】Second, we demonstrated that in addition to global warming, the variation in rainfall intensity associated with the East Asian monsoon may play a significant role in the recent dengue expansions in some East Asian subtropical countries/cities. An increasing risk of seasonal dengue epidemics has been observed in both southern Taiwan and Hong Kong in the recent years, and similar to our findings, a negative association between early rainfall and dengue infections has previously been identified in southern Taiwan^^. As Hong Kong and Taiwan are both located in the East Asian subtropics, they are both affected by the East Asian rainy season occurring annually between February and June^^. Our results suggest that the variability during or even before the East Asian monsoon (pre-summer) rainy season may pose a high risk for dengue expansion in the region and complex non-linear effects should be studied further. As for Guangzhou, we noticed that before the 2014 dengue outbreak period (the largest one in Guangzhou), heavy rainfall mixed with drought (or low initial water level) were observed in that particular year^,^.\n\n【24】Third, our findings on rainfall effects can be used to inform mosquito control strategies in Hong Kong and possibly in other nearby countries similarly affected by the East Asian monsoon. The authorities of Hong Kong often enhance mosquito control measures while increasing public awareness especially during periods of heavy rainfall^,^. Our results suggest that in this particular region, the relative risk of incidence is higher when the intensity of rainfall before summer is lower. This implies that stepping up mosquito control measures to reduce mosquito activities is the most critical when the early rainfall amount is lower than the expected level.\n\n【25】In conclusion, we have developed a generalized linear mixed model that is able to successfully forecast annual dengue incidence across Hong Kong by taking into account both the climate data and the unobserved area-specific factors. Our findings may provide a valuable assessment on how to plan dengue prevention and control measures more effectively in Hong Kong.\n\n【26】Methods \n=======\n\n【27】Study area \n----------\n\n【28】Hong Kong is officially divided into 18 districts, which are grouped into three main areas: Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories . Based on the geography, population density, and the usage of the Mass Transit Railways (MTR), which is the most heavily used public transportation in Hong Kong, we redivided the city into three main areas. We first divided the New Territories into two regions: New Territories-South (NTS) and New Territories-North (NTN) such that NTS consists of the smaller and outlying islands while NTN consists of the region connected to Mainland China. We then merged Hong Kong Island and Kowloon into Hong Kong Island & Kowloon (HKL) because of their high similarities in terms of population density  and public transportation network. Kwai Tsing District was reassigned from the New Territories into this area as it also has a high population density, is located close to Kowloon, and is linked to the area by the busiest MTR line^^.\n\n【29】Dengue data \n-----------\n\n【30】The confirmed numbers of local dengue fever cases from 2002 to 2018 were collected through press releases issued by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health of the Hong Kong Government^^. The official statements indicate the location and the date of every local case confirmed through laboratory tests such as NS1 antigen and IgM serological assays, where the possible infection location is determined by either the residence or the travel history of the patient. The annual number of dengue cases was defined as the total number of confirmed local (indigenous) cases in each year 删除21:<u></u>; the onset of dengue fever symptoms in all years between 2002 and 2018 was observed between June and December 删除21:<u></u>. Imported cases, confirmed by CHP, were excluded in order to rule out travel-related factors influencing infection rates.\n\n【31】Meteorological data \n-------------------\n\n【32】Both the daily mean temperature and the daily total rainfall from 2002 to 2018 inclusive were retrieved from the Hong Kong Observatory^^. A total of 11 out of the available 49 automatic weather stations were selected to represent all districts in Hong Kong 删除21:<u></u>. The stations were chosen as they provided the most complete temperature and rainfall data in those years; any weather stations with more than 30% missing data were excluded. The selected station with the highest number of missing data is in Tuen Mun District since it only started recording from 2007 onwards. Two additional automatic rainfall stations on the island were selected due to the incomplete rainfall data from the weather stations in Hong Kong Island. Daily weather data were then averaged across different stations in each defined area to obtain average area-specific weather data. Monthly mean (minimum) temperature is defined as the average (minimum) of the daily mean temperature while the monthly total (maximum) rainfall is defined as the total (maximum) of the daily total rainfall. In general, a strong seasonal pattern was observed among the climate parameters from 2002 to 2018 删除21:<u></u>. An increasing trend in monthly temperature and rainfall was observed from January until July and June, respectively.\n\n【33】Model framework \n---------------\n\n【34】Given the similar seasonality of dengue epidemics in Southern Taiwan and Hong Kong where infections mostly appeared in the latter half of the year starting in summer, we extended a previous study of forecasting dengue annual cases in Southern Taiwan by fitting a model using the temperature and rainfall data from the earlier part of the year to predict the subsequent area-specific outbreaks^^. In order to account for any unobserved factors relating to the studied areas, we developed a Poisson generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to fit the confirmed cases in the different defined areas.

We assumed that the zero values represent the true case numbers as CHP conducts strict dengue prevention and control measures in Hong Kong.\n\n【36】Model selection \n---------------\n\n【37】A two-step procedure was used for the model selection. First, a candidate model was chosen to represent each of the four climate parameter sets (T~mean~ or T~min~ with R~tot~ or R~max~). The stepwise algorithm based on the Akaike Information Criterion with correction (AICc), also known as the stepAICc, was used to select the fixed effect variables (monthly climate predictors) for each of the candidate models in a forward selection approach . The stepwise algorithm has been commonly used in selecting relevant environmental or climatic determinants to predict disease occurrences^,^. This approach iteratively added a new variable to the model, starting with zero variables, to fulfil the selection criteria (such as smaller AIC or AICc) until the most optimal set of variables was reached. For our case, the AICc was used instead of AIC due to the small number of observations. For the purpose of model selection, all the models were estimated using Maximum Likelihood by Laplace approximation provided by the R package, glmmTMB^^, in order to compare models with different fixed effects. Laplace approximation is a suggested method for fitting Poisson mixed effects models^^. Secondly, the candidate models with the most optimal set of variables were then compared with each other based on their AICc and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The model with the lowest AICc and BIC (or only AICc) was chosen as the best-fitting model.\n\n【38】Model evaluation \n----------------\n\n【39】Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used in order to evaluate the best-fitting model's overall performance and to ensure that the model does not overfit. During each iteration, the observation of the annual number of dengue cases in a particular year and area was excluded while fitting the model using the restricted maximum likelihood method. The number of annual dengue cases of this particular observation was then estimated (predicted) given the coefficients produced by the fitted model in that iteration. In order to measure the performance of the model against the observation data, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was calculated for both training and validation sets using the following general formulae: $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$\\beginMS_ & = & _^_{({\\widehat}_^-_)}^/(17\\cdot通用删除7(英):<u> (17-1)</u>)\\end$$\\end$$$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$\\beginMS_=_^{({\\widehat}_^-_)}^/17\\end$$\\end$$where j indicates the index of a year to be tested, $\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$${\\widehat}_^$$\\end$ indicates the estimated number of cases in year i when the number in year j was removed, and μ~i~ is the observed number of cases in year i. When pre-defined areas were considered, the highest value of index j became 51 to represent the total number of observations of annual dengue incidence by year and by area. In addition, leave-one-year-out (leave-three-out) cross-validation (LOYOCV) was also used to evaluate the best-fitting model when the observations of the annual number of dengue cases in all three areas in a particular year were removed and used as the validation set while fitting the model.\n\n【40】Bootstrapped confidence intervals were computed.

Using a probabilistic approach, we compare different designs of screens for recessive phenotypes and the impact each one has on the number of mutations that can be effectively screened. We address the issue of BC versus IC strategies and consider genome-wide, region-specific screens and suppressor screens. We find that optimally designed BC and IC screens allow the screening of, on average, similar numbers of mutations but that interpedigree variation is more pronounced when the IC strategy is employed. By conducting a retrospective analysis of published mutagenesis screens, we show that, depending on the strategy, a threefold difference in the numbers of mutations screened per animal used could be expected. This method allows researchers to contrast, for a range of experimental designs, the cost per mutation screened and to maximize the number of mutations that one can expect to screen in a given experiment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

It is important to know whether remifentanil may decrease the time to recovery of opioid-induced cardiovascular and cerebral effects compared to that of other short-acting agents such as alfentanil. Baseline measures were made during 1% end-tidal isoflurane and 50% N2O in oxygen in dogs.

Tokyo, Japan) tube, and endobronchial blocker through single-lumen endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway can be used for OLV . There are some patients who need OLV after tracheostomy, and in those cases, the method that can be used for lung separation is limited. Here, we report a clinical experience in which OLV with an endobronchial blocker through a single lumen reinforced wire endotracheal tube was used in a patient who needed OLV after total laryngectomy.\n\n【1】A 64-year-old male patient was diagnosed with supraglottic cancer and had a permanent tracheostomy following a total laryngectomy in May, 2009 Treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy were carried out six times. Since a 7 mm sized solitary pulmonary nodule and 9.3 mm sized cavitary nodule were observed in the positron emission tomography (PET) done in April, 2010, the patient was scheduled to undergo a right upper lobectomy of the lung to treat and diagnose the metastatic cancer. He was 172 cm tall and 67.2 kg in weight.\n\n【2】As total laryngectomy limited tracheal intubation orally, the patient had to be intubated through the stoma of the tracheostomy. We confirmed the patency and measured the size of the trachea and bronchus through the coronal and axial view of the chest CT . The length and diameter of the right main bronchus was 23.38 mm and 17.40 mm, respectively. The diameter of the left main bronchus was 14.96 mm. Considering the operation site and the diameter of the left main bronchus, a 37 or 41 Fr DLT was preferred, but to avoid causing injury to the tissue around the stoma of tracheostomy and taking into consideration the angle formed by the trachea and the stoma, we decided to use a single-lumen reinforced wire endotracheal tube and endobronchial blocker (Coopdech®, Coopdech, Daiken medical Co. Osaka, Japan) which is more flexible than a DLT.\n\n【3】Before the induction of anesthesia, we supplied 100% oxygen through the stoma of the tracheostomy and while administering 0.02 µg/kg/min of intravenous remifentanil continuously, we examined the patient\\'s airway with a pediatric flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB). We expected to have no difficulties in intubating through the stoma of the tracheostomy since it was impossible for the patient to wear a facial mask for positive ventilation. After 8 deep breaths with 100% oxygen and confirming the patient\\'s loss of consciousness by injecting 1.5 mg/kg of propofol intravenously, endotracheal intubation was performed with a single-lumen reinforced wire endotracheal tube with a 7.5 mm internal diameter. The patient coughed mildly. After intravenous injection of 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium bromide, we could not find any abnormalities in the ventilation by auscultating both lung sounds and confirmed there was sufficient muscle relaxation. With the end of the tube positioned 2 cm above the carina, the middle of the two black lines on the single-lumen reinforced wire endotracheal tube was placed at the stoma, and it was fixed tightly with Ioban™ (Ioban, 3M™ Health Care, St. Paul, USA). The endobronchial blocker was inserted into the right main bronchus, 1 cm directly under the carina with the guidance of a pediatric FOB. After reconfirming the position by auscultation, the endobronchial blocker was also fixed.\n\n【4】Anesthesia was maintained with 0.02-0.1 µg/kg/min of remifentanil, 0.5-2 vol% of sevoflurane, and oxygen and air at 3 L/min. During the operation, muscle relaxation was maintained by administration of intravenous rocuronium. Total anesthetic duration was 3 hours and 20 minutes, and the duration of OLV was 1 hour and 20 minutes. In the lateral position, the peak airway pressure (PAP) of two lung ventilation (tidal volume, 8 ml/kg; respiratory rate, 11 times/min; positive end expiratory pressure, 4 cmH~2~O) was 21 cmH~2~O. During OLV (peak inspiratory pressure, 17 cmH~2~O; respiratory rate, 11 times/min; positive end expiratory pressure, 4 cmH~2~O), we tried to keep the PAP at or under 21 cmH~2~O. Sixty percent oxygen was used and the results of the arterial blood gas analysis during OLV were as follows: pH 7.42, PaCO~2~ 40 mmHg, PaO~2~ 77 mmHg, and 95% oxygen saturation. All results from the arterial blood gas analysis during OLV were maintained as the standards measured under spontaneous respiration. All vital signs during the surgery were within normal range. When the patient\\'s consciousness, muscle relaxation and spontaneous respiration were restored after the surgery, extubation was performed. The patient was transferred to the general ward after one day of observation in the intensive care unit.\n\n【5】Coe et al.  reported on 8 cases in which a DLT was inserted through the stoma of a tracheostomy, and Seo et al.  reported on the clinical experience of OLV anesthesia using a Univent® tube for a patient who had undergone a total laryngectomy. Campos  explained various methods of OLV in patients with tracheostomy. DLT is preferred to remove bleeding or respiratory secretion from the operated lung, but compared with a DLT or Univent® tube of the same internal diameter, the endobronchial blocker through the single-lumen endotracheal tube has a smaller external diameter and more flexibility and is more convenient to fix and eliminates the possible injury of the surrounding tissue of the stoma of the permanent tracheostomy.\n\n【6】Yang et al.  pointed out the possibility of incomplete collapse of the right upper lobe of the lung in a case using an endobronchial blocker.

We observed progressive movement of the left leg and, when the patient touched the lateral aspect of the foot to the bed, dorsiflexion of the great toe (Babinski's sign). In other seizures, the patient started a progressive movement of the left leg, rubbing the external border of the left foot on the bed and provoking dorsiflexion of the great toe (Chaddock's sign). The Brissaud reflex component was also observed when the movement was accompanied by internal rotation of the leg and recruitment of the tensor fascia lata, making dorsiflexion more likely to be a reflex response and not voluntary. We also observed forceful passive plantar flexion at the ankle in association with dorsiflexion of the great toe (Moniz' sign).

Here, we show that YncC increases biofilm formation by repressing overproduction of the exopolysaccharide identified as colanic acid (corroborated by decreasing mucoidy and increased sensitivity to bacteriophage P1 infection). Differential gene expression and gel shift assays demonstrated that YncC is a repressor of the predicted periplasmic protein-encoding gene, ybiM, which was corroborated by the isogenic yncC ybiM double mutation that repressed the yncC phenotypes (biofilm formation, colanic acid overproduction, mucoidy and bacteriophage resistance). Through nickel-enrichment DNA microarrays and additional gel shift assays, we found that the putative transcription factor B3023 (directly upstream of mqsR) binds the yncC promoter. Overexpressing MqsR, AI-2 import regulators LsrR/LsrK and AI-2 exporter TqsA induced yncC transcription, whereas the AI-2 synthase LuxS and B3023 repressed yncC. MqsR has a toxic effect on E. coli bacterial growth, which is partially reduced by the b3023 mutation. Therefore, AI-2 quorum-sensing control of biofilm formation is mediated through regulator MqsR that induces expression of the transcription factor YncC.

{"seq_id": "453c4ae5-09b7-4507-9a8f-9ca4d288d7c4", "title": "", "text": "【0】1. Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Supercapacitors or electrochemical double layer capacitors are usually used in electrical circuits where high pulse power delivery is required, such as in fuel cells and hybrid electrical vehicles. Their response over extremely short time intervals and long cycle life makes them especially interesting for applications where a high specific energy and power density are needed. Depending on the charge storage mechanism, we distinguish two types of supercapacitors, electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and pseudocapacitors. In EDLC, the capacitance is mainly attributed to the physical adsorption of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface as a non-Faradic behaviour, with a contribution of 1--5% pseudocapacitance in the case of carbon DLC , while in Faradic capacitors (pseudocapacitors), the charge storage mechanism is mainly provided by the contribution of reversible redox reactions that take place on the electrode surface involving various oxidation states of metal oxides and the physical adsorption of ions .\n\n【2】Several forms of carbon such as activated carbon, carbon black, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been utilized in electrochemical capacitors due to their high surface area, high conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength . Among them, vertically aligned CNTs are more suitable as electrode material because of their low contact resistance, large specific surface area, and regular pore structure in comparison with curly, random CNTs . However, because of their hydrophobic nature and, therefore, low use of the specific surface area in aqueous electrolytes, the maximum capacitance obtained from pure CNTs is 40 Fg^−1^ . Capacitance enhancement of carbon electrodes can be achieved by surface specific treatments that introduce various kinds of functional groups such as oxygen- and nitrogen-based functionalities. As a result, the electrodes exhibit an increase in the double layer capacitance and also of reversible faradic reactions that contribute to the charge storage as a pseudocapacitance .\n\n【3】Generally, pseudocapacitance is associated with reversible Faradic redox processes in various oxidation states of transition metal oxides (RuO~2~, MnO~2~, NiO, V~2~O~5~, and IrO~2~). Among them, RuO~2~ presents the highest theoretical capacitance values (about 1400 Fg^−1^). However, due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, and, more importantly, its Faradic response with rectangular voltammograms, MnO~2~ appears to be more suitable for high power applications .\n\n【4】Regarding the oxidation/reduction mechanism in MnO~2~ pseudocapacitors, Toupin et al. suggested that H^+^ and C^+^ (Na^+^, K^+^, La^+^) are intercalated and deintercalated upon reduction and oxidation in the bulk of MnO~2~, and C^+^ is adsorbed on the surface of MnO~2~ : $$\\begin\n\\left. \\text\\text_ + \\text^ + \\text^\\longleftrightarrow\\text, \\right. \\\\\n\\end$$\n\n【5】or $$\\begin\n\\left. \\text\\text_ + \\text^ + \\text^\\longleftrightarrow\\text \\right. \\\\\n\\end$$\n\n【6】This procedure includes a redox reaction between Mn^3+^ and Mn^4+^ oxidation states .\n\n【7】Since only the surface is involved in the charge storage mechanism, a thinner film of MnO~2~ shows a higher capacitance than a thicker one. However, a compromise must be achieved to obtain the optimum thickness since usually a thinner layer of manganese dioxide undergoes mechanical instability and, as a result, delivers poor energy density . Therefore, for supercapacitor applications, it is important that the electrode material possesses high surface area and high porosity, as well as very low electrical resistance. A suitable configuration is CNTs/MnO~2~ composite electrodes, in which a thin layer of MnO~2~ provides high pseudocapacitance due to Faradic redox reactions taking place on large surface area electrodes. CNTs provide high electrical conductivity and mechanical stability to the 3D electrode . Although the highest reported capacitance obtained with such composite electrodes, in which MnO~2~ is deposited on the outer surface of CNTs, is as high as 790 Fg^−1^ , it is still well below the theoretical value for MnO~2~ (about 1370 Fg^−1^) .\n\n【8】Several techniques have been used to prepare MnO~2~/CNTs composite electrodes: electrophoretic deposition , wet chemistry method using capillary forces of the nanotubes , layer by layer deposition of MnO~2~ on CNTs , electrodeposition , and potentiostatic and galvanostatic deposition . Nevertheless, there is no report in the literature about the use of water plasma-treated CNTs/MnO~2~ composite electrodes for supercapacitor applications.\n\n【9】In previous work , we described the effect of radio frequency (rf) plasma power and water pressure on the physicochemical properties of CNTs. The specific capacitance was found to increase from 23 Fg^−1^ for untreated CNTs up to 68 Fg^−1^ for water plasma-treated carbon nanotubes (wpCNTs) with 10 W rf power and 135 Pa water pressure. Under these conditions, the water plasma is only specific to the removal of amorphous carbon, soft etching, and the introduction of oxygen functional groups. In addition, the water plasma treatment increases the wettability of the CNTs, decreases the bundle size, and increases the electrolyte accessibility to the CNTs .\n\n【10】Herein, we extend our approach towards the study of nanocomposite materials consisting of water plasma-treated CNTs covered with a layer of electrochemically deposited MnO~2~ (MnO~2~/wpCNTs) as electrodes for supercapacitor devices. Moreover, we study the effect of different potentials on the morphology and oxidation state of MnO~2~.\n\n【11】2. Experimental Section \n=======================\n\n【12】Growth and water plasma functionalization of CNTs was performed following the same procedure as previously reported . A Box-Wilson experimental design was adopted to explore the influence of plasma treatment parameters such as rf power and water pressure on the capacitance of MnO~2~/CNTs composite electrodes. According to the Box--Wilson graph distribution, nine conditions were chosen to perform 13 experiments; central point experiment was replicated 5 times in order to evaluate the intrinsic standard deviation of the process . This experimental design allows us to adjust the tested variables with a second degree polynomial equation: $$\\begin\n{X = \\alpha_ + \\alpha_A + \\alpha_B + \\alpha_A^ + \\alpha_AB + \\alpha_B^,} \\\\\n\\end$$\n\n【13】where X is the dependent magnitude, α ~n~ are constant coefficients obtained by statistically adjusting these polynomial equations, A is the plasma power, and B the water pressure.\n\n【14】The galvanostatic method was adopted to electrochemically deposit manganese dioxide on the surface of CNTs. A detailed description of this procedure can be found elsewhere . In brief, a graphite electrode was used as a cathode and CNTs as the anode in a two-electrode cell configuration . About 0.5 mL of a 0.2 M MnSO~4~ ·H~2~O solution was introduced dropwise through a hole in the cathode during the deposition. The deposition time was set to 2 minutes at a constant current density of 1 mA cm^−2^. The amount of manganese dioxide deposited on the CNTs was determined by oxidizing the manganese ions to MnO^4-^ and measuring its absorbency at 525 nm. The concentration of permanganate ions was obtained from UV-vis spectrophotometry, and the deposited mass of MnO~2~ was calculated from this value, which equaled (16.5 ± 1.5) μg. This amount corresponds to about 23% of the total mass of MnO~2~/CNTs nanocomposite. The charge storage mechanism of MnO~2~/CNTs composite electrodes was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and constant current charge/discharge cycling in a 0.1 M Na~2~SO~4~ aqueous solution using a potentiostat/galvanostat (AutoLab, PGSTAT30, USA). All experiments were carried out in a typical three-electrode cell at 25°C. A Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl internal solution) and a Pt-ring electrode were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. The working electrode was a sample of CNTs or MnO~2~/CNTs composite. The geometrical area of the working electrode was set to a constant value of 0.57 cm^2^.\n\n【15】XPS experiments were performed in a PHI 5500 Multitechnique System (from Physical Electronics) with a monochromatic X-ray source (Aluminium Kalfa line of 1486.6 eV energy and 350 W), placed perpendicular to the analyzer axis, and calibrated using the 3d5/2 line of Ag with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.8 eV. The analyzed area was a circle of 0.8 mm diameter, and the selected resolution for the spectra was 187.5 eV of pass energy and 0.8 eV/step for the general spectra and 11.75 eV of pass energy and 0.05 eV/step for the spectra of the different elements in the depth profile spectra. All measurements were made in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber pressure between 5 × 10^−9^ and 2 × 10^−8^ torr. Raman analysis was performed by using Raman system, HORIBA LabRam HR800 Japan. A green laser of wavelength 532 nm and power 0.5 mW and a 100x objective was used during the measurements.\n\n【16】3. Results and Discussion \n=========================\n\n【17】The morphological analysis of the CNTs was performed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (FEI Nova NanoSEM 230, USA). Figures [1(a)] and [1(b)] show SEM images of untreated CNTs and water plasma-treated CNTs (wpCNTs) at 75 W rf power and 135 Pa pressure, respectively. The CNTs vertical alignment is preserved after all the treatments. Clearly, the CNTs surface becomes cleaner after the water plasma-treatment and presents less amorphous carbon, which is a by-product generated during the CNTs growth (inset of Figures [1(a)] and [1(b)]). Figures [2(a)] and [2(b)] show scanning electron micrographs of wpCNTs/MnO~2~ composite before and after 2000 charge/discharge cycles, respectively, in the potential range of 0-1 V. Before cycling, the MnO~2~ presents nanoflower or nanosphere-like structures that are well distributed on the CNTs tips and inside the voids of CNTs bundles reaching the bottom part of the CNTs mat 删除21:<u></u>. After 2000 cycles and within the potential window of 0 to 1 V, the morphology of MnO~2~ has changed from nanoflower to needle-like structure, which corresponds to Mn~3~O~4~ as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy . Furthermore, the Mn~3~O~4~ has agglomerated on the top surface of the CNTs mat creating a thick layer of the oxide 删除20:<u></u>, whereas after 2000 charge/discharge cycles in a smaller potential window (0.1--0.8 V), nanoflower-structured MnO~2~ is transformed into a thin layer-like structure, resembling a paste coating the surface of the CNTs 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【18】Structural and chemical information about the carbon nanotubes and their composites was provided by Raman spectroscopy measurements. Information regarding the CNTs structure is usually obtained from three Raman peaks that appear in the region between 1000 cm^−1^ and 1800 cm^−1^. After the deposition of manganese dioxide on untreated and water plasma-treated CNTs, new Raman peaks emerge in the frequency region from 200 to 650 cm^−1^. The peaks observed in the 200--500 cm^−1^ region are assigned to distortion of Mn--O--Mn chains in MnO~2~ octahedral lattices, while peaks in the 500--650 cm^−1^ region are characteristic of Mn--O vibration in the basal plane of MnO~6~ groups . MnO~2~ Raman spectrum consists of three main distinguished peaks at 523, 576, and 650 cm^−1^ and three smaller peaks, not always detected, at 392, 490, and 776 cm^−1^ .\n\n【19】 shows Raman spectra of untreated CNTs, wpCNTs (75 W, 135 Pa), and wpCNTs/MnO~2~ (75 W, 135 Pa) composite before and after electrochemical cycling in small and large voltage windows. Before cycling, the peaks at 490, 560, and 640 cm^−1^ are very well pronounced and their positions are similar to those described in the literature for MnO~2~ Raman spectra, as well as the two small peaks observed below 400 cm^−1^ . After 2000 electrochemical charge/discharge cycles in the range of 0 to 1 V, a very sharp and high intensity peak is observed at 640 cm^−1^ along with a combination of smaller peaks at 260, 350, and 480 cm^−1^.\n\n【20】The high intensity of the Raman peak at 640 cm^−1^  is the signature of the Mn~3~O~4~ phase and characteristic of all needle-like structures, while a low intensity peak at this frequency cannot be assigned to Mn~3~O~4~ . In view of these results, we assume that dissolution of manganese species from the electrode in the solution and a slow phase transformation process from MnO~2~ to Mn~3~O~4~ take place during constant current charge/discharge cycling owing to irreversible redox reactions that occur in the region around 0 V . In agreement with this assumption, Gao et al. reported the thermal transformation of MnOOH into Mn~3~O~4~ phase . Moreover, the above results are consistent with the morphological changes observed with SEM (see Figures [2(a)] and [2(b)]) since the Raman signals at \\~1360 and \\~1580 cm^−1^ are very weak due to the formation of a thick layer of Mn~3~O~4~ at the CNTs top surface.\n\n【21】Raman spectra of samples cycled in the potential range of 0.1--0.8 V present peak positions and intensities that cannot be attributed to a change in the oxidation state of MnO~2~. Therefore, only a morphological change from nanoflower to layer-like structure, as proved by SEM images, occurs after cycling in this voltage window (0.1--0.8 V).\n\n【22】XPS was used to evaluate the elemental composition and oxidation states of manganese before and after electrochemical charge-discharge cycling within different potential limits.  shows Mn 2p spectra of different samples. The Mn 2p spectrum of sample wpCNTs/MnO~2~ (75 W, 135 Pa) before cycling exhibits three peaks; Mn 2p~3/2~ was positioned at (641.85 ± 0.1) eV, Mn 2p~1/2~ at (653.5 ± 0.1) eV , and a shoulder appears at around 644.5 eV. The binding energy difference between the Mn 2p~3/2~ and Mn 2p~1/2~ peaks is about 11.7 eV which is very much like the reported values in other studies . These results indicate that manganese is in the Mn^4+^ oxidation state . After 2000 charge-discharge cycles in the potential range of 0-1 V, the binding energy of the Mn 2p~3/2~ peak is shifted downward to a lower valence state of Mn at (641.5 ± 0.1) eV 删除21:<u></u>. This peak position reveals the transformation of MnO~2~ into Mn~3~O~4~ due to the irreversible potential limits used during the cycling process , whereas when the cycling was performed in the potential range of 0.1--0.8 V, there was almost negligible shift of the binding energies of the Mn 2p spectra in comparison with the sample without cycling, confirming that manganese is still in the Mn^4+^ state. The decrease observed in the intensities of the peaks could be related to the transition of MnO~2~ from flower-like to (sheet) layer-like structure on the nanotubes surface 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【23】The chemical environment of the oxygen atoms was examined by deconvoluting the O1s spectra in 4 peaks 删除21:<u></u>. The peak located at (529.30 ± 0.1) eV can be ascribed to (Mn--O--Mn). Peaks around (530.9 ± 0.1) eV, (532.7 ± 0.2) eV, and (535.10 ± 0.2) eV could be attributed to (Mn--O--H), (H--O--H), and chemisorbed oxygen, respectively . Table S4 in supplementary material shows the deconvoluted O1s spectra peak position and relative area percentage of oxide species. The amount of the OH/H~2~O is higher in the sample without cycling. Thus, higher hydroxide content implies higher effective area as well as increased Na^+^ and H^+^ diffusion in the electrode . The above XPS measurements are also in accordance with both SEM and Raman results previously discussed.\n\nSpecific capacitance of the wpCNTs/MnO~2~ composite electrodes was calculated using  as follows: $$\\begin\n{C_{\\text} = \\frac{q_ + \\left| q_ \\right|},} \\\\\n\\end$$\n\n【25】where q ~a~ and q ~c~ are the anodic and cathodic charges, respectively, in C, C ~s~ is the specific capacitance in Fg^−1^, m is the mass of the active material in g, and ∆V the voltage in V.  gives specific capacitance values obtained for different samples at a scan rate of 10 mVs^−1^. The specific capacitance of untreated CNTs/MnO~2~ composite is 678 Fg^−1^ and increases for most of the wpCNTs/MnO~2~ composites.\n\n【26】Highest specific capacitance (750 Fg^−1^) was obtained using plasma-treated CNTs with 10 W rf power and 135 Pa water pressure as the nanocomposite electrode. The increase in capacitance is related to the removal of amorphous carbon, soft etching, that is, less structural defects in comparison with other water plasma-treated carbon nanotubes, and the addition of oxygen functional groups . Under these water-plasma conditions (10 W, 135 Pa), the existence of C=O (quinone) groups on the CNTs surface is especially high . This type of groups promotes the adsorption of protons, which is in agreement with the nonperfect rectangular shape of the CV curves (i.e. a nontruly horizontal value of the current)  删除21:<u></u>. As a result, the specific capacitance significantly increases due to the additional contribution of faradic currents (I ~F~). Samples treated under other plasma conditions clearly show a redox peak in the potential region from 0.4 to 0.6 V that corresponds to reversible redox reactions between Mn^4+^ and Mn^3+^ 删除20:<u></u>. With increasing scan rate, the specific capacitance of the wpCNTs/MnO~2~ (10 W, 135 Pa) composite decreases below that of the other samples. Since the shape of the CV curves becomes more rectangular at higher scan rates 删除20:<u></u>, we assume that, for this sample, the I ~F~ contribution to the total capacitance decreases due to slow Faradic processes taking place at the CNTs/MnO~2~ surface.\n\n【27】Based on the experiments carried out, a second degree polynomial equation was adjusted for the specific capacitance . The polynomial model was found to be statistically significant (P \\< 0.05) explaining 76.6% of the samples variation with α ~0~ = 730.935, α ~1~ = −1.134, α ~2~ = 4.723, α ~3~ = 0.008, α ~4~ = −0.415, and α ~5~ = 11.365.  is a 3D graph obtained using these parameters. The interaction between plasma power and water pressure and their influence on the specific capacitance of wpCNTs/MnO~2~ composite electrodes is clearly shown. Optimum conditions of the plasma treatment that provide improved specific capacitance values of the composites are located at low plasma powers and high water pressures.\n\n【28】Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed to investigate the kinetics behaviour of hybrid electrodes. The internal components of the capacitor (e.g. current collectors, electrodes, dielectric material, and solution) contribute to the equivalent series resistance (ESR), which is above 65 ohm for all of the samples . The ESR of all the wpCNTs/MnO~2~ composites is lower than that of untreated CNTs/MnO~2~ composite (83 ohm) because of the removal of amorphous carbon and increased wettability. The Nyquist plot of the samples present an almost straight line parallel to the imaginary axis  that describes exactly polarized systems . Deviation from this vertical line at low frequencies to smaller slopes corresponds to a higher contribution of the ionic diffusion resistance.\n\n【29】The cycling stability of nanocomposite electrodes was investigated applying galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. A constant current density of 0.52 mA cm^−2^, in a potential window from 0 to 1 V, and of 1.75 mA cm^−2^, between 0.1 and 0.8 V, was applied during 2000 cycles. The specific capacitance was calculated from the discharge curve using  as follows: $$\\begin\n{C_ = \\left( \\frac{\\left( {/} \\right) \\cdot m} \\right),} \\\\\n\\end$$\n\n【30】where C ~s~ is the specific capacitance in Fg^−1^, ΔV is the voltage difference during the discharge curve in V, I is the current in A, Δt is the discharge time in s, and m has the same meaning and units as in .\n\n【31】Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were measured applying various current densities from 1.75 to 0.35 mA cm^−2^.  shows charge/discharge curves of wpCNTs/MnO~2~ (75 W, 135 Pa) nanocomposite between 0.1 and 0.8 V. As with the EIS measurements, the ohmic drop of the curves indicates a high series resistance related to the contact between silicon substrate and nanotubes, current collectors, and solution resistance.  shows the cycling stability of nanocomposite electrodes in the voltage range of 0.1 to 0.8 V at a current density of 1.75 mA cm^−2^. It is evident that water plasma-treated CNTs/MnO~2~ exhibits both a higher capacitance and capacitance retention in comparison with untreated CNTs/MnO~2~. On the other hand, charge/discharge cycling of untreated CNTs/MnO~2~ nanocomposite electrode in the voltage window of 0 to 1 V  gives higher capacitance than wpCNTs/MnO~2~ samples. However, it only lasts up to 700 cycles, while, in the case of wpCNTs/MnO~2~ samples, a continuous fading in the capacitance was observed. The reason for this poor cyclability in both composites with untreated and plasma-treated CNTs is related to irreversible reduction/oxidation reactions of Mn^4+^ to Mn^2+^ and Mn^7+^ in the voltage region around 0 V and 1 V, respectively. Additionally, oxygen evolution reaction starts to take place around 0.8 V, as observed in , which could also affect the reversibility of redox reactions . These irreversible redox reactions cause the dissolution of manganese in the electrolyte and fading of the capacitance  .\n\n【32】From the above results, we assume that some processes occur during cycling in the potential regions around 0 V and 1 V, namely, dissolution of MnO~2~ nanoflowers, coalescence, and upward drag of the oxide forming a thick layer of material on top of the CNTs, and morphological modification of the nanoflowers to a needle-like structure that corresponds to hausmannite Mn~3~O~4~. The dense and thick layer of Mn~3~O~4~ on the CNTs mat generated during the cycling process appears to be the reason for the capacitance fading. Furthermore, the presence of Mn~3~O~4~ proved by Raman spectroscopy and XPS is known to significantly decrease the reversibility of the system . SEM images and cyclability experiments reveal that highly porous CNTs/MnO~2~ composite electrodes, with good electronic conduction and, most importantly, separated MnO~2~ nanoflowers, and/or layer-like structure are the desired conditions for a suitable capacitive behaviour.\n\n【33】4. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【34】Water plasma treatment performed on CNTs removes amorphous carbon and introduces several oxygen functional groups on the CNTs surface. MnO~2~/CNTs nanocomposite electrodes were obtained after galvanostatic deposition of MnO~2~ on untreated and water plasma-treated CNTs. SEM images confirm the removal of amorphous carbon and reveal nanoflower-structured MnO~2~ deposited on the CNTs. Raman spectroscopy and XPS results indicate that electrochemical cycling in the potential range from 0-1 V converts MnO~2~ to Mn~3~O~4~, which corresponds to a change in the metal oxide morphology observed with SEM. On the other hand, a voltage window between 0.1--0.8 V does not change the oxidation state of MnO~2~ and only induces a morphological change from nanoflower to layer-like structure of the oxide. High specific capacitance values were achieved under optimum water-plasma conditions, low rf plasma powers and high water pressures. A high specific capacitance of 750 Fg^−1^ was obtained for wpCNTs/MnO~2~ (10 W, 135 Pa) nanocomposite electrode.\n\n【35】Supplementary Material \n======================\n\n【36】###### \n\n【37】This supplementary material provides additional information about Box-Wilson experimental design , charge/discharge curves and cycling between 0 and 1 V , Nyquist plot of different samples , and a table regarding the O1s peak in the XPS spectra of samples with MnO~2~ before and after cycling (table S4).\n\n【38】###### \n\n【39】删除28:<u>Click here for additional data file.</u>\n\n【40】This work was supported by Projects 2009SGR00185 of AGAUR of Generalitat de Catalunya and CTQ2009-14674-CO2-01 from MICINN of Spanish Government.

Playing an epidemic intelligence service officer for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Winslet marches to a blackboard and, chalk in hand, succinctly defines for her viewers the terms \"fomite\" and \"basic reproductive ratio\". Public health education has never had it so good.\n\n【1】And that\\'s not all. During the course of this movie, a CDC research scientist played by Jennifer Ehle explains the difference between live and attenuated vaccine; Lawrence Fishbourne as a CDC division chief describes \"social distancing\"; and Winslet informs us that the average person touches their face 2000 microbe-passing times a day.\n\n【2】Contagion traces the peregrinations of the fictional virus MEV-1 as it spreads across the globe on the hands and breath of strangers, and the charmingly self-effacing CDC and WHO scientists who race to identify and contain it. Despite its easy transmissibility, rapid 2-day incubation period, and whopping 25% fatality rate, MEV-1 looms over global society for months, causing all manner of social mayhem, as quarantines, riots, and looting replace the routines of everyday life.\n\n【3】© 2011 2011 Warner Bros.

MEV-1 was modelled on the zoonotic Nipah virus, which was discovered in 1999 after an outbreak in Malaysian pig farmers. And its path around the world shadows that of the real-life coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, which commercial air travel delivered from Hong Kong to other countries in 2003.\n\n【5】If history is any guide, a real pandemic would involve competing political agendas and scientific theories, a heady brew of over-reaction and under-reaction, and both purposeful and inadvertent abettors. Some degree of scientific uncertainty would be expected, and entrenched interest groups would not readily forsake their livelihoods. But in the pandemic-stricken world of Contagion, only the most venal and corrupt dare to question the wisdom of the CDC and WHO. A dentally challenged, conspiracy-theory-spouting blogger played by Jude Law makes a fortune hawking useless miracle cures; secretive Chinese government figures attempt to squelch a WHO investigation. The virus itself originates in true Hollywood fashion in the customs of far-away \"others\": the Chinese, with their strange foods, and the AIDS-plagued South Africans all contribute to its deadly efficiency. Meanwhile, aside from the Minnesota health department, which Contagion portrays as chock full of intransigent dullards, the western public health establishment\\'s handling of the pandemic is calm and assured. A CDC scientist single-handedly unravels the essential details about the virus in a matter of days, and within weeks develops a vaccine; cameras record every instance of initial transmission, making the job of WHO epidemiologist played by Marion Cotillard as straightforward as solving a Sudoku puzzle; and while police officers and clinicians are scarcely seen in the film, the public health authorities, from WHO to the CDC, are uniformly trustworthy and big-hearted.\n\n【6】In that way, as frightening as Contagion is---the Red Cross runs out of body bags, among other horrors---it\\'s also a tale with a straightforward message. When the next pandemic threat arrives, wash your hands, tune in, and sit tight. And never, ever, shake hands with a chef in Hong Kong who has been wearing a bloody apron. And for those viewers familiar with the threat of emerging infections who might find this message too simple, Contagion\\'s A-list ensemble cast and stylish film-making offer its own pleasures. Watching Gwyneth Paltrow fake a foamy-mouthed death by viral encephalitis to a throbbing electronic soundtrack sure beats a Powerpoint presentation.\n\n【7】ContagionDirected by Steven Soderbergh, written by Scott Z Burns.

The challenge includes identification of differences between cancer stem cells and their normal stem cell counterparts, and demonstration of complete control of cancer by targeting these stem cells. Success of an anti-stem cell strategy relies on complete inhibition of function of a gene required for the maintenance of cancer stem cells but not normal stem cells. A number of genes have been found to promote or inhibit cancer cell proliferation, but they also play similar roles in regulating normal stem cells. Examples include pathways involved in signaling through Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog and Notch ,--, Bim-1 , p53 , p16 ^INK4a^ , p19^ARF^ , etc. The role of Pten in the inhibition of cancer stem cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in the maintenance of normal HSCs is unique, and provides an example that distinguishes AML stem cells from normal HSCs, although Pten has an effect on normal HSCs . Because cancer stem cells express markers similar to those on normal stem cells , the major difference between them should be related to the cancer-initiating genetic changes such as acquiring an oncogene or accumulating a DNA mutation. It is reasonable to hypothesize that these genetic changes cause aberrant expression of genes, consequently turning a normal stem cell into a cancer stem cell. It is essential to identify genes that are functionally required by cancer stem cells but not by normal stem cell counterparts. Some clues for identifying genes that play roles in cancer stem cells could come from studies of normal stem cell counterparts and different lineages of cancer cells --. It is reasonable to think that biological features of cancer stem cells are reflected by the deference in gene expression between cancer and normal stem cells. The list of aberrantly expressed genes could be huge, and it is critical to identify key genes or pathways that are required for initiating and maintaining cancer stem cells and can be used as targets for inhibiting these cells.\n\n【1】We have tested our hypothesis using BCR-ABL-induced CML as a disease model system, because CML is a stem cell disease and we have previously identified LSCs for CML in mice . In addition, CML stem cells are insensitive to BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors , calling for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here we identify Alox5 as a key gene that regulates the function of LSCs but not normal HSCs in mice. Alox5 has been shown to be involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including oxidative stress response, inflammation, and cancer --. Here we also show that Alox5 deficiency or inhibition of the function of this gene completely prevent the initiation of BCR-ABL-induced CML.\n\n【2】Results \n=======\n\n【3】Alox5 is essential for the induction of CML by BCR-ABL \n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】LSCs in CML are insensitive to BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors , and we believe that this insensitivity would correspond to unresponsiveness of some genes to the kinase inhibitors. To identify genes that are regulated by BCR-ABL in LSCs, we used the bone marrow transplantation (BMT) mouse model of CML as an assay system, in which bone marrow cells from donor mice pre-treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and transduced with BCR-ABL result in development of CML in recipient mice . We transduced bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 (B6) mice with retrovirus containing BCR-ABL/GFP or GFP alone under conditions for the induction of CML, followed by transplantation of the transduced cells into B6 recipient mice. Some mice were treated with the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib to allow identification of genes that were altered by BCR-ABL in LSCs, but this alteration was not restored by inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity with imatinib. This approach to identifying pathways that are activated by BCR-ABL but are insensitive to inhibition by imatinib is based on our previous observation that BCR-ABL kinase activity does not relate to all signaling pathways activated by BCR-ABL . 14 days after BMT, bone marrow cells were isolated and subsequently sorted by FACS for LSCs (GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^) . Total RNA was isolated from these BCR-ABL-expressing LSCs or from the GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells that only expressed GFP, and DNA microarray analysis was carried out to compare gene expression between BCR-ABL-expressing and non-BCR-ABL-expressing Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells. The Alox5 gene was up-regulated and this up-regulation was not abolished by imatinib treatment . There were several genes that were also up-regulated by BCR-ABL and not changed in expression following imatinib treatment . The up-regulation of Alox5 by BCR-ABL in LSCs was confirmed by RT-PCR . To further demonstrate the regulation of Alox5 by BCR-ABL, we tested whether BCR-ABL up-regulates Alox5 function by measuring levels of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is synthesized and metabolized through the 5-LO pathway, in peripheral blood of the transplanted mice. Plasma level of LTB4 was increased in CML mice \n\n【5】Next, we studied the role of Alox5 in regulation of LSC function using Alox5 homozygous knockout (Alox5^−/−^) mice. Wild type or Alox5^−/−^ donor bone marrow cells in B6 background were used to induce CML. We first investigated whether Alox5 is required for the induction of CML by BCR-ABL. Recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced bone marrow cells from 5-FU-treated wild type donor mice developed and died of CML within 4 weeks, whereas recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced bone marrow cells from Alox5^−/−^ donor mice were resistant to the induction of CML . This defective disease phenotype correlated with much less severe infiltration of myeloid leukemia cells in the lung and spleen . In addition, FACS analysis of CML cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow showed that Gr-1^+^ myeloid leukemia cells grew initially, reached a peak after 2 weeks, then started to decline, and eventually disappeared after 7 weeks in peripheral blood and bone marrow of recipients receiving BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ donor bone marrow cells . Alox5 deficiency mainly affected growth of BCR-ABL-expressing (GFP^+^) but not non-BCR-ABL-expressing (GFP^−^) donor bone marrow cells , suggesting that Alox5 signaling is much more critical for the function of LSCs but not normal HSCs. Together, these results demonstrate that Alox5 pathway is essential for the induction of CML by BCR-ABL.\n\n【6】Alox5 transgene rescues defective CML \n---------------------------------------\n\n【7】To further confirm the role of Alox5 in CML development, we co-expressed BCR-ABL and Alox5 in Alox5^−/−^ and wild type bone marrow cells, respectively, by retroviral transduction, followed by transplantation of the transduced cells into recipient mice. The BCR-ABL-IRES-Alox5-pMSCV construct expressed BCR-ABL and 5-LO in 293T cells , and induced LTB4 production in mice . In contrast to no CML induction by BCR-ABL in the absence of Alox5 , ectopically expressed Alox5 in Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells rescued defective CML phenotype, and all mice receiving the BCR-ABL-IRES-Alox5-pMSCV transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells died . In this experiment, we included the control mice that received BCR-ABL transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells as shown in , and all these mice survived . FACS analysis  and peripheral blood smears  showed the development of typical CML after the expression of the rescue gene Alox5, consistent with the severe infiltration of myeloid leukemia cells in the lung and spleen . The mice receiving the BCR-ABL-IRES-Alox5-pMSCV transduced wild type bone marrow cells died faster than those receiving the BCR-ABL-IRES-Alox5-pMSCV transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells , correlating with more myeloid cells in peripheral blood  and more severe infiltration of myeloid leukemia cells in the lung and spleen . The results from this rescue experiment definitively confirmed that Alox5 plays a critical role in CML development.\n\n【8】Alox5 deficiency impairs the function of LSCs \n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The eventual disappearance of myeloid leukemia cells in CML mice in the absence of Alox5  prompted us to examine whether Alox5 is required for self-renewal of LSCs. A biological assay for LSCs is to examine their ability to transfer disease to secondary recipient mice , We transferred bone marrow cells from primary recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced wild type or Alox5^−/−^ donor bone marrow cells to secondary recipient mice. BCR-ABL-expressing wild type bone marrow cells transferred lethal CML, whereas BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells failed to induce CML in secondary recipient mice . This result suggests that Alox5 deficiency causes the impairment of the function of LSCs.\n\n【10】The impaired CML development in the absence of Alox5 could be caused by decreased number of LSCs. To test this hypothesis, we quantified LSCs (GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^) and normal HSCs (GFP^−^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^) in bone marrow and the spleens of CML mice at day 14 and day 18 after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL. At day 14, Alox5 deficiency did not cause a reduction of LSCs in bone marrow and the spleens, but did so in bone marrow not in the spleens at day 18, as compared to LSCs in wild type CML mice . In the spleen of these mice, the number of Alox5^−/−^ LSCs at day 18 was similar to that of wild type LSCs , indicating that the reduction of LSCs in bone marrow was not due to the migration of bone marrow LSCs to the spleens but due to an intrinsic defect caused by Alox5 deficiency in LSCs. Alox5 deficiency did not cause a significant reduction of normal HSCs (GFP^−^) in bone marrow and the spleens of the same animals , suggesting that Alox5 is functionally required by LSCs but not by normal HSCs. In addition, we did not observe a homing defect of HSCs lacking Alox5 , which could cause the impaired CML development . Furthermore, Alox5 deficiency did not appear to cause a homing defect on LSCs, as the total number of Alox5^−/−^ LSCs was not lower than that of wild type LSCs at day 14 after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL .\n\n【11】Engraftment of donor bone marrow cells in lethally irradiated recipient mice reflects stem cell function. Alox5 deficiency could cause a decreased engraftment of LSCs, leading to a decrease in LSCs. To test this idea, LSCs were sorted by FACS from bone marrow of CML induced by transplanting BCR-ABL-transduced wild type (CD45.1) or Alox5^−/−^ (CD45.2) donor bone marrow cells. The sorted wild type and Alox5^−/−^ LSCs were 1:1 mixed, followed by transplantation into lethally irradiated recipient mice. At day 14 or 25 after transplantation, more than 70% or 90% of GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ cells in peripheral blood of the mice were wild type (CD45.1^+^) leukemia cells, and all these mice developed CML and died . Total wild type and Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells that were not sorted by FACS were also 1:1 mixed, followed by transplantation into lethally irradiated recipient mice. At 40 day after BMT, more than 80% of GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ cells in peripheral blood were wild type (CD45.1^+^) leukemia cells, and all these mice died of CML . To further compare biological function between wild type and Alox5^−/−^ LSCs, BCR-ABL-transduced wild type or Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells were sorted by FACS for Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells, and equal number of the sorted wild type or Alox5^−/−^ cells were transplanted into each lethally irradiated recipient mouse. At day 14 after transplantation, GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ cells were detected in peripheral blood of recipient mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced wild type bone marrow cells but barely in peripheral blood of mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells . By day 50 after transplantation, all mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced sorted wild type bone marrow cells died of CML, whereas all mice receiving the transduced sorted Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells survived . These results indicated that Alox5 deficiency caused impairment of the function of LSCs, presumably leading to reduced production of leukemia progenitor cells over time. This assumption was consistent with our finding that at day 20 after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL, similar numbers of GFP^+^ CMP (common myeloid progenitor), GMP (granulocyte-macrophage progenitor), and MEP (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor) cells were detected in bone marrow of mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ donor bone marrow cells , and at day 45 the number of these cells were much less . By contrast, Alox5^−/−^ deficiency did not cause a reduction of non-BCR-ABL-expressing myeloid progenitor cells in the same animals , providing an indirect evidence that Alox5 deficiency only causes a functional defect in LSCs without affecting normal HSCs. The conclusion that Alox5 deficiency does not cause a functional defect in normal HSCs was further confirmed by comparing the engraftment of wild type (CD45.1) and Alox5^−/−^ (CD45.2) bone marrow cells by injecting the same number of each type of bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipient mice. At 30 day after BMT, the percentage of wild type or Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells was similar . A control experiment showed that after lethal irradiation, 100 % of cells in peripheral blood of recipient mice were donor-derived when assayed at day 30 after BMT , allowing the direct analysis of CD45.1 or CD45.2 cells to reflect the donor-derived wild type (CD45.1) and Alox5^−/−^ (CD45.2) bone marrow cells in the same animal.\n\n【12】Alox5 deficiency affects differentiation, cell division and survival of LT-LSCs \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Alox5 deficiency caused the impairment of the function of LSCs , and these cells were Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ phenotypically, containing long-term (LT) HSCs, short-term (ST) HSCs, and multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells. We further investigated which of these cell populations is affected by Alox5 deficiency. BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells were transplanted into recipient mice to induce CML, and bone marrow cells from these mice were analyzed by FACS for the percentages of total HSCs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^), LT-HSCs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^−^), and ST-HSCs /MPP cells (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^+^). At day 20 after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL, the percentage or total number of bone marrow LT-LSCs (GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^−^) was about 1/2 of those of ST-LSCs/MPP cells (GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^+^) . However, at day 90, the percentage or total number of LT-LSCs was about 8 fold higher than that of ST-LSCs/MPP cells . These results suggest that Alox5 deficiency blocks differentiation of LT-LSCs, preventing these cells from developing CML. In these mice, the percentage of GFP^−^ LT-HSCs was much lower than that of GFP^−^ ST-HSCs/MPP cells , demonstrating that Alox5 deficiency did not similarly affect differentiation of normal LT-HSCs. Although loss of Alox5 caused a relative high percentage of LT-LSCs than that of ST-LSCs/MPP cells, the total number of LT-LSCs declined with time , suggesting that Alox5 deficiency caused a gradual depletion of LSCs.\n\n【14】The effect of Alox5 deficiency on LSCs was further demonstrated in experiments showing that Alox5 function was inhibited by a selective 5-LO inhibitor Zileuton . BCR-ABL-transduced wild type bone marrow cells were transplanted into recipient mice to induce CML, and LSCs in bone marrow of these mice treated with Zileuton (300 mg/kg of body weight, twice a day) were analyzed by FACS at days 20 and 90 after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL. As the treatment went on, the ratio between the percentage of LT-LSCs and that of ST-LSCs/MPP cells became increasing , suggesting a blockade of differentiation of LT-LSCs. Zileuton treatment did not similarly affect differentiation of GFP^−^ LT-HSCs in the same animals , demonstrating that inhibition of 5-LO did not suppress normal HSCs. These findings were consistent with those from the studies using Alox5^−/−^ mice . No suppression of normal HSCs was further demonstrated in placebo- or Zileuton-treated mice receiving wild type donor bone marrow cells transduced with MSCV-IRES-GFP retrovirus. At day 14 after BMT, the numbers of GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells in bone marrow of placebo- and Zileuton-treated mice were compared. Zileuton treatment did not result in a reduction of GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells in bone marrow and the spleens of the mice .\n\n【15】The blockade of LT-LSC differentiation was correlated with biological and molecular changes in LSCs. Cell cycle analysis of LSCs in bone marrow of CML mice showed that there was higher percentage of LT-LSCs in the S+G2M phase of the cell cycle in mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells than in mice receiving BCR-ABL-transduced wild type bone marrow cells ; however, the percentages of LT-LSCs and ST-LSCs/MPPs in the S+G2M phase of the cell cycle were similar , suggesting that this differentiation blockade caused a compensatory response of Alox5 deficient LSCs to the shortage of downstream cell lineages. However, the higher percentage of LT-LSCs in the S+G2M phase of the cell cycle in the absence of Alox5 may also be explained by asymmetric cell division of LT-LSCs. In addition, Alox5 deficiency caused slightly increased apoptosis of LSCs (p\\> 0.05) , but the apoptotic ratio between ST-LSCs/MPPs and LT-LSCs in the absence of Alox5 was similar to that in the presence of Alox5 . To study the underlying mechanism for the defective function of LSCs at molecular level, we examined the expressive levels of three regulatory genes of hematopoiesis, β-catenin, GATA-1 and FOG-1 , We found that the defective function of LSCs in the absence of Alox5 was correlated with the reduction of β-catenin and GATA-1 but not FOG-1 .\n\n【16】Inhibition of 5-LO prolongs survival of CML mice \n------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Zileuton treatment suppressed LSCs in CML mice . We examined whether 5-LO serves as a potential target in LSCs for treating CML. Mice with BCR-ABL-induced CML were treated with a placebo, the 5-LO inhibitor Zileuton, imatinib alone, or two agents in combination. All placebo-treated mice developed and died of CML within 4 weeks after the induction of CML by BCR-ABL. Zileuton inhibited Alox5 function in CML mice, as plasma level of LTB4 was decreased compared to placebo-treated CML mice . As expected, imatinib treatment was effective in treating CML, but Zileuton treatment was even more effective . Treatment of CML mice with both Zileuton and imatinib had a better therapeutic effect than with either Zileuton or imatinib alone in prolonging survival of the mice . Prolonged survival of Zileuton-treated CML mice correlated with less severe leukemia cell infiltration to the lungs and the spleens . In peripheral blood of CML mice treated with Zileuton and imatinib, GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ leukemia cells gradually decreased with treatment, and dropped from over 50% to less than 2%, as analyzed at day 60 after the induction of CML . Although these mice eventually died , FACS analysis barely detected any GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ myeloid leukemic cells in peripheral blood at death , indicating that myeloid leukemia was eliminated. Instead, these mice developed ALL, as shown by the presence of GFP^+^B220^+^ leukemic cells in peripheral blood . Zileuton treatment did not have an inhibitory effect on normal myeloid cells (GFP^−^Gr-1^+^) in peripheral blood of the same animals, as the number of these non-leukemia cells increased during the treatment . In bone marrow of Zileuton-treated CML mice, GFP^+^Gr-1^+^ myeloid leukemia cells also dropped to low levels during the treatment . Prolonged survival of CML mice by Zileuton treatment is consistent with the inhibitory effect of Zileuton on LSCs . Zileuton treatment caused a reduction of white blood cell counts less dramatically than did imatinib treatment , presumably because Zileuton targeted LSCs and imatinib inhibited more differentiated leukemic cells. Zileuton treatment also prolonged survival of mice with CML induced by BCR-ABL-T315I .\n\n【18】Elevation of LTB4 level was observed in bone marrow cells of CML patients . However, a later report from the same group showed that the level of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase, which is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of LTC4 and represents a different metabolic pathway from LTB4, was elevated in human CML cells . Therefore, we examined whether BCR-ABL stimulates LTC4 production in CML mice using an ELISA method. We did not observe an increase of plasma LTC4 levels in mice receiving BCR-ABL-expressing wild type bone marrow cells (BCR-ABL+Alox5^+/+^) as compared to mice receiving BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5 deficient bone marrow cells (BCR-ABL+Alox5^−/−^). The mean level of LTC4 was 128.63 pg/ml for the BCR-ABL+Alox5^+/+^ group and 154.84 pg/ml for the BCR-ABL+Alox5^−/−^ group, respectively.\n\n【19】Alox5 deficiency does not significantly affect normal HSCs \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Alox5 deficiency or inhibition of 5-LO by Zileuton specifically impaired the function of Alox5^−/−^ LSCs but not non-BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5^−/−^ HSCs in CML mice , showing that these Alox5^−/−^ HSCs had stronger stem cell ability to engraft recipient mice than did Alox5^−/−^ LSCs in the same animals. However, these results did not clearly show whether Alox5 deficiency affected the function of normal HSCs. This question is important, because it is critical to know whether Alox5 deficiency or inhibition of 5-LO lowers the function of HSCs below their normal level, especially if Alox5 were considered as a therapeutic target. We characterized hematopoietic cell lineages in bone marrow and peripheral blood of Alox5^−/−^ mice in comparison with those of wild type B6 mice. The percentages of HSCs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^), LT-HSCs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^−^), ST-HSCs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^+^Flt3^−^) and MPPs (Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^CD34^+^Flt3^+^) in bone marrow of Alox5^−/−^ mice were only slightly lower than those of wild type mice , and the percentages of Gr-1^+^, Mac-1^+^, B220^+^, or CD3E^+^ cell populations in bone marrow of these mice were similar to those of wild type mice . In peripheral blood, the numbers of Gr-1^+^ and Mac-1^+^ cells in Alox5^−/−^ mice were even higher than those in wild type mice . These results demonstrated that Alox5 deficiency did not lead to significant decrease in the numbers of hematopoietic cell lineages.\n\n【21】To compare the function of HSCs between Alox5^−/−^ and wild type mice, we first performed engraftment assay, in which several doses of Alox5^−/−^ or wild type bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated wild type B6 mice. The engraftment ability of Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells was slightly lower than that of wild type bone marrow cells, as 5×10^4^ wild type bone marrow cells completely protected death of lethally irradiated recipient mice, whereas the same number of Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells partially rescued the irradiated mice . The minor engraftment defect of Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells was further examined in a competitive reconstitution analysis, in which Alox5^−/−^ (CD45.2) and wild type (CD45.1) bone marrow cells were 1:1 mixed and then transferred into recipient mice. 12 weeks after the transplantation, the percentages of CD45.2 Gr-1^+^ and Mac-1^+^ cells were slightly lower than those of CD45.1 Gr-1^+^ and Mac-1^+^ cells in peripheral blood , indicating that Alox5^−/−^ HSCs had slightly lower stem cell function as compared to wild type HSCs. However, the effect of Alox5 deficiency on normal HSCs is much less than that on LSCs, as the competitive engraftment capability of the sorted Alox5^−/−^ LSCs was about thirty fold lower than that of wild type LSCs as assayed at day 25 after CML induction , comparing to the one fold difference between Alox5^−/−^ and normal HSCs . This was further supported by the observation that Alox5^−/−^ LSCs failed to induce CML . We also compared the numbers of bone marrow CMP, GMP, MEP, and CLP between wild type and Alox5^−/−^ mice, and no significant differences were found , suggesting that there were no significant functional defects in these progenitor cells. The minor functional defect of Alox5^−/−^ HSCs prompted us to examine whether there were any cellular changes in cell cycle and gene expression of β-catenin, GATA-1 and FOG-1 in these cells. We found that there were slightly higher percentages of both LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs/MPPs in the S+G2M phase of the cell cycle in Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells than in wild type bone marrow cells , in contrast to the only increase in LT-LSCs in S+G2M phase of the cell cycle in BCR-ABL-expressing Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells . This further indicates that there is no differentiation blockade in Alox5^−/−^ HSCs and that Alox5 deficiency has distinct biological effect on normal HSCs and LSCs. To support this idea, we compared the expressive levels of β-catenin, GATA-1 and FOG-1 in HSCs of wild type and Alox5^−/−^ mice. We found that the minor functional defect of Alox5^−/−^ HSCs was correlated with a decreased expression of GATA-1 and FOG-1, and that β-catenin expression was increased in Alox5^−/−^ HSCs compared to that in wild type HSCs . Different expression patterns of β-catenin, GATA-1 and FOG-1 in Alox5^−/−^ HSCs  and LSCs  indicate that these three genes function differently in LSCs and normal HSCs.\n\n【22】Alox5 is not required for the induction of lymphoid leukemia by BCR-ABL \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】We tested whether Alox5 plays a role in BCR-ABL-induced acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which originates from committed lymphoid progenitors . We have previously shown that BCR-ABL-expressing pro-B cells serve as LSCs for this disease . Wild type or Alox5^−/−^ donor bone marrow cells were transduced by BCR-ABL retrovirus, followed by transplantation of the transduced cells into lethally irradiated wild type B6 recipient mice. Both groups of mice developed and died of ALL with similar disease latency and survival time . FACS analysis of lymphoid leukemia cells showed that both group of ALL mice had similar percentages  and numbers  of B220^+^ leukemia cells in peripheral blood of these mice. Together these results showed that Alox5 did not contribute to the development of ALL induced by BCR-ABL, and suggest that Alox5 is not required by ALL stem cells, but is specifically required by CML stem cells. Consistent with these findings, BCR-ABL did not up-regulate Alox5 function in ALL, as the plasma level of LTB4 in recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced wild type bone marrow cells was not significantly higher compared to recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells .\n\n【24】Disccusion \n==========\n\n【25】The specific role of the Alox5 gene in regulating the function of LSCs but not normal HSCs shows a new mechanism for how cancer and normal stem cells distinctly self-renew and differentiate, and provides a potential novel strategy for curative therapy of CML induced by BCR-ABL. Although Alox5 and its related pathways were identified in LSCs of CML in this study, they may play a critical role in regulating LSCs of myeloid leukemias induced by other types of oncogenes. This idea is supported by our preliminary finding that the development of Tel-PDGFR-beta induced myeloid leukemia was also largely prevented in the absence of the Alox5 gene . In addition, similar phenomenon that a gene specifically regulates cancer stem cells but not normal stem cells may likely be found in other types of cancers.\n\n【26】The mechanism for the specific role of the Alox5 gene in regulating function of LSCs but not normal HSCs remains to be further elucidated. We showed the differential regulation of the beta-catenin gene in wild type and Alox5 deficient LSCs, partially explaining the specific inhibitory effect of Alox5 deficiency on LSCs but not on normal HSCs. It is reasonable to think that these two types of stem cells utilize different pathways for self-renewal and differentiation, and Alox5 represents a critical difference in these stem cells. It is likely that BCR-ABL stimulates transcription of Alox5 to jointly form a unique pathway critical for LSC function. Because the transcriptional activation of Alox5 by BCR-ABL is not inhibited by the BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib, this at least partially explains why imatinib does not inhibit LSCs in CML mice . It is hopeful that targeting Alox5 in combination with a BCR-ABL inhibitor that eliminates BCR-ABL protein, such as a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor , would lead to a better control of CML. 5-LO inhibitor and imatinib could also be a good combination, with one inhibiting LSCs and another eliminating differentiated leukemia cells.\n\n【27】We show that Alox5 deficiency causes the depletion of LSCs in CML mice, and we believe that three biological changes (blockade of differentiation, asymmetric cell division and apoptosis) contribute to the eradication of these stem cells. At present, it is difficult to know which of the three biological changes plays a major role in depleting LSCs, and further mechanistic studies are required to answer this question.\n\n【28】No studies have shown a role of Alox5 in regulation of LSCs. Our findings in this study first demonstrate that Alox5 is a critical regulator of LSCs in CML, providing an in vivo system for investigating underlying molecular mechanisms. Human CML microarray studies have shown that Alox5 is differentially expressed in CD34^+^ CML cells , suggesting a role of Alox5 in human CML stem cells. An in vitro study also supports the role of Alox5 in CML, and in this study the treatment of CML blast cells in culture with 5-LO inhibitors reduced cell proliferation , although genetic approach is required to rule out any off-target effects. Our study shows complete eradication of myeloid leukemia in mice by removing and inhibiting 5-LO, prompting us to test this novel therapeutic strategy in human CML patients in the future. Alox5 function has been linked to many important signaling pathways such as p53 , NF-kB , and PI3K . PI3K is regulated by Pten, which plays a critical role in AML stem cells in mice . Thus, inhibition of Alox5 function may hold a promise for treating other types of malignant diseases. In addition, the impairment of LSCs in CML development by inhibiting Alox5 function also suggests that Alox5 may activate unknown pathways, and investigation of this Alox5 network is critical to understanding the mechanisms by which LSCs survive, self-renew, and differentiate. Besides LSCs in CML, specific signaling networks are likely found in other cancer stem cells, relative to their normal stem cell counterparts.\n\n【29】Methods \n=======\n\n【30】Mice \n----\n\n【31】C57BL/6J--CD45.1, C57BL/6J--CD45.2, and homozygous Alox5 knockout (Alox5^−/−^) mice in C57BL/6 background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment and given unrestricted access to 6% chow diet and acidified water. Alox5^−/−^ mice have normal hematopoietic cell counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood .\n\n【32】Flow cytometry and identification of leukemia and normal hematopoietic cell lineages \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Hematopoietic cells were collected from bone marrow and peripheral blood of the normal and diseased mice, and red blood cells were lysed with NH~4~Cl red blood cell lysis buffer (pH 7.4). The cells were washed with PBS, and stained with B220-PE for B cells, Gr-1-APC for neutrophils, Mac-1-PE for macrophage, CD3E--APC for T cells, and Sca-1-PE-cy7/c-Kit-APC-cy7/CD34-APC/CD135 (Flt3)-PE for hematopoietic stem cells. After staining, the cells were washed once with PBS and subjected to FACS analysis.\n\n【34】Bone marrow transduction/transplantation \n----------------------------------------\n\n【35】The retroviral vector MSCV-IRES-eGFP carrying the p210 BCR-ABL cDNA and retroviral transduction and transplantation of mouse bone marrow cells for induction of CML and ALL by BCR-ABL had been described previously ,\n\n【36】Measurement of plasma LTB4 \n--------------------------\n\n【37】Plasma of BCR-ABL induced CML mice were collected on day 20 post induction of the disease, and stored at the −80 °C before use. An enzyme immunoassay was carried out to measure the LTB4 levels in plasma using an ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 50 ul of each standard or plasma sample was added to each well of 96-well plates, followed by adding 50 ul of LTB4 AchE trancer to each well. Then, 50 ul of LTB4 EIA antiserum was added to each well, and incubated the plates at 4 °C overnight. Next day, the plates were read and the results were analyzed.\n\n【38】Western blot analysis and antibodies \n------------------------------------\n\n【39】Antibodies against c-ABL, β-actin, and 5−LO were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Protein lysates were prepared by lysing cells in RIPA buffer, and Western blotting was carried out as described previously .\n\n【40】Real-time PCR \n-------------\n\n【41】Total mRNA was isolated from HSCs or LSCs isolated by the FACS sorting. cDNA was synthesized using the Ovation-Pico cDNA synthesis method. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect expression of β-catenin, GATA-1 and FOG-1 with the primers shown in the .\n\n【42】Drug treatment \n--------------\n\n【43】Zileuton (Critical Therapeutics.

One group of CML mice was treated with imatinib (150 mg/kg body weight/ per dose, once every 4 hours) for 5 doses beginning at day 13 post bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Bone marrow cells were isolated from CML mice, and were sorted by FACS for GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells (normal or CML stem cells). Total RNA was isolated from these sorted cells for DNA micorarray analysis. Expression of the Alox5 gene was up-regulated by BCR-ABL in CML stem cells as compared to the sorted GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells that did not express BCR-ABL, and this up-regulation was not prevented by imatinib treatment. b, Bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice (B6) were transduced with retrovirus containing BCR-ABL/GFP or GFP alone to induce CML as described in a. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the mice were sorted by FACS for GFP^+^Lin^−^c-Kit^+^Sca-1^+^ cells, and then total RNA was isolated from these sorted cells for comparing Alox5 expression between GFP vector-transduced normal stem cells and BCR-ABL-transduced LSCs by RT-PCR. Expression of the Alox5 gene was significantly up-regulated by BCR-ABL in LSCs as compared to the sorted GFP vector-transduced normal stem cells (p\\< 0.001). c, The plasma level of LTB4 in recipients of BCR-ABL-transduced bone marrow cells was significantly higher than that in recipients of bone marrow cells transduced with GFP-containing retrovirus (p\\< 0.05), and this increased level of LTB4 was not observed in recipients of Alox5^−/−^ bone marrow cells transduced by BCR-ABL.

Calpain 2 was first expressed late in embryonic development and localized to the lens epithelium and transition zone. Lp82 was expressed at E9.5 in the lens placode, head ectoderm, and throughout the fiber cells during embryonic lens maturation. Lp82 co-localized at sites of crystallin modification in the juvenile lens. In the adult lens, Lp82 protein was maintained in cortical fibers but could not be detected in the lens nucleus. Lp85, the slightly larger splice variant of Lp82, was first observed at E9.5 and throughout early embryonic lens development. Abundant localization of this enzyme was observed in the cell nuclei of lens epithelium, elongating fibers, and undifferentiated mesoderm. Robust peri-nuclear localization of calpain 10 was observed in the head ectoderm, lens placode, and optic vesicle during early eye induction. Further, calpain 10 protein was maintained in the lens epithelium of pre- and post-natal lens.

An online survey was administered to medical students in North Carolina. Students were asked about specialty interest, MSK pain on surgical rotations, and deterrents from surgical fields. Students were exposed to literature about ergonomics in surgery then queried again about relative specialty interest (medical versus surgical). Differences in specialty interest before and after the exposure were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Of 243 participants, 44.0% were interested in pursuing a surgical specialty. Overall, 75.3% reported MSK pain during their surgical rotation, with the average daily pain score highest during surgery rotations compared to all other clinical rotations. The worst pain was reported in the feet and low back while \"standing in the operating room\" (81.2%) or \"retracting\" (59.4%). Among students initially interested in surgery but whose interest changed to a medical specialty during medical school, \"physical demands of the field\" was a common deterrent (36.4%). After exposure to literature regarding the incidence of MSK injuries in surgery, student interest in surgical fields on a 10-point scale significantly decreased (average -0.5 points; P < 0.01).

Among the world's poorest, a single procedure---amputation---is frequently the definitive therapy for a variety of unrelated processes such as trauma, infection, or gangrene ; many die without any care at all.

Private hospitals serve major metropolitan areas but have fees that are beyond the reach of the majority of the population. Public hospitals provide surgical care for a smaller fee, but supplies (sutures, medications, intravenous fluids, blood, and even gloves) must be purchased---frequently off-site, at private pharmacies---by the patient before any procedures take place. Charitable organizations are the third category of surgical care providers, but most of these institutions also charge fees for their services. The parallel existence of these three sources of surgical care is typical of most poor countries and, because of attendant fees, does not allow for adequate access to surgical care for the destitute sick---often the very people most in need of services. Among the multitude of nongovernmental organizations operating in rural Haiti, to our knowledge only one, Zanmi Lasante (ZL), provides a permanent setting in which a wide variety of surgical diseases can be addressed free of charge to the patient. This article describes Zanmi Lasante's experience scaling up surgical services over a 20-year period in a rural, isolated, and resource-poor setting.\n\n【5】Zanmi Lasante: the birth of a \"pro-poor\" hospital and expansion in the public sector \n====================================================================================\n\n【6】The Boston-based nonprofit organization Partners In Health (PIH) was founded in 1987 to support community health care efforts launched by ZL in a squatter settlement in central Haiti in 1983 . The hillside site of Cange, originally in the midst of a community displaced by the flooding of a fertile valley for the construction of a hydroelectric dam, is about three hours from the capital city, Port-au-Prince, on a largely unpaved and sometimes impassible road. Since its inception, the medical facility at Cange has grown from a small community clinic to a large sociomedical complex registering more than 250,000 visits annually. Today, l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur in Cange is a 104-bed, full-service hospital with two operating rooms; adult, pediatric, and surgical inpatient wards; an outpatient clinic; an infectious disease unit, which includes the national referral center for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB); subspecialty services, including women's health, dental, and ophthalmology clinics; laboratories; pharmacies; a blood bank; radiology services; and a broad range of socioeconomic initiatives. The hospital is linked to a network of hospitals and health centers serving the population of Haiti's Central and Artibonite Departments, with a combined population of about 1.2 million people.\n\n【7】A critical component of ZL's growth in this challenging setting is the recruitment and training of community health workers, called accompagnateurs. Today, 2,000 paid accompagnateurs serve as the vital link between ZL's health facilities and patients dispersed across the rural countryside. Their role in the PIH/ZL model of care, particularly for patients living with HIV or tuberculosis, has been discussed in detail in previous publications \\[--\\]. A second element of ZL's growth in Haiti is its engagement with the public health sector to expand access to services. Since 2001, ZL has collaborated with the Haitian Ministry of Health to revitalize and reinforce eight public hospitals and clinics in central Haiti, from rebuilding hospitals to installing generators for electricity, to hiring and training staff, to establishing pharmaceutical supply chains. The explicit goal of this public-private partnership was to leverage funds for AIDS and tuberculosis programs, which became available in 2002, to reinforce comprehensive primary health care and to strengthen health systems in general. Users' fees, even within the public sector, remained a barrier for the poorest patients until it was agreed that HIV prevention and care, women's health, TB diagnosis and care, and diagnosis and treatment of all sexually transmitted infections would be considered \"public goods for public health\"---provided free of charge to the patient . A major consideration for this partnership was the nearly complete absence of surgical services in central Haiti. Could surgical services be considered public goods for public health?\n\n【8】Surgical services at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur \n==========================================\n\n【9】Although minor procedures, from draining abscesses to tubal ligations, were done intermittently ever since clinical services were first offered in Cange, it was not until 1993 that an operating room was built. With the arrival of a full-time obstetrician-gynecologist, over the next several years the OR was used regularly to address obstetrical emergencies. Short-term medical missions from the United States became increasingly surgical over time, but there were neither general surgeons nor anesthesiologists on staff. As the number of patients seeking care for the major morbidities of TB, HIV, diarrheal disease, and chronic noncommunicable diseases grew, more and more patients with surgical disease also came to l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur seeking care. By the late 1990s, there was increased recognition of the need to treat a variety of routine, urgent, and emergent surgical diseases. To meet these needs, ZL built a second OR and a 15-bed surgical ward, and between 2000 and 2002 hired a general surgeon as well as two additional obstetrician-gynecologists. Through an agreement with the Cuban Ministry of Health, another general surgeon came to the hospital in 2002. An ophthalmologist was hired in 2003 and, with the help of the Haitian Red Cross, a proper blood bank was installed.\n\n【10】By 2005, ZL's public-private partnerships at small regional hospitals and clinics, along with hundreds of attendant community health workers, served as a network referring patients from across the entire Central Plateau to l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur for evaluation and surgery. Staff at all of the expansion sites are trained in basic surgical resuscitation and stabilization, and referrals are facilitated by Zanmi Lasante/Ministry of Health-owned ambulances in emergency cases or through the provision of transportation stipends to patients with nonurgent problems. Operating rooms at two of the largest expansion sites, Hinche and Belladères, have recently been refurbished and staffed with a full-time obstetrician and nurse anesthetist (NA) for emergency obstetrical care. A Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)-led NA training program began at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur in 2006; six nurses from ZL and other parts of Haiti are currently enrolled.\n\n【11】To better understand the volume and variety of surgical procedures at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur, we undertook a retrospective review of the surgical cases performed between January 2002 and September 2005. We reviewed the operating room logs maintained by the surgical and anesthesia staff for patient age, place of residence, date of procedure, type of procedure, and the specialty involved. Distance traveled to the hospital was estimated as the crow flies based on patients' place of residence. Table  displays the characteristics of surgical patients served at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur between January 2002 and September 2005. A total of 2,601 patients underwent 2,900 procedures, ranging from simple incision and drainage to complicated cardiothoracic surgeries. Table 1Characteristics of surgical patients at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur, Cange, Haiti, 2002--2005Year2002200320042005^a^TotalTotal patients2418147847622601    Female984344514481431    Male1433803333141170Mean age3436343735.5    0-20 years28%25%20%17%21%    21-40 years40%37%47%44%42%    41-60 years19%26%27%28%26%    \\>60 years13%15%6%12%10%^a^2005 data reflects the period January--September 2005\n\n【12】Two notable findings confirmed our experiential understanding of the l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur surgical program. First, the total number of patients seeking services has increased significantly, from 241 patients in 2002 to 762 during the first nine months of 2005. Second, the geographic distribution of patients has expanded: in 2002, more than 80% of patients lived within 50 km of the hospital. By 2005, however, more than half the patients traveled over 50 km to Cange for care---a significant journey to a rural, remote area of the country. This expanding catchment area points to the significance of PIH/ZL's accompagnateur model, which allows patients who might otherwise not seek care to be identified and referred from their communities and later followed up in their homes as necessary, but also the importance of providing free care to those who need it. By 2005 a third of all patients undergoing surgery at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur reported their place of residence to be the capital city of Port-au-Prince---the site of the largest public hospital in the country as well as numerous private surgical practices, all of which require fees for services. The widening geographic distribution of the ZL patient base over time presents convincing evidence of the surgical service's importance not just to the Central Plateau region, where the hospital is located, but to the country as a whole, as cost and/or quality of care are prohibitive factors even when other facilities are available.\n\n【13】A wide variety of surgical pathology was addressed at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur, with common procedures dominating the census 删除21:<u></u>. General surgery accounted for almost half (47.6%) of all cases, obstetrical and gynecological cases a third (32.6%) of all cases, and urologic, plastic, neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiothoracic cases the remainder. Visiting specialists on short-term missions, largely from the United States, performed operations not normally performed by the staff general surgeons, such as prostatectomy, extraventricular drain placement, and cleft lip repair. One case of mitral valvuloplasty surgery with the use of an extracorporeal bypass circuit was performed by visiting surgeons in 2002.

Other programs are surely larger in terms of volume; indeed, our own infectious disease and primary health care programs, which counted 1.6 million clinical exchanges in 2006, dwarf the surgical program. However, we believe this effort is noteworthy in large part because it provides services to people who would otherwise not have access to them, and for a simple reason: they cannot pay the fees associated with almost all surgical care. In an area in which medical insurance is all but unknown, what would be the financing strategy to manage both elective and emergent surgical services?\n\n【16】Over the years, PIH and ZL have drawn on both the public health and human rights paradigms to help build and keep afloat a surgical program in a setting in which fee-for-service models are doomed to fail. Outside assessments and some members of the ZL staff suggested that certain surgical services could be provided on a sliding payment scale, but even a cursory study of this approach led us to conclude that triaging patients' ability to pay would have required significant resources and yielded little. It would have cost more to perform such means tests than could be recovered through patient fees. For the destitute sick, the great majority of our patients, the only hope for access to such services came from operationalizing the notion of health care as a human right and maintaining free access to surgical services as we do for medical services . Efforts to keep afloat ZL's rights-based surgical program proved taxing; by 2003, ZL was seeing patients from around the country, the costs of the program continued to rise, and no foundations or international funding mechanisms existed to support the provision of surgical services---even emergency obstetrics---to the very poorest.\n\n【17】The connection between women's health and surgical care may well help us to move forward the general surgical agenda in resourced-constrained settings, as we argue in an accompanying editorial . Because there is a strong focus on women's health in both primary care and HIV services at Zanmi Lasante, it is no surprise that women also constitute the majority (55%) of surgical patients in this review. Although there is to date little enthusiasm for the notion of a right to surgical care, there is a growing movement to promote safe childbirth as a right---a possible entry point for promoting a broader agenda for surgical care in resource-poor settings.\n\n【18】Many challenges remain for ZL to be able to fully address the burden of surgical disease in the Central Plateau and beyond. These challenges are shared in other similarly poor and rural areas worldwide: inadequate basic infrastructure, lack of trained health-care workers, and lack of large-scale, sustained funding for surgical services.\n\n【19】This last issue---the question of consistent funding sources---is one of utmost importance. The logistics and capital costs of setting up a surgical theater are not trivial. Appropriate space, blood-banking, well-trained surgical and postoperative staff, proper tools and supplies, stable electricity, and accessible telecommunications are all essential for high-quality care. The World Bank, among others, has suggested that surgical services incorporated into hospital-level care may be as costeffective as other large-scale public health initiatives . However, large public health initiatives and funders often lack the flexibility and long-term mandate to support the construction of surgical theaters or the regular procurement of consumables, let alone the provision of free care to patients who are unable to afford user fees.\n\n【20】Staffing is a second major challenge. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than four million workers are needed worldwide to meet health-care needs, with sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia the most understaffed . The dearth of health personnel is even more striking in specialty fields. Shortages in surgical staffing include anesthesiologists, specialist and general surgeons, and nurses trained in postoperative or intensive care. The \"brain drain\" of workers from low-income to higher-income settings contributes to staffing gaps \\[--\\]. The AIDS epidemic and its attendant psychological burdens have demoralized health professionals and even further reduced their numbers . Alongside an absolute shortage of health-care workers, the distribution of existing personnel between capital cities and rural areas is severely imbalanced, and encouraging health personnel to live and work in rural areas can be difficult.\n\n【21】In addition to providing sufficient remuneration, ongoing training, and career-development opportunities, ZL has succeeded in retaining surgical staff in part because of the powerful motivator of providing health-care workers with the tools they need to perform their trade---namely, medicines, supplies, and adequate facilities. Targeted, local training efforts can also help overcome staffing shortages. At l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur, the chief of anesthesia is a nurse anesthetist from the area who was one of 19 NAs trained by Médecins Sans Frontières in Haiti between 1998 and 2002. Unfortunately, very few of these graduates are working in the public sector in Haiti; many are not working as NAs at all.\n\n【22】In some cases, visiting staff can effectively supplement in-house capacity. Well-organized, short-term surgical missions can address complicated surgical issues if high-quality follow-up care and services are available after the visiting surgeons leave. Developing residency training programs for U.S. surgeons based in resource-poor settings is one way to accomplish this. We have done this for medical residency ; now we need to do it for surgery. In extreme cases, some surgical patients with conditions that cannot be addressed in situ in Haiti have required intervention in the United States. PIH's Right to Health Care program serves patients with life-threatening medical and surgical needs that cannot be met at l'Hôpital Bon Sauveur or other hospitals in Haiti. Recent interventions have included surgery for repair of tetralogy of Fallot and rheumatic mitral valve disease, total hip replacement, neurosurgery for excision of meningioma, nephrectomy, and plastic surgery management of severe burns.\n\n【23】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【24】Surgical disease has been neglected as a serious public health problem despite its major contribution to death and disability worldwide . Half a million women die of pregnancy-related causes every year; leading causes such as hemorrhage and obstructed labor have effective surgical interventions that are simply not available to those who need them most . Annually, more than one million people lose their lives to road traffic accidents, and 875,000 children and adolescents die as a result of injuries such as burns and falls ; these pathologies all have surgical therapies that can save lives or prevent disability.\n\n【25】Recently there has been increasing acknowledgment of the importance of surgical care in public health. In 2005, the WHO established the Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care (GIEESC) with the aim of improving collaborations among organizations and agencies involved in reducing morbidity and mortality from surgical conditions . Further discussions have appeared recently in both medical and surgical journals , and the second edition of the World Bank's influential Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries included a chapter on surgery . The Bellagio Conference in June 2007 brought together leaders in surgery, anesthesia, obstetrics, health policy, and health economics from Africa, Europe, and the United States, who collectively concluded that a significant proportion of the global burden of disease is surgical, that with investments in infrastructure and training a majority of surgical disease can be treated or prevented at first-level referral centers, and that the integration of surgical services with primary health care services will be essential for prevention and referral efforts . Zanmi Lasante's experience providing surgical services in impoverished rural Haiti suggests that these recommendations are urgent and actionable.\n\n【26】This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The IMPROVEMENT of Heart Failure survey investigated the knowledge and perceptions of over 1300 primary care physicians from 14 ESC member nations and the actual practice in over 11000 of their patients. Guidelines and clinical practice were compared. The survey suggested, in this large sample, that the quality of care was higher than previous smaller surveys have suggested but have also identified important deficiencies in knowledge and management that should be rectified. The COPERNICUS study demonstrated that carvedilol was remarkably well tolerated even in patients with very severe heart failure and that treatment was associated with a substantial reduction in mortality even among patients that would conventionally not be considered, by many, for beta-blocker therapy. The MUSTIC trial suggested that cardiac resynchronisation using biventricular pacing improved patients symptomatically whether or not the patient was in atrial fibrillation. Morbidity and mortality studies of cardiac resynchronisation are now underway. The ASPECT-II and APRICOT-II studies investigated the role of warfarin, aspirin and their combination for the long-term management of myocardial infarction. One interpretation of the data from these studies is that the combination of aspirin and warfarin is about as effective as warfarin alone but with a much higher incidence of side effects. Warfarin alone appeared superior to aspirin alone.

Within an extensive screening programme of haematopoietic growth factor activity on malignant cells, the effects of rhSCF were further tested on the growth of 29 different human cell lines derived from a wide range of solid tumours, among them six lung cancers and five melanomas. RhSCF (0, 1, 10, 100 ng/ml) was tested in a human tumour cloning assay (HTCA) which reliably detects growth modulation of tumour cells by cytokines. Additionally, a tritiated thymidine uptake test was used. Growth of 27 of the 29 cell lines tested was not affected by rhSCF. However, growth of the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line HTB 120 was slightly stimulated (1.5 fold that of controls), and that of the melanoma cell line MeWo was stimulated up to 1.3-fold. This activity was eliminated dose-dependently by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. We further analysed the cell lines for expression of the proto-oncogene C-KIT and its ligand SCF. All melanoma and lung cancer cell lines expressed SCF as assessed at the mRNA level. Northern blotting also revealed clear C-KIT mRNA expression in three melanoma (HAS, MeWo, SK-MEL-28), one NSCLC (HTB 53), and four SCLC cell lines (HTB 119, HTB 120, HTB 171, HTB 175). Furthermore, C-KIT protein expression was detected by flow cytometric analysis on the cell surface of MeWo, HTB 119 and HTB 120 cells. Our data indicate that SCF can be operative in growth modulation of non-haematopoietic malignant cells, especially SCLC and melanoma. However, our extensive screening of SCF/tumour cell interaction shows that this interaction is rare and makes potential hazards, such as tumour stimulation upon clinical use of rhSCF in conjunction with chemotherapy in cancer patients, unlikely for the majority of other tumour histologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A systematic review by Simmons-Mackie, Raymer, Armstrong, Holland, and Cherney  has concluded that conversation training is effective at improving the communication of a CP, and having a trained CP is probably effective in also improving the participation in conversation of a person with chronic aphasia. One set of studies has focused on training CPs in groups without the person with aphasia (PWA) being present , while another has trained CPs and PWAs within dyads , but in all these studies, the focus is primarily on effecting change to the CP's behaviour in order to indirectly influence the PWA's conversation.\n\n【2】In a review of conversation therapy studies, Wilkinson and Wielaert  highlight not only the success of CP training, but also the potential of similar programmes that train a PWA directly. For example, Wilkinson, Lock, Bryan, and Sage  successfully taught a PWA to use topic alerters as a new method of initiating topics, and Wilkinson, Bryan, Lock, and Sage  employed direct training of a PWA to increase the development of topics. In addition, Fox, Armstrong, and Boles , employing procedures used by Boles  and Boles and Lewis , noted improved PWA participation in conversation after the training. Specifically the PWA initiated more topics, asked more questions and slowed rate of speech. These changes were verified by PWA and CP report and observation measures. Thus far, results of PWA conversation training have been encouraging. However, Wilkinson and Wielaert  note a reliance on single case analyses and qualitative evidence of change. As the authors point out, although this is not unusual when a complex behavioural intervention is in the early stages of development and evaluation, it limits the robustness of the evidence base.\n\n【3】This article reports on a tailored conversation therapy programme that was designed to allow direct work with a PWA and with their CP . The therapy aimed to raise insight into the effects of agrammatism on conversation and teach strategies to allow (i) a PWA to produce more complete, and thus successful, turns at talk, thereby increasing the likelihood of mutual understanding, and (ii) a CP to modify their responses to PWA turns and, thus, enhance their partner's chance of communicating more effectively. Participants were facilitated to choose three strategies to work on from a restricted set of suggestions. Each strategy had an interactional focus and was based on CA research into successful turn construction behaviours of individuals with agrammatism (Beeke, Wilkinson, & Maxim, ) and CP strategies that have been found to aid the flow of conversation . PWA strategies included the use of a keyword (to identify what is being talked about) and the integration of writing, drawing, use of props, gesture, or facial expression into a turn. Thus, the therapy was not impairment-focused with the objective of reducing agrammatic output, instead it targeted both speakers, facilitating the development of a communicative conversation style in spite of agrammatism.\n\n【4】Aims \n====\n\n【5】The aims of the study were to use a mixed methods approach to evaluate a conversation-focused intervention that trained both the CP and the PWA, in two dyads where one speaker has agrammatic aphasia. This article presents quantitative outcomes of conversation change and qualitative insights into why behavioural change in conversation may or may not have occurred for the PWA and CP, using conversation Analysis (CA). We present two illustrative case studies from a larger study, chosen for the similarity of the barrier conversation behaviour used by both CPs (test questions, defined below) and the extent to which it dominated pre-therapy conversations. An analysis of all eight dyads is in preparation.\n\n【6】Methods and procedures \n======================\n\n【7】Each case study involved a PWA and their chosen CP in 6 months of intervention, subdivided into three phases of 8 weeks each: (a) pre-therapy baseline assessment; (b) therapy; and (c) post-therapy follow up assessment.  illustrates the design. Figure 1.Study design.\n\n【8】Assessments \n-----------\n\n【9】A dyad participated in 8 weeks of pre-therapy and 8 weeks of post-therapy assessment, which took place at home, once a week for around 1.5 hr. Assessment of conversation involved video recording eight pre- and eight post-therapy samples, labelled C1--8 and C11--18, respectively, and two conversations during therapy (C9 and C10, not analysed here), each of approximately 20 min in length, totalling around 6 hr of recordings per dyad. To do this, a dyad was trained in how to operate a digital video camera. The research speech and language therapist (SLT) was not present when the recordings were made. Dyads were advised to record at a time when they would normally sit down for a chat, to catch up on events and news, for example; there were no suggested topics. Assessment of language impairment, activity, and participation was split into three pre-therapy and two post-therapy assessment baselines 删除21:<u></u> and consisted of a battery of tests and interviews and a test of cognitive flexibility 删除21:<u></u>. Some tests were repeated once at each baseline  in order to capture any change, and maintenance of change, post therapy. These assessments are referred to as repeated measures in . However, other tests were administered to gain an overview of performance and, thus, were only carried out once before and once after therapy (referred to as profile assessments in ). In this article, we report on pre-therapy language assessment results to give the reader a profile of each participant's aphasia. Thus, scores obtained from measures repeated before therapy have been averaged.

The therapy, designed specifically for people with agrammatic aphasia, was adapted from SPPARC  but with two significant differences: (i) it introduced participants to agrammatism and its specific effects on conversation, such as difficulties with \"building\" a turn; and (ii) it aimed to change the conversational behaviours of both the PWA and CP, via direct work with each on strategy use in conversation. Appendix A provides a list of the sessions, grouped according to their main aims (developing insight, choosing strategies, practising strategy use). Following the SPPARC ethos , during sessions 1, 2, and 3, a dyad viewed short video clips from pre-therapy conversations to increase their insight into key features (both positive and negative) of their interactions (referred to as facilitators and barriers) and to identify what they could have done differently during problematic exchanges. Having raised a dyad's insight in this way, the SLT then facilitated a joint goal setting process, with the outcome that both the PWA (in session 4) and the CP (in session 5) were encouraged to choose three strategies each that they wished to practise in therapy to reduce barriers and aid the flow of conversations. In session 6, both the PWA and the CP chose strategies to aid topic setting and development, as detailed in SPPARC. It should be noted that because of the extensive use of videos of the dyad, although the main aim of sessions 4, 5, and 6 was to facilitate strategy choice, these sessions also continued to develop insight. The therapy was also distinctive in that it included two sessions (7 and 8) during which the dyad held \"practise\" conversations and received feedback from the SLT on strategy use, both as the practise conversation was happening (online coaching) and after it ended (this included watching it back on video). For further details of session aims and techniques, see Beckley et al. To access the therapy programme itself, visit Better Conversations with Aphasia, a free e-learning resource .\n\n【12】Quantitative and qualitative analysis of conversation samples \n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The conversation samples were analysed quantitatively by counting instances of facilitators and barriers in twelve 5-min video samples, taken from six pre- and six post-therapy conversations (from a total of eight pre- and eight post-therapy samples), and applying a statistical test to look for significant change. Sample selection was motivated by the wish to minimise participant awareness of being part of the study, and particularly of being video recorded. Thus, we discarded C1, the very first conversation that participants recorded before therapy, and C18, the final post-therapy sample. The remaining seven pre- and seven post-therapy samples were felt to be more ecologically valid. Of these 14 samples, to date we have counts for 12 (C2--4 and C6--8 pre-therapy, and C11--14 and C16 and C17 post-therapy), and this analysis is reported here. Where a conversation sample was 10 min in length or longer, the first 5 min was discarded, with the second 5 min selected for analysis to maximise ecological validity. If a sample was less than 10 min in length, the final 5 min was selected for analysis.\n\n【14】The counts of facilitators and barriers reported here are the work of six Masters students of speech and language therapy at University College London, who completed their theses with the project team between 2010 and 2012. Prior to rating, students (all of whom had completed a minimum of 2.5 hr of basic CA training as part of their degree course) received 6.5 hr of group training split across four workshops, covering the aims and design of the project, how to produce a transcript of a sample (one turn to a line) prior to rating (a detailed transcript was not deemed necessary, but important non-verbal communication was included), and how to rate a sample for barriers and facilitators. Student raters were given written guidelines that defined each barrier and facilitator and gave real-data examples, and workshops included a discussion of these definitions followed by group rating practice, with conversation samples taken from two people with agrammatic aphasia who were not part of the project. During the rating process, students attended a further two group meetings at which they could discuss any difficulties with rating and categorising aspects of conversation. They also had access to a group e-mail via which they could post queries to their fellow students and the project team. Each student was allocated between two and eight samples to rate (with an equal number taken from pre- and post-therapy samples), depending on the scope of their project. All were blind at the time of rating as to the point of collection for all samples. In some cases, it was possible to ask two students to independently rate the same sample and to agree counts for individual facilitators and barriers. Agreement was defined as both students applying the same rating to a specific turn; consensus agreement techniques were not used. Where available, we report counts of facilitators/barriers agreed by two students, even if this is zero. Otherwise, counts by an individual student are reported.\n\n【15】The counts constitute non-parametric frequency data across occasions. The Poisson distribution can be applied where there are a large number of possible events which are rare. A weighted Poisson trend test for frequencies, derived from a Jonckheere Trend Test, was applied to identify whether there was a significant change in these counts after therapy (David Howard, May 2011, personal communication). This enabled us to test the hypothesis that the post-therapy counts differed significantly from the pre-therapy counts. To test this, all pre-therapy conversations were weighted the same and all post-therapy conversations were weighted the same. We did not explore other possible hypotheses, such as gradual change over the course of the study. It should be noted that, if the number of observations in any condition is less than 5, the z score approximation may not be very accurate. Because of the directional hypotheses for change, we employed one-tailed tests.\n\n【16】In addition, the methods and published findings of CA were applied to conversational extracts to illustrate the impact on conversation of a reduction in CP barrier behaviours and an increase in PWA strategy use and the interconnected nature of such changes. Three of the four extracts analysed here (Extracts 2, 3, and 4) were originally identified, transcribed using CA conventions and analysed by three of the six Masters students. This formed part of the qualitative data presented in their theses alongside the conversation ratings. They performed this work after producing the ratings, when they had been unblinded as to sample collection date. Their transcripts and analyses have been refined and extended by the first author.\n\n【17】Participants \n------------\n\n【18】Two dyads are reported here. The first is Graham, a right-handed male British-English speaker with severe non-fluent aphasia, and his partner, Alex (throughout this article, all names are pseudonyms). Graham was 63 years old when recruited to the project, having had a left middle cerebral artery infarct 5 years before, affecting the fronto-temporal cortex and parts of the parietal lobe. After the stroke, Graham was in intensive care for 4 weeks. He then received 12 weeks of National Health Service (NHS) inpatient rehabilitation followed by a further 6 sessions of community speech and language therapy. After this he had private SLT for 3 years, twice a week for the first 6 months, weekly thereafter. Graham left school at 16 years, trained and worked as a nurse, and latterly worked as a nurse manager in several hospitals. Alex is a retired accident and emergency nurse and was in his early 60s when recruited to the project.\n\n【19】As  shows, although non-verbal semantics was largely intact and single word comprehension was mildly impaired, Graham's comprehension was severely impaired for spoken and written sentences. He was severely impaired on spoken word retrieval and sentence production. His ability to write single words was less impaired than his spoken naming. As this sample from the CAT picture description (Swinburn, Porter, & Howard, ) shows, Graham's connected speech is severely affected by his aphasia and also a moderate to severe verbal dyspraxia (numbers in brackets indicate pauses in seconds): Figure 2.Pre-therapy language profile: Graham. \"\"a cat通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> and (2 sylls) and the (2 sylls)通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> and a then a another one and通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u> a (1 syll) and (SLT: that's it?) yes\"\" His test profile is suggestive of severe agrammatic aphasia.\n\n【20】During therapy, after viewing video footage of their conversations and discussing facilitators and barriers with the SLT, Graham chose to work on the following strategies: writing and drawing; mime; keyword. Alex chose to work on: \"let the conversation continue (for further clues/so Graham can use strategies)\"; \"carry on if you have understood (it does not need to be perfect)\"; \"comment\" on Graham's turn. A key conversational barrier discussed with the dyad was Alex's use of test questions. A test (or \"known answer\") question is defined as one to which the questioner already knows the answer and was first outlined in the context of formal talk in the classroom (McHoul, Searle, ).\n\n【21】The second dyad is Stuart, a right-handed male British-English speaker with severe non-fluent aphasia, and his wife, Pamela. Stuart was 57 years old when recruited to the project, having had a left cerebrovascular accident 10 months before (no scan results were available). After the stroke, Stuart received NHS inpatient rehabilitation for an unknown length of time before having 12 weeks of community SLT. Stuart left school at 16 years, and, prior to his stroke, he worked as a self employed van driver. Pamela is a school dinner lady and was in her mid-50s when she and Stuart joined the study. They live with their son, Graham, who was 12 years old at the time of their involvement in the project. Some of the conversations recorded by Pamela and Stuart include Graham (though he is not visible on camera).\n\n【22】As  shows, Stuart showed a mild impairment of non-verbal semantics, a mild problem understanding spoken words, but a moderate difficulty understanding spoken sentences. He was severely impaired on a test of understanding written sentences. Production of single words and sentences, spoken and written, was severely impaired. As this sample from the CAT picture description  shows, Stuart's connected speech is severely affected by his aphasia (numbers in brackets indicate pauses in seconds): Figure 3.Pre-therapy language profile: Stuart. \"\"yeah yeah picture and通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> book通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> book umm tree通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> tree uh uh uh and ((taps with fingers))通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> (1 syll)通用删除7(英):<u> (10)</u> picture通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u> and book and通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> book and (SLT: it's alright)通用删除7(英):<u> (9)</u> book and right通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> know what I mean, d'you know what I mean, ooh oh (SLT: anything else) book and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> book, yes通用删除7(英):<u> (6)</u> book (3 sylls) look look no one two three four five通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> book book book and woman woman woman (3 sylls) and run run run run (3 sylls)通用删除7(英):<u> (10)</u> (SLT: yes) ((PWA writes))通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u> miaow miaow miaow miaow\"\" His test profile is suggestive of severe agrammatic aphasia.\n\n【23】During therapy, after viewing video footage of their conversations and discussing facilitators and barriers with the SLT, Stuart chose to work on the following strategies: writing and drawing; gesture; keyword. Pamela chose to work on: \"let the conversation continue (for further for clues/so Stuart can use strategies)\"; \"carry on if you have understood (it does not need to be perfect)\"; \"paraphrase\" what you think Stuart said/meant. In common with Graham and Alex, a key conversational barrier discussed with this dyad was Pamela's use of test questions.\n\n【24】Results \n=======\n\n【25】We predicted that there would be an increase in behaviours targeted as helpful in conversation (facilitators) and a decrease in behaviours deemed unhelpful (barriers). Here we present results of statistical analysis of strategies chosen by the PWA and by the CP (deemed facilitatory behaviours), and CP barriers, for six pre- and six post-therapy conversation samples, to identify whether therapy had a significant effect on conversation. This section is followed by a qualitative analysis of conversation extracts that explores how the turns taken by the PWA and CP changed after therapy.\n\n【26】Quantitative results: conversation change after therapy \n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】### Graham and Alex \n\n【28】 summarises the effects of therapy on targeted facilitators and barriers for Graham and Alex.

(Note that there were no counts of drawing in pre- or post-therapy samples, so the result applies only to writing). As  shows, there were no counts of writing in pre-therapy samples, thus the result for writing appears to reflect adoption of a new strategy. However, the counts for mime and keywords reveal that Graham was making some use of both before therapy, so the results reflect increased use of these behaviours, rather than adoption of new strategies. For Alex, the CP, there was no significant effect of therapy on strategies that he chose to work on: Poisson trend for frequencies (1-tailed), \"let the conversation continue\" (z = −0.22, ns), \"carry on if you have understood\" (z = −0.43, ns), \"comment\" (z = 0.00, ns). For each strategy, the numerical data for pre-therapy and post-therapy total counts are stable, as are the means. However, there was a significant result for test questions, a barrier behaviour in Alex's conversations that was targeted for reduction: Poisson trend for frequencies (1-tailed) test questions (z = −4.74, p \\< .0001). Thus, for Alex, behaviour change as a result of therapy constituted the reduction (almost the eradication) of a barrier conversation behaviour (asking test questions), but there was no corresponding increase in his three chosen strategies, which remained at pre-therapy levels.\n\n【30】### Stuart and Pamela \n\n【31】 summarises the effects of therapy on targeted facilitators and barriers for Stuart and Pamela.

Note that there were no counts of drawing in pre- or post-therapy samples. However, therapy did have a significant effect on Pamela's use of test questions: Poisson trend for frequencies (1-tailed), test questions (z = −6.18, p \\< .0001). Thus, for Pamela (as for Alex), behaviour change as a result of therapy constituted the reduction of a barrier conversation behaviour (in fact, test questions were almost eradicated), but there was no corresponding increase in her three chosen strategies; these remained relatively stable as the means per sample before and after therapy illustrate. In the case of Stuart, therapy had no statistically significant effect on his chosen strategies; however, numerically, keywords showed a slight increase, from a pre-therapy mean of 2.5 per sample to a post-therapy mean of 3.8 per sample. In contrast, gesture showed a numerical decrease (pre-therapy mean = 7.5, post-therapy mean = 5.2) and writing remained relatively stable (pre-therapy mean = 1.7, post-therapy mean = 1.3). All Stuart's chosen strategies were in use before the therapy began.\n\n【33】In summary, after therapy, Alex and Pamela (the CPs) almost eradicated test questions from their talk; however, use of chosen strategies remained at pre-therapy levels. Whilst Graham used significantly more of his chosen strategies (writing, mime, keyword), Stuart's use of strategies (writing, gesture, keyword) showed no significant change compared with pre-therapy levels (a numerical increase in keywords did not reach significance).\n\n【34】Qualitative analysis: the impact of barriers and strategies in conversation \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】To shed some light on these results, it is helpful to perform a qualitative exploration of the data using CA. The analysis that follows is divided into two sections, the first explores the form and impact of test question sequences in pre-therapy conversations, the second explores the opportunity for PWA strategy use when such questioning by the CP is reduced.\n\n【36】### Test questions: PWA turns highly constrained by prior sequential context \n\n【37】Test questions are typically a feature of pedagogic interactions, and they set up a context in which the addressee is expected to provide a very specific known answer, commonly a noun or a noun phrase. This clearly sets up a difficult interactional task for any PWA, given the persistent word finding difficulties associated with all types of aphasia. The literature reveals the social and emotional impact of test questions in aphasic conversation to be variable. Sometimes they can be a positive method of promoting language use (Aaltonen & Laakso, Bauer & Kulke, ) and, in other instances, a behaviour that engenders a threat to face, arouses frustration and even distress . See Beeke et al.  for more detailed discussion of the interactional motivations behind test question sequences.\n\n【38】Extracts 1 and 2 have been chosen to illustrate the form that test question sequences commonly took in pre-therapy talk for these two dyads and to highlight their impact on the turns of Graham and Stuart, respectively. Extract 1: D4C2i Anne's birthday Alex and Graham decide they will talk about what they have been doing during the week by going through the diary, which Alex is holding. After Alex mentions doing some gardening, Graham says a friend's name (line 01).01Grahamerm (1.2) Anne?02Alexmhm  for her what03Grahambirthday04Alexyeah (0.4) what did you think of that05Graham⌈(2.8) ⌉ yeah, mm (1.2) uh⌊((Graham grimaces)) ⌋06 ⌈no⌊((Graham grimaces, small head shake))07Alexwhat didn't you like08Graham(2.5) erm (5.8)09Alexyou went in (0.5) yeah?

The first is seen in line 02, where Alex asks Graham to say why they saw Anne (\"for her what\"); since Alex and Graham both participated in the event involving Anne, we surmise that Alex knows the answer to his question. Graham's response is highly constrained by the test question formulation---it must consist of a noun to stand in the place of the word \"what\" in Alex's question. Graham produces \"birthday\", and Alex's evaluation of this as an acceptable answer (\"yeah\", line 04) provides further evidence that this is a \"test\" sequence. Then Alex makes a genuine request for Graham's opinion about the birthday party (\"what did you think of that\", line 04), but as the talk progresses, Alex's subsequent turns suggest that he already knows that Graham did not enjoy it, and he may also know why. Although it is difficult to know if \"what didn't you like\" (line 07) is a genuine question, \"what was difficult about the night\" (line 15) appears to be designed to prompt mention of a specific negative issue already known to them both. This is suggested by Alex's verbal and gestural cueing behaviour in line 17; he says \"the nuh\" while touching his ear. At this point in the sequence, his turn could be designed to offer a guess, marked with rising intonation, for Grahame to accept or reject, in order to help move the conversation along. However, this is not what Alex does; he provides a cue to elicit a specific word, \"noise\", in answer to his question. Graham encounters severe difficulty when attempting to answer these questions. His responses consist of fillers and long pauses (lines 08 and 16), and his turns remain incomplete. He does appear to have some success responding to Alex's prompt in line 11, a gestural cue to name a drink, producing syllables unintelligible to the analyst (line 12) but apparently understood by Alex, who responds \"yeah\" (line 13). Having ignored Alex's cue for the word \"noise\" in line 17, Graham goes on to mention other things, some of them unintelligible (line 20) before describing the noise in his own way, by gesturing \"chatter\" and mimicking the sound of talking (\"(but) eh = and bay ay ay ay ay- oh god!\", line 22). Alex appears to attempt one further elicitation of the reason why the night out was difficult, saying \"because.\" (line 25) and repeating the gesture of touching his ear that was seen in line 17, but Graham is unable to respond. In the end, it is Alex who voices the reason, saying \"to hear people was hard\" (line 27), to which Graham responds \"yeah.yeah\" (lines 28 and 30). This sequence is representative of Alex and Graham's pre-therapy exchanges. It is notable that Graham has severe difficulty in producing answers constrained by test questions, yet does appear to be able to talk more freely when not required to produce such specific turns; compare direct attempts to answer test questions in lines 08 and 16 with turns in lines 18, 20, and 22. Although the impact of test questions on Graham's turns appears problematic, such sequences are often collaborative, and there is little sign of negative emotion. Interestingly, when asked in therapy session 5 how he feels about Alex asking test questions, Graham rolls his eyes and shows quite plainly that it annoys him.\n\n【40】However, some people with aphasia, like Stuart, appear in their conversations to be frustrated and upset by being asked test questions. Extract 2 has been chosen to illustrate the common pattern of test questions in Stuart's and Pamela's conversations before therapy. In this extract, their 12-year-old son, Graham, is present. Extract 2: D8C7 where did you go this morning Pamela, Stuart and their 12 year old son Graham are eating around the table. Prior to this exchange, Stuart started singing and was told to talk instead.01Pamelawhere did you go this morning?02Stuart⌈(0.6) ⌉⌊((Stuart looks at Pamela)) ⌋03Grahamdon't panic04Stuart⌈(0.8) ⌉⌊((Stuart nods at Graham)) ⌋05PamelaMr Mainwaring06Grahamhehe=07Pamela=hehe=08Graham=you always say that09Stuart⌈(3.0) ⌉ ⌈right ⌉⌊((Stuart opens and closes mouth)) ⌋ ⌊((points upwards then puts hand on hip)) ⌋10 ⌈(3.4) ⌉ yep⌊((looks into space, opens and closes mouth)) ⌋11Pamelawhere did you [go] this morning?12Stuart⌈(3.1) ⌉⌊((Stuart skywrites letter W)) ⌋13Grahamoh you can hear the fair14Stuart⌈(3.4) ⌉⌊((Stuart puts hand on hip and looks at Graham in annoyance)) ⌋15 ⌈(sedskai) gardens ⌉⌊((looks at Pamela)) ⌋16Pamela(0.7) [where] did you go though?17Stuart⌈(3.2) ⌉⌊((Stuart looks down and puts arm heavily on table)) ⌋18Pamela⌈where did you go ⌉ and you had a cup of tea, where did you go=⌊((Stuart sighs heavily)) ⌋19Stuart=⌈yeah ⌉⌊((Stuart scratches head and looks away)) ⌋20 ⌈(9.2) ⌉⌊((Stuart continues to look away, then down at table, holds head)) ⌋21Pamelado you know?22 ⌈(6.1) ⌉⌊((Stuart eats a mouthful of food, then looks at Pamela)) ⌋23Pamelatry and think of it while you24Stuartyeah25Pamelayou went over thu-26Stuart⌈(3.1) ⌉⌊((Stuart looks into space, then at Pamela)) ⌋27Grahamthe28Pameladon't give him ⌈any anymore clues because it's cheating then29Stuart⌊park?30Pamelayou didn't get that because we gave you a clue\n\n【41】This extract opens with Pamela asking a question, \"where did you go this morning?\". As the sequence progresses, it becomes clear that this something she already knows and that Stuart is required to say the \"correct\" word rather than talk about his day. The son's comment \"don't panic\" (line 03) reinforces the sense that Stuart is being tested and leads to a humorous aside between mother and son, centred on a catchphrase from a television programme (\"don't panic Mr Mainwaring\"), while they wait for Stuart to respond (lines 03--08). Stuart recognises that an answer is required; lines 09 and 10 show signs of word search behaviour including pausing, mouth movements, gazing to the middle distance and fillers. Pamela then repeats her question, this time stressing the word \"go\", marked by underlining in the transcript (line 11). Stuart writes the letter W in the air (line 12), but this strategy goes unnoticed, and Graham comments about being able to hear the fair outside their house. Stuart's body language suggests a negative reaction to this interruption (line 14). In the next turn, Stuart manages to give a spoken but only partially intelligible response (\"(sedskai) gardens\", line 15). However, Pamela's response (\"where did you go, though\", line 16), delivered after a 0.7 s pause, appears to indicate that it is not the answer she is looking for. Stuart looks down, drops his arm onto the table top and sighs heavily. Pamela asks again, and Stuart continues to have severe difficulty formulating an answer (lines 19--20). There is a 9.2 s pause, at the end of which he holds his head in his hand. It is unclear whether he will make any further attempt to respond. Recognising this, Pamela gives him the option to stop, asking \"do you know?\" (line 21), and Stuart resumes eating. She then encourages him to think while he eats. Next, she attempts to cue him by starting a turn for him to complete with a noun, \"you went over thu-\" (line 25). A 3.1 s pause follows during which Stuart gazes to the middle distance and then at Pamela. In response, Graham produces the determiner in full, saying \"the\" (line 27). Pamela's reaction is to tell her son not to \"give any more clues because it's cheating then\" (line 28), making explicit the interactional \"rules\" that are in play during this test question sequence. In overlap, Stuart tentatively offers the word \"park?\" (line 29). Pamela's turn in line 30, \"you didn't get that because we gave you a clue\", suggests that Stuart has now produced the required response however, and this is not acknowledged directly; she voices a view that the \"test\" was not valid because they gave him a clue.\n\n【42】As Extracts 1 and 2 show, test question sequences constrain Graham's and Stuart's turn constructions; they are required to answer questions typically by producing nouns, and as a result, their turns display severe word search behaviours and often remain incomplete. After therapy, the quantitative findings reveal a significant decrease in both CPs' test questions. This change leads to less constraint on what type of turn the PWA has an opportunity to produce, and the next section explores what effect this opening up of the turn space has on Graham's and Stuart's turns.\n\n【43】### An opportunity for PWA strategy use when the turn space is opened up \n\n【44】Extracts 3 and 4 have been chosen as representative examples of post-therapy sequences of talk, where Graham and Stuart can be seen to construct turns that reach completion and are much less problematic to produce than those seen in Extracts 1 and 2. These turns are produced in the context of Alex and Pamela taking types of turns other than test questions. Extract 3: D4C17 Lauren Graham and Alex are sitting at a table. Graham has the diary and a notepad and pen in front of him, from which he has torn out a page which appears to be a list of things to do. They are discussing things on the list.01Alex⌈and what else is on there⌊((looking over at and pointing to an item on Graham's list))02Graham(1.2) si- si- ⌈(susums)⌊((points at same item on list))03Alexoh yeah cos we have to- (0.3) give them identification about- for you04Grahamyeah erm ⌈(3.5)⌊((Graham looks down at list))05 ⌈(14.5)∣((Graham picks up pen, writes, when finished puts down pen and looks at Alex))⌊((Alex watches Graham write))06Alexis that ⌈London⌊((looks up from watching what Graham has written))07Graham⌈(lunuh)⌊((Graham points to what he has written))08AlexLauren09Grahamyeah10Alexfor the will as well11Grahamyeah12Alexoh yeah13 (1.0)14Alex(if y-) phone her u- WELL we should dig it out (0.3)15Alex⌈and then make the ch- copy it make ⌈changes⌉  ⌊((Alex mimes writing in the air))⌋ ⌊((Graham nods))16 I'm happy to take in=she might just do it by post17 (0.3)18Grahammm19Alexbut we'll need to like work out who  what and all that (0.8) beforehand20 (5.3)21Alexdid you want that done before we go away22Grahamyeah23Alex⌈(0.4) sensible ⌊((nods))\n\n【45】In this extract, Graham and Alex are discussing an item on their \"to do\" list, which possibly relates to legal issues (identification documents, Graham's will); although it is not entirely clear what is being talked about (in part because Graham's identification of a key referent is distorted by dyspraxia), the speakers appear to understand each other fully. When asked by Alex about an item on the list, Graham verbalises a name that sounds like \"susums\" (line 02). Alex's response is quick and makes apparent his understanding not only of the referent but also of what has to be done \".we have to give them identification.for you\" (line 03). Graham agrees and then begins a word search, saying \"erm\" and looking down at his list for 3.5 s. Subsequently, he picks up a pen and begins writing for 14.5 s (line 05), during which time Alex watches. When Graham puts the pen down, Alex asks for clarification of what he has written, saying \"is that London\" (line 06). In response, Graham offers what appears to be a correction (\"(lunuh)\", line 07); his production of the word is distorted by dyspraxia but Alex understands it to be \"Lauren\" (line 08), which Graham accepts. Alex then shows his understanding of how this referent links to the topic of talk, saying \"for the will as well\" (line 10). They then go on to have a discussion about how best to change the will, and when. By using his chosen strategy of writing, Graham is able to circumvent his severe word finding difficulties to take a turn that extends the current topic and launches discussion about an issue of importance to him. It is notable that before therapy, Graham did not write to circumvent his word finding problems---there were no examples of writing in pre-therapy samples 删除21:<u></u>. In addition, this extract shows how Alex's turns differ from pre-therapy test questions. Here he is commenting and offering his opinion (lines 03, 10, 14--16, 19, and 23), and when he does ask a question, it is one to which he genuinely does not appear to know the answer (\"did you want that done before we go away\", line 21). Arguably, Alex has the option to take turns like this precisely because Graham has been able to influence the conversation by introducing new referents and generally taking a more active role. The quantitative findings reveal no significant change in Alex's use of his chosen strategies (one of which was commenting), which implies that he is doing no more commenting than he was before therapy. And yet he is using significantly fewer test questions. Qualitatively, it appears that he is commenting, offering his opinion and asking genuine questions. Extract 4: D8C13 mini convertible Pamela, Stuart and their 12-year-old son Graham are talking about Stuart's outing with his friend Sonny earlier in the day.01Pameladid Sonny have his mini?02Stuartyeah03Pamelahe took him in a mini convertible \\[said to Graham\\]04Stuartyeah HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH05Pamelaohhhh you poser you!06Stuart⌈yes indeed!⌊((salutes))07Pamelawhere was you in the front?08Stuartwell er d'you know what I'm saying09Pamelawhere was you sitting10Stuartyeah yeah11Pamelain the front12Stuartyeah\\[5 lines between Graham and Pamela about who owns the car omitted\\]13Pamelaand Jane was in the back14Stuartyeah15 (2.0)16PamelaI don't know17StuartI don't know\\[10 lines about a phone call between Pamela and Sonny omitted\\]18Pamelaoh so you was posing ⌈were you19Stuart⌊I know20Pamelaeh?  in your  in his mini convertible=what- I've forgotten what colour it is21Stuartyeah erm (0.5) ⌈blue,22Graham⌊is it white?23Stuart⌈eh no, ⌉⌊((Stuart holds hand up))⌋24Graham⌈because normally th- there's mini- white mini⌊((Stuart puts hand on hip, looks down at table top))25 con⌈vertibles26Stuart∣WHITE!⌊((Stuart looks up at Pamela and sky-writes letter W))27 ⌈erm ⌉ (0.3) white a⌈nd⌊((moves index finger up and down in the air))28Pamela⌊oh it's white ⌋29Graham⌊green30Stuart⌈no ⌉⌊((Stuart shakes head))⌋31Pamela⌈Graham! let him say⌈it himself⌊((Stuart moves hand in dismissive action, looks down at table, drops hand))32Graham⌊don't worry I'm not gonna-33Stuart⌈(0.2) ⌈black ⌈ black=⌊((Stuart raises arm))⌊((sky-writes letter B))34Graham⌊black35Pamela=(what) black and ⌈white! ⌉36Stuart⌊((Stuart does thumbs up to Pamela))⌋ exactly\n\n【46】In this extract Pamela asks Stuart about his trip out with Sonny earlier that day. Although Pamela still asks Stuart questions, there is a marked contrast with pre-therapy talk as exemplified in Extract 2. Rather than prompting Stuart to name referents that are already shared knowledge (where he went and with whom), Pamela instead asks about details that she does not appear to know, such as what car they went in and where Stuart sat. Importantly, she also takes different kinds of turns to those seen pre-therapy, creating humour with \"ohh you poser you!\" (line 05) and \"I don't know\" (line 16), said with mock despair. By constructing turns that express her opinions, rather than asking test questions, she succeeds in collaborating with Stuart to create a light-hearted exchange, which both of them appear to enjoy. Thus, although the quantitative findings reveal no significant change in Pamela's use of her chosen strategies, there appear to be qualitative changes in her post-therapy turn types. In line 20, she asks Stuart to tell her what colour the car is, a question that bears a resemblance to those seen in their pre-therapy conversations. Interestingly, she begins a direct question, saying \"what\", but immediately reformulates it into a statement that focuses on her own failings, \"I've forgotten what colour it is\". The fact that we cannot tell from the sequence of turns if she knows the colour of the car, and thus whether this is a test question, is testament to the subtlety of her interactional behaviour here. Her question casts Stuart in the role of knowing the answer, rather than being \"tested\". One final turn of interest is line 31 where Pamela asks their son to stop interrupting Stuart. This suggests a shift from pre-therapy conversation dynamics in which Pamela and Graham collaboratively prompted Stuart to talk. For his part, Stuart succeeds in providing the answer over lines 21--36, in collaboration with Pamela and Graham. Some of Stuart's turns appear to be constructed using similar strategies as those used before therapy, namely keywords and writing letters in the air. However, in this post-therapy extract, Stuart makes more effective use of these strategies, in part because Pamela appears to treat his sky writing as part of his turn (compare this with Extract 2 line 12 where sky writing is ignored). Thus, he perseveres with a self repair to successfully identify the car as \"white and. black\" (lines 27 and 33). In addition, Stuart takes very different kinds of turns to those seen in Extract 2. He deploys stereotyped phrases such as \"yes indeed\" (line 06), \"d'you know what I'm saying\" (line 08), \"I don't know\" (line 17) and \"I know\" (line 19) to great conversational effect, allowing him to collaborate with Pamela to create a humorous story about his day out.\n\n【47】Discussion and clinical implications \n====================================\n\n【48】This article reports the quantitative and qualitative therapy outcomes of conversation training for two dyads where one speaker has agrammatic aphasia. The quantitative results reveal that therapy had a significant effect on both speakers of one dyad, Alex (CP) and Graham (PWA), but only on the CP of the other dyad, Pamela, and not on Stuart (PWA). Thus, Alex almost eradicated test questions from his talk after therapy, having identified this as a barrier behaviour that he wished to change. Qualitative analysis showed that Alex was taking facilitative turn types (such as commenting and asking genuine questions) after therapy; however, the quantitative analysis revealed no significant increase in the specific strategies that he chose to target (\"let the conversation continue\", \"carry on if you have understood\", \"comment\"); commenting was present in pre-therapy samples. Graham, his CP with aphasia, used significantly more of the strategies he chose to practise during therapy (writing, mime, keywords).\n\n【49】While Pamela too almost eradicated test questions from her talk after therapy, she did not significantly increase her use of chosen strategies (\"let the conversation continue\", \"carry on if you have understood\", \"paraphrase\"), though qualitative changes were noted. Post-therapy turns expressed her opinions, and questions appeared to arise from a genuine lack of knowledge. There was no significant change in strategy use (writing, gesture, keyword) for her CP with aphasia, Stuart, although a numerical increase in keywords was noted. These findings strengthen the evidence base for the success of conversation therapy in changing the behaviours of CPs and also add quantitative evidence to the growing case for the effectiveness of direct conversation training for some people with aphasia.\n\n【50】With both CPs asking significantly fewer test questions, the post-therapy conversational context for both PWAs changed. They were presented with an opportunity to take turns that were less constrained; they were no longer frequently being selected by the CP to produce a specific (and often known) answer. In this relatively open post-therapy turn space, both increased their use of keywords, but this only reached statistical significance for Graham. Graham also increased his use of writing and mime, yet Stuart showed no change in his use of writing and, indeed numerically, gestures reduced. So we might ask why Stuart was less able to take advantage of the changed interactional context in his conversations with Pamela and was less able to deploy the strategies he practised during therapy. One reason appears to be his pattern of language impairments. As  shows, Stuart scored zero on the PALPA written picture naming test (Kay, Lesser, & Coltheart, ). (Graham scored 13/30 on the same test.) In conversation, we see Stuart successfully writing the first letter of a word in the air , but he does not attempt to spell out more of the word and never resorts to pen and paper. So it appears that, for Stuart, the potential of writing as a strategy to aid conversation is limited by his aphasia. However, for Graham, this strategy appears much more functional, as reflected in his increased use of writing after therapy and the success with which he and Alex collaborate to make use of it in their conversations. It is less clear why Stuart appeared to be using fewer gestures after therapy, despite choosing this as another of his strategies to practise. It might be that, before therapy, when required to produce a specific, concrete noun in response to a test question, Stuart was facilitated to produce a gesture instead of or alongside the lexical item required in his answer. After therapy, it seems possible that the opportunity to take a range of different turn types may have adversely influenced gesture use. With impaired non-verbal semantics---he scored 44/52 on the Pyramids and Palmtrees Test (Howard & Patterson, )---the semantic constraint imposed by a test question may have aided his production of gesture. Qualitative analysis of the context of gesture use in conversations before and after therapy is required to further explore this idea.\n\n【51】If, as it appears, the extent and pattern of language deficit has an impact on a PWA's ability to learn to deploy conversational strategies successfully, we may need to reconsider the conversation therapy goal setting process. When working with a CP on conversation training, it is common for the SLT to facilitate the CP to choose his or her own strategies, as it is felt that this has a beneficial effect on motivation to change behaviour. However, transferring this goal setting technique to direct work with a PWA appears to raise additional challenges, in that he or she may choose a strategy that has limited use, given his or her aphasic deficits.\n\n【52】It is interesting to note that, although both CPs reduced their use of test questions, neither significantly increased the use of their strategies chosen to enhance conversation. For Pamela, qualitative analysis revealed the use of different types of turns after therapy (genuine questions, opinions), whereas Alex continued to comment, as he had been doing before therapy. Therapy aimed to reduce barrier behaviours such as test questions indirectly: it was hypothesised that such barriers would fall away as other positive conversational behaviours came online. However, this does not appear to be the mechanism for behaviour change that operated for Alex or for Pamela. Intuitively, it seems possible that stopping oneself from engaging in negative behaviours might be easier than learning to systematically use positive ones (consider not eating chocolate versus remembering to incorporate more fibre into your diet, for example). Perhaps a single, very distinctive, conversational barrier can be avoided with relative ease once one has insight into its negative effects, yet more complex behaviour change is required to deploy a facilitative strategy in an appropriate interactional context. This idea clearly has important implications for how SLTs might guide the goal setting process and deliver conversation therapy. Research into behaviour change mechanisms in conversation therapy is currently under way by the authors, led by Johnson.\n\n【53】Finally, it is recognised that stability of interactional behaviours may vary naturally, both within a conversational sample and over time (Perkins, Crisp, & Walshaw, ). This study has attempted to mitigate for within-participant variation by measuring behaviours across multiple baselines as advised by Perkins et al. analysing six pre- and six post-therapy 5 min conversation samples in total. The extensive sampling of conversation provides a rich source to analyse for quantitative and qualitative explanations of behaviour change after conversation therapy, and as our analysis expands to include additional dyads, the number of repeat recordings will continue to help us answer questions about stability of strategies used.\n\n【54】Conclusions \n===========\n\n【55】In this article, quantitative and qualitative analyses of pre- and post-therapy conversations between two dyads have been presented and discussed to illustrate not only whether but how conversation therapy might achieve behaviour change in a CP and in a PWA. Both dyads show evidence that collaborative work between an SLT, PWA, and CP can produce tangible improvement in conversational exchanges in the chronic stage of aphasia. Certain aspects of conversation (both positive and negative) captured by video were highlighted by the SLT for discussion, then the dyads selected and practised strategies to enhance their communication. A quantitative analysis of barriers and strategies across pre- and post-therapy conversation samples, combined with a qualitative analysis of interaction, revealed that the same change in conversational behaviour of two CPs (significant reduction in test questions) went hand in hand with a different outcome for each CP's respective PWA; the combination of strategies that work for one dyad may not work for another. Questions have been raised about what types of behaviour may be more amenable to change and the effect of a PWA's language deficit. Once the data from all eight dyads have been analysed, conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention will be reconsidered in the light of variation of language profiles and other variables recorded in this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Synchrotron X-ray scattering and electron microscopy of taxol-induced microtubules assembled from purified tubulin in comparison with glycerol and MAP-induced microtubules.\nThe structure of microtubules has been characterized to 3 nm resolution employing time-resolved X-ray scattering. This has revealed detailed structural features of microtubules not observed before in solution. The polymerization of highly purified tubulin, induced by the antitumour drug taxol, has been employed as a microtubule model system. This assembly reaction requires Mg2+, is optimal at a 1:1 taxol to tubulin heterodimer molar ratio, proceeds with GTP or GDP and is intrinsically reversible. The X-ray scattering profiles are consistent with identical non-globular alpha and beta-tubulin monomers ordered within the known helical surface lattice of microtubules. Purified tubulin-taxol microtubules have a smaller mean diameter (approx. 22 nm) than those induced by microtubule associated proteins or glycerol (approx. 24 nm), but nearly identical wall substructure to the resolution of the measurements. This is because the majority of the former consist of only 12 protofilaments instead of the typical 13 protofilaments, as confirmed by electron microscopy of thin-sectioned, negatively stained and ice-embedded taxol microtubules. It may be concluded that taxol induces a slight reduction of the lateral contact curvature between tubulin monomers. The main fringe pattern observed in cryo-electron micrographs is consistent with a simple 12 protofilament 3-start skewed lattice model. Cylindrical closure of this lattice can be achieved by tilting the lattice 0.8 degrees with respect to the microtubule axis. The closure implies a discontinuity in the type of lateral contacts between the tubulin monomers (regardless of whether these are of the -alpha-beta- or the -alpha-alpha-/-beta-beta- type), which indicates that lateral contacts and the subunit specificity of taxol binding are, to a large degree, equivalent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "55411ecc-7beb-4349-98b2-48f3aa9aca90", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background \n==========\n\n【1】In 1969, Weil and Shubin emphasized the importance of fluid resuscitation followed by cardiovascular support with vasoactive agents for the treatment of shock . This strategy is still the mainstay of management of septic shock today . The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend initial resuscitation by fluid administration, at least with 30 ml/kg of crystalloids, followed by use of vasoactive agent such as norepinephrine for the treatment of patients with septic shock . Hypotenison can be defined as a systolic arterial pressure \\<90 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) \\<65 mmHg or a decrease in MAP \\>40 mmHg in a previously hypertensive patient .\n\n【2】Although this strategy has been well established, blood pressure target in septic shock patients remains a subject of ongoing controversy. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend MAP target of 65 mmHg as a starting point , but this recommendation is based on limited evidence. The guidelines caution that the MAP target should be individualized because older patients with atherosclerosis or previous hypertension, for example, may have a higher optimal MAP than younger patients without any cardiovascular conditions.\n\n【3】In 2004, Asfar et al. conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, prospective study involving 776 septic shock patients in French intensive care units (ICU) . The study confirmed that targeting an MAP of 65--70 mmHg in a patient without prior chronic hypertension was a reasonable first approximation. In a patient with a history of chronic hypertension, however, targeting an MAP of 80--85 mmHg was associated with lower incidences of AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy. Although patients with chronic hypertension benefited from this higher MAP target, it was associated with higher incidences of adverse events such as tachyarrhythmia, presumably because higher doses and duration of vasopressors were necessary.\n\n【4】Taken together, the available evidence underscores the importance of personalizing the MAP target based on clinical responses of individual patients with septic shock. Heterogeneity, not only of patients, but their individual organs and microcirculation  makes uniform approach to septic shock particularly difficult. The aim of this review, therefore, is to provide some guidance on how to personalize management of blood pressure in patients with septic shock. We reviewed the existing literatures using both PubMed and Google Scholar search engines for the primary search terms: arterial blood pressure, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, perfusion pressure, critical closing pressure and autoregulation. We then expanded our search as linked citations indicated. We limited these searches to studies on adult patients published in English.\n\n【5】Review \n======\n\n【6】Pathophysiology \n---------------\n\n【7】Humans, like other warm-blooded animals, maintain relatively high blood pressure at the expense of its multiple potentially negative consequences, such as myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, aneurysm or chronic kidney disease. This is because high blood pressure is necessary to allow autoregulation of organ blood flow to occur.\n\n【8】Autoregulation is defined as the intrinsic ability of organs to maintain a constant blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure . Since organs autoregulate their blood flow to meet their metabolic demands, this dissociation between pressure and flow seems reasonable. Organ blood flow and cardiac output (CO) are usually independent of arterial blood pressure except under extreme hypo- and hypertension.\n\n【9】Organs can increase their own individual blood flow to meet their changing metabolic demands primarily by decreasing resistance, or vasodilation. Accordingly, both inflow pressure and intra-organ inflow resistance at the baseline must be sufficiently high to leave sufficient room for autoregulation of organ blood flow to occur. As a corollary, hypotension alone impairs local autoregulation independent of other factors like vasomotor tone and vascular responsiveness because without a sufficiently high inflow pressure, changes in local vascular resistance will not result in changes in local blood flow.\n\n【10】Organ perfusion pressure is the difference between the inflow pressure and outflow pressure. In a totally vasodilated vasculature, outflow pressure approximates local venous pressure. Inflow and outflow pressures differ across vascular beds and can be altered by various diseases 删除21:<u></u>. Although MAP is usually considered to be the inflow pressure, actual arterial inflow pressure varies greatly across organs. For example, arterial inflow pressure at porta hepatis is about 10--30 mmHg lower than MAP because of high hepatic arterial resistance. Similarly, renal perfusion pressure of the post-glomerular tubules is much lower than MAP and varies greatly based on solute load. Outflow pressure is not uniform across organs either. Global renal perfusion pressure, which is the difference between MAP and central venous pressure (CVP), becomes the difference between MAP and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) when IAP is elevated, such as in intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome.Table 1Perfusion pressure for different organsOrgansInflow pressureOutflow pressure (whichever is higher)Perfusion pressureBrainMAPCVP or intracranial pressure (ICP)MAP---CVP or ICPHeartDiastolic BPCVP or intrathoracic pressure (ITP)Diastolic BP---CVP or ITPKidneyMAPCVP or intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)MAP---CVP or IAPBowelMAPCVP or intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)MAP---CVP or IAPMAP mean arterial pressure, BP blood pressure, CVP central venous pressure\n\n【11】Under normal conditions, distribution of organ blood flow is determined by local metabolic demands. For example, cerebral blood flow increases in the cortex when the mind is actively thinking , and splanchnic blood flow at the site of peristalsis and absorption increases after a meal . Actively metabolizing tissues are thought to increase blood flow by releasing vasoactive substances such as adenosine, a potent vasodilator . In contrast, under hypotensive conditions, organ blood flow is no longer determined by local metabolic demands, but is redistributed according to each organ's pressure--flow relationship under maximally vasodilated conditions.\n\n【12】This is because autoregulation, though central for normal blood flow homeostasis, is overruled in circulatory shock where baroreceptor-induced hypotension induces profound sympathetic nervous system output. Thus, in circulatory shock, sympathetic-induced vasoconstriction, not the metabolic-related vasoconstriction, becomes the primary determinant of organ blood flow distribution. The massive sympathetic discharge causes α-adrenergic receptor-based vascular vasoconstriction to occur as a function of the amount of vascular α-adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness of a given vascular region. Skin and skeletal muscle have large concentrations of α-adrenergic receptors and constrict markedly in response to circulatory shock. The gut has less α-adrenergic receptors and the kidneys lesser still. Importantly, the heart has minimal α-adrenergic receptors and the cerebral circulation none. Therefore, in case of severe systemic hypotension, organ blood flow will be diverted away from the skin, non-exercising skeletal muscles and splanchnic viscera to support the brain, heart and kidney blood flow . This redistribution of blood flow not only ensures adequate blood flow to these critical organs, but also increases the net efficiency of O~2~ utilization of a whole body . Importantly, during septic shock, adrenergic hypo-responsiveness often occurs owing to internalization of adrenergic receptors and inflammatory mediator-induced release of potent vasoactive agents (e.g. nitric oxide). The resultant combination of systemic hypotension and vasoplegia blunts the normal redistribution of blood flow usually seen in circulatory shock and markedly limits the host's ability to sustain the vital organ blood flow. If the perfusion pressure falls below the autoregulation threshold where blood vessels are already maximally dilated, organ blood flow will decrease linearly to declines in perfusion pressure.\n\n【13】Under normal conditions, if inflow pressure were to be abruptly decreased, organ blood flow would also decrease and then cease at an inflow pressure higher than outflow venous pressure. This organ-specific stop-flow pressure is called critical closing pressure (Pcc) and it was first proposed by Burton . Pcc is generated by vasomotor tone of arterioles and pre-capillary sphincters. As a lump sum, Pcc is thought to be around 45 mmHg in normal healthy adults , but it can vary among vascular beds dependent upon the overall sympathetic tone and local metabolic demands. As local vasodilation increases, Pcc decreases toward outflow pressure 删除21:<u></u>. Notably, in the heart, which is maximally extracting oxygen at all times, Pcc is only slightly higher than CVP and the primary way the coronary circulation can increase its flow is by vasodilation \\[--\\].Fig. 1Theoretical relationship between arterial input pressure (P) and blood flow (Q) for a given vascular bed or the entire body. The thick solid line represents the actual relationship between pressure and flow describing the autoregulation of vascular tone to sustain a constant blood flow despite varying arterial input pressures. The smaller straight lines reflect the theoretical instantaneous arterial input pressure to blood flow relations that exist upon this autoregulation curve showing how changes in vascular tone from maximal vasoconstriction (far left) to maximal vasodilation (far right) account for this phenomenon. Note the zero blood flow intercept points, or critical closing pressure of the arterial input circuit also varies with changes in vasomotor tone such that both slope (resistance) and zero-flow intercept (critical closing pressure) co-vary as local vasomotor tone varies\n\n【14】Under normal resting conditions, perfusion pressure is the difference between inflow pressure and Pcc, and outflow venous pressure does not influence organ blood flow . This phenomenon is called \"vascular waterfall.\" The principle of vascular waterfall is that flow over the edge of the waterfall is independent on how far the water then drops toward the pool below 删除21:<u></u>. Local tissue Pcc is analogous to the waterfall edge and central venous pressure (CVP) to the downstream pool, such that changes in CVP will have no impact on the flow or resistance. Therefore, while CVP is necessary in calculating organ perfusion pressure, CVP should not guide treatment decisions in patients with septic shock. Maas et al. confirmed the existence of a vascular waterfall by showing a significant difference between Pcc and mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) in post-cardiac surgery patients . This difference signified the height of vascular waterfall.Fig. 2Theoretical vascular pressure profile from aortic values through the circulation to the great veins. Note that mean arterial pressure (MAP) is constant for most of the length of the large arteries, because those vessels serve mainly as vascular capacitors holding stored blood under pressure. Whereas vascular pressure drops rapidly as blood traverses the smallest arteries, arteriole and precapillary sphincters. The point at which arterioles spontaneously collapse limiting arterial pressure drop is referred to as the critical closing pressure (Pcc) and approximates a vascular waterfall, in that water flowing over a waterfall is unaffected by how far it falls once over the edge. Thus, shown as a dashed line, the pressure fall from arterioles to venules; changes in the downstream venous pressure do not influence either arterial pressure or blood flow. While the mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf) represents the upstream pressure driving venous return against a downstream central venous pressure (CVP). These concepts were recently validated in post-operative humans where Pcc was estimated to be about 40 mmHg and Pmsf at 20 mmHg \n\n【15】It is critically important to identify patients whose perfusion pressure is below the autoregulation threshold because from the point downward, organ blood flow is usually inadequate and organ perfusion will solely depend on perfusion pressure. This is the rationale for using vasopressors to restore organ perfusion pressure during acute resuscitation in fluid resuscitated patients with septic shock. Regrettably, there is not one threshold MAP because each organ system has a different inflow and outflow pressures and internal control systems linked to their individual physiologic roles . For example, the kidney increases filtration as renal perfusion pressure increases because its role is to filter solute from the blood, whereas the liver maintains a relatively constant flow from the combined hepatic artery and portal vein so as to maintain hepatic clearance and metabolic functions.\n\n【16】Clinical evidence \n-----------------\n\n【17】Although the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend using vasopressor to support an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg followed by individualized titration , this recommendation was based on limited evidence. A retrospective cohort study by Varpula et al. showed that MAP below 65 mmHg, particularly during the first 48 h in the ICU, was associated with the highest mortality in patients with septic shock . Meanwhile, a small prospective study by LeDoux et al. showed no improvements in tissue perfusion by increasing MAP from 65 to 85 mmHg using norepinephrine , and a small randomized, open-label, prospective study by Bourgoin et al. also showed lack of any benefit by targeting an MAP higher than 65 mmHg .\n\n【18】Looking specifically at renal function, however, other studies found that targeting an MAP higher than 70 mmHg might be beneficial . Furthermore, in reality, the majority of critical care practitioners seemed to be targeting an MAP higher than 65 mmHg . Clearly, more studies were needed to determine the optimal MAP in patients with septic shock.\n\n【19】In this context, Asfar et al. conducted a multicenter, randomized, stratified, open-label study called the Assessment of Two Levels of Arterial Pressure on Survival in Patients with Septic Shock (SEPSISPAM) to determine whether targeting an MAP of 65--70 mmHg was more or less effective than targeting a higher MAP of 80--85 mmHg . Unfortunately, MAP values of the low-MAP target group usually ranged from 70 to 75 mmHg and rarely decreased toward the 65 mmHg minimal threshold. Still, the study showed that there was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 and at 90 days. For the patients with chronic hypertension, the low-MAP target group had a higher incidence of the doubling of creatinine level and the need for renal replacement therapy.\n\n【20】Importantly, targeting a higher MAP in all patients was not without risk. Although this study was underpowered to detect any differences in incidence of most of the adverse events, which were rare, the majority of adverse events (mainly tachyarrhythmias) were reported higher in the high-MAP target group who required higher infusion rates and duration of vasopressors .\n\n【21】The study supports the recommendation that targeting an initial MAP of 65--70 mmHg in a patient without prior chronic hypertension is a reasonable first approximation, after which time MAP levels should be adjusted up or down as end-organ function dictates. Whereas in the patient with chronic hypertension, targeting a higher MAP around 80--85 mmHg appears to be a reasonable first step, but it should be done with caution because of the potential risk of adverse events due to higher doses and duration of vasopressors that would be necessary. Although no study to date has shown the impact of the dose and duration of vasopressors on survival, studies have consistently shown the risk of adverse events due to vasopressor use, ranging from 10 to 12 % \\[--\\].\n\n【22】These findings underscore the importance of personalizing target MAP based on individual patient's clinical response. There is no \"one-size fits all\" when it comes to optimal MAP for septic shock patients. This may seem to be an obvious conclusion, since MAP is not organ perfusion pressure, as described above. In fact, organ perfusion pressure is highly heterogeneous, not only between patients, but also within the same patient over time and among their organs and microcirculation during the evolution of septic shock . This is what makes blood pressure management in septic shock, particularly challenging, requiring close bedside titration.\n\n【23】After the SEPSISPAM study was published, two review articles were published analyzing blood pressure targets for septic shock patients. Leone et al. reviewed 12 studies including 7 comparative studies that addressed different blood pressure goals on patient outcomes . They concluded that MAP target of 65 mmHg is usually sufficient in patients with septic shock, but MAP target of around 75--85 mmHg may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with chronic hypertension.\n\n【24】D'Aragon et al. also reviewed 12 studies including two randomized control studies, which were the SEPSISPAM study and a Czech study, and 10 crossover studies . They refrained from making any conclusions regarding optimal target blood pressure and commented instead on the paucity of clinical evidence to guide blood pressure management in septic shock patients. They were particularly concerned with prior studies for using limited types of vasopressors, potential inaccuracies on blood pressure measurements and titration of vasopressors based on endpoints other than blood pressure. Their concerns may be justified. Practitioners and researchers tend to disagree even on such a fundamental practice as measuring an MAP .\n\n【25】The issue of vasopressor choice needed to support a given target MAP is also relevant to this discussion. It had been suggested that dopamine might increase splanchnic blood flow in well-resuscitated patients with septic shock , but SOAP II study failed to show this . In that study, they compared dopamine to norepinephrine in the management of vasopressor-dependent septic shock. Although they showed no mortality difference between the two study arms, the group receiving dopamine had a higher rate of arrhythmias and many patients in that group also required supplemental norepinephrine to reach their target MAP goals. Based on these data, the authors and the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines both recommend norepinephrine as the vasopressor of choice. Likewise, it had been suggested that vasopressin might impair hepato-splanchnic blood flow . As such, VASST trial studied the addition of vasopressin to usual vasopressor management. They showed no differences in the rate of hepatic dysfunction or mesenteric ischemia . A smaller prospective randomized study even showed better splanchnic perfusion with vasopressin as compared to norepinephrine alone . Currently, another trial is underway, comparing vasopressin with or without corticosteroids to norepinephrine as the initial vasopressor in the management of patients with septic shock .\n\n【26】Meanwhile, it has been suggested that vasodilators such as prostacyclin may improve hepato-splanchnic circulation . In a small prospective study involving septic shock patients requiring norepinephrine to maintain MAP above 70 mmHg, prostacyclin (PGI~2~ or iloprost) infusion showed improvement in both cardiac output and hepato-splanchnic blood flow . Notably, the actual median MAP was around 80 mmHg in this study.\n\n【27】Organ-specific blood flow considerations \n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】### Brain \n\n【29】As early as the time of Hippocrates more than 2500 years ago, sepsis has been known to affect brain function . Sepsis-associated delirium is the most common brain dysfunction and it can be found in up to 70 % of septic patients . It is associated with a significant increase in mortality .\n\n【30】Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is defined as the difference between MAP and either CVP or intracranial pressure (ICP), whichever is higher. Under normal conditions, the brain maintains a high degree of autoregulation . Notably, in patients with preexisting cerebrovascular conditions such as chronic hypertension, the autoregulation threshold is shifted significantly to the right by as much as 20 mmHg 删除21:<u></u> .Fig. 3Theoretical relationship between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow using the same construct as in Fig. Here, the autoregulatory range for subjects without hypertension (normal patients) is in blue and that for patients with hypertension (hypertensive patients) is shown in gray. Note that the minimal CPP within the autoregulatory zone for normal is about 50 mmHg whereas for those with hypertension it is shifted rightward with CPP on the x-axis to 70 mmHg. Again the maximal vasoconstriction and vasodilation instantaneous CCP-cerebral blood flow relations for normal patients are shown as the light blue lines\n\n【31】A study using transcranial Doppler and near-infrared spectroscopy showed that cerebral autoregulation is disturbed in severe sepsis, presumably due to vascular endothelial dysfunction . Cerebral blood flow is also reduced in severe sepsis . Although its precise mechanism is yet to be understood, Pfister et al. demonstrated that sepsis-induced cerebral edema can increase ICP to more than 15 mmHg, resulting in CPP less than 60 mmHg .\n\n【32】There are no clinical studies looking specifically at optimal MAP for the brain in severe sepsis, but a growing body of evidence looking at the relationship between CPP and outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may prove helpful. Based on multiple indices such as brain tissue O~2~ saturation, jugular venous oxygen saturation, transcranial Doppler and cerebral microdialysis studies, autoregulation threshold for CPP is thought to be around 50--60 mmHg .\n\n【33】Accordingly, Brain Trauma Foundation recommends a target CPP between 50 and 70 mmHg . Within this range, however, results of the existing studies are conflicting. For example, one retrospective study involving 392 patients with severe brain injury showed the poor outcome associated with CPP below 60 mmHg , while another retrospective study involving 427 patients with severe head injury showed no benefit in keeping CPP above 60 mmHg .\n\n【34】One exciting development in the management of CPP in TBI patients is the emergence of autoregulation-based therapy using cerebrovascular reactivity, which can be determined by looking at response of ICP to changes in MAP . Loss of cerebrovascular reactivity is an independent predictor of fatal outcome following head injury . Using real-time measurements of pressure reactivity index, Steiner et al. found a target CPP in head injury patients to be between 60 and 85 mmHg . The autoregulation range of an individual patient is much narrower, however . Accordingly, the importance of titrating a target CPP based on pressure vascular reactivity index in individual TBI patients was suggested . A similar approach that targets autoregulation rather than an MAP may also be useful in septic shock patients.\n\n【35】### Heart \n\n【36】Sepsis-induced myocardial depression is common and it tends to appear later in the course of the disease. Initially, patients with severe sepsis present with reduced CO, despite the preserved left ventricular ejection fraction because stroke volume is reduced as a result of decreased preload and vasomotor tone . Both these processes cause venous return to the heart to markedly decrease. Volume resuscitation is critical in these patients and usually restores stroke volume to baseline and CO to baseline or even higher levels owing to a combined tachycardia and peripheral vasodilation.\n\n【37】Later in their course, typically within the first 72 h, 40--50 % of these patients develop myocardial depression . Their CO, however, is often increased because the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction is compensated by tachycardia and dilated ventricles . Sepsis-induced myocardial depression is reversible and full recovery of cardiac function is typically seen in survivors by 7--10 days .\n\n【38】Pathophysiology of sepsis-induced myocardial depression is complicated and involves various mechanisms, such as downregulation of β-adrenergic receptors, decreased sensitivity to calcium or increased nitric oxide production \\[, --\\]. Notably, ischemia is not one of the etiologies listed. Coronary blood flow is increased in severe sepsis and myocardial oxygen consumption appears to be adequate . Neither cellular hypoxia nor bioenergetics failure has been seen in a septic heart .\n\n【39】These findings led to a hypothesis that perhaps sepsis-induced myocardial depression is an adaptive response by which human heart attempt to prevent activation of cell death pathways and to allow full functional recovery by reducing energy expenditure .\n\n【40】If that would be the case, the best management of heart in sepsis may be to avoid further stresses on the heart. Interestingly, recent randomized control trial showed improved clinical outcome using β-blockers in septic shock patients . While its exact mechanism remains unknown, the trial showed that β-blockade could make the heart more efficient, as evidenced by improved stroke work index and left ventricular stroke work . This is an area of active clinical study.\n\n【41】### Kidneys \n\n【42】Renal function may be the most studied with regard to target blood pressure in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Early animal study by Robertson et al. had shown that autoregulation threshold of kidneys might be around 80 mmHg . At least two subsequent human studies seemed to confirm this by showing improved creatinine clearance in septic shock patients whose baseline MAP below 60 mmHg was raised above 80 mmHg using norepinephrine . Looking specifically at urine output, however, LeDoux et al. showed that raising MAP from baseline 65 mmHg to 85 mmHg using norepinephrine conferred no benefit . This finding was confirmed by a small prospective randomized control study by Bourgoin et al. involving 28 patients . These clinical studies implied that autoregulation threshold of kidneys may be closer to 65 mmHg than 80 mmHg.\n\n【43】More recent studies seemed to favor somewhere in the middle. A larger, but retrospective clinical study by Dünser et al. showed that MAP below 75 mmHg was associated with a higher requirement of renal replacement therapy . Notably, 38 % of the study population had chronic arterial hypertension. Badin et al. also showed in their prospective cohort study that optimal MAP to prevent AKI was somewhere between 72 mmHg and 82 mmHg . Prevalence of chronic hypertension in their study was not reported. Another large prospective observational study by Poukkanen et al. suggested that MAP below 73 mmHg was associated with progression of AKI . Nearly half of their study population had chronic hypertension and the overall rate of AKI was high at 36.2 %.\n\n【44】In elderly patients or patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis or chronic kidney diseases, the autoregulation curve of kidneys can be shifted significantly to the right . This may be why the above studies showed benefit of higher MAP to prevent AKI when the study cohort included many patients with chronic hypertension.\n\n【45】To confirm this, Asfar et al. stratified their study population at the time of randomization according to whether or not they had a history of chronic hypertension . More than 40 % of the study population had chronic hypertension. Indeed, they found that among the patients with chronic hypertension, the low-MAP target group had a significantly higher rate of doubling of creatinine or need for renal replacement therapy, compared to the high-MAP target group.\n\n【46】Notably, what is missing in all of these studies is the consideration of IAP. The renal perfusion pressure becomes the difference between MAP and IAP when IAP exceeds CVP. IAP can be measured at the bedside using bladder pressure . IAH is defined as a sustained elevation of IAP above 12 mmHg whereas normal IAP is considered to be approximately 5--7 mmHg . Sustained IAP above 20 mmHg is called abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and results in intra-abdominal organ dysfunction . Thus, in case of ACS, such as in abdominal sepsis or sepsis associated with liver failure, MAP target may need to be increased at least by the increase in IAP.\n\n【47】Given the current state of evidence, MAP target of 65 mmHg may be reasonable in septic shock patients without any heightened susceptibility to AKI, such as preexisting chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease or advanced age. In contrast, septic shock patients with these risk factors may benefit from higher target MAP of 80 mmHg. In patients with IAH, further increase in MAP target may be necessary, depending on their IAP. Notably, multiple other conditions including the use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also impair kidney's autoregulation and may benefit from higher MAP.\n\n【48】Vasopressor of choice to achieve desired MAP is norepinephrine. Norepinephrine reduces renal blood flow in normal condition, but increases in sepsis by both decreasing renal vascular resistance and Pcc . Vasopressor should be used with caution, however, because of its potential complications as mentioned above. This point may be particularly important because an increasing body of evidence suggests that hypotension, though important, may not be the primary cause of sepsis-associated AKI . Schlichtig et al. showed that kidneys could tolerate significant hypotension compared to rest of the body . In a large retrospective cohort study, Murugan et al. found that sepsis-associated AKI can occur in the absence of global hypotension . Restoration of hemodynamic variables alone thus should not be the only goal for the management of sepsis-associated AKI .\n\n【49】### Liver \n\n【50】The liver plays a critical role in severe sepsis and septic shock for two reasons . First, the entire splanchnic circulation, which comprises 25 % of cardiac output, must pass through the liver. This is particularly important because the gastrointestinal tract is thought to be the driver of multi-organ failure syndrome in sepsis . Second, nearly 90 % of the body's reticuloendothelial system exists within the liver, primarily as Kupffer cells . Thus, the liver is thought to be the clearinghouse of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous \"damage\"-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that incite and perpetuate systemic inflammatory response .\n\n【51】Unlike the other organs, but like the lungs, the liver receives both arterial and venous blood flow. Hepatic artery supplies 25--50 % of hepatic blood flow and portal vein supplies the remainder . Regulation of hepatic arterial flow and portal venous flow is distinct from each other. Autoregulation is the primary mechanism for the arterial system, while distensibility of vascular beds that create capacitance and existence of vascular waterfall in the portal venous system allows steady venous return despite changes in CVP . Furthermore, any reduction in portal venous flow is mitigated by a reciprocal increase in hepatic arterial blood flow. This mechanism is called hepatic arterial buffer response and appears to be mediated by adenosine .\n\n【52】Severe sepsis affects the liver in two stages . In the first hours, early hepatic dysfunction occurs due to hypoperfusion. Both autoregulation of hepatic artery and hepatic buffer response appear to be impaired . This is followed by late hepatic dysfunction, characterized by functional and structural injury due to various circulating PAMPs and DAMPs.\n\n【53】Often, hepatic and splanchnic circulations are studied together due to technical difficulties in isolating one from another , and studies specifically looking at optimal MAP for hepato-splanchnic circulation in septic shock are limited. In Asfar et al. there was no difference in the rate of mesenteric ischemia between the low-target group and the high-target group (2.3 versus 2.3 %) . A study that showed the lowest rate of bowel ischemia was the SOAP II study, which compared dopamine versus norepinephrine for the treatment of septic shock (1.3 versus 0.7 %) . Notably, the actual MAP was maintained only around 58 mmHg in this study. In other studies that compared various regimens of vasopressors and their impact on hepato-splanchnic circulation, the actual MAP was maintained at least above 70 mmHg .\n\n【54】Conclusion \n==========\n\n【55】The available evidence suggests that targeting an MAP of 65--70 mmHg in a patient with septic shock who does not have chronic hypertension is a reasonable first approximation. Whereas in a patient with chronic hypertension, targeting an MAP of 80--85 mmHg appears to be a reasonable first step. It must be done with caution, however, because the use of vasopressors is associated with adverse events. After these initial treatments, MAP should be titrated up or down based on the individual patient's response, but heterogeneity, not only of patients, but of organs and microcirculations affected by septic shock makes it challenging. Caution needs to be taken in all patients in using MAP alone as surrogate of organ perfusion pressure, especially under conditions in which intracranial or intra-abdominal pressure may be elevated.\n\n【56】If sepsis-associated delirium is the primary concern, a growing body of evidence regarding the management of traumatic brain injury patients suggests that MAP target between 50 and 70 mmHg is needed. Further titration of MAP based on multi-modal monitoring including pressure-reactivity index may worth further investigation.\n\n【57】Sepsis-induced myocardial depression, though challenging in its management, may be an adaptive response by the heart in sepsis. Because coronary blood flow is increased, MAP target should not guide its management. Rather, it is important not to stress the heart any further by avoiding excessive or prolonged use of vasopressors. Recent study suggests promising role of β-blockers.\n\n【58】Target MAP in septic shock is most studied in relation to sepsis-associated AKI. In patients without chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease or advanced age, MAP target of 65 mmHg may be reasonable. For patients with these risk factors, MAP target of 80 mmHg may be better. It should be noted, however, that recent evidence suggests that hypotension may not be the primary mechanism of sepsis-associated AKI.\n\n【59】Finally, hepatic dysfunction or mesenteric ischemia that can be associated with septic shock may not only result from the disease, but also from excessive use of vasopressors. MAP target as low as 60 mmHg may be reasonable to reduce vasopressor requirement. Furthermore, there may be a role of vasodilator in the management of hepato-splanchnic blood flow.\n\n【60】RK performed the review searches and reviewed the primary manuscripts cited in this review, wrote the initial draft of the manuscript, and contributed to revisions of the final version.

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Wheat gluten (WG) and potato protein (PP) are industrial side-streams originating from wheat and potato processing into ethanol and potato starch, respectively. Both protein-rich by-products are currently mostly utilized in baking (e.g. WG) and animal feed industries (PP). In addition, both of these proteins have attractive properties as raw materials for non-food applications such as in bio-based plastics . During the production processes of WG and PP, high drying temperature is utilized, and for PP, an acid mediated coagulation step is also included. Both procedures are known to denature the chemical and structure-determining bonds in the protein and may also result in ionization of amino, carboxyl and phenolic groups  and reduced protein functionality . In addition, for PP being treated at a low pH ≈ 4 during industrial processing, causing definite changes in chemical and physical properties to occur. The chemical processes resulting in intra- and intermolecular changes of the protein limit their processing window, thereby decreasing their suitability for processing into bio-based materials . Similarly for WG, the relatively high temperature during drying negatively impacts the proteins and results in aggregated gluten with limited functionality . An alternative and added-value opportunity is to use chemical tools to retain the WG and PP processing ability, both in their present or modified form, for benefit of industry, the consumer and society, thereby contributing to the circular bio-economy. Manipulating the chemical nature of industrial WG and PP would create new possibilities and contribute to the development of alternative uses and an added-value of these proteins for different applications. Development of new bio-based materials from WG and PP proteins is one such promising application.\n\n【2】Un-plasticized WG and PP are difficult to process as their glass transition temperature (T~g~) is located close to their thermal degradation temperature . Thus, easy processing requires the addition of chemical agents or polyol-based plasticizers that depress T~g~ and widen the processing window . In general, proteins perform better in terms of their structure--functional properties when they are processed at basic pH . The basic pH is known to denature and unfold the proteins and thereby expose sulfhydryl and hydrophobic protein sections, which open-up for new protein interactions when processed .\n\n【3】Chemical additives, such as NaOH, NH~4~OH or urea, create basic conditions for the protein, resulting in changes of secondary and supramolecular protein structures which correlate with improved functional properties of processed materials \\[,\\]. However, previous studies have mainly focused on additives or chemical modifiers being added directly to the protein where the blend was immediately processed, thereby leaving a short reaction time for additives to interact with the protein. Although, pre-treatment of the proteins with chemical modifiers in order to modify the protein and later use it for processing has not been evaluated before. This has left a gap for further investigations on the impact of such chemical pre-treatment on protein structure and also functional properties of the final product. In this study, we pre-treated the WG and PP with NaOH in a solution to achieve a basic pH and to promote protein unfolding and induce reactivity. The pH modification was aimed to promote new protein--protein interactions, that could positively impact the mechanical performance of the protein films and composites. The objective was also to understand the effect of the chemical modification on protein molecular and secondary structures, processing behavior and mechanical performance of composites with varying WG and PP ratios. Increased understanding of protein--protein interactions and chemistry, as well as structure-function relationships of proteins in a blend can offer novel opportunities to create versatile and attractive performance of films and composites.\n\n【4】2. Results and Discussion \n=========================\n\n【5】2.1. Protein Extractability in pH-Modified Protein Powders, Films and Composites \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】In this study, SE-HPLC was used to assess protein polymerization behavior in the pH modified protein powders and high temperature processed films . The modified potato protein (MPP) and modified wheat gluten (MWG) powders showed greater amounts of extractable polymeric proteins (HMw and LMw) compared to the non-modified samples, PP and WG (a--d). This was particularly evident for the HMw proteins extracted during 2Ex and 3Ex extractions (b,d). The results indicated, that the alkaline pH induced unfolding in the studied protein and made the proteins more extractable.\n\n【7】For protein films and composites processed at two temperatures, 130 and 150 °C, variation in protein extractability was observed. The processing of the protein powders into films at high temperature induced a higher degree of protein cross-linking and promoted the formation of larger protein aggregates and polymers, thereby decreasing their extractability during SE-HPLC analysis as has previously been reported in processed protein based materials \\[,\\]. In addition, possible interactions of the proteins studied with residual starches (wheat starch from wheat gluten fraction and potato starch from potato protein fraction) could have potentially occurred through non-covalent reactions such as, hydrogen and van der Waals-bonding between the protein and reactive hydroxyl groups from starch. Although those interactions were minor and did not substantially impact protein cross-linking.\n\n【8】For the pressed materials in this study an increase in protein extractability was seen for protein materials pressed at 150 °C, as compared to those pressed at 130 °C (e). This increase in extractability in films pressed at the higher temperature (150 °C), was mainly due to an increase in LMw proteins being extracted as a consequence of protein degradation (except, for MWG, in which increase in HMw proteins at higher temperature was also observed) and lack of protein--protein interactions. In addition, proteins from films produced from the chemically modified proteins were in general more easily extractable, with the exception of MPP pressed at 130 °C (compare MPP with PP pressed at 130 °C; e).\n\n【9】The protein extractability results clearly suggests that the basic pH-modification of protein powders contributed to a protein network unfolding, decrease in protein--protein interactions and de-polymerization of protein aggregates being present in the non-modified protein powder. The unfolding, decrease of protein--protein interactions and de-polymerization of the proteins after modification resulted in an increased extractability of the proteins. The fact that the extractability increased primarily as HMw proteins were extracted during 2Ex and 3Ex extraction steps (where sonication energy is used), suggests that primarily protein aggregates/polymers were affected by the pH adjustment (chemical modification). However, the majority of the protein extraction taking place at 2Ex and 3Ex indicated the presence of some of the cross-links, although with lower degree of intermolecular disulphide bonds, while hydrogen bonds and non-covalent protein interactions might still be in place .\n\n【10】Compression molding of the powder into films resulted in excessive cross-linking and re-formation of intermolecular disulphide bonds for all samples, as this has been previously reported for wheat gluten and potato protein materials . In particular, most of the HMw proteins in all the hot pressed samples ended up in forming large polymers, which were not extractable in the films after pressing. It is also known from previous studies that compression molding of films under alkaline conditions leads to increased protein--protein interactions with the formation of disulphide cross-links in WG, hydrogen bonding in WG and PP and also the formation of isopeptide bonds such as dehydroalanin, lanthionine and lysinoalanine . In addition, alkaline pH and the use of cross-linking enzymes, such as transglutaminase, for protein pre-treatment can further introduce new protein cross-linking opportunities, as has been shown in grass pea flour films . Also, newly sourced transglutaminase species that have been shown to positively impact certain functional behavior of proteins in wheat dough  should further be explored in protein-based materials.\n\n【11】In this study, the proteins were found to be less polymerized after hot pressing at 150 °C than at 130 °C, most likely due to protein degradation, with HMw proteins breaking into LMw fragments . In terms of nano-structure for unmodified WG and PP samples pressed at 130 and 150 °C, few differences due to high temperature were observed in the main scattering broad peak, d~1~ and for the scattering distance d~2~, studied by SAXS, for both types of proteins . For the PP film, the broad peak (d~1~) became \"sharper\", while d~2~ intensity decreased with increasing temperature. While for the WG film, at 150 °C the scattering distance, d~2~, disappeared, indicated a less complex structural morphology compared to the previously observed structural morphologies in WG films pressed at 130 °C . A possible explanation is a decrease in polymerization and an increase in protein breakdown as shown by SE-HPLC (e). Regarding the PP film morphology, intensity of the d~2~ peak was higher at 130 °C than at 150 °C, indicating more structural complexity, although without any specific peak ratio . This change in peak position and intensity may be affected by protein polymerization behavior, which was observed at different pressing temperatures. Regarding the MWG and MPP films morphology, the MPP showed a clear peak, d~1~, indicating similar structural morphology observed previously for the PP films pressed at 130 °C  . While MWG showed d~1~ and d~2~, scattering distances, that can be referred to some undefined, though poorly hierarchically arranged structural entities (as compared to previously observed hexagonal arrangement of WG proteins). Thus, modification may not have considerably changed the nano-structure of MPP, while MWG nanostructure was not improved.\n\n【12】Previous study of WG has indicated that a less polymerized structure in the powder used for processing contributes to a higher degree of re-polymerization, chemical flexibility for proteins to interact and cross-link during processing, and the availability of chemically reactive sites for disulphide bond formation . Although, the described effect could not be seen for the WG proteins in this study, indicating the alkali modification either leads to irreversible changes in the protein conformation (negative impact) or to chemical reactions not involving disulphide bond formation.\n\n【13】2.2. Protein Extractability in Pressed Composites \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Among the pressed composites the highest protein extractability was clearly seen for the MWG/MPP samples at 150 °C, almost independent of the ratio of the two modified proteins within the composite . These results corresponded well with the high protein extractability found for the modified proteins pressed individually at 150 °C (compare e), although protein extractability was even higher in the composites than in the pressed films of individual proteins. Thus, mixing of the two modified proteins did not contribute to increased protein polymerization as compared to protein polymerization for the modified proteins separately. Similarly, a high proportion of MWG (50 and 70%) in the composites pressed at 130 °C resulted in increased protein extractability as compared to the films from each of the individually modified proteins (a compared with ). The extractability was also increased with the increase in temperature from 130 to 150 °C and with higher MWG content in the blend . An increased protein extractability with increase in MWG content (at 130 °C) could be due to the fact that MWG has a more complex protein molecular structure and chemistry, compared to PP, and was more denatured and depolymerized in the pH-modification process compared to PP 删除21:<u></u>. Therefore, an MWG increase in the MWG/MPP blends (i.e. the 70/30 sample) resulted in a decrease in polymerization and lack of disulphide cross-link formation compared to 30/70 and 50/50 samples. However, using a 150 °C pressing temperature reduced the protein polymerization (increased protein extractability) for all MWG/MPP compositions compared to the individual modified proteins (compare  and b). This increase in protein extractability at higher temperature may be due to the lack of disulphide and irreversible cross-links between the protein chains and also due to breakdown of HMw protein into LMw fragments.\n\n【15】For the composites based on non-modified proteins (WG/PP), such an increase in protein extractability (as seen for modified samples) was not seen (compare  and ); instead a slight decrease in protein extractability was observed, especially at high WG ratios (70/30). The non-modified (as received) WG and PP have a low extractability due to the formation of HMw protein aggregates during their industrial processing . Therefore, their further processing at high temperatures favored the formation of non-reducible protein cross-links and also incorporation of the LMw fragments in larger protein networks, thus reducing their extractability . This suggests that composites of non-modified proteins produced in this study did show reduced protein extractability as reported for individual protein based materials produced previously .\n\n【16】As for the WG (non-modified) composites with different ratios of MPP, the protein extractability was in a similar range to that of WG/PP films at both pressing temperatures (compare  and ) except for WG/MPP 30/70 at 150 °C with surprisingly higher amounts of extractable proteins. Hence, higher pressing temperature (as 150 °C) increased protein polymerization and decreased extractability when ≤ 50 wt.% of MPP was used. No such effect of temperature and amount used of MPP was seen in the samples pressed at 130 °C, suggesting that high temperature may be one of the main driving factors in determining the protein polymerization.\n\n【17】Interestingly, the lowest protein extractability (highest degree of protein polymerization) was found for the 70/30 WG/MPP composite film at 130 °C, and for the 70/30 WG/PP film at 150 °C . Thus, to increase protein polymerization in WG based films, modified potato protein (MPP) is beneficial at 130 °C, while non-modified PP is beneficial to have at higher temperature. Increased protein polymerization in 70/30 WG/MPP could be explained by a higher degree of protein cross-linking of WG at 130 °C as has been reported in previous studies . However, an increased protein polymerization in WG/PP 70/30 sample at 150 °C suggests formation of new protein--protein interactions in a composite, because the extractability of these blends decreased slightly more when compared to both non-modified proteins pressed at 150 °C.\n\n【18】2.3. Effect of Chemical Modification on Secondary Structure of Proteins \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】As shown in previous studies , the non-modified WG powder showed relatively low amounts of β-sheets, as indicated by a flat shoulder in the amide I region (1620--1625 cm^−1^), while peaks at 1660, 1650 and 1641 cm^−1^ verified the presence of α-helices, α-helices and random coils, and unordered structures, respectively (a). Chemical modification of the WG protein (MWG sample) resulted in a slight decrease in the intensity of peaks in the region 1640--1660 cm^−1^, indicating that some of either α-helices, α-helices and random coils, or unordered structures became involved in formation of strong hydrogen bonded β-sheets (a). Thus, FT-IR data indicate formation of β-sheets at the expense of either α-helices, α-helices and random coils or unordered structures, may indicate development of novel interactions (presumably via hydrogen bonds, protein-protein and peptide--protein interactions ), although not verified by SE-HPLC results .\n\n【20】The FT-IR spectra of PP showed a very distinct and high intensity peak at 1622 cm^−1^ verifying the presence of strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets. The formation of these protein structures are known to originate from the harsh treatment of the PP during industrial extraction with the use of high temperature and acidic processing conditions promoting a high degree of cross-linking . The high degree of cross-linking in PP was also supported by the SE-HPLC data, showing low extractability of PP powder (a). Furthermore, results of the SE-HPLC were supported by FT-IR data for the MPP powder sample, in general showing a lower amount of strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets (less aggregated structure) as reported in previous studies .\n\n【21】The pressed WG/PP blended films resulted in FT-IR spectra with a clear and high intensity peak at 1620 cm^−1^ and also several well defined peaks in the 1640--1660 and 1622 cm^−1^ region (b,c), thereby showing structural features resembling both single powders used in the blend (a) and indicating presence of strongly bonded β-sheet interactions, α-helices, α-helices and random coils, and unordered structures . Including MPP in the blends (WG/MPP) for compression molding resulted in FT-IR spectra with reduced intensity and a shift to lower frequency of the major β-sheet peak (especially at 150 °C when the shoulder also became broader), and a decrease in intensity of the peaks in the region of 1640--1660 cm^−1^ (b,c). In general protein aggregation has been correlated to an increased amount of strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets contributing to ordered conformation and improved tensile strength \\[,\\]. However, the lowest extractability of the proteins (indicating protein polymerization) as resolved by SE-HPLC results  was found for WG/MPP 70/30 at 130 °C and WG/PP 70/30 at 150 °C, not corresponding with blends showing the most intense peak for β-sheets by FT-IR (b,c). These results suggest that the protein polymerization behavior and relationships with structural properties seems to be more complicated for compression molded composites than for individual proteins, especially while modifying of the chemical structures of the proteins used in the blends.\n\n【22】FT-IR spectra of MWG/MPP composites showed more differentiation between the ratios of proteins, where the strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets related structural peak was more pronounced at higher PP ratio and lower temperature , corresponding to lower protein extractability by SE-HPLC . This might indicate that differences in protein polymerization were too limited among WG/PP and WG/MPP blended compression molded films to be differentiated by FT-IR in most cases, and basically only differences between separate blended protein components were seen. Thus, only for differences in protein polymerization behavior of MWG/MPP blends were large enough to be differentiated by FT-IR as also indicated by SE-HPLC, and corresponded to the characteristic relationship of SE-HPLC, FT-IR and functional properties data .\n\n【23】2.4. Effect of Protein Modification on Mechanical Performance of the Pressed Composites \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Compression molding of WG, MWG, PP, MPP and their blends, yielded samples of different colors as can be seen in . High WG and MWG content generally resulted in a sample with light brown color (, MWG100 and WG/MPP 70/30), while high PP and MPP content generally resulted in samples with dark brown (WG/PP 30/70) or almost black in color (MPP100), which can influence the composites' attractiveness and end-use. It is however an easy task to incorporate a pigment or dye to obtain a desired color (excluding white color). WG and PP samples showed opposite tensile performance, WG having lower strength and E-modulus but higher extensibility (elongation at break) than PP. Thus, comparing these two protein types, the tensile strength correlated positively with protein extractability. This observation was different to many previous studies, where a higher degree of cross-linking yielded higher strengths . Here, the WG proteins most likely have a higher ability to cross-link (due to their more complex molecular structure characteristics and specific polymerization properties ) during pressing than the PP as SE-HPLC results indicate, although FT-IR shows a higher degree of β-sheets in the pressed PP which might explain their higher maximum stress and E-modulus .\n\n【25】Modification of WG (MWG) resulted in lower maximum stress and E-modulus and reduced extensibility compared to WG for both evaluated pressing temperatures . Modification of the PP (MPP), resulted in a decrease in E-modulus for samples pressed at both temperatures and maximum stress decreased at 150 °C while the extensibility increased particularly at 130 °C . SE-HPLC data indicated an increase in cross-linking at 130 °C, although a decrease in β-sheet content was shown by FT-IR, which might explain the improvement in the extensibility and decrease in E-modulus for the MPP as compared to PP. In addition, a previous study reported an increase in extensibility and a decrease in modulus for PP modified with NaOH, when pressed with 30% glycerol . Thus, modification of PP prior to processing (e.g. hot pressing) leads to improved tensile properties but also contributes to opportunities for using lower processing temperatures than was used in previous studies (≥ 150 °C) , thereby saving energy input during the production process.\n\n【26】The pressed composites of WG and PP resulted in tensile properties generally as expected from the ratios of the individually pressed proteins . In addition, pressed WG/MPP samples showed tensile properties generally between those of the individually pressed protein samples, although minor differences were seen among the samples. Furthermore, as also indicated by comparing FT-IR and SE-HPLC results, differences in the protein cross-linking obtained by SE-HPLC could not explain the differences in tensile properties between the WG/PP and WG/MPP blends.\n\n【27】The most rubber-like properties were observed for the pressed MWG material (lower stiffness than WG), which also resulted in that the MWG/MPP blends were with the most rubber-like properties (low modulus but still with appreciable extensibility) , thereby correlating with SE-HPLC and FT-IR data. It is noteworthy that the higher pressing temperature (150 °C) leads to lower stiffness, strength and extensibility for the modified materials and their blends (MWG, MPP and MWG/MPP) .\n\n【28】3. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【29】3.1. Wheat Gluten and Potato Proteins \n-------------------------------------\n\n【30】Wheat gluten with protein content of 77.7 wt.%, starch 5.8 wt.%, moisture 6.9 wt.% and fat 1.2 wt.%, was purchased from Lantmännan Reppe AB, Lidköping, Sweden. Commercial PP was supplied by Lyckeby Starch AB, Kristianstad, Sweden. The potato protein content was 82.2 wt.% (Dumas method, Flash 2000 NC Analyser, Thermo Scientific, USA, NX 6.25) and moisture content of 8.1% (dry basis, dried at 105 °C for 3 h). Glycerol (purity 99.5 wt.%, 0.5 wt.% water) was supplied by Karlshamns Tefac AB, Karlshamn, Sweden.\n\n【31】3.2. Protein Modification \n-------------------------\n\n【32】Potato protein powder, 50 g was slowly dispersed in 600 mL distilled water under stirring. The suspension was adjusted to pH 10 by addition of a 5 M NaOH solution, followed by stirring for 30 min at 75 °C (± 3 °C). The PP was well dispersed in these conditions forming a dark brown suspension. The PP suspension was then lyophilized and ground to powder using an IKA A10 grinder (IKA, Germany) and was designated as modified PP (MPP) in this study. WG was modified in the same way as the PP above and was designated as modified WG (MWG). Protein blends were prepared by dispersing various ratios of WG and PP in water followed by the pH modification step as described for the separate protein sources. Thereafter, MWG/MPP blend were lyophilized and ground to obtain powder for further sample processing.\n\n【33】3.3. Sample Preparation and Compression Molding \n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Powders from individually modified PP and WG proteins were mixed with glycerol, (70 wt.% protein and 30 wt.% glycerol) prior to compression molding and later pressed into films. Each type of protein was pressed into two films, one at 130 °C and another one at 150 °C. For blends, different ratios of WG/PP and WG/MPP (30/70, 50/50 and 70/30) were manually mixed with glycerol, (70 wt.% protein and 30 wt.% glycerol) prior to compression molding. The sample compositions are presented in . The prepared individual protein films and blends were then placed in a 0.5 mm thick aluminum frame with a 100 × 100 mm opening to control the size and thickness of the film. The film and blends were then molded for 5 min at 200 bar in a hydraulic press (Polystat 400s, Servitech, Germany) between pre-heated aluminum plates with poly(ethylene terephthalate) release films. From each of the blends two films were compression molded, one at 130 °C and another one at 150 °C. Pressed films were removed from the hot press and left to cool between two room temperature aluminum plates.\n\n【35】3.4. SE-HPLC to Assess Protein Polymerization in Processed Composites \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】The soluble amount of protein and protein size distribution of the protein powders, compression molded samples and composites were examined in this study. For this analysis, films were cut into approximately 0.2 mm pieces using a scalpel. Thereafter, 16.5 mg (± 0.05 mg) of each sample was added to 1.4 mL buffer solution (0.5% SDS, 0.05 M NaH~2~PO~4~, pH 6.9) in a Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL). To obtain the first extraction (1Ex) tubes were vortexed for 10 s (Whirli Vib 2, Labassco, Sweden) and then shaken for 5 min (IKA-VIBRAX VXR, IKA, Germany) at 2000 rpm. The tubes were then centrifuged (Legend Micro 17, Sorvall, Germany) for 30 min at 12,500 rpm and the supernatant was collected in HPLC vials. For the 2nd extraction (2Ex), extraction buffer (1.4 mL) was added to the pellet from 1Ex and then sonicated for 30 s at an amplitude of 5 microns using a Sanyo Soniprep 150 Ultrasonic Disintegrator (Tamro, UK) and thereafter centrifuged for 30 min and the supernatant collected in HPLC vials for analysis. The third extraction (3Ex) was similar to 2Ex, the pellet of 2Ex was used with sonication intervals of 30 + 60 + 60 s, to avoid overheating, samples were left to cool at room temperature between each sonication interval. All three extractions (1Ex, 2Ex and 3Ex) were analyzed with a Waters 2690 Separation Module connected to a Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector (Waters, Millford, MA, USA).\n\n【37】An SE-HPLC column (Biosep-SEC-S 4000, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used for protein size distribution determination. For each sample, 20 µL was injected onto the column at an isocratic flow of 0.2 mL/min (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA; 50% H~2~O, 0.1% TFA). Chromatograms were obtained at 210 nm and integrated using Empower Pro software (Waters, USA). The chromatograms were divided into two sections depending on the elution time of the proteins and total area was calculated. The high molecular weight (HMw) proteins were eluted between 7--14.5 min and low molecular weight (LMw) between 14.5--28 min. HMw are referred to as polymeric proteins, and LMw as smaller molecular size proteins.\n\n【38】3.5. Tensile Testing \n--------------------\n\n【39】For mechanical testing the films were conditioned for at least 48 h at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity and then cut into dumbbell shaped samples (ISO 37 type 3, Elastocon, Sweden) and thereafter tested in the same conditions. Prior to testing the thickness of all the samples was measured at 5 different points (Mitutoyo IDC 112B) in the test area and the average was used for calculations. A clamp separation distance of 40 mm, crosshead speed of 10 mm/min and a 500 N load cell was used to test all samples on an Instron 5566 universal testing machine with a Bluehill software (Instron AB, Danderyd, Sweden).\n\n【40】3.6. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【41】All the samples were dried for at least 72 h in a desiccator over silica gel prior to the analysis. FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out on all films and powders using a Spectrum 2000 FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer inc. Norwalk, CN, USA) equipped with single reflection ATR (Golden Gate, Speac Ltd. USA). Data was Fourier self-de-convoluted using the Spectrum software with γ=2 and a smoothing factor of 70%.\n\n【42】4. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【43】Chemical modification of plant proteins, through heating at a basic pH, results in a protein with a decreased amount of intermolecular disulphide bonds and thereby a less cross-linked structure, as shown here for both WG and PP. Cross-linking of the proteins in the starting powder, when producing bio-based materials, largely impacts the properties of compression molded materials both in terms of opportunities for the proteins to further cross-link and form new bonds and structures during processing. From our previous study, mild protein extraction of WG has been shown to contribute with less cross-linked protein powder which when hot compression molded into films resulted in improved tensile properties (E-modulus and maximum stress) . However, a less cross-linked structure in the protein starting material does not necessarily contribute to improved properties of processed bio-based materials. Here, a decrease in cross-linking of proteins by chemical modification, improved cross-linking (during temperature pressing) and tensile properties (E-modulus and maximum stress) of the material of PP but not for WG. Thus, using basic pH for modification of WG must contribute to irreversible changes in the protein conformation/structure and/or to chemical reactions not involving disulphide bond formation, which reduces the opportunities for the proteins to re-cross-link when processed. For PP, instead the chemical modification through basic pH contributed to the breaking of disulphide bonds which were created during industrial production of the PP starting material (the powder).\n\n【44】A major advantage with the chemical modification of PP was that it enabled the production of films with improved properties at a pressing temperature as low as 130 °C, thereby contributing to a lower environmental foot-print due to a reduction of energy use.\n\n【45】Thus, chemical modification of proteins for bio-based material production on an industrial scale may potentially help to widen the functional properties and improve the socio-economic value of the product (especially in the case of PP).  provides a schematic summary of the important findings of this study.\n\n【46】We acknowledge Maria Luisa-Prieto Linde for her kind assistance in the laboratory, Lyckeby Starch AB for their kind provision of the potato protein and William Newson for his kind editing of the manuscript and English.\n\n【47】Supplementary materials can be found at <http://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/1/58/s1>.\n\n【48】###### \n\n【49】删除28:<u>Click here for additional data file.</u>\n\n【50】R.K. conceived and designed the experiment together with F.M.

This crucial information guides initial assessment and forms the basis for reaching a diagnosis, risk stratification and early treatment . By comparison, most analyses of the emergency care provided rely on auditing cohorts of patients with a specific diagnosis. This can lead to inaccuracies, for example, if a diagnosis is subsequently altered or excluded. An alternative approach is to examine the reason for attendance. Studying PCs facilitates a clearer examination of the diagnostic process and, consequently, how well the emergency department is performing . In Germany, diagnoses are encoded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, German Modification (ICD-10-GM), but there is no comparable classification system for PCs applicable to emergency medicine. Consequently, PCs are not routinely encoded; rather, they are variably recorded as additional free-text information somewhere in the admission documentation. This complicates data analysis and interferes with reliable benchmarking, auditing and research .\n\n【2】A national documentation standard for emergency departments was established in 2010 by the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine , During a revision process, it became clear that details of patients' PC needed to be recorded using a classification system . A literature review was performed with the aim of identifying a credible PC list used widely by the scientific community. The Canadian Emergency Department Information System (CEDIS) Presenting Complaints List (PCL) developed by the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) was identified as an optimal solution , The CEDIS PCL is available in both official Canadian languages: English and French. It consists of 171 signs and symptoms grouped into 17 categories; Table  represents an extract from the CEDIS PCL. Introduction of the CEDIS PCL necessitated that it be translated for the German user. Nonmodification of the CEDIS PCL during the translation process was a prerequisite to preserve international comparability. A hasty, poorly considered translation may unintentionally alter some concepts and meanings, and thus limit the tool's equivalence across languages and cultural regions. To avoid such situations, the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) published the Principles of Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural Adaptation Process for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures .\n\n【3】###### \n\n【4】Sample from the original Presenting Complaint List with German translation\n\n【5】删除20:<u>!</u>(mej-25-295-g001)\n\n【6】The aim of this paper is to describe our experiences of using the ISPOR guidelines to translate the CEDIS PCL into German.\n\n【7】Materials and methods\n=====================\n\n【8】The project involved a convenient 'Working Group' recruited from the German Interdisciplinary Association for Emergency and Acute Medicine and German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, whose role was to initiate and manage the project. Table  provides an overview of the methodology used. We began by acquiring the most recent English version of the CEDIS PCL (3.0) . Furthermore, we acquired permission for translation from the author (step 1 of methodology). The 'Translation Group' comprised four 'forward' translators (English into German), all German native speakers and experienced emergency physicians with a working knowledge of English and German. They independently translated the PCL into German (step 2). The German terms were compared with each other. Where there was limited agreement, the results were carefully considered, resulting in a single forward translation (step 3). The three 'back' translators who independently translated the PCL back to German were medically qualified, bilingual English native speakers working in the UK and Germany, and one was a professional translator affiliated with the German Federal Office of Languages. None of the back translators were familiar with the original CEDIS PCL (step 4). The back translations were reviewed by the Working Group; the terms suggested were compared with the original wording in the CEDIS PCL. Lack of agreement indicated a problem with the forward-translation process and led to further review of the German translation (step 5). Small variations between participants were accepted as showing agreement, for example, where the translator used a singular or a plural form, different spellings and word order. We expanded on the review of the back translations advocated by the ISPOR in step 5 by asking the back translators to review the revised German version. Step 6 could be omitted as there were no different language versions to harmonize.\n\n【9】###### \n\n【10】The various translation stages used in this project according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research methodology \n\n【11】删除20:<u>!</u>(mej-25-295-g002)\n\n【12】The resultant German version was reviewed by a diverse 'Evaluation Group' of emergency personnel working in six German hospitals. We developed our own questionnaire , aimed at eliciting respondents' opinions on the overall German version of the CEDIS PCL, specifically, views on its anticipated applicability in routine clinical practice and individual items of the PCL (step 7). The returned completed questionnaires were reviewed, resulting in final changes to the German version of PCL by the Working Group (step 8). Proofreading (step 9) and development of this paper, which constitutes the final report (step 10), followed. A table detailing all intermediate steps, results and modifications made to the German version during the translation process is available at SDC 2 .\n\n【13】The data were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). Because no patients were involved in this study, approval by the Ethics Committee was considered unnecessary.\n\n【14】Results\n=======\n\n【15】Translation process\n-------------------\n\n【16】There was limited agreement among the four forward translators tasked with translating the CEDIS PCL into German. In 98 (57%) of 171 PCs, there was either complete lack of agreement or agreement between only two translators, with the other two proposing different wording. In the remaining 73 (43%) PCs, either three or all four translations were identical. The former PCs generated considerable discussion at step 3, whereas reconciliation was generally easier for the latter group.\n\n【17】The results of the back-translation process were better compared with those of initial translation from the English original. In 94 (55%) of 171 PCs, the wording of two or all three back translations was identical to that in the CEDIS PCL. This meant that approval of the chosen German translation at step 5 was generally easier. However, in 77 (45%) PCs, there was limited or no agreement. This necessitated a detailed exploration in terms of generating optimal wording.\n\n【18】The most common cause of differences between the back translation and the original version was the use of synonyms. For example, for PCL code 406, 'Gait disturbance/ataxia' was forward-translated into German as 'Gangstörung/Ataxie'. Back translation yielded the following wording: 'Gait disorder/ataxia', 'Gait problems/ataxia' and 'gait disorder/ataxia'. Although the back translations all differed from the original, they were considered synonyms and, consequently, no change to the forward translation was necessary.\n\n【19】For eight of the items, back translation yielded an unintentional change in meaning, compared with the original, thus necessitating modification. For example, the PCL code 008 'Syncope/presyncope' was translated as 'Synkope/Kollaps' and consistently back-translated by all three translators as 'Syncope/Collapse'. Most emergency physicians would consider 'presyncope' a different concept from 'collapse'; thus, the translation was modified to 'Synkope/Präsynkope' .\n\n【20】Further, in 12 PCs, intentional modification of the original was necessary because there was no equivalent wording or usage in the German language. For example, PCL code 003, 'Chest pain -- cardiac features', was intentionally translated as 'Brustschmerz (kardial)' because there is no equivalent German translation for the word, 'feature', in this context. Similarly, because of the lack of appropriate German equivalents to enable a distinction between 'Sore throat' and 'Neck swelling/pain' (PCL codes 103 and 104), with both words being translated as 'Halsschmerzen', an expanded form of wording had to be adopted for clarity.\n\n【21】Feedback from the back translators 删除21:<u></u> led to the identification of several unintentional modifications and necessitated 14 language improvements. This occurred when the German translation was linguistically too close to the English original. Here is an example: PCL code 503, 'Foreign body, eye', was originally translated as 'Fremdkörper Auge', whereas the more correct linguistic expression in German should be 'Fremdkörper im Auge'.\n\n【22】The German translation of the CEDIS PCL is available at SDC 3, Supplemental digital content 3,\n\n【23】Evaluation process (steps 7 and 8)\n----------------------------------\n\n【24】A total of 32 completed questionnaires were received from the Evaluation Group members. Respondents comprised six physicians, 16 nurses, one paramedic and seven medical assistants, with two participants not reporting their occupations. Female participants were in the majority (n=19). Respondents' average age was 35 years and they had, on average, 7 years' work experience in emergency medicine. Twenty-nine members of the Evaluation Group commented on the general applicability of the PCL to the German emergency practice; 18 (62%) were positive, seven (24%) were neutral and four (14%) were negative.\n\n【25】Of the 156 comments received, 40 were general observations relating to the structure of the CEDIS PCL; these were not related to the translation process. Those giving positive responses agreed that all presenting complaints were adequately covered by the PCL. Negative comments mostly entailed requests to add more subsections to the list to address perceived incomplete information or the level of item detail. Forty-two more comments referred to PCs that were considered to have been completely omitted from the list. The remaining 74 comments pertained to individual terms of the list, six of which resulted in changes to the German version. One example is 'Anorexia' (PCL code 252), which had been translated as 'Anorexie', a term that is more commonly associated with anorexia nervosa in the German language. This term was subsequently changed to 'Appetitlosigkeit' ('Appetite loss').\n\n【26】Discussion\n==========\n\n【27】In this paper, we describe our experiences of using the ISPOR guidelines to translate and adapt the CEDIS PCL from English into German for local healthcare personnel on the basis of comments from an occupationally mixed group of evaluators. The aim of this study was to develop a German version of the CEDIS PCL, which is compatible with and equivalent to the English original. This process took time, language skills and medical knowledge; these considerations are relevant to other translation exercises in medical practice. A hasty, forward-translation only by one individual would have likely resulted in significant errors, reducing equivalence with the original document. Having applied the ISPOR guidelines, we feel confident that the resultant German translation of the CEDIS PCL is as good as we could get at present and is sufficient for introduction into emergency practice on a limited scale before further review.\n\n【28】Translating from one language to another poses the risk of altering the intended concepts and/or meanings of words or phrases. This can be particularly important in medical practice. Another issue to be considered is ensuring appropriate cultural adaptation. This may necessitate more creative use of wording in the new language, rather than direct translation. The Principles of Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural Adaptation guidelines were originally developed by an ISPOR taskforce to address such issues, in respect of patient outcome measures , and have since been used elsewhere in numerous studies --.\n\n【29】Our translation experience is also positive; use of the ISPOR guidelines helped us avoid a number of errors. Each step of the process showed a number of unintended changes in meaning, which required refinement of the German translation.\n\n【30】The latest version of the CEDIS PCL list is protected by a Creative Common License. This allows usage and dissemination of the original list, but not transmission of an altered document, such as a translated version. Consequently, we sought the permission of the licence holder to translate the CEDIS PCL and subsequently involved him in the translation process and clarification of any areas of difficulty.\n\n【31】A strength of this study is the involvement of four translators with emergency medicine experience, whose mother tongue is German, and who possess working knowledge of English. This is compatible with the ISPOR recommendation (step 2: 'forward translation') of using two or more translators. On the basis of our experience, we would not recommend such few translators for even a simple medical translation exercise.\n\n【32】Again, we were more diligent with our back translation. We employed three translators (the guidelines stipulate at least one) and requested them to review the revised forward translation from the English original. Their comments sharpened our translation, enabling us to identify differences and improve language quality. This reduced the risk of mistranslation in the various rounds of forward translation and mirrors previous findings by Breuer et al.\n\n【33】Our Evaluation Group members were all experienced emergency personnel from various backgrounds, who were working in Accident and Emergency departments across Germany. They were generally positive about the usefulness and applicability of the German version. Negative comments were typically related to the level of detail within the PCL, some of which we could not resolve without changing the document to something that was no longer equivalent to the CEDIS original, as developed by the CAEP. We chose not to do this as significant changes would have generated a new, nonequivalent list that, like so many before it, would be prone to limited dissemination across other Accident and Emergency departments ,\n\n【34】Limitations of the study\n------------------------\n\n【35】At the beginning of the translation process, we omitted to provide a clear explanation of the concepts on which the CEDIS PCL was based. This led to confusion. Moreover, we did not state whether our aim was to seek a literal translation or one that was conceptually correct. A decision to emphasize the former was only made after the study had begun.\n\n【36】None of the translators had previous experience of using ISPOR guidelines, and therefore required a steep learning curve. A further limitation was that the 'Working' and 'Translation' groups consisted primarily of physicians, whereas the majority of future users are likely to be nurses and associated healthcare staff (e.g. paramedics or doctors' receptionists).\n\n【37】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【38】The translation method advocated by the ISPOR has been put into practice and found to be useful for the translation of the CEDIS PCL from English into German. This was an intensive process, with reviews and modification at each stage. Subsequent examination by an occupationally mixed Evaluation Group led to further modification. Our experience is that use of a less intensive methodology other than the ISPOR guidelines would have likely introduced several potentially significant errors.\n\n【39】The challenges of translating medical tools from foreign languages into a native language are not confined to the German language. The methodology applied in this study could be used to translate the CEDIS PCL into different languages that are used in Europe.\n\n【40】We intend implementing the translated PCL in Germany for use in complaint-based quality benchmarking, research and allowing comparisons across existing CEDIS PCL users. Translation of the CEDIS PCL into other languages using the ISPOR methodology could harmonize global research in emergency medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Dietary protein restriction preserves renal function and improves survival in animals with varies glomerulopathies. Conversely, it was suggested that prolonged protein restriction preceding dialysis may induce protein malnutrition and thus confer a poor prognosis during dialysis. The prevalence of protein-energy wasting in early to moderate CKD is 20--25% and increases as CKD progresses. Alpha-Ketoanalogues (KA) of essential amino acids, converted into essential amino acids in the body via transamination, could improve nutritional deficiencies caused by protein-restricted diets in CKD patients. In the 1980s, Mitch and colleague found that using KA to supplement a LPD slowed or halted the progression of renal insufficiency in CKD patients. LPD supplemented with KA alleviated the decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and maintained body mass index . Other studies further suggest that KA per se may be renoprotective . However, a meta-analysis indicated that KA supplementation has an insignificant effect on preserving renal function . The reasons for the discrepancies between the results of studies conducted to evaluate LPD are of particular interest. Comparison of their designs reveals great heterogeneity due to short follow-up periods, late commencing supplementation, or small sample size. Therefore, data are still lacking regarding whether KA supplementation exerts an effect on decreasing risk for long-term dialysis or all-cause mortality in advanced CKD patients. As maintenance dialysis is generally initiated when uremic symptoms begin, its necessity may be deferred by LPD-KA.\n\n【3】In Taiwan, with an extremely high incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) , patients start dialysis with very low residual renal function (average estimated GFR \\< 5.0 mL/min/1.73 m^2^) . This clinical situation allows for a risk-benefit analysis of treatment in patients with advanced CKD using national claim databases. Taking advantage of the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) research database, we designed a nationwide, population-based cohort study to explore the association between KA supplementation and risk for long-term dialysis or all-cause mortality in advanced CKD patients. We also conducted a dose-response analysis regarding KA supplementation and outcome.\n\n【4】Methods \n=======\n\n【5】Data sources \n------------\n\n【6】The Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) is a nationwide insurance program that covers outpatient visits, hospital admissions, prescriptions, intervention procedures, and disease profiles for over 99% of the population in Taiwan (23.12 million in 2009). The NHI database is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the world, and offers research data for various studies on diagnoses, medication use, and hospitalizations .\n\n【7】Patient selection \n-----------------\n\n【8】Our cohort study used the longitudinal database created by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute (NHRI) by extracting original NHI data for all patients aged ≧ 20 years who were diagnosed with CKD and received ESA treatment in the NHI in the period from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2010. Based on the reimbursement regulations of the NHI, ESA can only be prescribed in anemic advanced CKD patients with a hematocrit level of ≦ 28% and a serum creatinine level of \\> 6 mg/dL with the aim of achieving a hematocrit level of 33--36%. To ensure a sufficient duration of dialysis-free follow-up, we only enrolled patients not yet dialyzed (identified by procedure codes) from 6 months before to 90 days after the first ESA prescription.\n\n【9】According to NHI reimbursement regulations, patients in Taiwan with CKD who were on an LPD with serum creatinine levels above 6 mg/dL for three consecutive months could also receive low dose KA supplementation  without copayment, with a maximum total dose of six tablets daily. The KA doses the patients were on were judged and determined by their attending physicians, typically one or two tables twice a day. Patient should be inspected at least once every two months; if serum creatinine level decrease to 5 mg/dL or less, or the compliance, evaluated by the dietitian to LPD was poor, KA supplementation should be discontinued immediately. Advanced CKD is defined as the presence of CKD coding and concomitant reimbursement of ESA prescriptions. The rate of ESA use was 85% in 2012 for patients with advanced CKD who had not yet commenced dialysis . The first date of ESA prescription was defined as the index date. Patients were excluded if they had a KA prescription within the past 12 months before the index date, if they commenced dialysis before the index date, received dialysis or died within 90 days after the index date, or if they received a renal transplant. Ultimately, 1483 patients with predialysis stage 5 CKD starting KA supplementation were enrolled in this study 删除20:<u></u>.\n\n【10】![Flow diagram of study subject selection.\\\n(Abbreviations: CKD, chronic kidney disease; ESA, erythropoiesis stimulating agent; NHI, National Health Insurance).]\n\n【11】KA cumulated dose \n-----------------\n\n【12】The dose of KA was measured based on the cumulative dose in the 180 days preceding the 30^th^ day before outcomes. We used a long observation period to consider the lag effects of the drugs. In order to reduce potential confounding effects due to indication, we did not count medications prescribed within 30 days before the outcome event. In time-varying model, we could choose a selected fix- time period to calculate the drug dose. The time period is different from the Cox regression applied time varying model. The KA continuation period is a certain period of time during which the patient is with treatment of KA, and the countermanded period is a certain period of time during which the patient is without treatment of KA. The NHI claims data regarding medications are reliable because they were constructed on the basis of NHI procedures and drug codes that were tied to the NHI reimbursement system with auditing 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【13】Multidisciplinary nutritional education \n---------------------------------------\n\n【14】Since 2004, nearly all Taiwanese patients with a principal diagnosis of CKD have received a multidisciplinary care (MDC) program, thus reducing the probability of misdiagnosis \\[--\\]. The medical system in Taiwan has established a unique protocol to standardize and regulate pre-ESRD MDC, with all the medical expenditures covered by Taiwan NHI. For standardizing purposes, the management goals and education measures are stratified according to different stages of CKD and in compliance with the NKF K/DOQI guidelines. This program regulates that every patient diagnosed with CKD should receive specialist (including renal dietitian) consultations. The interventions evaluated vary considerably in terms of protein restriction (protein intake ≤0.8 g/kg/day). According to the reimbursement policy, patients with CKD stage 3 or 4 are followed in nephrology clinics every 3 months, while patients with CKD stage 5 are followed-up at least every month. Nutritional compliance with dietary protein intake was measured by using diet record and analyzed using standard food composition tables. This Taiwanese nationwide CKD prevention program, including LPD and ESA use, was shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of ESRD, mortality, and medical costs \\[--\\].\n\n【15】Research variables \n------------------\n\n【16】We used codes from the International Classification of Disease, 9^th^ revision (ICD-9) to define diseases. The NHI data is generally reliable, because the National Health Insurance Administration routinely audits claims data to prevent fraud in the NHI program \\[--\\].\n\n【17】The baseline comorbidities, including CKD, were identified from at least three outpatient visits or one inpatient claim within one year preceding the first ESA prescription. This identification method has been well validated with good predictive power . The Charlson comorbidity index was calculated by weighting baseline comorbidities 删除21:<u></u>. We also identified prescriptions that could be attributed to long-term dialysis or all-cause mortality risk, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and diuretics, within 30 days before the events.\n\n【18】Outcome measurement \n-------------------\n\n【19】The observation period started from the index date to the date commencing long-term dialysis, to death, or to December 31, 2010, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was defined as long-term dialysis, the secondary endpoint was the composite outcome defined as long-term dialysis or all-cause mortality. In Taiwan, patients who continue dialysis for more than 90 days all apply a catastrophic illness registration card, which ensures the accuracy of our definition of dialysis continuation. The verification of ESRD on chronic dialysis includes a detailed exclusion of acute kidney injury; supported medical records, examination reports, and imaging studies with a comprehensive review by nephrology specialists are required .\n\n【20】Data used for validation \n------------------------\n\n【21】The advanced CKD patients in Taiwan should be on LPD for three consecutive months before receiving KA supplementation without copayment. We validated the nutritional compliance with dietary protein intake by analyzing data of patients with CKD followed up in Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) . The purpose of CAKs is to build a platform on which we share the clinical data and exchange state-of-the-art research information. Up to June 2016, 21 hospitals along with the National Health Research Institute and Harvard statistics company have joined the Consortium. Through uniting Taiwan as a whole, CAKs aims to actively take part in the international kidney disease clinical trials and to pioneer in the scientific and bio-medical devices . This study including the data from Taipei Tzu Chi hospital, and National Taiwan University Hospital and its 2 affiliated hospitals (National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch, southern Taiwan, and National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, central Taiwan) during January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2015 attributed from CAKs.\n\n【22】Statistical analysis \n--------------------\n\n【23】Continuous variables are described as mean ± SD; discrete variables are presented as counts and percentages. We used the R software, version 2.8.1 (Free Software Foundation, Inc. Boston, MA, U.S.A.). A two-sided p-value \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. KA supplementation is more often prescribed to patients whose renal function is expected by the physician to deteriorate more rapidly. Approaches using statistical methods to enroll those \"unexposed\" groups do not overcome this kind of initial selection bias. Therefore, we do not construct a control group using statistics matching. Instead, we used a Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates to account for the influences of medications on the risks of long-term dialysis and the composite outcome in our investigation. Self- matching of cases eliminates the threat of control-selection bias and increases efficiency.\n\n【24】Time varying factors, including using KA, cumulated dose of KA, and ACEI/ARB as time-dependent covariate in the model, ensured that patients were at risk only when they have used them. The model allowed for moving patients from one exposure group to countermanding period. In the repeated analysis, person days of follow-up were correctly classified as untreated until the intended treatment definition of \"each immortal time of use\" was met, and as treated thereafter.\n\n【25】To determine threshold values of KA dosage for favorable renal outcome chances, we specified a multilevel discrete-time event history analysis using the logistic regression method incorporating patient-specific random effects, and adopted a generalized additive model (GAM) with splines regarding KA dosage. This approach permits adjustments for possible nonlinear effects of continuous variables . To show the effect of KA dosage on risk of initiating long-term dialysis, we plotted a function curve with values of the logs of odds ratios. The curve was centered to have an average of zero over the range of the data with approximate point-wise 95% CIs. After determining dosage threshold values, we categorized KA dosage levels accordingly, and incorporated the non-linear effect of KA dosage into the specification of another alternative Cox regression model to further examine the non-linear effect of KA dosage on outcome and avoid the healthy survivor bias. Subgroup Cox regression analyses were further performed to examine the effects of age, sex, diabetics, hypertension, and nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【26】Sensitivity analysis \n--------------------\n\n【27】To assess the reliability of our findings, additional analysis was conducted. We restricted the analysis to patients receiving ESA therapy at 2 or more consecutive ambulatory care visits to exclude acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure with transient creatinine levels of greater than 6mg/dL.\n\n【28】Ethical considerations \n----------------------\n\n【29】Informed consent was originally obtained by the NHRI, and since patients were anonymous in the present study, informed consent was not required. Also, since the identification numbers of all individuals in the NHRI databases were encrypted to protect the privacy of the individuals, this study was exempt from a full ethical review by the institutional review board of National Taiwan University Hospital.\n\n【30】Results \n=======\n\n【31】Patient characteristics \n-----------------------\n\n【32】A total of 1483 eligible patients with anemic advanced CKD who received KA therapy between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010 were enrolled in our study.

The risk for long term composite outcome was lower during the KA continuation period compared to the countermanded period (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.38--0.49; p \\< 0.001). This protective effect was independent of the effects of DM (HR1.53; 95% CI 1.34--1.74; p \\< 0.001), HTN (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.11--1.41; p \\< 0.001), and use of diuretic (HR 2.13; 95% CI 1.88--2.41; p \\< 0.001). Data analysis using the Cox regression model incorporating the non-linear effect of KA dosage on the composite outcome risk shows that the HR of a daily dosage of more than 5.5 tablets relative to the unsuitable dose period was 0.61 (p = 0.0225) 删除20:<u></u>. For the composite outcome, our Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates also had a good validity (C-index 0.81; ). Again, it still showed an accumulated dose-dependent effect of KA on improving the composite outcome after daily use of more than 5.5 tablets. In line with our main findings, this suggests that adequate supplementation of KA may reduce the composite outcome risk.\n\n【51】Comparison of the effect of KA supplementation on the risk of long-term dialysis and composite outcome under a framework of subgroup analysis \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】To investigate the consistency in the beneficial effect of KA supplementation among different groups in advanced CKD patients, we conducted subgroup analysis. We found that KA supplementation was consistently associated with a much lower risk of long-term dialysis and composite outcome across broad varieties of patient groups with respect to baseline comorbidity as DM, HTN and nephrotic syndrome 删除20:<u></u>. In sensitivity analysis, we found that the estimated effect of KA supplementation was similar when we restricted analysis to patients receiving ESA therapy persistently 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【53】![HRs of study outcomes among patients with advanced CKD, and subgroup analysis with respect to premorbid risk further adjusted for age and gender.\\\n(A) Long-term dialysis and (B) long-term dialysis or all-cause mortality. (Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CKD, chronic kidney disease, HR, hazard ratio)]\n\n【54】Characteristics of patient group validated by database attributed from CAKs \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【55】From patients with CKD followed up in CAKs from Taipei Tzu Chi hospital, and National Taiwan University Hospital and its 2 affiliated hospitals (National Taiwan University Hospital Yun-Lin branch, southern Taiwan, and National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, central Taiwan) during January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2015, we identified 655 patients with advanced CKD with serum creatinine more than 6 mg/dL. Sampled 62 patients received KA supplementation. The renal dietitians assessed the food intake of these patients using measuring bowls and food models. For calculating the amount of dietary protein per day, 3 day recall method was adopted. Renal dieticians calculated the amount of dietary protein per day using the Taiwan Food Composition database provided by the Taiwanese government. After 3 months of multidisciplinary nutritional education (before receiving KA supplement), the mean amount of dietary protein per day of KA user was 0.69 ± 0.05 g/kg per day.\n\n【56】The diagnosis of DM and HTN in NHI claims data were well validated . Since NHI reimbursement regulation is strict, patients who did not change their diet to meet their bodies' lower protein needs as nutritionist's suggestion could not be candidate for KA treatment. Advanced CKD patients who have good adherence to LPD appeared to be a selected group of patients, and therefore the clinical characteristic of these patients were different from that in other reports. We validated the prevalence of DM and HTN by analyzing data attributed from CAKs as mentioned above. Among 62 patients with advanced CKD on LPD received KA supplementation, 18 patients had a diagnosis of DM (29.0%) and 41 had HTN (66.1%). This result was consistent with our data that the prevalence of DM and HTN in these selected groups of patients were lower than previous reports.\n\n【57】We also validated the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in advanced CKD patients (serum creatinine higher than 6 mg/dL) with and without KA supplementation. The decline in eGFR \\[using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation\\] after 3 months of multidisciplinary nutritional education in KA users and nonusers were 2.17 ± 3.19 mL/min/1.73m2 and 1.16 ± 1.52 mL/min/1.73m2, respectively (p\\<0.0001). KA supplementation seemed to be highly selected in real world practice. Therefore, we only enrolled patient who ever received KA to avoid indication bias.\n\n【58】Discussion \n==========\n\n【59】Our results, derived from a large population cohort, provide evidence that KA supplementation during LPD may reduce the risk of commencing long-term dialysis or of developing the composite outcome in patients with advanced CKD, especially when used at an appropriate dosage. After a mean follow-up period of 1.57 years, KA supplementation with LPD decreased the risk of initiating long-term dialysis by 46%, and reduced the composite outcome risk in patients with advanced CKD by 51%. These benefits remained significant after subgroup analysis with respect to baseline comorbidity.\n\n【60】KA ameliorates the risk of long-term dialysis \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【61】LPD shows the benefits of slowing kidney deterioration. However, it exposes patients to the risk of protein malnutrition . Potential strategies to avoid protein-energy wasting include supplementing the LPD with essential nutrients or supplements that are specifically designed for CKD patients.\n\n【62】Studies on animals with CKD showed that LPD supplemented with KA is more effective than an LPD alone in protecting remnant kidneys from progressive injury . Compared with the LPD group, long term co-administration of an LPD and KA in CKD patients decreased the level of plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine and delayed the progression of renal failure . The declining slopes of GFR during the LPD and KA period were significantly lower than those during the period of LPD alone .\n\n【63】Especially in older patients, dialysis may be associated with increased mortality risk and healthcare cost as compared with conservative care. Renal replacement therapy can safely be deferred beyond 1 year by very LPD (0.3 g/kg) in advanced CKD patients. Similarly, as shown in an Italian study, dietary protein restriction and KA supplementation could postpone the initiation of dialysis in elderly patients with CKD for about 1 year without increasing the risk of either death or hospitalization . In the Hungarian KA Cohort Study, an LPD supplemented with KA could reduce the CKD progression rate.\n\n【64】Safely postponed initiation of dialysis could, on average, correspond to 21,180 euro/patient in the first, 6500 euro/patient in the second, and 682 euro/patient in the third year of treatment, with a significant net benefit in favor of dietary protein restriction with KA supplementation . Postponing dialysis therapy should be cost saving because the incidence of stage 5 CKD grows continuously and causes enormous treatment costs. LPD with KA supplementation allows health care systems to save economic resources.\n\n【65】Dose-response analysis regarding KA supplementation \n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】To the best our knowledge, our study is the largest cohort study to date investigating the effectiveness of supplementing LPD with KA, and the first to conduct dose-response analysis regarding KA supplementation and outcome in patients with advanced predialysis CKD. Our findings reveal the importance of the dose-response effect regarding KA supplementation of LPD to improve the outcome. The association between the cumulative dose and the risk of long-term dialysis or the composite outcome in patients with advanced CKD deserves attention. This study suggests that supplementary KA of more than 5.5 tablets daily could reduce the risk of undesired outcomes; many of the enrollees in our cohort underuse KA, which has no beneficial effect on preserving kidney function. This suggests that underuse of KA may be a problem that calls for more attention in medical practice.\n\n【67】A recently published randomized, controlled trial by Garneata et al. compared the safety and efficacy of ketoanalogue---supplemented vegetarian very low---protein diet (KD, 0.3 g/kg vegetable proteins per day) with conventional LPD (0.6 g/kg proteins per day) among patients with a stable estimated GFR\\<30 mL/min/1.73 m^2^. At 18 months of follow-up, compared with the LPD group, fewer patients in the KD group required RRT (30 versus 11 percent). The dose of ketoanalogues was 1 tablet per 5 kilogram body weight per day in that study. Noteworthy is the concern that Ketosteril with a maximum total dose of six tablets daily could yield a therapeutic effect or not, since six tablets daily is approximately equivalent to 1 tablet per 10 kilogram body weight per day, according to the maximum Taiwan NHI reimbursement regulations. Chen et al. conducted a prospective, group-comparison study enrolled patients with serum creatinine more than 6 mg/dL. In their study, treatment with a low dose (Ketosteril one tablet/10 kg/day) of KA in CKD patients was not inferior to a standard dose (Ketosteril one tablet/5 kg/day) in preventing the progression of renal failure after 6-month observation. Further studies are required to confirm the dose-response relationship.\n\n【68】The benefits of KA \n------------------\n\n【69】Advanced CKD is not infrequently associated with protein-energy wasting and malnutrition. KA has positive effects on protein metabolism, independent of the amount of dietary protein intake. Leucine as well as ketoleucine (a component of KA) plays a central role in promoting muscle protein synthesis by suppressing protein catabolism, with no change in the rate of protein synthesis . Oral supplementation of branched-chain amino acids can reduce anorexia sensation and significantly improves overall nutritional status in elderly malnourished hemodialysis patients . In an observational study, malnourished advanced CKD patients treated with a KA supplement  had increased body weight, body mass index, serum albumin levels, and alleviated Subjective Global Assessment scores and appetite scores.\n\n【70】Hyperphosphatemia is linked to high all-cause mortality, adverse cardiac outcome, and rapid decline in renal function in CKD patients \\[--\\]. An LPD reduces phosphate intake, while KA is provided as calcium salts which reduces phosphate serum levels through formation of insoluble calcium phosphate in the intestines. Dietary protein restriction with supplemental KA was shown to significantly diminish proteinuria in CKD patients . Furthermore, regardless of drug class, for each 30% reduction in albuminuria the risk of ESRD decreased by 23.7%, and could further result in reduction of cardiovascular risks and heart failure . KA supplemented LPD is associated with increased serum bicarbonate levels , which in turn could improve nutritional status . Long term co-administration of an LPD and KA in CKD patients decreased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels , thus attenuating endothelial dysfunction. This could slow kidney function progression and reduce all-cause mortality, and thus have a favorable effect on the composite outcome.\n\n【71】Study strengths and limitations \n-------------------------------\n\n【72】A strength of our study is that the NHI database has a large national sample size and a long follow-up. Therefore, our analysis takes into account time-varying covariates and dose-response effect regarding KA supplementation, which can enrich the scope of future nutritional research in this field. However, our study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the NHI research database does not contain information on self-pay use of medications and several potential confounders, including body mass index, smoking status, nutritional condition, data of proteinuria, serum bicarbonate, and the adequacy of glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control. One study enrolled 3,320 advanced CKD patients in Taiwan showed that the overall mean BMI in male and female patients were 24.8 ± 3.4 kg/m^2^ and 24.3 ± 3.9 kg/m^2^, respectively . Moreover, as in all observational studies using electronic databases, we were unable to confirm whether patients actually took the dispensed medications. Second, indications for dialysis and the decision of whether to receive dialysis is a complex issue that depends on several factors which are beyond the scope of this study. Generally, the clinical decision to start dialysis is taken late in Taiwan . Although this makes no difference to survival compared with early dialysis, it provides the opportunity to observe the positive effect of supplemental KA. Third, this study design is a retrospective, observational cohort study; therefore it has inherent limitations in attributing improved outcomes to KA supplementation. Fourth, patients with acute kidney injury who had transient creatinine levels of more than 6 mg/dL were possibly included in this database. Therefore, we conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to restrict the analysis to patients receiving ESA therapy persistently at 2 or more consecutive ambulatory care visits, and the results were not materially changed. Furthermore, use of a serum creatinine level as a major inclusion criterion is also likely to lead to select the higher proportion of women than men in this cohort. However, in our subgroup analyses 删除20:<u></u>, KA supplementation was consistently associated with a much lower risk of long-term dialysis and composite outcome independent of age, sex and baseline comorbidities. Finally, the generalizability of our data is limited to the population of patients with advanced CKD who were receiving ESA therapy. These results may not be applicable to all patients with advanced CKD.\n\n【73】Conclusions \n===========\n\n【74】Our study represents the largest national cohort study of long-term KA supplementation in advanced CKD patients. KA supplementation may substantially reduce the risk of commencing long-term dialysis or developing the composite outcome in advanced CKD patients on an LPD. Importantly, the favorable outcome of KA supplementation is evident only when its dosage is appropriate. Prescriptions corresponding to more than 5.5 tablets of KA daily are warranted. KA supplementation provides an additional therapeutic strategy to slow down the progression of CKD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Topoisomerases play an ambivalent role in nuclear genome maintenance: Deficiency compromises gene transcription, replication and chromosome segregation, while the inherent DNA-cleavage activity of the enzymes endangers DNA integrity. Indeed, many DNA-damaging agents act through enhancing topoisomerase DNA cleavage. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clearly requires topoisomerase activity for transcription and replication, because it is a closed, double-stranded DNA molecule. Three topoisomerases have so far been found in mammalian mitochondria (I, IIβ, IIIα), but their precise role in mtDNA metabolism, mitochondrial maintenance and respiratory function remains mostly unclear. It is a reasonable surmise that these enzymes exhibit similar ambiguity with respect to genome maintenance and gene transcription as their nuclear counterparts. Here, we review what is known about the physiological roles of mitochondrial topoisomerases and draft three scenarios of how these enzymes possibly contribute to ageing-related mtDNA attrition and respiratory chain dysfunction. These scenarios are: mtDNA attrition by exogenously stimulated topoisomerase DNA cleavage, unbalancing of mitochondrial and nuclear transcription by direct effects on mitochondrial transcription, and contributions to enhanced mtDNA entanglement and recombination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "25c37b89-4c57-4fae-b88e-748b1c0c7f3a", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction \n============\n\n【1】Sub-Saharan African countries are in a process of a rapid epidemiological transition, away from infectious diseases, towards non-communicable diseases as leading causes of death . Such transition in disease pattern is generally attributed to rural-to-urban shifts in adult lifestyle and typically involves changes in diet, cigarette smoking and lack of exercise . There is a growing body of evidence however, suggesting that increased susceptibility to chronic diseases in adulthood has a developmental basis, originating in fetal life , The rapid development and shaping of the phenotype that occurs in utero is highly sensitive to environmental - in particular, nutritional -- perturbations, leading to reduced functional capacity, altered metabolism and hormone production , This is considered an important underlying mechanism ,  explaining why adults born small -- a proxy for fetal starvation - are at increased risks for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes ,\n\n【2】The role of undernutrition during gestation for future health in children and adults has previously been evaluated in different countries --. However, besides data from European birth cohorts from the second world war --, --, there is very limited information on the effects of fetal famine from other parts of the world, and with a follow-up time reaching beyond young adulthood. In particular, there is a lack of long-term follow-up data from sub-Saharan Africa, a continent with an unresolved situation with ongoing maternal-infant undernutrition, a recent and quick introduction of obesity-enhancing lifestyle factors and a rapidly increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension , --. Therefore, the strength of a link between poor fetal nutrition and later adult diseases, would be of great interest to clarify in this part of the world also.\n\n【3】The study aim was to determine the risks for hypertension, diabetes and overweight forty years after fetal and infant exposure to the famine hitting Biafra during the Nigerian civil war通用删除7(英):<u> (1967--1970)</u> .\n\n【4】Methods \n=======\n\n【5】This observational study is based on the findings from a cohort of 1,339 subjects, belonging to the ethnic group Igbo, who were born between 1965 and 1973, i.e. before, during and after the Biafran famine.\n\n【6】Ethics statement \n----------------\n\n【7】Ethical approval for the study was given by the Ethics Committee of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, and the Regional Ethical Vetting Board, Stockholm, Sweden. Informed consent (verbal and written in English, translated to Igbo if necessary) was obtained from all participants.\n\n【8】The Nigerian civil war and the Biafran famine \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】The Nigerian civil war broke out on 6 July 1967, after the Igbo people in the south-eastern provinces had declared independence as the Republic of Biafra. The war was a culmination of ethnic, economic, and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. Disapproving of the secession, Nigerian forces rapidly pushed the Biafrans back into a small enclave. Inflow of food to this enclave was cut off. The result was extensive famine among the Igbos, regarded as one of the great nutritional disasters of modern times . The war ended on 15 January 1970.\n\n【10】Of the 1 to 3 million Igbos that are estimated to have lost their lives, only a small fraction (10%) died of military violence. The majority succumbed to starvation. The nutritional emergency was most critical in the Biafran enclave, in which approximately 7 million people - mostly refugees - resided. In August 1968 the first international relief operations were launched but the amount of food provided was clearly not sufficient and the great majority of the Igbos did not get access to this relief food .\n\n【11】Setting and participants \n------------------------\n\n【12】This follow-up study took place between June 27 and July 31, 2009. All shops at the six major market places of Enugu, the former Biafran capital, were systematically covered. People at the markets were actively contacted at their work place. The selection of participants was restricted to men and non-pregnant women who knew they were born in the southeast of Nigeria between 1965 and 1973. All subjects reported year of birth and 73% reported at least month and year. To confirm the birth year specified by the subject, we asked each person for a short review of his or her family history during the Nigerian civil war. The vast majority (more than 90%) of eligible subjects accepted participation in the study. It was not possible to do a systematic categorization of those who declined.\n\n【13】Data collection was conducted by MH, PT, PU, as well as doctors and medical students from the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital . Recruitment was performed by all team members, whereas measurements of blood pressure and p-glucose were obtained by a smaller group (n = 7) of specially trained investigators. Subjects were asked about level of education, current smoking, previously diagnosed hypertension or diabetes mellitus, and treatment for these conditions. Level of education was categorized as none, primary, secondary or higher education. There was no available information on birth weight or infant nutrition.\n\n【14】All measurements were performed according to predefined standard operating procedures. Participants were instructed to rest seated for at least five minutes before blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured. Two readings were taken three minutes apart in the left arm using a validated  automated oscillometric device (Omron M6 HEM-7001-E, Omron Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). A third reading was taken if the first and second BP differed more than five mmHg and mean systolic and diastolic values were calculated and defined as the subject\\'s BP. Subjects having a systolic BP (SBP)≥140 mmHg, or a diastolic BP (DBP)≥90mmHg or who had a normal blood pressure but were pharmacologically treated for hypertension (n = 41 of 1,339), were categorized as hypertensive. Subjects having a SBP≥160 mmHg, and a DBP≥100 mmHg, were categorized as severely hypertensive. Random plasma glucose (p-glucose) was measured with a minimally invasive sampling technique (Abbott Freestyle Lite, Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd, Oxon, UK). A random p-glucose of 11.1 mmol/l or higher was classified as diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was defined as random p-glucose between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/l . A subgroup (n = 75) reported no food intake for at least 8 hours prior to investigation. In this group IGT was defined as p-glucose between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/l and diabetes mellitus as a p-glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l . Height and weight were obtained from all subjects using height sticks and digital scales, respectively, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Overweight was defined as a BMI over 25 kg/m^2^ and obesity as BMI over 30 kg/m^2^. Waist circumference was measured with a measuring tape placed around the abdomen at the level of the upper hip bone, and considered as an indicator of central obesity.\n\n【15】All participants were briefly counselled about their current health status. Hypertensive or glucose intolerant subjects were referred to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital for further investigation and treatment.\n\n【16】Categorization according to exposure to famine \n----------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Subjects born between 1965 and 1967 were categorized as being exposed to famine in early childhood. Subjects born between 1968 and January 1970 (end of war) were categorized as being exposed to famine in fetal life and in infancy. Subjects born immediately after the surrender of Biafra were left uncategorized because of uncertainties in their exposure to famine and local variations in nutritional relief. Accordingly, subjects born between 1971 and 1973 and after the transitional period were categorized as being unexposed to famine.\n\n【18】Efforts to limit any potential bias included investigator-driven recruitment of participants (in contrast to subjects actively seeking participation in the study), direct assessments of outcomes with non-operator dependent methods and predefined standardized operational procedures applied by all data collectors.\n\n【19】Statistical methods \n-------------------\n\n【20】We aimed to include 630 individuals in each group, based on an assumption of a standard deviation of 19 mmHg and a group difference in systolic blood pressure of 3 mmHg or more, given 80% power and a statistical significance level of 0.05. Because of exhausted recruitment at the six study markets, data collection was ended when 1,339 subjects had been included in the study. All subjects were included in logistic regression analyses according to year of birth whereas in group wise logistic regression analyses, the 173 subjects born during the transition from famine to nutritional relief, i.e. from February to December 1970, were excluded.\n\n【21】Data are presented as means (SD), proportions (%) and odds ratios (95% CI). Group differences were tested using ANOVA and chi-squared test. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and for evaluation of relations between exposure (fetal-infant famine), potential confounders (sex, smoking, educational level) and outcomes (blood pressure, p-glucose, and BMI). As several previous reports have shown that the associations between early life exposures and adult outcomes vary in relation to sex and adult body size , --, we also stratified our analyses on sex and BMI. A p-value \\<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Analyses were performed using STATA/IC 11.0 (Stata Corp LP, TX, US). To evaluate gender differences analyses stratified according to sex were also performed.\n\n【22】Results \n=======\n\n【23】Age differed among the three groups due to inclusion criteria. The proportion of men varied between 66 and 74% in the three groups and was highest in the group born after the famine. Smoking occurred predominantly in men and the proportion of smokers differed in the three groups, Educational levels were found to be distributed equally between groups (p = 0.38) and overall, no education was found in 1%, primary in 34%, secondary in 52% and higher education in 13%.\n\n【24】10.1371/journal.pone.0013582.t001\n\n【25】###### Subject characteristics.\n\n【26】删除20:<u>!</u>\n\n【27】                                     Born 1965--1967   Born 1968--   Born 1971--1973              Feb--Dec 1970\n  --------------------------------- ----------------- ------------- ----------------- ---------- -----------------\n  Number of subjects通用删除7(英):<u> (1,339)</u>           388             292             486                         173\n  Sex, male                             246 (66%)       189 (66%)       353 (74%)        0.01       112 (65%)\n  Age                                  43.0 (0.8)      40.5 (0.6)      37.0 (0.8)        N/A           39\n  Smoking, yes (%)                      46 (12%)         27 (9%)        81 (17%)        0.007       19 (11%)\n  Education, N (%)                                                                           \n  None                                   6 (2%)          4 (1%)          5 (1%)          0,38        4 (2%)\n  Primary                               138 (38%)       80 (30%)        152 (33%)                   46 (28%)\n  Secondary                             172 (48%)       152 (57%)       239 (52%)                   97 (58%)\n  Higher                                44 (12%)        33 (12%)        60 (13%)                    19 (11%)\n  Current data                                                                               \n  Systolic blood pressure, mm Hg        125通用删除7(英):<u> (17)</u>        129通用删除7(英):<u> (19)</u>         122(16)       \\<0.0001     124通用删除7(英):<u> (19)</u>\n  Diastolic blood pressure, mm Hg        81通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>         84通用删除7(英):<u> (12)</u>         79通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>       \\<0.0001      81通用删除7(英):<u> (12)</u>\n  Heart rate, bpm                        75通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>         76通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>         75通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>         0.27        77通用删除7(英):<u> (10)</u>\n  Random p-glucose, mmol/l              6.1 (1.6)       6.4 (2.0)       6.1 (1.8)        0.04       6.3 (2.6)\n  Weight, kg                           76.2 (12.9)     78.5 (13.4)     77.0 (13.4)       0.08      76.3 (15.4)\n  Height, cm                             169通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>         169通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>         170通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>        0.034        169通用删除7(英):<u> (8)</u>\n  Waist circumference, cm                93通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>         94通用删除7(英):<u> (13)</u>         91通用删除7(英):<u> (11)</u>        0.0011       92通用删除7(英):<u> (12)</u>\n  BMI, kg/m^2^                         26.7 (4.7)      27.5 (4.6)      26.5 (4.4)       0.016      26.6 (5.1)\n\n【28】Data are mean (SD) or number (%) of subjects. p-values for ANOVA or chi-squared test across groups.

Stratified analyses on sex showed that this effect was confined to women .\n\n【50】Discussion \n==========\n\n【51】This study showed higher BP, higher p-glucose and higher weight in middle-aged Nigerian people exposed to severe undernutrition in utero and in infancy. Comparing unexposed offspring with that of starving pregnant women, fetal-infant undernutrition was associated with significant increases in the prevalence of hypertension (from 9.5 to 24%, defined as SBP≥140 mmHg) and impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (from 8.0 to 13%). Famine in early childhood was also associated with an increased prevalence of adult blood pressure in the hypertensive range (from 9.5 to 16%). Given the additive effects of early famine and adult overweight , early undernutrition followed by later overnutrition seem to provide two fundaments for the adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes seen in today\\'s Nigeria, and as also previously described in an Indian cohort通用删除7(英):<u> (14)</u>.\n\n【52】Our results are in line with previous epidemiological and experimental studies suggesting that fetal undernutrition contributes significantly to cardiovascular disease risk in adult life , In contrast to observations in European birth cohorts --, --, the effects of fetal undernutrition seem to be more pronounced and emerge at an earlier age in this sub-Saharan cohort. These differences could reflect variations in exposure and population differences. Such an explanation may not necessarily be confined to susceptibility for and degree of fetal-infant undernutrition alone. Accelerated growth in later childhood ,  and a high BMI in adult life have previously been found to have a stronger adverse effect on hypertension ,  and diabetes ,  in people who were small at birth. The mismatch between the environment that people in urban Nigeria now live in, characterized by a high-calorie-high-carbohydrate diet, and the one within which they evolved during the Biafran famine, may therefore be largely responsible for the present increase in disease risks . Our finding of a higher current weight and waist circumference, and a higher BMI in adults exposed to fetal-infant famine  imply that accelerated growth later in childhood may be in the pathway between early under-nutrition and later metabolic syndrome. Such an explanation may also be valid for the finding that glucose tolerance and blood pressure in 35-year-old Gambians (predominantly women) who remained fit and lean, showed no association with moderate to severe malnutrition in early life . However, as we found no attenuation of the excess odds for adult hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance after adjusting for current BMI , the association between fetal-infant famine and adult metabolic syndrome cannot be attributed to accelerated childhood growth alone .\n\n【53】Gender differences in developmental programming have previously been described . In our study, both men and women exposed to fetal-infant undernutrition exhibited higher odds ratios for elevated blood pressure at follow-up. An excess risk for IGT was also found in men whereas power limitations unable conclusions regarding the risk for IGT in women exposed to early famine. Conversely, a significant excess risk for overweight was only seen in women exposed to fetal-infant undernutrition. Although there are reports of increased susceptibility for fetal programming of BP in males , sex differences in the association between birth weight and BP have been questioned . Experimental data suggest possible sex specific mechanisms in fetal programming of insulin secretion and insulin resistance , mechanisms that may be relevant in explaining our findings of gender differences in glucose tolerance.\n\n【54】The strengths of this study include the design with prospectively set inclusion criteria and active enrolment of a large cohort of customers and traders at markets, i.e. places where many people in the urban areas gather and work, as other sectors of employment and sites for purchasing of everyday goods are not very developed in this part of the world. Thus we believe that the study cohort is representative for urban settings in sub-Saharan Africa and at highest risk for the present epidemic in non-communicable diseases. Categorization was based on date of birth -- i.e. exposure to famine in early life. In addition, since subjects born in the transitional period were excluded, there was no late gestational overlap with famine in the unexposed group. The follow-up time was sufficiently long to establish relations to outcomes that are directly related to adult cardiovascular disease. Finally, we addressed the possibility that smoking confounded our results .\n\n【55】Although heritability for birth weight has been estimated to range from 25% to 40% , and although some experimental data suggest that birth weight may fail to reflect intrauterine factors associated with later disease risk , birth weight is the most commonly used proxy for fetal undernutrition. Therefore, a limitation of our study, shared with other famine studies , is the lack of anthropometric data at birth and in infancy. There are no records from which these data can be retrieved. In addition, we have no data on mother and infant nutrition. Given that inflow of food to Biafra was cut off, it can be assumed that access to infant formula was extremely limited and that most infants were exclusively breastfed.\n\n【56】It is likely that survival of the healthiest pregnant women occurred during the Biafran famine. The most severe cases of fetal and infant undernutrition are also likely to have died prior to follow-up, either in early childhood or from the increasing cardiovascular morbidity reported from adults residing in the area . Some misclassification may have occurred as the nutritional situation of Biafra gradually deteriorated, making it difficult to pinpoint the start of famine. If anything, these limitations may have introduced a conservative bias into our study, underestimating the true long-term effects of undernutrition in fetal life and in infancy.\n\n【57】Before the war, Biafra differed from most developing nations because it had a good supply of food and water, and sound public health policies with many physicians, nurses, hospitals, and clinics . Already months after the war, there are reports of vast improvement in the nutritional situation . Our results are therefore most likely reflecting differences in adult health outcomes after severe early famine as compared to a significantly better nutritional situation in early life.\n\n【58】The external validity of data from a convenience sample from market places can also be discussed. The method of recruiting participants will have missed subsistence farmers and others not attending the markets, whose nutritional status and other factors are likely to differ from market people. We note that the prevalences of hypertension, diabetes and obesity reported herein are similar to those reported from comparable urban and rural Nigerian cohorts ,\n\n【59】The study design, i.e. comparing long-term outcomes in people born before, during or after famine, has previously been used --. By inclusion, the subjects in the unexposed group were youngest. As the prevalence of hypertension and glucose intolerance increases with age, some associations with birth year might be expected. However, given the size of the effect and that the OR\\'s for all outcomes after fetal-infant famine were significantly lower not only in younger, but also in older people, trends in disease-risks over time and cohort effects cannot be the only explanation for our findings.\n\n【60】Previous studies indicate that a nutritional insult - during gestation or the first few months of postnatal life - may be important for later outcome and disease risk , Although the resolution and exposure data of this study do not allow for a detailed analysis of the timing of the insult, the striking dose-response effect found between birth during years of famine and over-risk for hypertension in adult life  suggests a causal relationship. The Biafran famine was characterized by a severe scarcity of proteins, manifested in the vast number of infants and children suffering from kwashiorkor . Experimental models suggest that protein deficit in utero may programme abnormal glucose homeostasis and vascular endothelial dysfunction, whereas results are less consistent with regard to programming of high blood pressure , Besides the nutritional insult, pregnant women in former Biafra were living under conditions of war. Such stress for mothers and infants could also contribute to higher blood pressure in later life .\n\n【61】The implications of our findings are important. On a population level, a 3.3 mmHg increase in mean SBP and 2 mmHg in DBP can be translated into an estimated increase in cardiovascular deaths by 25% and stroke by 32% . Given the combination of large blood pressure effects and increased rates of glucose intolerance resting on a basis of prevalent obesity before middle age , which is characteristic for Nigeria today, it is not surprising that disability and deaths from stroke and coronary heart disease are rapidly increasing. To adequately address this trend in non-communicable diseases on a community level requires a developed health care infrastructure providing life-long treatment and follow-up. The increasing burden of chronic diseases therefore poses a massive challenge to the already crippled health care systems of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n【62】In summary, our study demonstrates a fetal-infant contribution to adult hypertension and glucose intolerance in an African cohort. It can be assumed that fetal and infant undernutrition is a significant contributor to the increasing prevalence of hypertension and glucose intolerance also in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, prevention of fetal and infant undernutrition should be given high priority in national health, education, and economic agendas to limit the increase of non-communicable diseases in many African countries. Given that the highest risk for hypertension was found in those undernourished in early life and then growing overweight, it is appropriate to consider that preventing excess growth in later childhood may be as important for reducing adult ill-health as supporting fetal-infant growth.\n\n【63】This study was a collaboration between the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden and University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria.

The majority of research in multitasking has been focusing on individual paradigms, with surprisingly little effort in understanding their relationships. We adopted an individual-difference approach to reveal the limitations underlying multitasking costs measured in different paradigms. Exploratory factor analyses revealed not a general multitasking factor but instead three different processing limitations associated with response selection, retrieval and maintenance of task information, and task-set reconfiguration. The three factors were only weakly correlated with and thus not reducible to common measures of processing speed, working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Males and females excelled in different aspects of multitasking, demonstrating the benefit of using a multifaceted view of multitasking competency in group comparison. Findings of the current study help resolve conflicting results between studies using different paradigms, and form the basis of more comprehensive measurement tools and training protocols covering different aspects of multitasking limitations.

Overexpression of the ErbB-2/Neu receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with increased progression in human breast cancer, yet in breast explant cultures, the ErbB-2/Neu receptor contributes to alveolar differentiation. To examine the consequence of deregulated ErbB-2/Neu activation on epithelial morphogenesis, we have expressed a constitutively activated mutant of ErbB-2/Neu in a Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell model. Using two-dimensional cultures we demonstrate that activated ErbB-2/Neu induces breakdown of cell-cell junctions, increased cell motility and dispersal of epithelial colonies. This correlates with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions and loss of insoluble cell-cell junction complexes involving E-cadherin. Interestingly, a constitutively activated ErbB-2/Neu receptor promotes an invasive morphogenic program in MDCK cells in a three-dimensional matrix. We show that two tyrosines in the carboxy-terminal tail of ErbB-2/Neu, involved in the phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein, are each sufficient to promote epithelial-mesenchymal like transition and enhanced cell motility in two-dimensional culture and cell invasion rather than a morphogenic response in matrix culture.

The questionnaire was filled in anonymously and returned during the meeting days. The questions covered two patient paper cases with schematic drawings of the radiolucency of proximal caries lesions according to bitewing radiographs from 20-year-old patients: one high-caries case and one low-caries case. Dentists' gender, age, working experience and place, and participation in continuing education served as background data. In total, 1,033 dentists completed the questionnaire, 63% were men. Statistical evaluation was by the Chi square test and logistic regression. Respondents were to select from four alternatives the earliest stage in the progression of a lesion at which they would intervene by restorative treatment. For the high-caries case, 77% of the respondents chose to restore a caries lesion confined to enamel; activity in continuing education was the strongest factor (OR = 1.4) to explain dentists' restoring a lesion no earlier than in dentine. For the low-caries case, 32% chose to restore a lesion in enamel. Restoring a lesion no earlier than in dentine was more likely (OR = 1.5) among female dentists.

The primary structure of the isolated oligosaccharides was determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, using homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional techniques. The isolated pentamer and hexamer contained one glucose unit oxidised to a dicarboxyl residue. As the hypochlorite oxidation has occurred at positions C-2 and C-3 of a glucose unit, the introduced carboxyl groups caused ring cleavage between the carbons C-2 and C-3. The ring-cleaved dicarboxyl residue had glycosidic linkages on both sides, implying that this oxidation pathway does not result in depolymerisation. The vicinal coupling constant between H-4 and H-5 in the ring-cleaved dicarboxyl residue was 3.2 Hz, showing that the gauche orientations are preferred. As a result, a different bending of the starch chain is observed and is probably, therefore, one of the reasons why hypochlorite oxidation reduces the tendency to retrogradation.

Radiologic studies of orthopantomography images of children and adolescents].\nDental findings are an important source of information regarding forensic-odontologic determinations of identity and a person's age. A main part of odontologic findings is the judgement of the dental status, including caries and identification of filled teeth. The aim of this study was to answer the question whether fillings of wisdom teeth allow individual age estimation, in particular the age of 18 years or older. The orthopantomograms of 1053 outpatients were evaluated. The patients were aged 14 to 24 years. For each wisdom tooth the values \"decayed\", \"filled\", \"decayed and filled\", or \"not decayed and not filled\" were registered. The data were then calculated using tools of descriptive and inferential statistics in order to provide predictive values for the age to be above or below 18 years. The majority of wisdom teeth in this study group showed neither caries nor fillings. However, the correlation between filled wisdom teeth and an age over 18 years was very high, up to 100%. This study provides for the first time predictive values for the estimation whether a person is 18 years of age depending on the presence of filled wisdom teeth. This finding is a useful tool for determining the age limit of 18 years. The sanitary condition of teeth is dependent from both social and individual circumstances. Therefore, the calculated values also reflect the culture of the population under study.

In this chapter, we describe a label-free mass spectrometry-based screening workflow specifically to detect peptides that contain inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds, followed by elucidation of their primary structure. This method is based on the determination of the normalized isotope shift (NIS) and the normalized mass defect (NMD) of peptides, two parameters which are heavily influenced by the presence of sulfur in a peptide, where cysteines are the main contributing residues. Using ant defensive secretions as an example, we describe the initial fractionation of the venom on strong cation exchange followed by nanoflow HPLC and mass spectrometry. High resolution zoom scan spectra of high-abundance peptides are acquired, allowing an accurate determination of both monoisotopic and average mass, which are essential for calculation of NMD and NIS. Candidate peptides exhibiting relative low NMD and high NIS values are selected for targeted de novo sequencing.

{"seq_id": "1410c7a3-f1f0-49d5-ba85-6c7ee239f913", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background \n==========\n\n【1】The protozoa in the genus Cryptosporidium are important parasitic pathogens causing water and food contamination leading to diarrhoeal disease . Waterborne outbreaks occur globally and have been linked to recreational water exposure and drinking water consumption. Contamination of the waters has been shown to be due to human (wastewater) and animal (livestock and wildlife) sources .\n\n【2】Clinically, cryptosporidiosis may cause profuse and long-lasting (usually 1--2 weeks, ranging from a few days to 4 weeks) but usually self-limiting diarrhoea with abdominal cramping. Chronic or systemic infections are reported in immunodeficient patients. Treatment is usually symptomatic, with no licensed specific therapy in the EU. Repeat infections elicit some degree of immunity .\n\n【3】To date, around 30 species in the genus are identified.Disease in humans is predominantly caused by Cryptosporidium (C.) parvum and hominis . While C. parvum infects a broad spectrum of mammals, C.hominis has a human infection cycle . The oocysts of the parasite represent the infective form which can survive and remain infective for many months outside a host, particularly in moist and cool environments. Oocysts can survive in river sediments and rivers were demonstrated to have acted as transfer medium from livestock to public water supplies. The pathogen is not sensitive to chlorine disinfection as applied in drinking water treatments. Transmission takes place by oral ingestion. The incubation period is 2--10 days and infected persons can excrete the pathogens for several months after symptoms have stopped .\n\n【4】In Germany, by federal law all diagnostic laboratories are obliged to notify the local public health departments of patients with stool tests positive for Cryptosporidium. Between 900 to 1.400 cases have been reported annually between 2008 and 2012 in Germany. Outbreaks resulting in notification were restricted to households or community settings .\n\n【5】Environmental context \n=====================\n\n【6】In late May and early June 2013, extreme river flooding in Eastern Germany began after several days of heavy rain. The river Saale, a tributary of the river Elbe and navigable for inland water transport, overflowed the floodplain and parts of the city centre of Halle (inhabitants 230,000), Saxony Anhalt, Germany. The flooding peaked on 5^th^ June and the city council declared the state of disaster from 3^rd^ to 8^th^ June. The flooding was considered the worst since 1890. It affected central parts of the sewage piping system and damaged sewage pumps in several locations along the river and the floodplain. A central sewage collector tunnel running along the river bank normally removes the wastewaters to a treatment plant northwards and downriver of the city centre. Numerous emergency spillways allow direct efflux from the tunnel into the river in case of extremely high water levels e.g. after heavy rainfall or in case of flooding.\n\n【7】The floodplain bisecting the city represents the central recreational area for the urban population of Halle and includes playgrounds, ponds, parks and sports facilities. Bathing, although officially not approved, is very common at a river beach and other locations, and children have easy water access to the normally gently flowing stream. The area was polluted by the floods and consequently closed to the public for cleaning. The area was reopened to the public in stages from mid-July on and the beach use resumed during the last week of July. The summer holidays in Halle started on 15 July 2013. A period with much sunny and hot summer weather lasted from early July until end of August 2013, likely encouraging the use of the recreational areas in the reopened floodplain.\n\n【8】Outbreak signals \n================\n\n【9】During calendar weeks 32 and 33 (5--18 August), 2013, 24 cases of cryptosporidiosis were notified in the city of Halle. By comparison the annual average in years 2008--12 in Halle was 9 cases. This increase was simultaneously detected by the local health department in Halle and by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, the federal level public health institute in Germany, through application of electronic routine cluster algorithm for outbreak detection. An outbreak investigation team was formed and included public health professionals from the local health department, expert microbiologists for drinking water and recreational water from the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Bad Elster, an expert parasitologist from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and epidemiologists from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). This report describes the epidemiological and microbiologic investigations which aimed to identify the source of the outbreak and recommend control measures.\n\n【10】Methods \n=======\n\n【11】Epidemiological investigation \n-----------------------------\n\n【12】### Initial assessment \n\n【13】For confirmation of the outbreak, laboratories involved in primary stool diagnostics in Halle as well as local general practitioners and paediatricians in Halle were interviewed regarding current sample loads of incoming diarrhoea stools, routine test procedures, laboratory testing frequency and the number (and perceived trends in numbers) of patients presenting with diarrhoea.\n\n【14】Descriptive epidemiology and case finding \n-----------------------------------------\n\n【15】An outbreak case was defined a case as a resident of Halle with gastroenteritis (diarrhoea or vomiting or abdominal cramps) and Cryptosporidium-positive stool (microscopy or antigen detection) with disease onset weeks 27 through 47 and who did not stay outside Halle for more than 7 out of the 2 to 14 days incubation period . Secondary outbreak cases were defined as cases with reported contact to persons with diarrhoea in either their household, kindergarten or school during the two weeks prior to onset of symptoms. The local health authorities published a press release calling on individuals with diarrhoea to see their doctor for stool sampling.\n\n【16】Hypothesis generation \n---------------------\n\n【17】Cases and parents of infant cases were routinely contacted by the public health authority of Halle regarding symptom onset, contact to other cases of gastroenteritis and general exposure assessment as attendance of kindergarten, schools or at other communal facilities. Additionally, a sample of primary cases was interviewed using a standardised explorative questionnaire concerning: disease history, traveling, consumption of drinking water, visits to specific public pools and lakes, visits of play grounds with fountains, animal exposure, activities in previously flooded area, general eating habits, usual grocery shopping and visits of public food places (e.g. ice cream vendors).\n\n【18】Case control study \n------------------\n\n【19】The objective of the case--control study was to test the main hypothesized sources/modes for infection with cryptosporidiosis: activities in the floodplain, visits to swimming pools and such pools where oocysts where detected, the consumption of tap and mineral water and visits to the zoo in the 14 days before symptom-onset.\n\n【20】We recruited primary cases and controls among kindergarten children because this subgroup represented 39/80 (49%) of all primary cases until the start of the study on 5 September. Also they were considered to be approachable comparably quickly via day-care centres. All kindergartens in Halle were informed by the city council and were asked to inform the parents about the study using information material provided by the outbreak investigation team. Cases' parents were interviewed by employees of the RKI via telephone.\n\n【21】The information material provided to the parents contained a weblink to an online questionnaire which could be filled in autonomously and voluntarily.\n\n【22】Control persons were defined as children without symptoms of gastroenteritis (vomiting or diarrhoea) after 1 July 2013 and who did not have a history of travel outside Halle for 7 days or more during the 14 days before symptom-onset. The questionnaire was accessible between 5 and 16 September 2013. For the questioning of control persons we defined a reference observation period from 29 July to 11 August 2013.\n\n【23】Analysis utilised univariable logistic regression adjusted for district of residence. Candidate variables for multivariable logistic regression had a p-value smaller than 0.1 in the univariable analysis. This was calculated using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp LP). In accordance with article 25, section 1, of the German Infection Protection Act of 2001, a formal ethical review process and approval was not required for this investigation of an ongoing outbreak. Data protection and medical ethics standards were adhered to as regulated by law. Parents of controls received a detailed information letter about the study with the invitation to participate online, parents of cases were asked verbal consent before start of the telephone interview.\n\n【24】Microbiological investigation \n-----------------------------\n\n【25】### Human faecal samples \n\n【26】Cryptosporidium-positive faecal samples were referred to the National reference centre for tropical pathogens (NRC) for confirmation of diagnosis and species identification. For confirmation of the genus Cryptosporidium, stool microscopy was performed using faecal smears following formol-ether concentration of stool samples  and subsequent staining by the modified cold Kinyoun acid fast method . In addition, multiplex PCR was performed able to detect Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cyclospora cayetanenesis DNA in faecal samples . For species and subtype identification of Cryptosporidiae, sequencing of PCR amplified DNA fragments of the 18S rRNA and the 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP60) genes was performed \\[-\\].\n\n【27】Environmental samples \n---------------------\n\n【28】In order to trace the source and to monitor the faecal pollution 5 samples were taken from the public drinking water system (27 August 2013), 13 samples from pools of public baths, 12 samples from 10 different sites in the river Saale including lateral branches and 5 samples from other bodies of water in Halle .Figure 1Schematic map of the city of Halle and the Saale river.Table 1Concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts (oocysts/100 litres) in open waters in the floodplain and in public baths in Halle, Germany 2013No. on mapSampling spotBathing waterNumber of oocysts date of sampling27 Aug2 Sept11 Sept24 Sept11 Nov1Pond in floodplain (in Kröllwitz)n12Pond in floodplain (in Regattastrecke)n03Pond in floodplain (Planena)n04River Saale (near sewage plant North)n1485Saale lateral channel Mühlgraben (Street Ochsenbrücke, near beach)y^2^59246046Saale lateral channel Mühlgraben (150 m up-stream from Street Ochsenbrücke)n207Saale lateral channel Mühlgraben (300 m up-stream from Ochsenbrücke, West)n38Saale lateral channel Mühlgraben (300 m upstream from Ochsenbrücke East)n1449Saale lateral channel Mühlgraben (500 m upstream from Ochsenbrücke)n510Saale tributary Wilde Saale (in Gimritz)n511River Saale (in island Rabeninsel)n012River Saale (in island Planenan4Saale tributary Weiße Elstern7Pond outside floodplainy1Pond outside floodplainy0Public bath Ny99 / 0^1^Public bath My0/0/3^1^0/0/1/3^1^Public bath Sy11 / 0^1^36 / 100^11^From different pools.^2^Bathing officially not approved; y = yes, n = no, m = meter.\n\n【29】Sampling and analysis were carried out according to international standards . A portable sampling device was used to pump water samples of 100 l through a membrane filter (PALL-Envirocheck ®). In the laboratory, the oocysts were eluted from the filters with a buffer-tenside mixture on a shaking apparatus. The eluate was centrifuged and the formed pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer. The oocysts were extracted from the suspension by immunomagnetic separation using Dynabeads ® GC Combo (Life Technologies). The separation of the parasite oocysts and the magnetic beads was carried out by changing the pH. The remaining 50 μl suspension was transferred to a glass slide, fixed with methanol and stained with FITC (fluoresceien isothiocyanate)-labelled monoclonal antibodies (BFT) and DAPI (4\\',6 -diamidino −2- phenylindole). Preparations were screened using a fluorescence microscope at appropriate wavelengths.\n\n【30】To identify Cryptosporidium species from the water samples, molecular investigations were performed in the United Kingdom's Cryptosporidium Reference Unit at Public Health Wales. The reference unit received the only three remaining IMS-concentrated and purified aliquots (drawn 12 November 2013,) of river water (around 50 μl each) from the UBA, Germany. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested PCR SSU rRNA gene analysis as described previously .\n\n【31】Results \n=======\n\n【32】Epidemiological investigation \n-----------------------------\n\n【33】### Initial assessment \n\n【34】In initial interviews with physicians in Halle 7 of 11 (64%) report an unusually high incidence of diarrhoea among their patients. Interviews with laboratories reveal that the different institutes do not have uniform eligibility criteria for cryptosporidiosis stool testing based; 3 out of 4 major laboratories serving Halle perform tests only upon specific request or automatically only in children \\<2 years (2/4 laboratories).\n\n【35】Descriptive epidemiology \n------------------------\n\n【36】Altogether 167 cases were reported over a period of 17 weeks. First cases occurred during week 29 删除21:<u></u>. Case numbers strongly increased from week 31, peaked in week 34 with 36 cases and strongly decreased afterwards. Cases appeared in all 5 districts of the city 删除21:<u></u>. Incidence was highest in the central district and lowest in the eastern district. The central district comprises the most frequented recreational areas and the beach in the floodplain, while the eastern district is the only one which is not directly adjacent to the river. The cases' median age was 8 years (range: 0--77 years), 81/167 (49%) patients were male, 60/167 (36%) were children attending kindergartens. Altogether 40/167 (24%) were classified as potential secondary cases, and 21/60 (35%) of the secondary cases were from kindergartens.Figure 2Weekly distribution of date of onset of disease of reported Cryptosporidiosis cases during an outbreak in Halle (Salle) 2013 (n = 167).Table 2Distribution of cases in urban districts during the outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis in Halle (Saale), Germany 2013DistrictCases (% of total cases)District populationIncidence (in 100,000)Centre36 (21.6)39,74891North34 (20.4)39,95585East4 (2.4)14,78927West39 (23.4)67,94957South45 (26.5)68,39066unknown9 (5.4)Total167通用删除7(英):<u> (100)</u>230,83173\n\n【37】A cluster of 16 diarrhoeal cases in children confirmed as Cryptosporidium by laboratory analysis was detected in two kindergartens sharing the same premises. In the rural district Saalekreis which is surrounding the city of Halle, 23 cases were reported during weeks 27 through 47 compared to the annual average for 2008 to 2012: 5 cases/yr.\n\n【38】Hypothesis generation \n---------------------\n\n【39】In exploratory interviews with 16 parents of primary cases, 12/16 (75%) reported activities (playing and picknicking) in the previously flooded areas, 10/16 (63%) reported using at least one of the three public swimming pools that tested positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts during the course of the investigation and 5/16 (31%) reported visits to either the public zoo or a different petting zoo. During the interviews it became clear that background rates of those activities were high due to the hot weather conditions and school holidays. Consumption of unboiled tap water, was reported by 9/16 (56%) while several respondents strictly denied this due to perceived bad taste. Based on these findings, an analytical epidemiological study of the exposure among diseased and non-diseased was launched to test the relevance of the following factors: activities in the previously overflowed floodplain, visits to public swimming pools and the zoo and consumption of tap water.\n\n【40】Case control study \n------------------\n\n【41】For the case control study we were able to contact 39 case patients of whom 20 (51%) met the study case definition and agreed to participate. Altogether 112 individuals responded as controls, 19 (17%) were excluded because of a history of diarrhoea after 1 July 2013, 15 (13%) because of a history of traveling outside Halle, 5 (4%) who did not provide a post code of their living address in Halle and another 12 (11%) who turned out to be actually not attending a kindergarten, resulting in 61 (54%) control persons. Cases and controls did not differ significantly in age and gender (p-value for gender: 0.2; p-value for age: 0.8).\n\n【42】Thirteen of the 20 (65%) cryptosporidiosis cases compared to 23/61 (38%) of the controls reported visits to previously flooded areas 删除21:<u></u> resulting in an odds ratio (OR) of 4.9 (95% CI 1.4-18.0) in univariable analysis. Nine cases (45%) indicated visits to the zoo (OR 2.6; 95% CI 0.9-7.6).Table 3Exposures related to Cryptosporidiosis among infants during an outbreak in Halle, Germany 2013 (univariable and multivariable logistic regression)Univariable\\Multivariable\\ExposureCases exposed (n/N, %)Controls exposed (n/N, %)OR95% CIOR95% CIStays in flooded area13/20通用删除7(英):<u> (65)</u>23/61通用删除7(英):<u> (38)</u>4.921.35-18.025.501.40-21.56Use of a swimming pool where Cryptosporidium oozysts were detected5/20通用删除7(英):<u> (25)</u>17/61通用删除7(英):<u> (28)</u>0,80.26-2.62\\--Visits to the zoo9/20通用删除7(英):<u> (45)</u>14/61通用删除7(英):<u> (23)</u>2.630.91-7.633.200.85-12.07Consumption of tap water9/20通用删除7(英):<u> (45)</u>41/61通用删除7(英):<u> (67)</u>0.400.14-1.22\\--\\Adjusted for district of residence, OR: Odds ratio, 95% CI: 95%-Confidence interval.\n\n【43】Other variables were not related to cryptosporidiosis. In stratified analysis, 7/9 (78%) cases who visited the zoo, also visited the flooded areas. In multivariable analysis, visits to the floodplain remained the sole statistically significant risk factor (OR 5.5; 95% CI 1.4-22).\n\n【44】Microbiological investigation \n-----------------------------\n\n【45】### Human faecal samples \n\n【46】Of 170 specimens tested positive for Cryptosporidium antigen in primary diagnostics, 114 (67%) were sent to the NRC for species identification. In 106/114 (93%) presence of Cryptosporidium was detected by PCR, in 8/114 (7%) PCR was negative. Other coccidia such as Cyclospora cayetanensis or Cystospora belli as well as other diarrhoea-inducing protozoan parasites such as Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica were not detected. Molecular typing of 32/106 samples revealed that all of them represented Cryptosporidium hominis of the subtype IbA9G2 corresponding to GenBank accession number AY166807.\n\n【47】Environmental samples \n---------------------\n\n【48】No Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the public water supply. Oocysts were found on 27 August 2013 in two public baths which were subsequently closed 删除21:<u></u>. On 11 September a high concentration of 592 oocysts/100 litres was detected in an inner-city lateral channel of the river Saale called Mühlgraben, only a couple of metres from a frequently used river-beach and lawn for sunbathing and picnicking. In successive sampling during the following weeks, concentrations decreased but remained elevated . Additionally, other sampling spots at the river Saale were confirmed positive 删除21:<u></u>. Determination of Cryptosporidium species and subtype in the environmental samples (map identifiers 5, 8, 9) was not successful.\n\n【49】Public health action \n--------------------\n\n【50】After confirmation of the outbreak, on 26 August 2013 the public health authorities informed the citizens of Halle via a press release about the outbreak and issued a precautionary boil-tap-water advisory. This measure was countermanded five days later, after considering the findings from the exposure interviews and the first tap water samples testing negative for oocysts. Two public swimming pools were positive and were closed. Furthermore, based on the results from the case control study and the water samples from the inner-city river sampling points, the health authorities informed the population about the risk associated with presence in the floodplain and advised against bathing and playing in or next to the river (13 September 2013).\n\n【51】The spillovers, where high concentrations of oocysts were found close by in the river water, were reassessed in October 2013 by the responsible municipal agency operating the system in Halle. No damages or dysfunctions were reported which would have allowed efflux of waste water in normal mode (none or only light rain) into the river.\n\n【52】Discussion \n==========\n\n【53】We describe the largest recognized outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Germany, which occurred in the city of Halle (Saale) and comprised 167 notified cases. The true size of the outbreak probably was much larger since many patients probably did not see a doctor and did not undergo laboratory testing for Cryptosporidium.\n\n【54】The outbreak began 6 weeks after the peak of an extensive river flooding which in the city inundated the whole floodplain as well as some adjacent streets and also affected and damaged the sewage systems. PCR confirmation was obtained for all but 8 (7%) of 114 samples recorded as positive for visual fluorescent antibody testing. The ability of PCR to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium in samples negative for visual analysis was not determined. We did not exlude these cases as the case definition was based on microscopy and antigen testing which are the most frequently used methods in primary diagnostics.\n\n【55】Epidemiological investigations provide evidence for exposure from human activities in the areas affected by the flood waters, including numerous playgrounds and the river beach, as a primary risk factor of infection of children -- the most affected group in this outbreak. Repetitive water samples, taken two weeks to three months after the peak of the outbreak and in different locations, showed Cryptosporidium oocysts in the inner-city river, in some sites in very high concentrations. It appears plausible that children contracted infection when playing, bathing and also eating there. However, we did not ask what they did specifically in the floodplain.\n\n【56】However, interpretation of the case--control study is limited by the fact that exposure information was recorded differently among cases and controls (telephone and online) and it is not certain that the identified risk factors apply for other persons in the same way as for kindergarten children (study) group.\n\n【57】Based on preliminary results, local health authorities also released a notification of the risk in the floodplain (13 September) while the online questionnaire was still accessible (until 16 September), however only two controls and zero cases answered to the questionnaire or got interviewed after 13 September.\n\n【58】As Cryptosporidium oozysts were shown to being able to survive long periods in river water sediments, our findings cannot explain if the high concentrations of Cryptosporidium oocysts detected up to five months after the flooding, were exclusively caused by the preceding flooding or if ongoing sewage seepage or spills in a city with ongoing Cryptosporidium transmission contributed to this.\n\n【59】In any case, the oocyst counts measured at several spots (particularly no. 3--6 in the map) correspond to concentrations in open waters which according to WHO guidelines suggest pollution by wastewater . In an analysis from a different river in German, Kistemann et al. detected median oocyst counts of only 4 oocysts/100 l (range 0--28) .\n\n【60】The involvement of wastewater in the aetiology of this outbreak is additionally supported by the nature of C. hominis which is almost entirely confined to humans \\[-\\].\n\n【61】However, evidence of the environmental findings is limited as species identification based on PCR-amplification in samples from the river water was not successful. Thus, source tracking to the river was limited to the findings of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water. However, discrepancies between microscopic and molecular water sample investigations have been reported frequently .\n\n【62】To date, gastrointestinal disease outbreaks after river flooding in Central Europe usually have much smaller impact on public health than in countries with lower water and sanitation standards  and, waterborne outbreaks, even after flooding events were extremely rare in Germany . The outbreak in Halle started about two weeks after public reopening of the previously closed floodplain. This could explain the outbreaks' beginning two months after the flood. Furthermore, while most faecal pathogens may have died on the dried out floodplain during the period of very hot and dry weather in July 2013, Cryptosporidium oocysts have been described to survive several months particularly but not exclusively in moist environments . The sodden and only slowly drying lawns of the floodplain parks likely provided such conditions. Infection has been described to occur after ingesting only 10 -- 30 oocysts  and the concentrations detected in the river water close to the river beach and other locations in Halle were comparably high .\n\n【63】Decreasing case numbers coincide with the end of the summer holidays (23 August) and of the sunniest period which may underline the causative role of bathing in the river and/or ingestion via wet or muddy hands. It is questionable if the late public advice to restrain from bathing (13 September, week 37) based on our findings had a strong influence on decreasing case numbers as the bathing weather ended at this time. We need to consider that the participants were not asked what precisely they did in the floodplain (e.g. bathing, eating, playing) and our findings do not provide information on what the exact mechanism of transmission actually is.\n\n【64】Mason et al. report an outbreak caused by drinking water where \\<1 oocyst per 100 litres (size of water samples in our investigation) were detected in the drinking water . Therefore, despite lack of evidence for tap water involvement in from initial patient interviews, we included this hypothesis in the case--control. However, the results provide no evidence for a causative role of tap water in this outbreak.\n\n【65】The Halle zoo was not overflowed by the flood. However, one of its exits leads directly to recreational areas in the floodplains, so that visits to the zoo and to the floodplain can be could easily combined. From the parasitological perspective, a causative role of the zoo would appear more likely if the relevant species here had not been C. hominis.\n\n【66】We did not find any evidence for food vehicles playing a role in this outbreak. Swimming pools have been frequently indicted as sources of infection during outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis \\[-\\]. Moreover, pool-to-pool transfer of oocysts by diarrhoeal swimmers has been described . Whether the contaminated swimming pools in Halle were additional sources of infection remains unclear. In the case--control study among children, bathing in these pools was not associated with cryptosporidiosis. However, pools may have played a role for transmission to adults in this outbreak. Pool closures based on active sampling for oocysts and subsequent hygiene measures may have prevented additional gastroenteritis cases and shortened the outbreak.\n\n【67】Conclusions \n===========\n\n【68】Even in countries with high standards of sanitation, river flooding can cause epidemics of gastroenteritis, when sewage systems overflow and pollute and water ways used by humans.\n\n【69】Severe flooding events have become more frequent in recent years and their frequency will probably further increase in Germany and other European countries due to climate change and stream straightening. Extreme water events such as flooding have been shown to be causative for the transmission of a number of waterborne diseases . Also, the risk of gastrointestinal illness related to coastal and freshwater swimming was reported to be increased after heavy rainfall . Evidence from this outbreak investigation suggests practical recommendations with regards to bathing within urban areas and preventive measures after river flooding: Particularly in urban areas, possible area and water contamination with persistent pathogens such as Cryptosporidium should also be considered and particularly open surface waters used for bathing should be tested also for parasites before re-opening to the public. River bathing sites should not be located near or closely downstream of potential sewage spillways, even if those are only operational on occasion. After flooding and during gastrointestinal outbreak situations of waterborne pathogens, sewage systems should be investigated for possible leakages.\n\n【70】In addition, the efforts to keep persons with diarrhoea or with little children who show such symptoms from using public swimming pools should be enhanced. In outbreak situations, swimming pools should be regularly evaluated for evidence of parasite oocysts.\n\n【71】Additionally, we found that physician ordering and laboratory routine testing schemes for Cryptosporidium are not very standardised. Thus validity of disease surveillance and outbreak detection based on laboratory detection is limited.\n\n【72】The molecular methods for detecting Cryptosporidium species and subtypes from environmental samples should be established in Germany. More research data on presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in open surface water after heavy rains and in normal situtations is needed to better understand relevance for health threats after similar events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Using oxamic acid, an inhibitor of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) which hinders aerobic glycolysis, we decreased ATP levels in PLC/PRF/5 cells (a line from a hepatocellular carcinoma). We found that in these cells oxamic acid potentiated the antiproliferative activity of sorafenib, imatinib and sunitinib, three kinase inhibitors. When aerobic glycolysis was shut down by culturing the cells in the absence of glucose, oxamic acid did not reduce the ATP levels, suggesting that in normal tissues, which do not rely on aerobic glycolysis for their ATP synthesis, the block of LDH should not impair cellular metabolism. In conclusion, the inhibition of LDH could enhance anticancer activity of sorafenib, imatinib and sunitinib without increasing their side effects on normal cells, which in conditions of normal functional activity and sufficient oxygen supply do not need the activity of this enzyme.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】In recent years, China's ever-increasing air pollution problem has attracted worldwide attention. Air pollution commonly refers to the concentration of harmful emissions in the environment, usually from heavy traffic, industry, power generation, and coal smoke. These pollutants, induced by human activity, can have a major impact on public health, and international government agencies and health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese government, have provided specific air quality guidelines to limit human exposure to ambient air pollutants such as particulate matter (soot), ozone, and nitrogen dioxide 删除21:<u></u> . However, meeting these guidelines for improving urban air quality presents a great challenge in China, which remains in the midst of a rapid expansion of economic development and urbanization.\n\n【2】ijerph-12-14887-t001_Table 1\n\n【3】###### \n\n【4】Current guidelines for air pollutant exposure limits.\n\n【5】  Pollutant   WHO    US    EU    China                   \n  ----------- ------------------------------- ------------------------------ ------------------------------ --------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ----\n  PM~2.5~     10                              25                             12                             35                                12   25   15   35\n  PM~10~      20                              50                                                                                              20   25   40   50\n  SO~2~                                       20                                                                                              8    50   40   80\n  NO~2~       40                                                                                                                                        20   50\n\n【6】Notes: PM~2.5~ = Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers, measured in µg/m^3^; PM~10~ = Particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers, measured in µg/m^3^; SO~2~ = Sulfur dioxide, measured in µg/m^3^; NO~2~ = Nitrogen dioxide, measured in µg/m^3^.\n\n【7】As an indication of the seriousness of air pollution in major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi'an, PM~2.5~ air pollution has routinely exceeded the current guidelines. For example, air pollutant concentrations in most major urban areas in 2013 exceeded WHO guidelines  by four times or more the average annual limit for PM~2.5~ and by two times or more for PM~10~ 删除21:<u></u>. In the same year, 92% of 74 cities in China failed to meet China's national ambient air quality standards . In some cities, PM~2.5~ values have reached extremely hazardous levels. For example, on 12 January 2013, data on daily PM~2.5~ concentration levels measured by the U.S. Embassy's Beijing Air Quality Monitor registered an unprecedented 886 μg/m^3^ , a value 35 times higher than the guideline limit set by WHO . A satellite image taken by NASA two days after the peak recording is shown in . Such hazardous levels, as determined by the Air Quality Index set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) , are likely to affect the entire Chinese population. In terms of the impact on public health, the worsening pollution situation in China has been described as \"more horrible\" than the SARs epidemic in 2002 , given that it is likely to increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health risks among China's total population . According to estimates released from the Global Burden of Disease Study , ambient air pollution contributed to more than 1.3 million premature deaths in China in 2010, ranking it first among 15 countries in terms of premature mortality attributable to air pollution, with the preventable death rate being higher in megacities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Chengdu, and Shanghai . Ultimately, cities such as Beijing may become \"uninhabitable for human beings\" .\n\n【8】ijerph-12-14887-t002_Table 2\n\n【9】###### \n\n【10】Annual average concentrations of air pollutants in selected major Chinese cities in 2013.\n\n【11】  City        PM~2.5~   PM~10~   SO~2~   NO~2~\n  ----------- --------- -------- ------- -------\n  Beijing     89        108      26      56\n  Tianjin     96        150      59      54\n  Harbin      81        119      44      56\n  Shanghai    62        84       24      48\n  Nanjing     78        137      37      55\n  Hefei       88        119      44      56\n  Wuhan       94        124      33      60\n  Changsha    83        94       33      46\n  Guangzhou   53        72       20      52\n  Chongqing   70        106      32      38\n  Chengdu     96        150      31      63\n  Xi'an       105       189      46      57\n\n【12】Notes: PM~2.5~ = Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers, measured in µg/m^3^; PM~10~ = Particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers, measured in µg/m^3^; SO~2~ = Sulfur dioxide, measured in µg/m^3^; NO~2~ = Nitrogen dioxide, measured in µg/m^3^.\n\n【13】!(ijerph-12-14887-g001)\n\n【14】Ambient air pollution has long been recognized as having adverse health effects on humans. Epidemiological studies have shown that it is associated with increased risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, increased incidence of lung cancer and pneumonia, and increased mortality . However, neither the extraordinary magnitude and severity of China's air pollution nor the extent to which it impacts human health has been fully examined or understood. Of particular public health concern is the adverse health impact it has on millions of people who routinely engage in outdoor physical activity for the purpose of maintaining fitness and health .\n\n【15】A previous paper  highlighted this issue and emphasized the importance of developing public health measures and surveillance systems to maximize the safety of outdoor physical activity in a polluted environment. The present article provides an update and review of the research into the association between air pollution and physical activity and its impact on health, as well as proposing future research projects to better understand these relationships. It concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of air pollution for public health and the promotion of physical activity in polluted environments.\n\n【16】2. Physical Activity and Air Pollution Exposure \n===============================================\n\n【17】2.1. Health Significance of Air Pollution Exposure while Exercising Outdoors \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Engaging in physical activity requires oxygen intake, with the demand for oxygen increasing as exercise intensity increases. Breathing through the mouth, which becomes more common with exertion, bypasses nasal filtration mechanisms and both increases the amount of pollution inhaled and the degree to which it travels into the respiratory system. Thus, exercising in a polluted environment (e.g. one with high vehicular traffic) exposes individuals, especially sensitive ones, such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly, to combustion-related airborne pollutants (e.g. nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, PM, and ozone). Such exposure can inflame airways and worsen asthmatic responses  and trigger health problems or exacerbate existing ones such as asthma , cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infraction ), and cancer , leading to premature death .\n\n【19】Therefore, although exercise is known to be highly beneficial to health \\[,\\], engaging in it in a polluted environment may increase population-wide health risks . In some cases the risks may outweigh the benefits because of the potential for long-term deleterious effects on health. The fact that most recreational physical activities in China are done outdoors  has made exposure to ambient air pollution a significant public health issue .\n\n【20】2.2. Potential Health Risks and Benefits of Physical Activity due to Ambient Air Pollution Exposure \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Increased respiratory uptake and deposition of air pollutants in the lungs due to higher minute ventilation during physical activity may amplify the adverse effects of air pollution on health . Several studies  have documented evidence of acute deleterious health effects of physical activity with even short-term exposure to air pollution. For example, adults with asthma who walked on a busy street in London for only two hours were found to have reduced lung function . Similarly, young children engaged in high levels of exercise (i.e. participating in more than three athletic activities) in communities with high concentrations of ozone were shown to have a higher incidence of asthma compared to children who exercised in low-ozone communities . Reduced lung function has been observed among runners after they ran near busy highways  and among cyclists after they rode along heavy traffic routes during rush-hour traffic .\n\n【22】In contrast to findings that show a simple negative relationship between exercise and air pollution, a number of studies suggest more complex relationships, including physical activity modifying or attenuating the health risks of air pollution exposure or pollution undermining the health benefits of activity. For example, a study by Yu et al.  showed that habitual physical exercise among children 8 to 12 years old in a low-pollution district improved cardiopulmonary fitness in regard to maximal oxygen uptake, but this beneficial effect was not observed among children living in a high-pollution area.\n\n【23】Two recent experimental studies  conducted in Barcelona (Spain), examined interactions between short-term effects of traffic-related air pollution (2 h in exposure duration) and intermittent moderate physical activity (consisting of 15-min intervals of alternating rest and cycling on a stationary bicycle) on heart and lung function in healthy individuals. Results on arterial blood pressure responses showed that physical activity weakened air-pollution-induced increases in systolic blood pressure, with a stronger effect under a low-air-pollution exposure condition . Additionally, respiratory and inflammatory responses indicated that while air pollution increased negative aspects of both, exercising mitigated these changes .\n\n【24】With respect to mortality risk, an observational study conducted in Hong Kong revealed a similar complex relationship in that sedentary older adults with acute exposure to air pollution had a higher mortality risk attributable to the exposure compared to those who engaged in habitual physical activity . The study also showed that older adults who engaged in a moderate level of exercise had lower mortality risk compared to those who engaged in a high level of exercise. In a recent large-scale prospective cohort study, Andersen et al.  showed that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~) among urban individuals between 50 and 65 years of age in Denmark modified beneficial health effects of sports participation on mortality, with stronger effects on individuals living with moderate to low levels of exposure to air pollution (i.e. less than 19.0 µg/m^3^ in NO~2~ exposure). Collectively, findings from these studies suggest that exercising in a polluted environment may not be completely detrimental to health, and, in some cases, the benefits of physical activity may outweigh the risks related to air pollution exposure.\n\n【25】3. Future Research Needs \n========================\n\n【26】Despite the clear evidence that exposure to air pollution is detrimental to health , findings from epidemiological studies on the relationship between air pollution and physical activity are mixed, with some evidence that the health benefits of physical activity may not be adversely affected by exposure to air pollution . The current key issue is the unknown demarcation point between the level of pollution at which physical activity can attenuate health risks associated with pollution and the level at which physical activity increases negative health outcomes due to pollution.\n\n【27】Given the unprecedented situation in China in terms of the extent of its pollution problem and its high population density, the lack of population-based epidemiological studies that link ambient air pollution, physical activity/inactivity, and health is extremely problematic. In this regard, research that addresses context-specific effects of air pollution on physical activity in China is urgently needed.\n\n【28】First, air pollution in China is considered to be extreme because of the country's exceptional scale of industry. Since most studies on physical activity and pollution have been conducted in developed countries where air pollution is far less severe, the extent to which those findings are applicable to China is unclear. Therefore, it is critical that an assessment of the severity of negative health consequences or physical activity effects resulting from acute and chronic exposure to air pollutants be undertaken in China.\n\n【29】Next, as air pollution continues to worsen in China, research is needed to explore the relationship between changes in health outcomes (positive and/or negative), total time engaged in physical activity, and level of pollution. Although animal-based research shows long-term protective effects of exercise on mice , there have been no human studies that help determine the critical time point at which continued or cumulative exposure to air pollution while exercising leads to a decrement in health outcomes. Future research should focus on mechanisms underlying the relationship between exercise and optimal health outcomes as modified or mediated by either acute or chronic exposure to various levels of air pollutants.\n\n【30】With the implementation of environmental laws by the Chinese government , epidemiological studies are needed to assess whether associations between long- and short-term concentrations of air pollution and indicators of health risks can be modified by levels and types of physical activity, as well as the locations (e.g. streets, residential areas) where physical activity is performed . Given that air pollutant levels may change due to seasonal weather or climate changes, studies are needed to understand how the level of exposure (low, medium, high) impacts physical activity in the general population as well in \"sensitive\" populations involving children, older adults, and people with existing chronic medical conditions . Conversely, as shown by Wong et al. research is needed to delineate the optimal level or threshold effect of physical activity at which it can be protective against air-pollution-related health risks or mortality.\n\n【31】Acquiring knowledge in these areas is important from the perspectives of public health and physical activity promotion because air pollution discourages people from engaging in regular outdoor physical activities . Evidence-based knowledge is also important to inform decision-making by government and public health authorities in developing guidelines and intervention strategies to promote active lifestyles while reducing the risks from exposure to air pollution .\n\n【32】4. Public Health Implications \n=============================\n\n【33】Despite the known adverse health impact of air pollution, current evidence from epidemiological and ecological-based studies suggests that engaging in physical activity in a polluted-air environment may not diminish the positive effects of exercise and should not be completely avoided in such environments. Moderate levels of physical activity, such as habitual walking or cycling, may still be beneficial for healthy individuals if done where the concentration of airborne pollution is low . However, evidence is lacking on the balance between the health risks and benefits at different pollution levels and in diverse populations (e.g. healthy individuals vs. those who are susceptible to certain diseases), indicating that different strategies may be needed for subpopulations that face greater health risks.\n\n【34】The fact that engaging in physical activity in outdoor settings  is a tradition in China makes it important to consider environmental modifications and protective strategies for exercise. Certain air pollutants, such as PM, are modifiable, and interventions can therefore be developed to mitigate the level of air pollution. One strategy to offset the great expansion of urbanization is to develop green spaces that can counter the health hazards induced by air pollution  and then promote behaviors such as physical activity in these green spaces . With increasing dependence on automobiles in China, encouraging community walking for utilitarian purposes becomes increasingly important for maintaining healthy lifestyles, providing health benefits, and helping reduce motorized traffic and its harmful emissions of NO~2~ .\n\n【35】Finally, habitual exercisers must be educated in precautions against pollution by staying away from heavy traffic or industrial areas  or by eliminating exercise when pollution levels are known to be high . Research shows that regular and timely air quality alerts are important for informing the public about harmful air pollution and for helping people make decisions about engaging in physical activities . Other protective strategies that can offset adverse health effects of air pollution include taking antioxidant supplements, wearing a facemask, and avoiding high-traffic areas . A final untapped area is the provision of education and information for health care providers about potential risks for exercising outdoor on highly polluted days, especially for patients with existing medical conditions.\n\n【36】5. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【37】Air pollution in China poses a major public health threat to the promotion of physical activity. In the absence of the enforcement of meaningful environmental regulations to temper growing industrialization and urbanization, air quality will continue to deteriorate, exposing exercisers to higher levels of toxic air pollutants. Thus, large-scale public health initiatives, including expanded epidemiological research, are needed to protect the population and the long-standing Chinese tradition of exercising outdoors.\n\n【38】The work presented in this paper is supported by research grants from Key Laboratory of Exercise and Health Sciences of the Ministry of Education, the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai (14DZ1103500), and the Shanghai Broad Liberal Arts Academic New Talents Incubation Program (xsxr2013025).\n\n【39】Jiaojiao Lü conceptualized, drafted, and wrote the article.

There is a high prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition and anemia among Suruí children. Comparison with a previous survey indicated that the prevalence of height for age deficit significantly decreased between 1987 and 2005 (from 46.3 to 26.7% in children younger than 9 years). On the other hand, 3.9% of the children were overweight in 2005, a finding that had not been reported in 1987. The prevalence of anemia did not change remarkably between these years. Despite the improvement in anthropometric parameters, the prevalence of nutritional deficit has been persistently higher than that observed in the Brazilian population at large. It is therefore necessary that systematic and regular monitoring of indigenous children's growth and development be implemented, focusing mainly on nutritional surveillance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The demand for electricity is expected to double by the year 2050 . The most common source of energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels  which has long-term environmental and political ramifications. The need for a long-term solution may be met by renewable sources of energy. One of the most heavily studied areas in this realm is that of rechargeable batteries, which are required to store energy generated by intermittent sources (i.e. solar and wind). Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized consumer electronics and begun to make inroads in hybrid and all-electric cars. Though much development has focused on improvements in energy density, cost, and rate capability of the positive electrode, relatively little has changed in the electrolyte, which consists of a lithium salt dissolved in a mixture of carbonate solvents. Solid electrolytes have obvious safety and energy density advantages over a liquid but so far have largely failed to demonstrate sufficiently high ionic conductivity at normal operating temperatures. The recent discovery of highly conducting ceramics such as Li~10~GeP~2~S~12~ shows promise  in certain applications such as thin film batteries, but is challenged by the requirement of maintaining a good electrode/electrolyte interface over repeated charge and discharge. In the realm of \"soft\" solid electrolytes, there are gels consisting of liquid electrolytes immobilized within the gel structure and solvent-free polymer electrolytes. It is the latter that this review will highlight. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have the benefits of being flame-resistant, flexible and generally low-cost in design . The research associated with lithium-ion batteries has certainly seen vast improvements over the years but can still benefit as the next generation of these types of batteries comes to fruition. Other battery technologies that could benefit from a suitable SPE are also being studied, including lithium-air and sodium-ion systems, the latter of which will be briefly addressed later.\n\n【2】There are many experimental techniques that can be used to study SPEs, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, vibrational spectroscopy, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy is a very useful technique because it can probe local structure as well as ionic and polymer chain and segmental dynamics . NMR spectroscopy is element- (nuclei-) specific so that individual ions or functional groups can be specifically targeted. Some of the common nuclei for SEM materials studied are ^1^H, ^2^H, ^6,7^Li, ^11^B, ^13^C, ^19^F, ^23^Na, ^27^Al. The different NMR techniques used to investigate SPEs include static and magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments for local structure determination and relaxation and pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusion measurements to study dynamic properties of materials. Of course, the maximum benefit of these kinds of measurements accrues through seeking correlations between the NMR results and parameters more directly related to battery performance such as ionic conductivity and cation transference number.\n\n【3】2. Results and Discussion \n=========================\n\n【4】2.1. Polymer/Ceramic Composite Electrolytes \n-------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Poly(ethylene) oxide (PEO) is one of the most commonly studied polymers as a host material to create an effective solid polymer electrolyte . Among the salts (and by no means an exhaustive list) added to PEO to form the SPE are LiClO~4~, LiI, LiCF~3~SO~3~, and LiN(CF~3~SO~2~) (often referred to in the literature as LiTFSI or LiNTf2). Despite nearly 40 years of research on PEO-salt complexes, improvements in electrical and mechanical properties for battery applications can best be described as incremental. Among early strategies to improve mechanical properties was the incorporation of ceramic particles such as Al~2~O~3~ , SiO~2~ , LiAlO~2~ , TiO~2~  and other inorganic oxides . In the course of investigating these polymer/lithium salt/ceramic composites, it was subsequently observed that the presence of the ceramic particles can also have a positive influence on ionic motion, and in favorable circumstances can even increase the Li^+^ transference number, which is the fraction of the ionic current carried by the Li^+^ ions. These effects on the ions have been attributed to ionic interaction with surface groups on the ceramic particles, and naturally such effects are markedly enhanced when using nano-sized particles in the composite . Another mechanism for the enhancement of ionic conductivity is that, in many cases, the ceramic particles tend to suppress the much less conductive crystalline phases of PEO and PEO-salt complex, and, as an added benefit, the filler can also yield a more stable electrolyte/electrode interface .\n\n【6】Rather than offer an extensive review of the literature on the subject of ionically conductive polymer ceramic composites and NMR studies of these materials (for which several extensive reviews exist), we pose here a limited survey of examples from the labs of the authors and collaborators and those of a select few others that will serve to illustrate the main thrusts in these areas. We highlight, among other works, collaborative efforts with the laboratory of Professor Bruno Scrosati, in whose honor this volume has been compiled, as well as other notable publications from his laboratory .\n\n【7】Prior studies by the author in collaboration with Peled, Golodnitsky et al.  on PEO-Li salt complexes containing Al~2~O~3~ filler showed enhanced lithium transport in both total conductivity and cation transference number.\n\n【8】In fact, because it was hypothesized in this investigation that there might be more than one kind of mobile Li ion, at least one coordinated to the polyether segments and one associated with the filler particle or polymer/filler particle interfaces, a follow up study was performed on milled mixtures of LiI and Al~2~O~3~ . Clear evidence of interfacial Li was observed in these mixtures using ^7^Li high resolution magic angle-spinning NMR as described later. Similar phenomena were reported some 25 years prior to this work by Liang, though without the benefit of high resolution NMR . We return to this phenomenon of interfacial Li in polymer electrolyte composites later.\n\n【9】Some early evidence that the Li^+^ transport mechanism can be influenced in a fundamental way beyond that due to only reduction in the crystalline phase was provided by an investigation of TiO~2~ nanofillers in PEO~8~LiClO~4~ .  displays the ^7^Li NMR linewidth (full-width at half-maximum) of the SPE with and without the TiO~2~ filler. NMR linewidth studies provided the earliest insight into the coupling between ion transport and polymer segmental motion occurring in the amorphous phase above the glass transition temperature which usually marks the onset of motional line narrowing .\n\n【10】![Arrhenius plot of ^7^Li NMR linewidth of Li SPE with and without TiO~2~ filler .](membranes-05-00915-g001)\n\n【11】There is no clear distinction in motional narrowing behavior attributable to the filler and, in fact, the filler-free material exhibits a somewhat narrower resonance. However, it was determined that the ionic conductivity is enhanced by about a factor of three at 90 °C by the filler. The enhancement is about a factor of 10 at 60 °C and over two orders of magnitude at 25 °C. Though the low temperature enhancement is mainly attributable to suppression of the crystalline phase, the high temperature increase arises from additional possible transport pathways. Additional evidence for this comes from cation transference measurements performed at 90 °C, for which the obtained values were 0.20 and 0.50 in the SPE without and with filler, respectively. Furthermore, Li^+^ self-diffusion coefficients measured at 65 °C by PFG revealed an order of magnitude higher value for the filler-containing material, in line with the conductivity results.\n\n【12】Before resuming discussion of composite SPEs, we give additional evidence for the interaction between Li^+^ and ceramic filler particles even in the absence of polymer. As mentioned, this effect was first reported by Liang , and somewhat more recently, our group in collaboration Golodnitsky, Peled et al. reported on the ion conductivity enhancement of milled mixtures of LiI and Al~2~O~3~ .  shows variable-temperature high-resolution MAS solid-state ^7^Li spectra of milled mixtures of LiI and Al~2~O~3~. In addition to the bulk LiI site, there is a second resonance assigned to Li^+^ ions at the salt/ceramic interface, i.e. the interfacial Li referred to earlier. The intensity of the second site is clearly greater in the sample with higher alumina content. In fact, close examination of the 50/50 composition reveals a third resolvable site at elevated temperature.\n\n【13】![Comparison between variable-temperature ^7^Li MAS NMR spectra of LiI/Al~2~O~3~ samples: (a) 50/50, bottom spectrum is pure LiI reference compound; (b) 60/40.](membranes-05-00915-g002)\n\n【14】Even in the presence of polymer and resultant solvation of the ions, there is still ample opportunity for Li^+^-ceramic interactions of the kind described by Croce et al. These interactions produce an alternative ion transport pathway at the interface of the polymer and ceramic particle surface.\n\n【15】Another example of the benefits of inorganic oxide fillers is highlighted by the work of Park et al. In this particular case, a relatively large amount (30% by weight) of Al~2~O~3~ was added in order to produce a robust membrane with the ability to block dendrite formation at the anode or prevent soluble redox species at the cathode side from crossing over to the anode. The polymer structure and resultant membrane are depicted in .\n\n【16】![(a) Crosslinked PETTeDEGDVE polymer chain structure in the Al~2~O~3~/PEO membrane and (b) a photograph of the membrane (25 × 20 cm^2^) .](membranes-05-00915-g003)\n\n【17】In very recent work with Golodnitsky et al. (Tel Aviv University), we have investigated high ceramic content PEO-LiI SPEs, where the ceramic used was LiAlO~2~, and the SPE was prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) as opposed to solvent-casting . The EPD method is particularly effective for restricted geometry applications such as 3-dimensional microbatteries because it allows conformal deposition of active materials.\n\n【18】Static ^7^Li NMR linewidth (full-width at half-maximum) measurements were performed from 25 °C up to 80 °C. As the temperature was increased, the full-width at half maximum decreased, as well as the appearance of the narrower peak which indicates a more mobile Li species.\n\n【19】![The ^7^Li NMR spectra at different temperatures of 30 wt. % LiAlO~2~ in PEO~2~LiI composite electrolyte.](membranes-05-00915-g004)\n\n【20】Knowing that LiAlO~2~ itself (as opposed to the composite) yields a temperature-independent (over the range measured) linewidth, it can be assumed that the mobile species observed in the spectra correspond to Li ions either coordinated to the PEO segments or associated with the ceramic interfacial sites. In order to distinguish between these scenarios, high resolution MAS measurements were performed, as shown in . The polymer-associated Li^+^ ions can clearly be resolved from the Li ions associated with the inorganic filler surfaces.\n\n【21】![The ^7^Li NMR high resolution MAS spectrum of 30 wt. % LiAlO~2~ in PEO~2~LiI composite electrolyte at 80 °C; full spectrum plus spectral fits to components.

Sodium-Ion Batteries: \n--------------------------\n\n【23】Recently, the first-ever vehicle powered by sodium-ion battery technology was unveiled . High temperature sodium batteries were explored in the 1970s--1980s but have undergone a revival among researchers . Because of their similar (to Li) electrochemical properties, such as a favorable redox potential (−2.71 for Na and −3.04 for Li) and reduced cost, sodium-based batteries operating at or near ambient temperature are receiving increasing attention . Many of the materials that can be used for Li-ion batteries that have been studied over the past 25+ years are similar to that of the sodium battery . One of the main hurdles to the development of these batteries is the absence of a sufficiently conductive electrolyte with the required mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties.\n\n【24】LiTFSI mixed with PEO has been studied extensively. For sodium-based battery applications, PEO~n~:NaTFSI has been previously studied ; however, these films were prepared using a solvent-casting method. Recently, Moreno et al.  published their findings on a PEO~n~:NaTFSI. The addition of the nanometric-sized SiO~2~ and the use of a solvent-free hot pressing technique were chosen initially to enhance the mechanical properties of the membranes and to increase the amorphous fraction of the membranes, two of the well-documented effects discussed previously . However, an additional benefit of the filler addition became apparent in that the chronoamperometric measurement of the Na^+^ transference number was found to increase as reported in .\n\n【25】membranes-05-00915-t001_Table 1\n\n【26】###### \n\n【27】Transference number for PEO~20~:NaTFSI + x% SiO~2~; x = 0, 5, 10.\n\n【28】  PEO~20~:NaTFSI + x% SiO~2~ x=   t~Na~^+^\n  ------------------------------- ----------\n  0                               0.39\n  5                               0.51\n  10                              0.48\n\n【29】NMR diffusion measurements were performed to gain additional insight into this phenomenon. Owing to its typically large electric quadrupole interaction and correspondingly short relaxation times, ^23^Na diffusion measurements in solids are usually not possible with normally accessible gradient strengths. Though one may not be able to measure Na diffusion, one can still determine anion diffusivity. Thus, ^19^F PFG NMR measurements showed a decrease in anion diffusivity with the addition of silica with a noticeably larger decrease in going from 0% to 5% than from 5% to 10%. The anion diffusion results are plotted in .\n\n【30】![Arrhenius plot of ^19^F self-diffusion coefficients for PEO~20~:NaTFSI + x% by wt. SiO~2~ (x = 0, 5, 10).](membranes-05-00915-g006)\n\n【31】It is notable that the ionic conductivity measurements showed an increase when filler was added. This is consistent with a higher Na^+^ mobility that offsets the lower TFSI^-^ anion mobility and thus an increase in the Na^+^ cation transference number, which is in agreement with the results in .\n\n【32】3. Conclusion \n=============\n\n【33】Polymer electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries are promising in terms of stable, affordable, and safe storage technologies. Ceramic-polymer electrolyte composites, originally conceived to improve mechanical properties, have been shown to possess additional desirable features, including enhanced electrochemical stability against electrodes and augmented cation transference numbers. NMR is a vital investigative tool in identifying structural and mobility properties of these materials.\n\n【34】The work performed at Hunter College was supported in part by grants from the U.S. Office of Naval Research.\n\n【35】Marc B.

The periprocedural anticoagulation management could play a role in the incidence of these complications. Although ablation procedures performed without warfarin discontinuation seem to be associated with lower thromboembolic risk, no randomized study exists. This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter study assessing the role of continuous warfarin therapy in preventing periprocedural thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Patients with CHADS2 score ≥1 were included. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the off-warfarin or on-warfarin arm. The incidence of thromboembolic events in the 48 hours after ablation was the primary end point of the study. The study enrolled 1584 patients: 790 assigned to discontinue warfarin (group 1) and 794 assigned to continuous warfarin (group 2). No statistical difference in baseline characteristics was observed. There were 39 thromboembolic events (3.7% strokes [n=29] and 1.3% transient ischemic attacks [n=10]) in group 1: two events (0.87%) in patients with paroxysmal AF, 4 (2.3%) in patients with persistent AF, and 33 (8.5%) in patients with long-standing persistent AF. Only 2 strokes (0.25%) in patients with long-standing persistent AF were observed in group 2 (P<0.001).

Much oxidative damage is due to hydrogen peroxide meeting redox-active iron in the acidic and reducing lysosomal environment, resulting in the production of toxic hydroxyl radicals that may oxidize intralysosomal content, leading to lipofuscin (LF) formation or, if more extensive, to permeabilization of lysosomal membranes. Formation of LF is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and known to jeopardize normal autophagic rejuvenation of vital cellular biomolecules. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization causes release of lysosomal content (redox-active iron, lytic enzymes), which may then cause cell death. Total cellular and lysosomal low-mass iron of cultured, immortalized human RPE (ARPE-19) cells was compared to that of another professional scavenger cell line, J774, using atomic absorption spectroscopy and the cytochemical sulfide-silver method (SSM). It was found that both cell lines contained comparable levels of total as well as intralysosomal iron, suggesting that the latter is mainly kept in a non-redox-active state in ARPE-19 cells. Basal levels and capacity for upregulation of the iron-binding proteins ferritin, metallothionein and heat shock protein 70 were tested in both cell lines using immunoblotting. Compared to J774 cells, ARPE-19 cells were found to contain very high basal levels of all these proteins, which could be even further upregulated following appropriate stimulation. These findings suggest that a high basal expression of iron-binding stress proteins, which during their normal autophagic turnover in lysosomes may temporarily bind iron prior to their degradation, could contribute to the unusual oxidative stress-resistance of ARPE-19 cells. A high steady state influx of such proteins into lysosomes would keep the level of lysosomal redox-active iron permanently low. This, in turn, should delay intralysosomal accumulation of LF in RPE cells, which is known to reduce autophagic turnover as well as uptake and degradation of worn out photoreceptor tips. This may explain why severe LF accumulation and AMD normally do not develop until fairly late in life, in spite of RPE cells being continuously exposed to high levels of oxygen and light, as well as large amounts of lipid-rich material.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction \n===============\n\n【2】The majority of enveloped viruses contains multiple glycans on their envelope proteins. In some cases (i.e. human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) 删除20:<u></u>, hepatitis C virus (HCV) 删除20:<u></u>, coronaviruses (CoV) 删除20:<u></u>, influenza virus (INF) 删除20:<u></u>), the envelope is extensively glycosylated. The gp120 envelope of HIV is among the most heavily glycosylated proteins known 删除20:<u></u>. Protein glycosylation may serve multiple functions, including proper folding of the nascent peptide, avoiding peptide precipitation due to the presence of lipophylic amino acid domains in the protein, protection against breakdown by proteases, increasing molecular diversity, and last but not least, in some cases, escape of immune surveillance 删除20:<u></u>. After the glycan building block (GlcNAc)~2~Man~9~Glc~3~ has been added to asparagines of the native peptide that are part of a N‐glycosylation motif (NXS/T), the N‐glycans are processed by α‐glucosidases to remove the terminal three glucoses in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Then, ER and Golgi class I α1,2‐mannosidases specifically hydrolyze α1,2‐mannose residues, and catalyse the trimming of the high‐mannose chains involving four α1,2‐linked mannose residues, and this process generates Man~5~GlcNAc~2~. Subsequent action of GlcNAc transferase I initiates complex chain formation and yields the substrate for Golgi α‐mannosidase II which trims the terminal α1,3‐ and α1,6‐mannose residues 删除20:<u></u>. Further processing events in the Golgi apparatus eventually lead to glycans that consist of a wide variety of carbohydrates and combinations thereof \\. Since mammalian viruses use the host cell glycosylation machinery for glycan synthesis and modification of the glycans that need to be incorporated in their envelope glycoproteins, it has been suggested that it is possible to target the viral envelope glycoproteins by inhibiting certain host‐cell glucosidases at low levels that do not affect host‐cell viability 删除20:<u></u>. The altered glycan structures on the viral envelope proteins may then result in decreased viral infectivity (fitness), virus assembly and/or virus particle release 删除20:<u></u>. HIV infectivity has indeed shown to be suppressed in cell culture when the virus was propagated in the presence of the α‐glucosidase inhibitor NB‐DNJ 删除20:<u></u>. The latter drug has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials as an anti‐HIV therapeutic 删除20:<u></u>. For hepatitis B virus (HBV), it was demonstrated that NN‐DNJ (and also to a minor extent NB‐DNJ) disrupted the proper folding and efficient release of the viral envelope molecules. It was shown that NB‐DNJ could reduce virus levels in a dose‐dependent manner 删除20:<u></u>. Since the E1 and E2 transmembrane glycoproteins of HCV are important for host cell entry 删除20:<u></u>, and since proper folding is calnexin‐dependent 删除20:<u></u>, glucosidase inhibitors may also be expected to affect HCV entry and infectivity.\n\n【3】Recently, we have shown that carbohydrate‐binding agents (CBA) are able to force HIV‐1 to delete part of the glycans on its gp120 envelope in an attempt to escape drug pressure \\. Such mutant virus strains display different degrees of phenotypic (in)sensitivity to the CBA\\'s antiviral activity depending the number and the nature of the glycans that were deleted in gp120. In this study, we wanted to investigate whether the concomitant combination of CBAs and the glycosylation inhibitor 1‐deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) against wild‐type and mutant (glycan‐deleted) gp120‐containing HIV‐1 strains could afford a superior antiviral activity than when added as single drugs. DMJ was used because it selectively inhibits α1,2‐mannosidase I resulting in the accumulation of high‐mannose glycans on the viral envelope glycoprotein. We found a significantly increased sensitivity of the mutant virus strains to the inhibition by DMJ, and a marked potentiation of the antiviral efficacy of CBAs when co‐administered with DMJ, both for wild‐type and mutant virus strains.\n\n【4】2. Materials and methods \n========================\n\n【5】2.1. Test compounds \n-------------------\n\n【6】The mannose‐specific plant lectins from Galanthus nivalis (GNA) and Hippeastrum hybrid (HHA) were derived and purified from these plants, as described before \\. DMJ was obtained from Sigma--Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and from Calbiochem (VWR International, Haasrode, Belgium).\n\n【7】2.2. Cells \n----------\n\n【8】Human T‐lymphocytic CEM cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultivated in RPMI‐1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (BioWittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium), 2 mM [l]‐glutamine and 0.075 M NaHCO~3~.\n\n【9】2.3. Viruses \n------------\n\n【10】HIV‐1(III~B~) was provided by Dr. R.C. Gallo and Dr. M. Popovic (at that time at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD). The mutant virus strains were obtained and characterized as described before 删除20:<u></u>.\n\n【11】2.4. Antiretrovirus assays \n--------------------------\n\n【12】The methodology of the anti‐HIV assays has been described previously \\. Briefly, CEM cells (4.5 × 10^5^ cells per ml) were suspended in fresh culture medium and infected with HIV‐1 at 100 CCID~50~ per ml of cell suspension. Then, 100 μl of the infected cell suspension were transferred to microplate wells, mixed with 100 μl of the appropriate dilutions of the test compounds, and further incubated at 37 °C. After 4--5 days, giant cell formation was recorded microscopically in the CEM cell cultures. The 50% effective concentration (EC~50~) corresponds to the compound concentrations required to prevent syncytium formation by 50% in the virus‐infected CEM cell cultures. In the drug combination experiments, DMJ was added to the cell cultures prior to the addition of the CBA and virus infection of the drug‐exposed cells. The proper control experiments in which only one of the drugs or none of the drugs were present, were carried out under similar experimental conditions. Data of representative experiment were shown in the figures.\n\n【13】3. Results \n==========\n\n【14】3.1. Antiviral effect of the glycosylation inhibitor DMJ and the CBAs HHA and GNA against wild‐type and mutant HIV‐1 strains \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】The antiviral activity of the 通用删除7(英):<u>α(1,2)</u>‐mannosidase I inhibitor DMJ and the mannose‐specific plant lectins HHA and GNA was investigated against wild‐type HIV‐1(III~B~) and three mutant HIV‐1(III~B~) strains that contain a variety of 7--8 glycan deletions in their envelope gp120 . DMJ did not suppress HIV‐1(III~B~)‐induced cytopathicity in CEM cell cultures at a concentration as high as 500 μM. However, when DMJ was evaluated for its antiviral activity against the mutant virus strains, it had gained, as such, measurable antiviral efficacy. DMJ was inhibitory at an EC~50~ that ranged between 90 and 155 μM against the mutant virus strains. Thus, the cytopathic activity of the mutant virus strains was invariably suppressed by DMJ . In contrast, the CBAs HHA and GNA that showed EC~50~ values as low as 0.28 and 0.16 μg/ml against wild‐type HIV‐1(III~B~), respectively, markedly lost their pronounced suppressive activity against the three mutant virus strains (EC~50~: 58--500 μg/ml) . Thus, the deleted glycans in HIV‐1 gp120 clearly compromised the antiviral activity of the CBAs.\n\n【16】###### \n\n【17】Glycan deletions present in the gp120 envelope of mutant HIV‐1 strains^a^\n\n【18】  Position of the N‐glycan amino acid deletion   Nature of the glycan[^b^]   Mutant virus strain        \n  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ---- ----\n  88                                             C                                                                         ±                     \\+   −\n  197                                            C                                                                         −                     \\+   −\n  230                                            M                                                                         \\+                    −    \\+\n  234                                            M                                                                         \\+                    \\+   \\+\n  276                                            C                                                                         −                     −    ±\n  289                                            M                                                                         ±                     \\+   −\n  295                                            M                                                                         −                     \\+   \\+\n  301                                            C                                                                         \\+                    −    \\+\n  332                                            M                                                                         −                     \\+   \\+\n  339                                            M                                                                         \\+                    \\+   \\+\n  386                                            M                                                                         −                     \\+   −\n  392                                            M                                                                         \\+                    −    \\+\n\n【19】Glycan deletions at the N‐glycosylation sites in gp120 (indicated as +) as determined in [ref. 22].

Antiviral effect of CBAs in combination with DMJ against wild‐type HIV‐1 in CEM cell cultures \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The effect of 250 and 100 μM DMJ on the inhibitory activity of the CBAs HHA and GNA against wild‐type HIV‐1 replication in CEM cell cultures was investigated 删除20:<u></u>. As already mentioned above, DMJ was not inhibitory against HIV‐1‐induced cytopathicity at the concentrations used (250 and 100 μM). In contrast, HHA (A) and GNA (B) as single drugs completely prevented HIV‐1‐induced CPE in the CEM cell cultures at concentrations as low as 0.8 μg/ml. At 0.16 μg/ml, HHA and GNA were ∼25% and 50% inhibitory, respectively. At 0.032 μg/ml, no residual inhibitory effect of the CBAs was observed. Interestingly, co‐administration of DMJ to HHA and GNA markedly potentiated the antiviral efficacy of these CBAs. The inhibitory activity of 0.16 μg/ml HHA against HIV‐1 increased from 25% to 90% in the presence of DMJ, and from 50% to 100% upon co‐administration of DMJ with 0.16 μg/ml GNA. At lower HHA and GNA concentrations, no pronounced antiviral activity was noticed for the CBAs, neither in the absence, nor in the presence of DMJ 删除20:<u></u>.\n\n【29】![Effect of 1‐deoxymannojirimycin on the antiviral effect of HHA and GNA against HIV‐1‐infected CEM cell cultures.](FEB2-581-2060-g001)\n\n【30】3.3. Antiviral effect of CBAs in combination with DMJ against mutant HIV‐1 strains in CEM cell cultures \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Three different HIV‐1 strains that were shown to contain several N‐glycan deletions in their gp120 envelope  were exposed to GNA and HHA in the presence of a variety of DMJ concentrations. When 50, 20 and 8 μM DMJ was combined with GNA ( A--C), DMJ acted synergistically in combination with these CBAs. For example, 4 and 20 μg/ml GNA that showed poor, if any, antiviral efficacy against HIV‐1/GNA‐500(CS) (, panel A) and HIV‐1/HHA‐500(CS) (, panel B) became 100% protective against the virus‐induced cytopathic effect in the presence of 50 μM DMJ, and 40--100% protective in the presence of 20 μM DMJ. Such a synergistic effect was also seen for DMJ against HIV‐1/HHA‐500(SN) when GNA was administered at the higher concentration range (20--500 μM) (, panel C). A similar synergistic activity of DMJ was noted against the mutant virus strains when combined with HHA ( , panels A, B and C).\n\n【32】![Effect of 1‐deoxymannojirimycin on the antiviral effect of GNA against mutant drug‐resistant HIV‐1 strains in CEM cell cultures.](FEB2-581-2060-g002)\n\n【33】![Effect of 1‐deoxymannojirimycin on the antiviral effect of HHA against mutant drug‐resistant HIV‐1 strains in CEM cell cultures.](FEB2-581-2060-g003)\n\n【34】Surprisingly, when the lower GNA and HHA concentrations (0.032--0.8 μM) were combined with DMJ, rather an antagonistic activity was observed. This phenomenon was consistently seen for both HHA and GNA, in the presence of the different DMJ concentrations 删除20:<u></u>.\n\n【35】3.4. Cytostatic and antimetabolic activity of DMJ and CBA combinations in CEM cell cultures \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Neither the CBAs (500 μM) nor DMJ (250 μM) proved inhibitory against CEM cell proliferation whether administered to the cell cultures as single drugs or combined . The drug combinations also had no inhibitory effect on cell metabolism since radiolabeled thymidine, uridine and leucine incorporation into CEM cell DNA, RNA or proteins was not measurably affected.\n\n【37】4. Discussion \n=============\n\n【38】The glycosylation inhibitor DMJ targets the ER and Golgi 通用删除7(英):<u>α(1,2)</u>‐mannosidase I that trims the α1,2‐mannose(s) from the Man~9~(GlcNAc)~2~ glycan after the ER α‐glucosidases I and II have removed the three terminal glucose units from the N‐glycan Glc~3~Man~9~(GlcNAc)~2~ block \\. As a result, the amount of high‐mannose type glycan structures on the glycoprotein markedly increases in the presence of DMJ since further trimming/processing of the high‐mannose glycans to hybrid‐ or complex‐type glycans has been largely prevented by the DMJ‐mediated blockade of the α1,2‐mannosidases I. Since the CBAs GNA and HHA are known to specifically bind to 通用删除7(英):<u>α(1,3)</u>‐ and/or 通用删除7(英):<u>α(1,6)</u>‐mannose oligomer structures 删除20:<u></u>, it could be reasoned that a higher amount of high‐mannose type glycans on gp120 may allow these CBAs to concomittantly bind to a higher amount of glycans on the HIV‐1 envelope. Consequently, they may exert a more pronounced antiviral activity in DMJ‐treated virus‐infected cells. We observed indeed a potentiation of the anti‐HIV‐1 activity of HHA and GNA in the presence of DMJ concentrations that exerted themselves no antiviral activity when used as a single drug. Thus, concomittant administration of glycosylation inhibitors (such as DMJ) and CBAs in HIV‐1‐infected cell cultures may further potentiate the antiviral activity of the mannose‐specific CBAs.\n\n【39】Interestingly, whereas wild‐type virus infection and replication efficiently proceed in the presence of high (i.e. 250 and 100 μM) DMJ concentrations (EC~50~ \\> 500 μM), the mutant HIV‐1 strains that contain multiple deletions of N‐glycans in gp120 gained sensitivity to the inhibitory activity of the α1,2‐mannosidase I inhibitor DMJ in the CEM cell cultures. Whereas DMJ was not effective at all at 500 μM against parent wild‐type virus it could indeed inhibit mutant virus infection at an EC~50~ that ranged between 90 and 150 μM, that is at an at least more than 5--10‐fold lower DMJ concentration. These mutant virus strains showed 7 or 8 glycan deletions at putative N‐glycosylation sites in gp120 删除20:<u></u>, and the deletions preferentially occurred at high‐mannose type glycan sites . Such glycan deletions in the mutant HIV‐1 strains resulted in a marked phenotypic resistance to the HHA and GNA CBAs. It could be assumed that DMJ converts at least part of the remaining glycans of the mutant gp120 into high‐mannose‐type glycan structures, making them more vulnerable to interaction with the CBAs. Consequently, an increased antiviral activity would then be expected upon co‐administration with DMJ, a phenomenon that we indeed observed to occur in the HIV‐infected cell cultures. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been observed to occur when Pradimicin A, a high mannose‐type glycan‐binding antibiotic, was exposed to mammalian U937 cells that had been pretreated with DMJ 删除20:<u></u>. Under these experimental conditions, the cells express high levels of high mannose‐type oligosaccharides and become sensitive to PRM‐A (resulting in apoptosis induction). No such apoptosis induction was observed in PRM‐A‐exposed cell cultures that were not pretreated with DMJ \\. Thus, the combined use of CBAs and the α1,2‐mannosidase‐inhibitor DMJ enabled partial restoration of the phenotypic sensitivity of the mutant HIV‐1 strains against the CBAs. Our results argue for combined administration of CBAs and DMJ to wild‐type virus, because phenotypic resistance development may be expected to slow down when DMJ is present during CBA treatment of HIV‐1. The slight but consistently observed antagonistic activity that has been observed for DMJ when combined with the lowest CBA concentrations is rather puzzling and the molecular basis of this phenomenon is yet unclear.\n\n【40】There is, in general, a concern for the therapeutic application of inhibitors that target cellular enzymes such as the α1,2‐mannosidase I inhibitor DMJ. Indeed, inhibition of cellular glycosylation enzymes in virus‐infected cells may not only compromise proper viral glycopeptide formation, but may also have deleterious effects on glycoproteins of non‐infected cells. However, therapy with drugs, in casu glycosylation inhibitors, should not necessary aim to ablate enzyme activity but should rather be used to modulate enzyme activities involved in glycosylation 删除20:<u></u>. Since the envelope gp120 glycoprotein of HIV is among the highest glycosylated glycoproteins currently known and has a high (functional) requirement of high‐mannose type glycans, it may be assumed that a moderate attenuation of α1,2‐mannosidase I activity may have a more pronounced deleterious impact on the synthesis of the viral envelope glycoprotein than on the cellular glycoproteins, allowing for a certain degree of selectivity of such inhibitors. Proper in vivo experiments should reveal the therapeutic efficacy and feasibility of such drugs.\n\n【41】In conclusion, the 通用删除7(英):<u>α(1,2)</u>‐mannosidase I inhibitor DMJ was found to potentiate the inhibitory activity of CBAs against wild‐type HIV‐1. Administration of DMJ to cell cultures infected with mutant HIV‐1 strains that contain N‐glycan deletions in the gp120 envelope render the mutant virus susceptible to the inhibitory activity of DMJ. Moreover, DMJ can partially reverse the phenotypic resistance of CBAs to the mutant virus strains. These three phenomena may argue for further investigation of glycosidase inhibitors such as, but not limited to, DMJ to be used in combination with CBAs with the aim to further potentiate the antiviral activity of the CBAs and to delay resistance development that may develop under CBA drug pressure.\n\n【42】We are grateful to Ann Absillis and Yoeri Schrooten for excellent technical assistance and Christiane Callebaut for dedicated editorial assistance.

We interpret microstate sequences as discrete stochastic processes where each state corresponds to a representative scalp potential topography. Testing low-order Markovianity of these discrete sequences directly, we find that none of the recordings fulfils the Markov property of order 0, 1 or 2. Further analyses show that the microstate transition matrix is non-stationary over time in 80% (window size 10 s), 60% (window size 20 s) and 44% (window size 40 s) of the subjects, and that transition matrices are asymmetric in 14/20 (70%) subjects. To assess temporal dependencies globally, the time-lagged mutual information function (autoinformation function) of each sequence is compared to the first-order Markov model defined by the classical transition matrix approach. The autoinformation function for the Markovian case is derived analytically and numerically. For experimental data, we find non-Markovian behaviour in the range of the main EEG frequency bands where distinct periodicities related to the subject's EEG frequency spectrum appear. In particular, the microstate clustering algorithm induces frequency doubling with respect to the EEG power spectral density while the tail of the autoinformation function asymptotically reaches the first-order Markov confidence interval for time lags above 1000 ms. In summary, our results show that resting state microstate sequences are non-Markovian processes which inherit periodicities from the underlying EEG dynamics. Our results interpolate between two diverging models of microstate dynamics, memoryless Markov models on one side, and long-range correlated models on the other: microstate sequences display more complex temporal dependencies than captured by the transition matrix approach in the range of the main EEG frequency bands, but show finite memory content in the long run.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction \n===============\n\n【1】Supervision incivility is defined as supervisor's low intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the subordinate, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect . Examples of supervision incivility include the superior (leader) publicly criticizes, slanders, or satirizes the subordinate. There is compelling evidence that supervision incivility results in negative employee attitude, behavior, and psychological health . However, it is unclear whether these negative outcomes occur only at the dyadic level between the superior and the subordinate. Meanwhile, Anderson and Pearson  pointed out that, in order to define the antecedents of workplace aggression, researchers should investigate the response to mistreatment as a related system of social interactions. In line with this view, our research incorporates supervision incivility as a link in a chain of aggressive workplace events to develop and test a trickle-down effect of supervision incivility.\n\n【2】The trickle-down effect is an interesting phenomenon in organizations that describes a transfer process of cognition, affection, or behavior from one party to another, such as from leaders to supervisors and then to employees, or from employees to customers . Previous research has studied a broad range of organizational topics with regard to the trickle-down effect, such as organizational justice , perceived organizational support , and psychological contract . Among all the studies on trickle-down effect, leadership research has received the most attention thus far in such aspects as ethical leadership , transformational leadership , empowering leadership , authentic leadership , and so on. Obviously, most of the research to date has focused on the trickle-down effect of positive leadership and their impact on organization performance. Fewer studies, however, have examined the trickle-down effect of \"dark\" leadership behavior , such as abusive supervision - employees' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in sustained hostile verbal and non-verbal behaviors, excluding physical contact .\n\n【3】Another type of trickle-down effect of dark leadership is supervision incivility, which is lower in intensity than abusive supervision but involves rude or disrespectful behaviors by the supervisors with vague intention to harm their employees . Since workplace incivility is more pervasive than abusive behavior in high-context cultures such as China , and previous research on the trickle-down effect of dark leadership focused on abusive supervision and collected data from low-context cultures such as the United States only , we believe studying the trickle-down effect of supervision incivility in a high-context culture shall be able to complement the existing literature and empirical findings on dark leadership in the workplace.\n\n【4】To develop our trickle-down model of supervision incivility, we applied the social exchange theory . Social exchange theory posits that individual behavior obeys the rule of reciprocity, which will propel the recipient of the benefit to discharge the obligations by returning the favor, in the hope that continuing such a relationship will bring more valued benefits . For example, group leaders who receive fair treatment from their department leaders feel obligated to reciprocate the fair treatment by treating their own subordinates the same way . That is to say, there exists an \"indirect exchange\" between department leaders, group leaders, and employees. When group leaders experience negative behavior from their department leaders, the norm of reciprocity  will lead to a \"get even\" mentality in the former, which manifests themselves in poor treatment of their subordinates in turn. In other words, a department leader's uncivil behavior indirectly impacts employees who are two hierarchical levels below the department leader through its effect on their group leader's uncivil behavior. Thus, we predict that department leaders' uncivil behavior will be positively related to a group leader's uncivil behavior, which in turn will be associated with employee attitudes, behaviors, and mental health, as links in a chain of aggressive workplace events.\n\n【5】As a matter of fact, one aspect of such mental health is the employees' perceived psychological safety, which is defined as a shared belief among employees as to whether it is safe to engage in interpersonal risk-taking in the workplace . Newman et al.  further pointed out that psychological safety is likely more potent and meaningful at the group level. Therefore, to specify our exploration of the trickle-down effect of uncivil leadership behavior, we particularly examine whether the impact of department leader incivility on group psychological safety is mediated by group leader incivility.\n\n【6】Last but not least, previous research on abusive supervision has found that not all uncivil behaviors are equal---the subordinate's perception and attribution of the superior uncivil behavior plays a critical role hereby. In particular, two distinctive types of motives are associated with supervisory abuse---performance promotion and injury initiation . On the one hand, if subordinates perceive their leader's mistreatment of them as to enhance their performance, the impact of the incivility could be mitigated. On the other hand, if the subordinates believe their leader's abusive behavior is more likely to harm them on purpose, they would feel harmed more by their leader's incivility. Therefore, drawing on the attribution literature , we examine the contingent effect of group leader attribution for performance promotion motive and injury initiation motive  on the relationship between department leader incivility and group psychological safety.\n\n【7】In sum, our research tests a mediated-moderation model of supervision incivility and group psychological safety. It can make three unique contributions to the research literature. First, we augment the research on the negative impact of supervision incivility on group psychological safety. Second, we build a trickle-down effect model to unveil how supervision incivility flows top down and consequently undermines group psychological safety. Third, we expand the existing research thoughts on the trickle-down effect of dark leadership behavior by introducing the motive attribution variable as the boundary condition to further clarify its impact on group psychological safety .\n\n【8】2. Theoretical Background \n=========================\n\n【9】2.1. Department Leader Incivility and Group Psychological Safety \n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】As a shared belief by group members with regard to risk-taking in the workplace , group psychological safety is formed through the interaction between group members and their leader and is deeply influenced by supervision support . In a psychologically safe work environment, employees feel that their supervisor or colleagues will respect their thoughts and competencies, have positive intentions to them, and will not reject them for saying what they think or engaging in constructive conflict . Research to date in this area has found that positive leadership styles, such as transformational leadership , ethical leadership , change-oriented leadership , and shared leadership , are all positively and strongly related to group psychological safety. On the other hand, Baumeister et al.  found that people are generally more responsive to negative aspects of their external context than to positive ones across a broad range of psychological phenomena, and negative contextual aspects tend to have stronger influences on people's attitude and behavior than the positive ones. As a type of negative leadership, therefore, supervision incivility may have a greater impact on group psychological safety than positive leadership behavior.\n\n【11】Meanwhile, a department leader engaging in uncivil behavior such as unfair evaluation, cavil, and contempt may undermine their relationship with group members since the department leader is an indirect leader of the group. The department leader can also make group members feel frustrated, unfair, and vulnerable, and negatively impacts group psychological safety. Moreover, department leader incivility may create a stressful workplace climate, causing group members' insecurity and anxiety, which also lead to low group psychological safety . Thus, it is reasonable to infer that department leader incivility behavior will weaken group psychological safety.\n\n【12】Furthermore, according to social exchange theory , interpersonal behavior follows the rule of reciprocity -- \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.\" One condition for such a reciprocity is that the two parties can achieve their goals by exchanging their unique resources directly . When employees receive favorable treatment from their leader in the workplace, the employees will create value for the organization as a reciprocity responding to their leader . On the contrary, if the department leader engages in negative behavior and treat employees uncivilly, the employees are more likely to exchange negative behavior in return . They might feel unsafe in the work atmosphere and thus tend to withdraw from workplace because they cannot directly retaliate against the department leader. Based on these inferences, we propose our first hypothesis: Hypothesis 1.Department leader incivility has a negative effect on group psychological safety.\n\n【13】2.2. Mediating Effect of Group Leader Incivility \n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】As discussed previously, social exchange theory suggests the norm of reciprocity is the key in regulating social behaviors . In other words, benefits received by the group leader from the department leader may be \"repaid\" by the group leader's conferring similar benefits on subordinates and not necessarily by repaying the original benefactor (the department leader) directly. This process is called \"indirect exchange\" by Blau , a construct referring to the circuitous chain of exchange in a group caused by normative obligations. Previous empirical research's findings have supported this argument. For example, Wo et al.  found that, when upper-level managers treat supervisors with interpersonal justice and informational justice, supervisors interpret the respectful and dignified treatment and the open and candid communication as strong organizational recognition and support. Then, the norm of reciprocity will drive supervisors to reciprocate the fair treatment by making their own contribution to the organization. One such reciprocal behavior by the supervisors is to treat their own subordinates with respect, dignity, openness, and candidness. In contrast, when supervisors experience unfair interpersonal or informational treatment from upper-level managers, they feel their organization is not supportive. The norm of reciprocity then leads to a \"get even\" mentality on the part of the supervisors, who are likely to withhold behavior that benefits the organization, such as treating their subordinates nicely. This action by the supervisors in turn lead to low interpersonal and informational justice perceptions among subordinates. In the case of supervision incivility, there might also exist such \"indirect exchange.\" When group leaders experience incivility from department leaders, the norm of reciprocity might lead to a \"get even\" mentality on the part of the group leaders and drive them to take similar uncivil actions against their subordinates. Eventually these actions could negatively impact employees' attitude and behavior, such as their group psychological safety.\n\n【15】Moreover, when further examining the interactions between the department leader, the group leader, and group members, the group leader stands out in a unique liaison role. Lewin  argued that psychologically proximate factors have a more dominant impact on behavior than those less proximate forces. The department leader has frequent, direct contact with the group leader, who in turn directly supervises group members on daily basis. Any uncivil behavior by the department leader will immediately influence the group leader, who then transfers the impact of incivility to his or her direct reports. Specifically, uncivil behavior might serve as the central psychological medium that links department leader incivility to group members' psychological safety. In other words, the uncivil behavior received by the group leader from the department leader may be \"exchanged\" to the subordinate, and ultimately undermines group psychological safety. Empirical research lends support to this assumption. For example, Liu et al.  found that senior managers' deviance behavior \"trickled down\" via its influence on supervisors' abusive behavior to affect group members' creativity. Mayer et al.  indicated that the behavior of abusive managers trickles down to impact on work group's interpersonal deviance through abusive supervisor behavior. In addition, Li and Sun  reported that a manager's authoritarian leadership can trickle down to influence employee's voice behavior through supervisor's authoritarian leadership. Therefore, we propose: Hypothesis 2.Group leader incivility mediates the effect of department leader incivility on group psychological safety.\n\n【16】2.3. Moderating Effect of Attribution Motive \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Research on attribution found that people tend to make causal explanation for the behavior of other individuals around them so as to adjust their own behavior to their social environment . In particular, when encountering incivility from their supervisor, subordinates incline to develop causal attribution for the reason or purpose of the supervisor's incivility as performance-promotion motive or injury-initiation motive . Attribution for performance-promotion motive refers to causing injury so as to accomplish an objective such as eliciting high performance, while attribution for injury-initiation motive only refers to causing injury .\n\n【18】These two types of attribution for supervisor incivility affect subordinates' behavioral responses by following the norm of reciprocity by the social exchange theory. That is, \"benefits\" received from one party may be \"repaid\" by conferring benefits on a third party . Therefore, when a group leader interprets the department leader's motive as performance promotion, the former might believe that the latter's incivility is aligned with the former's own personal interests and will be beneficial to the former's long-term career development. In other words, the group leader will consider the department leader's incivility is justified, reasonable, and conducive to the group leader's own development. Based on social exchange theory, in order to reciprocate the department leader's kindness, the group leader will implement more incivility on the group members and believe that such uncivil action can further improve the group members' performance. In contrast, when the group leader interprets the department leader's motive as injury initiation, the former would perceive the latter's incivility as unethical and harmful to subordinates' experiences in their organization. By the same token, in order to resist this kind of unethical and harmful behavior to the subordinates, the group leader will not impose more supervision incivility on the group members. Thus, we propose the following moderating hypothesis:Hypothesis 3-1.Group leader attribution motive for performance promotion on the part of department leader incivility moderates the positive effect of department leader incivility on group leader incivility, such that the positive effect is stronger for group leaders with a high level of attribution for performance-promotion motive. Hypothesis 3-2.Group leader attribution motive for injury-initiation on the part of department leader incivility moderates the positive effect of department leader incivility on group leader incivility, such that the positive effect is weaker for group leaders with a high level of attribution for injury-initiation motive.\n\n【19】2.4. Mediated-Moderation Model \n------------------------------\n\n【20】Hypotheses 1 and 2 together propose the mediating effect of group leader incivility and Hypotheses 3-1 and 3-2 propose the moderating effect of attribution for performance-promotion motive and attribution for injury-initiation motive. Following the logic of these two pairs of hypotheses and drawing on Hayes'  recommendation on mediating and moderating effect, we propose a mediated-moderation model: Hypothesis 4-1.The indirectly negative effect of department leader incivility on group psychological safety via group leader incivility is moderated by attribution for performance-promotion motive, such that the indirect effect will be strengthened for group leaders with high attribution for performance-promotion motive. Hypothesis 4-2.The indirectly negative effect of department leader incivility on group psychological safety via group leader incivility is moderated by attribution for the injury-initiation motive, such that the indirect effect is weakened for group leaders with high attribution for injury-initiation motive.\n\n【21】Altogether, we summarize our research variables and hypotheses in a conceptual framework in .\n\n【22】3. Method \n=========\n\n【23】3.1. Participants and Procedures \n--------------------------------\n\n【24】Our research proposal was approved by the academic ethics committees of our institutions. We collected data from 11 business and public service organizations in a southern metropolis of China. In each organization, we distributed our survey questionnaires randomly to group leaders and group members through a liaison from the organization. All the respondents were assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of their responses. We received a total of 346 responses out of 452 copies distributed to group members (response rate 76.5%) and 78 responses out of 108 copies to group leaders (response rate 72.2%). Consistent with previous research , we only included groups with five or more respondents. Thus, our final sample included 78 work groups, all of which consisted of five or more employees from the same department in the same organization and their group leaders (supervisors). The final sample consisted of 182 men (42.9%) and 242 women (57.1%), including both group members and their leaders. The survey questionnaire for group members contained measurements on group leader incivility and group psychological safety, while the version for group leaders contained scales measuring department leader incivility, attribution motives, and questions on group size (i.e. number of members) and organization type (i.e. state-owned enterprise and public service, private enterprise, international joint venture enterprise, or wholly foreign-owned enterprise).\n\n【25】3.2. Measures \n-------------\n\n【26】To ensure the reliability and validity of measurements, we adopted well-established scales developed and used by previous researchers in corresponding areas. All the scales were originally developed in English and then translated into Chinese through back-translation validation . They all used five-point Likert scales rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\n\n【27】Department leader incivility and group leader incivility. We measured supervision incivility with a seven-item workplace incivility scale developed by Cortina et al. A sample item is \"My manager or supervisor put me down or was condescending to me\" (α = 0.911). The group leaders were asked to report on the uncivil behavior of their department leader (i.e. middle manager) whereas group members reported on the uncivil behavior of their group leader (i.e. lower managers or supervisors) (α = 0.951).\n\n【28】Group psychological safety. We adopted a seven-term scale developed by Edmondson  to measure group psychological safety. A sample item is \"If I make a mistake on this team, it is often held against me\" (α = 0.836).\n\n【29】Attribution motives. We measured attribution motives with a 10-item scale adapted from Liu et al. including five items for attribution for performance-promotion motive (a sample item is \"My supervisor desire to elicit high performance from me\" (α = 0.750) and five items for attribution for injury-initiation motive (a sample item is \"My supervisor desire to cause injury on me\" (α = 0.750).\n\n【30】Control variables. To ensure the accuracy and rigor of the results, we controlled group size and organization type since these variables may influence group work results .\n\n【31】3.3. Data Analyses \n------------------\n\n【32】We followed a two-step analysis procedure by Anderson and Gerbing  to test the hypotheses with SPSS21.0, Mplus7.4, and Hayes' PROCESS macro .\n\n【33】4. Results \n==========\n\n【34】 shows the descriptive statistics and correlations among all variables.\n\n【35】Following Zhou and Long's  suggestions, we first conducted a varimax rotation analysis of principal factors for all variables to examine the presence and magnitude of the common method variance, according to the number of factor precipitation or common factor interpretation. Five common factors (eigenvalue \\> 1) were extracted from the test results, and the first factor explained only 22.16% of the variance, that is, less than the recommended explanation criterion of 50%. Therefore, we reasonably concluded that the common method variance in the present research was not significant.\n\n【36】Before testing the hypotheses, we examined the distinctiveness of the research variables. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) with maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus 7.4 . The CFA results in  demonstrate that our hypothesized five-factor model (i.e. department leader incivility, group leader incivility, group member psychological safety, attribution for performance-promotion motive, and attribution for injury-initiation motive) was a better fit to the data (x^2^/df = 2.49 \\< 4, Root-Mean-Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.051 \\< 0.08, Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.909 \\> 0.9, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.916 \\> 0.9, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.931 \\> 0.9) than these more parsimonious models: a four-factor model (M1) with attribution for performance-promotion motive and attribution for injury-initiation motive loaded on one factor (x^2^/df = 3.92, RMSEA = 0.098, IFI = 0.761, TLI = 0.705, CFI = 0.827); a three-factor model (M2) with group leader incivility, attribution for performance-promotion motive and attribution for injury-initiation motive loaded on one factor (x^2^/df = 4.64, RMSEA = 0.144, IFI = 0.710, TLI = 0.628, CFI = 0.705); a two-factor model (M3) with group member psychological safety, group leader incivility, attribution for performance-promotion motive and attribution for injury-initiation motive loaded on one factor (x^2^/df = 4.98, RMSEA = 0.131, IFI = 0.593, TLI = 0.572, CFI = 0.591); and a one-factor model (M4) with all variables loaded on a single factor (x^2^/df = 5.42, RMSEA = 0.180, IFI = 0.514, TLI= 0.416, CFI = 0.508).\n\n【37】We also generated the group leader incivility and group psychological safety measures by aggregating employee ratings to the group level so as to place all constructs in the model at the work group level of analysis. To justify the aggregation, we assessed the degree of group member consent in terms of group leader incivility and group psychological safety by calculating the r~wg~ statistic . The r~wg~ statistic is used to determine interrater agreement. The median r~wg~ statistic for group leader incivility was 0.76 and the median r~wg~ statistic for group psychological safety was 0.82. Despite considerable dissent on the adequate \"cut-off\" for r~wg~ value , these values are all greater than the generally accepted level of 0.70.\n\n【38】In addition, we computed intra-class correlations (ICCs) to determine the reliability of group leader incivility and group psychological safety . We used ICC通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> to examine the degree of variability in responses at the individual level that is attributed to being part of the group. The ICC通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> was 0.34, F = 5.91, p \\< 0.01 for group leader incivility and 0.32, F = 1.92, p \\< 0.01 for group psychological safety. We used ICC通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> coefficient to examine the reliability of the group means. The ICC通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> was 0.72 for group leader incivility behavior and 0.71 for group psychological safety. These aggregation statistics provided strong support for combining the variables from the individual level to the workgroup level .\n\n【39】Next, we used the hierarchical regression analysis method to test Hypothesis 1. As shown in , we first entered the control variables (group size and organization type) into the regression model and then department leader incivility via stepwise. The results showed a significantly negative correlation between department leader incivility and group psychological safety (M2, β = −0.577, p \\< 0.001). Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported.\n\n【40】We tested Hypothesis 2 with Hayes' PROCESS macro , in which 10,000 bias-corrected bootstrapped samples are used. The indirect effect of department leader incivility on group psychological safety via group leader incivility is −0.131, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) \\[−0.241, −0.068\\], not including 0 (not shown in ). That is, the indirect effect is significant. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 is supported.\n\n【41】In order to test the moderating role of attribution motives, we first normalized the variable data and used the group-mean-centering technique when testing the interaction effect of department leader incivility and group leader attribution and then conducted regression analysis. As shown in , department leader incivility had a significant positive correlation to group leader incivility (M3, β = 0.588, p \\< 0.001), after entering the interaction term between department leader incivility and attribution for performance-promotion motive in Model 6, and the interaction coefficient is significant (β = 0.220, p \\< 0.05), R^2^ = 0.39 (p \\< 0.001). Meanwhile, after entering the interaction term between department leader incivility and attribution for injury-initiation motive in Model 7, the interaction coefficient is significant (β = −0.208, p \\< 0.05), R^2^ = 0.351 (p \\< 0.001). These results indicate that attribution for performance-promotion motive played a positive moderating role between department leader incivility and group leader incivility; moreover, attribution for injury-initiation motive played a negative moderating role between department leader incivility and group leader incivility. Therefore, both Hypothesis 3-1 and Hypothesis 3-2 receive support.\n\n【42】Finally, we tested Hypotheses 4-1 and 4-2 with Hayes' PROCESS macro . The results showed that, when attribution for performance-promotion and injury-initiation motives are high, the indirect effect of the uncivil manager behavior on the group psychological safety through group leader incivility behavior is −0.272, CI \\[−0.107, −0.484\\] and −0.161, CI \\[−0.355, −0.048\\], respectively, not including 0; when attribution for performance-promotion and injury-initiation motives are low, the indirect effect of department leader incivility on group psychological safety through group leader incivility behavior is −0.147, CI \\[−0.042, −0.319\\] and −0.351, CI \\[−0.169, −0.624\\], respectively, not including 0. Together these results suggested that attribution for performance-promotion motive and injury-initiation motive moderate the indirect effect of department leader incivility behavior on group psychological safety through group leader incivility behavior. Nevertheless, according to Hayes , if the indirect effects are both significant when the moderation variables are either high or low, the index of moderated-moderation criterion must be employed to determine whether the mediated-moderation effect is significant. In the present research, the index of attribution for performance-promotion motive is −0.062, CI (−0.007, −0.153), while the index of attribution for injury-initiation motive is 0.095, CI (0.229, 0.016), not including 0 for both. Thus, both Hypotheses 4-1 and 4-2 are supported.\n\n【43】 and  illustrate the moderating effect of group leader attribution motives (i.e. performance-promotion and injury-initiation motives) between department leader incivility and group leader incivility.  and slope tests show that department leader incivility was more positively related to group leader incivility (β = 0.110, p \\< 0.05) when group leaders' attribution for performance promotion motive was high (3.64 + 0.59) than when it was low (β = 0.091, p \\< 0.05)).  and slope tests demonstrate that department leader incivility was less positively related to group leader incivility (β = 0.072, p \\< 0.05) when group leader attribution for injury initiation motive was high (1.94 + 0.66) than when it was low (β = 0.089, p \\< 0.05).\n\n【44】5. Discussion \n=============\n\n【45】We studied the trickle-down effect of supervision incivility in organizations, i.e. how department leader's incivility affects group leader's incivility and eventually group members' psychological safety. Drawing on a sample of 346 employees and 78 group leaders in 78 work groups, we found that department leader incivility has a negative indirect effect on group member psychological safety through group leader incivility and that this trickle-down effect was moderated by group leader attributions. Specifically, group leader attribution of department leader's incivility for performance promotion motive strengthened the positive influence of department leader incivility on group leader incivility, but group leader attribution of department leader's incivility for injury initiation motive weakened such influence. These findings are in accord with Liu et al.'s  research on the trickle-down effect of executives' deviance behavior on supervisors' abusive behavior and Mayer et al.'s  study on how supervisors' abusive behavior trickle down to affect subordinates' interpersonal deviance in work groups. These findings have meaningful theoretical and managerial implications.\n\n【46】5.1. Theoretical Implications \n-----------------------------\n\n【47】Our findings contribute to the literature on leadership, psychological safety, and attribution in three primary ways. First and foremost, we explored and confirmed the antecedents of supervision incivility in organizations. Previous research on supervision incivility in the workplace has mostly focused on its consequences or dependent variables  but more or less ignored its antecedents or independent variables, i.e. what could cause supervision incivility. Our research complemented this gap by revealing a trickle-down effect, i.e. the department leader incivility has a positive impact on group leader incivility. That is, the uncivil treatment received by the group leader from the department leader can be transferred to group members through \"indirect exchange\" according to social exchange theory . Therefore, studying the proliferation of supervision incivility from high-rank to low-rank managers expanded the scope of research area on supervision incivility.\n\n【48】Second, our research enhances the understanding of the role of dark leadership on employee psychological safety. Previous studies on leadership and group dynamics highlighted the impact of positive leadership behavior on group outcomes  but paid less attention to the relationship between negative leadership behavior and group outcomes. Even less research has probed the impact of destructive leadership such as abusive supervision and workplace bullying on group outcomes . Consequently, the influence of negative leadership on such group outcomes as supervision incivility has generally been left unexplored . We addressed this research gap to provide empirical evidence about the detrimental effect of supervision incivility on subordinate psychological safety. Our research found that department leader incivility behavior has a negative impact on group psychological safety. Department leaders' uncivil actions could bring in stressful climate in the workplace and eventually threaten group members' psychological safety. This finding is consistent with other researchers' results at the individual level . Our research also explores the antecedents of psychological safety. We discovered that department leader incivility and group incivility exerted unique, independent effects on psychological safety. This finding also supports social exchange theory and sheds light on the social exchange nature of workplace incivility . Specifically, if managers are engaged in negative behaviors towards their subordinates, the latter are very likely to respond with negative behaviors in return. Although the subordinates are unlikely to retaliate the leader back directly, they would most likely withdraw from the workplace due to their reduced psychological safety.\n\n【49】Finally, our research broadened the trickle-down model of leadership by unveiling the contingent roles of subordinate attributions in stimulating or preventing the spread of supervision incivility down the organization hierarchy. Researchers have generally looked at how leaders' causal attributions for followers' behaviors may impact leaders' responses to followers . Supervisors respond differently to employee feedback-seeking behavior depending on whether they ascribe employee behavior to performance-enhancement motive or impression management motive . However, empirical research that examines followers' attributions for leader behavior is still scarce . Answering to Liu et al.'s call  about examining followers' attribution for leader behavior, we showed that followers not only develop two causal motive attributions for leaders' incivility, but also that such attributions significantly affect the cascading effect of supervision incivility. Thus, the results may generate crucial insights into the research on leadership process and consequences.\n\n【50】5.2. Practical Implications \n---------------------------\n\n【51】Our research brings in significant implications to management practice as well. Curbing supervision incivility and minimizing its negative impact on group performance is a direct and effective way to create and maintain a positive and productive work climate for employees and managers to contribute to the success of their organization. Organizations should formulate, publicize, and periodically audit and restate their policies against supervision incivility, destructive leadership, and workplace bullying as part of their equal employment obligation. Organizations might also consider enhancing their managers' awareness and immunity to supervision incivility through business ethics and regulation compliance training, management development (e.g. on emotional intelligence), individual coaching programs, and so on. Moreover, organizations can also institutionalize their anti-incivility policy through their management systems in terms of managerial selection and promotion, performance appraisal, and rewarding and compensation. On the other hand, as our findings show, supervision incivility from both department leader and group leader can undermine group members' psychological safety, which is a prerequisite for high group performance and productivity. Organizations, particularly their human resource departments, should take good care of their employees' psychological safety through such practices as emotional counseling, stress coping and resilience training, and other employee assistance programs. Establishing interactive communication channels between the management and employees such as employee engagement survey, employee opinion e-mailbox, online discussion forum, grievance hotline, or managerial open-door policy can help mitigate employees' psychological safety as well.\n\n【52】5.3. Limitations and Directions for Future Research \n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】As with any empirical study, our study has several limitations that point to avenues for future research. First, although we draw on social exchange theory  to explain the trickle-down effect of supervision incivility, alternative theories may be considered to explain the phenomenon, such as social learning theory  and affect-driven displaced aggression theory . Further research can deepen the research area by adopting a design that can further test the relative strengths of several alternative theories in explaining the trickle-down effect of supervision incivility.\n\n【54】Second, we did not empirically test the possible psychological mechanisms between supervision incivility and group member psychological safety, because our research focus on how the conditional, trickle-down effect of supervision incivility from department leader to group leader ultimately damage group member psychological safety. Future study may consider perceived organization support as the mediating process that links supervision incivility and group member psychological safety.\n\n【55】Third, given the focus of our research model on group leaders' reactions to department leader incivility, we only investigated group leader attribution motives. However, Martinko, and Gradner  argued that both leader and subordinate attributions for subordinate successes and failures might explain variance in leader and subordinate behaviors. Thus, future study may more comprehensively consider the impact of subordinate attribution motivation and leader attribution motivation.\n\n【56】Last but not least, we collected only cross-sectional data and ignored the time effect on variables. This restrained us from testing the dynamic impact of supervision incivility on group psychological safety, even though our findings suggested that supervisor incivility can be used as a negative predictor of group psychological safety. Future researchers can use a time-series design to collect horizontal and vertical data through empirical sampling or by employing a field test method.\n\n【57】Conceptualization, C.E.L.

The disease is most common in middle-aged diabetic women. Patients with chronic UTIs, indwelling urethral catheters, urinary tract outlet obstruction, or neurogenic bladders are predisposed to complicated UTIs such as emphysematous cystitis. Air within the urinary tract can also occur due to instrumentation, fistula to a hollow viscus, tissue infarction with necrosis. Patients might have varied presentations, ranging from incidental diagnosis on abdominal imaging to severe sepsis. Gas-forming infections or emphysematous conditions of the urinary tract are potentially life-threatening, and require prompt evaluation and management. We describe a case of emphysematous cystitis that was managed successfully with bladder drainage, intravenous antibiotics, and strict glycemic control.\n\n【2】C[ASE] R[EPORT] \n=======================================\n\n【3】A 45-year-old male who was a known case of type-2 diabetes mellitus for last 16 years, complained of on and off fever, dysuria and turbid colored urine for last 3 months. He was treated with parenteral antibiotics and improved. However, he was lost to follow up. He was admitted with recurrence of symptoms associated with pneumaturia. He had past history of suprapubic catheterization for obstructive uropathy due to meatal stenosis 15 years back. Clinical examination revealed pallor, penile hypospadias, meatal stenosis, bilateral nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and evidence of sensory neuropathy.

It is a rare condition, often occurring in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. The organism most commonly responsible is E.coli (58%). Other organisms reported include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group D Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Clostridium perfringens and Cl. welchii. The clinical presentation of emphysematous cystitis is varied; patients can be asymptomatic, describe pnematuria, or irritative voiding symptoms, or present with an acute abdomen with severe sepsis. Of reported patients with emphysematous cystitis, 7% were asymptomatic and were diagnosed incidentally on abdominal imaging for other concurrent illnesses. Predisposing factors for emphysematous cystitis include diabetes mellitus, neurogenic bladder, lower urinary tract obstruction, urethral catheter placement, vesicourethral reflex, and end stage renal disease. The effects of diabetes mellitus on the urinary tract include diabetic nephropathy, renal papillary necrosis, renal artery stenosis, and bladder dysfunction secondary to neuropathy. These factors combined with glycosuria and impaired leukocyte function place diabetic patients at greater risk of complicated UTIs such as emphysematous cystitis. Overall, two-thirds of reported cases of emphysematous cystitis were diabetic and 64% were women.\n\n【7】The symptoms of emphysematous cystitis are similar to those of uncomplicated cystitis, consisting of frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Patients may be asymptomatic or have nonspecific complaints. Pneumaturia is an infrequent presentation. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis especially in patients with risk factors.\n\n【8】Diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis is established by radiological means. Plain radiographs of the abdomen reveal radiolucency within the lumen of the bladder as a ring of radiolucency outlining the bladder wall. Computed tomography of the abdomen is superior to plain radiographs as a diagnostic tool because it clarifies the extent and location of the gas collection as observed in our case. A pathological assessment of involved bladder tissue might show bladder wall thickening with vesicles of varying size, and microscopically there are multiple gas filled vesicles predominantly within the bladder mucosa, lined by flattened fibrocytes and multinucleated giant cells.\n\n【9】It is thought that the high glucose concentration within the tissues acts as a favourable substrate for organisms to produce carbon dioxide through facultative anaerobic glycolysis. However, this does not account for the significant number of non-diabetic patients with emphysematous infections. In such patients, urinary albumin might act as the substrate for gas production by urinary pathogens. Another theory suggests that an impaired host response, involving vascular compromise and impaired catabolism within the tissues, predisposes patients to gas production within these tissues. The pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but a multifactorial aetiology of impaired host responses with sugar or protein fermentation seems to be a plausible explanation for the production of gas within the affected tissues.\n\n【10】Management consists of adequate urinary drainage, appropriate antibiotic treatment, and good blood glucose control. Surgical debridement or cystectomy may rarely be needed. However, delayed diagnosis may lead to extension to the ureters and renal parenchyma, bladder rupture, and death. The overall death rate of emphysematous cystitis is 7%. The gas is reabsorbed once the infection is eliminated as was seen in our patient \\.\n\n【11】C[ONCLUSION] \n========================\n\n【12】History of pneumaturia and evidence of intraluminal and intramural gas along with bladder thickening on imaging clinches the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "54b3c746-32cd-479e-8174-bfee8162a774", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background \n==========\n\n【1】The ability to make objective measurements of physical activity is of clinical importance for many movement related disorders and to understand lifestyle risk factors for disease. As an example, osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 20% of adult dogs . Affected dogs have changes in mobility, including reduced willingness to exercise, and a tendency to stop on walks . Assessing changes in mobility forms a core part of monitoring treatment response in this disease. However, current outcome measures for this purpose are frequently un-validated and at risk of bias . The few widely available outcome measures that are validated to assess canine mobility are reliant on owner observations that may be subjective or inaccurate . To solve this issue, researchers are turning to accelerometer based technologies that have the potential to objectively measure such movement based parameters. In addition to monitoring movement related disorders, movement based parameters could also monitor general levels of physical activity or energy exertion. Lack of physical activity is an important lifestyle risk factor, both directly, and indirectly through contributing to obesity, for a wide variety of diseases and behaviour problems . In order to facilitate monitoring of physical movement parameters, here we present an open-design algorithm for monitoring canine steps (number and distance).\n\n【2】Accelerometer based activity monitors have been steadily gaining popularity and are generally available as either research-grade or consumer-based devices. Over the past decade, researchers have started to experiment with their suitability for animal populations, including domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Particular focus has been given to measuring Physical Activity as a proxy for dysfunction or disease \\[--\\]. Research grade devices such as such as the Actical (Philips Respironics, Netherlands) and GT3X (Actigraph Inc. USA) (used in  respectively) are attractive as they have software that facilitates data export in formats suitable for post-processing. Unfortunately, the parameters calculated are optimised for human measurements and parameters such as rest, calories and steps are invalid for canine subjects. This leaves the researcher to either make coarse mappings (as in ), or export raw data and develop their own species-specific algorithms. More recently, consumer based devices tailored for canine Physical Activity have emerged \\[--\\]. However, studies such as  which examine robustness, reliability and validity are limited. As the devices are tailored for consumers, management and extraction of bulk data from such devices (which is necessary for research studies) is often manual and cumbersome (e.g. using provided Apps). Most of the consumer devices are collar based and despite recognition of the influences of fitting and placement \\[--\\], these aren't standardised between devices. Currently neither research or consumer based products targeted at dogs offer clear, characterized and detailed explanations of underlying algorithms to calculate parameters such as activity, sleep, step-counts or behaviour. This means before use in research, validation processes must be carried out. Furthermore, there is the possibility of further re-validation requirements following changes to algorithms or calculation approaches between firmware updates or across device versions or models. To mitigate these issues, some animal researchers have made attempts to fill gaps between dog-specific consumer devices and research-grade human devices by making their own sensors . This step is challenging and is a barrier to most.\n\n【3】Akin to humans, some of the most common diseases and welfare concerns have exercise-related outcome measures. Walking forms an important part of exercise for dogs  and thus a step counting measure has promise to be a suitable replacement for otherwise complex actigraphy signal, which measures gross motor activity. Step counts may be a more precise alternative to gross motor activity because they don't include energy resulting from stationary behaviours like scratching or shaking. Furthermore, gross activity and step counts could be used synergistically to partition energy expended through walking separate to activities such as playing or tail chasing. Some dogs might engage in more play at home and expend more energy this way than out on walks which would not be apparent from the gross activity measures alone, but could be if combined with step count data. In humans, providing tools to monitor both cumulative  and temporal distribution of step counts , as well as the variability of step frequency and length of any one bout of walking, have proved useful in improving health outcomes. We hypothesise similar benefits could be realised in the domestic dog population, and thus an accurate tool for detecting steps and measuring their distance is important.\n\n【4】In this paper, a pedometer algorithm is described that is adapted specifically for the quadruped gait cycle and is optimised for canine gait. Measuring canine gait has different requirements to measuring human gait, both due to positioning of device and differences between the way human and dog gait is modelled. Our twofold aim was to develop a method for: (i) Counting steps; and (ii) Estimating distance travelled. The methods were designed to be suitable for quadrupeds, and particularly the domestic dog. The intention behind developing these methods was that they would replace existing methods that are: closed source \\[, \\]; offer uncharacterised performance ; or are optimised for capturing human gait .\n\n【5】To count steps, an approach based on partitioning acceleration was used. We used data from an experimental cohort of healthy dogs (described further in ). Particular consideration was given to algorithms to only detect continuous forward locomotion; it rejects stumble or shuffles. The performance of the proposed algorithm was characterised by comparing step estimates from algorithms to those made through manual annotations of video footage.\n\n【6】To estimating step length, an approach based on signal features was used. This method was evaluated in a second experiment where walks were measured using a GPS system in a free-living setting (on- and off- lead walks without intervention) in a clinically relevant population (dogs with osteoarthritis). This sample of dogs was chosen for convenience and were recruited as part of a larger study and is described in more detail in . The performance of the proposed algorithm was characterised by comparing estimates of walk length from algorithms to those made using GPS data.\n\n【7】Methods \n=======\n\n【8】Subjects - step counting \n------------------------\n\n【9】For the step count experiment a convenience sample of 13 healthy adult dogs were recruited from a local demographic using posters and local advertising.

Walks were videoed using a smart phone at 60 frames-per-second (iPhone 7, Apple Inc, USA) to enable subsequent manual counting of steps. At the start of each walk the dog was fitted with and habituated to a soft-weave, nylon, flat collar fitted with an accelerometer (VetSens, UK). The accelerometer was attached  to the outside of the collar using a single layer of Gorilla Tape (Gorilla Glue Company, USA). The accelerometer was set to log at each axis continuously at 100 Hz with a sensitivity of ±8 g. The collar with the sensors attached was worn in addition to the dogs normal collar and tightened such that two fingers could be placed in-between the material and the neck (as recommended in ). Prior to fitting to collars the accelerometer was clapped against a hand in view of the video camera to place a distinctive signal in the data that would enable subsequent synchronisation between the accelerometer signal and the video. For the duration of each walk, all dogs were kept on lead and walked by the same handler to ensure route adherence and appropriate position for filming. Walking speed of the experimenter was approximately constant (\\~ 6.4kph) and continuous. As dogs were of different sizes the step frequency did vary between dogs. No attempt was made to control the gait of the dog, the side of the handler it walked on, or position relative to the handler (in front or behind). At the end of the walk, the instrumented collar was removed and the data was extracted for processing.Fig. 1Image of the course used for walking the dogs during step counting experiment.

This step is achieved through a method derived from mathematical principles laid out in Whaba's problem. First, rotation matrix is derived such that when applied to the source signal, approximates the gravitational vector optimally in the Dorso-Ventral axis; the target sensor position. The approach starts by filtering any low frequency movements via a 4th order, zero-phase, low-pass Butterworth filter with ω~c~ at 0.1 Hz. The resulting signal is then projected out of Cartesian space onto unit (1 g) sphere in polar coordinates. Signal components falling within a threshold of 0.2 g of the sphere surface are segmented out and labelled as candidates for rotation correction. To preserve signals that might arise from natural movements such as posture transitions, a sliding window of length 10 s is passed over the data. Any orientation transitions occurring within the window are excluded from the list of candidate collar shifts. The remaining elements in the signal are subjected to a cost function (eq. ) that aims to place gravity maximally in the Dorso-Ventral axis; orthonormal to gravity.$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ J(R)=\\frac\\sum \\limits_^N\\parallel _k-_k^2 $$\\end$$Fig. 3Flow diagram highlighting individual process stages of the algorithm for step counting\n\n【14】Where ω~k~ is the k^th^ 3-axis sample in the rotated reference frame, ν~k~ is the k^th^ sample 3-axis sample in the target reference frame and R is the rotation matrix between the present and target reference frames.

In this step the principles laid out in  are followed. Firstly, the Dorso-Ventral axis is filtered with a 4th order Butterworth low-pass filter of ω~c~ at 0.2 Hz. With the resulting signal, a window of 20 s (inspired from ) is used to derive a zero-threshold ; with zero-line half way between maximal-peak and minimal-nadir. Each time the zero-line is crossed by the falling-flank, the crossing times are stored  as step candidates for further comparison against rejection criteria.\n\n【16】The algorithm next establishes the time between each step-candidate is in a range prototypical of a head movement . As  describes, in quadruped locomotion, each stride (initial-contact to initial-contact on the same leg) will result in a dual-peak movement 删除21:<u></u>. This can be modelled as simple harmonic motion around the scapulohumeral joint . For the algorithm, this translates that each falling flank can be associated to a footfall . The valid step frequency range was derived using eq.  as described in . The heaviest and lightest animals in our cohort (64Kg Irish Wolf hound and 11.3Kg mixed breed), led to a step frequency range of 2.50--3.19 Hz. As a generalising step to accommodate dogs outside our cohort weight band, as well as ones that walk outside the ideal gait pattern, a margin was added and the valid step frequency range used for experiments was 2.25--3.75 Hz.$$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ stridefreq\\left({\\mathit}^\\right)=269^ $$\\end$$Fig. 4Illustration of approach used to find falling flank zero crossings and estimate step distance.

Candidates that did not fall within t~step~ within each other were marked. Any window containing more than 3 marked candidates (\\< 70% of the window total) were rejected and did not contribute towards the final step count.\n\n【18】Analysis- step counting \n-----------------------\n\n【19】Videos were annotated by two observers using ELAN software (Max Planck Institute, Netherlands). The definition of one step was taken to be final-contact to initial contact for each thoracic limb. If the limb was not in full view of the camera, the step was not annotated. Steps were annotated wherever possible and no exclusions were made for cornering or for dog head posture. The claps inserted into the accelerometer and video were identified using manual inspection and time-offsets that allowed for synchronisation were calculated. Inter-observer reliability on manual step counts was tested with Cohen's Kappa. The accuracy of the step counter was estimated as the percentage of steps correctly identified against annotations and the positive predictive value was calculated. True positive (TP) predictions were regarded as when the predicted step lay between the final and initial contact of an annotated step (swing phase). False positives (FP) were counted when a prediction was made but no aligning annotation was present. From TP and FP, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was estimated. Pearson's correlations and Bland Altman statistics were calculated for comparison of predicted steps against video annotations using MatLab R2016b.\n\n【20】Subjects - distance travelled \n-----------------------------\n\n【21】For the distance experiments, data was gathered from 10 dogs diagnosed with osteoarthritis in at least one limb by their general veterinary practitioner.

Each dog was fitted with a soft weave nylon flat collar instrumented with a G-Paws GPS (G-Paws Limited, UK) and accelerometer (VetSens UK). This instrumented collar was worn in addition to the dog's normal collar and tightened such that two fingers could be placed in between the collar and the neck. The accelerometer was attached to the outside of the collar using a single layer of Gorilla Tape and the G-Paws was attached using the provided housing. The accelerometer was set to record continuously for a period of seven days with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz at ±8 g sensitivity. Owners were requested to use the G-Paws only during walks and to keep the devices plugged in to be charged when not in use. Owners were also asked to keep a diary of walk times and locations.\n\n【24】Algorithm- distance travelled \n-----------------------------\n\n【25】Estimating distance from step counts can be done in the most basic way by first estimating stride length (directly from weight as suggested in ) and then multiplying by the number of strides. This simplistic approach has been shown to falsely estimate distance in field-based experiments , as stride length changes with gait, terrain and incline. A more sophisticated approach is to estimate stride length dynamically by means of a gait model. For this, the dog's walking gait (which makes up the majority or transportive-locomotion according to ) was split as two independent sets of legs; pelvic and thoracic . Each pair is then modelled as an inverted-pendulum with the thoracic centred on the scapulohumeral joint and pelvic centred on the coxofemoral joint. Over the course of a stride, each set works by transferring the centre of mass (COM) on to the other pair. The accelerometer mounted ventrally on the neck is sensitive to the undulating movement of the COM through the stride and schematically depicted in Fig.\n\n【26】Using trigonometry, h is can be derived as eq. $$\\documentclass[12pt]\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage \n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\usepackage\n                \\setlength\n                \\begin$$ h=\\sqrt{{\\mathrm}_-{\\mathrm}_} $$\\end$$where A~max~ and A~min~ are the maximum and minimum values of ventral acceleration (in m/s^2^) observed around the zero-crossing). For distance estimation, each step is considered independently and stride distance is approximated as the sum of two consecutive steps.\n\n【27】Analysis- distance travelled \n----------------------------\n\n【28】The raw files recorded on the G-Paws sensors were manipulated using Google Earth software v7.1. This software facilitates walks to be manually segmented according to a rule-base described in  which suggests maximal and minimal traveling velocities. For each walk, the total distance travelled was calculated and walks of less than 100 m were rejected. Owner diaries were used to confirm the segmented walks occurred on the correct day and time, had a legitimate duration, and walk location corroborated the GPS data. Using the start and end times directly from the GPS data segments, time-aligned accelerometer data was extracted using a custom Matlab script. The distance estimation mean similarity was estimated by calculating the mean of 1- the percentage difference between GPS and algorithm estimated distance for each walk. Pearson's correlations and Bland Altman statistics were calculated for comparison against the GPS distance estimate using Matlab R2016b.\n\n【29】Results \n=======\n\n【30】Step counting \n-------------\n\n【31】All the dogs recruited for this part of the experiment (n = 13) were healthy adult dogs.

The pedometer algorithm was able to detect 91.0% of these with a PPV of 0.98. The predicted and annotated step counts were highly correlated (r = 0.99, p = 6.072e-10) and Bland Altman statistics revealed a mean difference of 3.96 steps and a critical difference of 25 steps, with all but one dog within the critical difference.

The cohort was made of 4♀ and 6♂. Over the course of the week, all dogs recorded GPS data from at least 1 walk, with 3 dogs completing 2 walks and 1 dog completing 3. The GPS based walk distance ranged from 0.57--2.59 km (mean 1.1 km). All dogs tolerated the equipment well and in total, the GPS equipped collars logged 20,184 m meters over 15 individual walks. This distance was made up of a roughly equal distribution of on and off-lead time (based on owner self-reports). The mean similarity between GPS and algorithm estimated distances was 79% with stdev of 16 删除21:<u></u>. The predicted and GPS measured distances were highly correlated (r = 0.98, p \\< 0.001) and Bland Altman statistics revealed a mean difference of -211 m and a critical difference of 699 m, with all but one walk within the critical difference.\n\n【34】Discussion \n==========\n\n【35】Here we present two algorithms which show good promise in being able to detect steps and estimate distance travelled by a dog, based on data extracted from a collar-mounted accelerometer. Due to the distance estimates being derived from accelerometer signals, rather than GPS, they are supportive of indoor based measurements (where GPS coverage is unfeasible), as well as long-term, continuous operation (not possible with GPS technologies due to high power consumption). The algorithm described is a first step in an accurate tailored system for measuring dog walking out of laboratory conditions. It not specific to any hardware design and with minimal modification (perhaps just axis rotation), could be used on data arising from either existing research grade hardware or raw tri-axial data available from consumer grade devices. Furthermore, unlike , we did not find any observable differences between accuracy of distance estimates and dog size, although the sample in the current study was relatively small. In  pedometers were used which were designed for human gait and unlike the approach used here were not tailored for the canine gait. Further research is needed to establish whether accuracy of pedometer devices is influenced by weight and not just size as has been found in humans . This is important because it could affect research findings. For example, the association observed between body condition score and steps walked in  may have been influenced by a relationship between pedometer accuracy and body weight. The ability to calculate the number of steps taken in time and the distance travelled for steps have two clinically relevant potential uses. Firstly, temporal and spatial measurements of ambulatory behaviour, which can be measured with accelerometers and the algorithms outlined in this paper, alter with movement disorders or other diseases which effect the motor system. The methods presented here therefore offer the first step towards automatic diagnostics and monitoring for veterinarians, owners or researchers interested in disease prediction. Secondly, the number of steps taken per day or distance travelled are simple metrics which are familiar to the general public (e.g. public health schemes promoting 10,000 steps a day). Thus, measuring number of steps or distance travelled could be used to support promotions of healthy lifestyles for dogs, or for weight loss interventions.\n\n【36】The number of steps estimated was highly accurate, but there were a small number of occasions where it was less accurate. By manually reviewing video footage of when accuracy was lower, we found these mostly occurred when a dog was excessively pulling on the leash (such that the leash was taking the majority of the dog's weight). The other occurrence observed when the algorithm failed to perform well, was when dogs walked in tight circles, such to manoeuvre onto a preferred side of the dog walker. If such a movement was classified as a non-step it was rejected. As the algorithm uses a windowing approach, there is the possibility a complete window of steps is rejected due to it containing a single poor candidate step. This could be one reason for the approach consistently underestimating step counts. Despite the algorithm not being able to detect left from right steps, it performed without bias in their delineation. It is anticipated that addition of gyroscope data to the accelerometer data could yield left-right detection; as it has done in human studies .\n\n【37】In this study accelerometers and GPS collars were fitted to a second collar, if the dog already wore one as standard. This was to prevent changes in rotation of the collar or other forces caused directly by an attached leash. No owners reported any concerns with their dog wearing two collars, even when asked directly and dogs showed no visible signs of discomfort. All dogs in our sample were walked on a leash rather than a harness, however, we foresee no reason why the combination of an instrumented collar and harness would influence the algorithms proposed.\n\n【38】The subjects of this study were biased towards the medium to large breed range. Despite this, it did contain a mixture of healthy and arthritic dogs as well as one chondrodysplastic breed (Welsh Corgi). This dog did not appear as an outlier in the dataset. However, to thoroughly characterise the role of morphology, body condition score (obesity) and size, a subsequent study is required. Furthermore, theoretically the inverted pendulum model used to estimate step distance should not be affected by disease such as osteoarthritis, a further study of distance measurements on healthy dogs would confirm this.\n\n【39】During both step count and distance experiments, no effort was made to standardise the gait of the dog. The study design used here meant it was not possible to precisely determine the effect of gait on detection performance or mitigate it through design. Conversely, the data set could be considered naturalistic and thus the results presented are representative of performance in a real deployment. Furthermore, in the distance experiment, the owner determined the dog pace, duration and distance of the walk and put on the collar. In the GPS based data there was an obvious outlier in one walk. While it is not possible to precisely pinpoint the cause of the outlier, the authors suspicion is that this related to collar attachment. This highlights the need for clear instructions for collar placement or that instrumentation is carried out by trained clinicians to ensure proper attachment; highlight by  as important.\n\n【40】Conclusions \n===========\n\n【41】The experimental results show promise that the approach is suitable for accurately discerning steps and associated distance from a collar mounted accelerometer. The use of accelerometers and these algorithms may be preferable to alternative devices such as GPS, due to their suitability for extended durations and in both indoor and outdoor environments. The approaches presented are also preferable to those designed for humans or from dog specific commercially available devices. The reason for this is because humans have a lower cadence than dogs and are obviously bipedal as opposed to quadrupedal; devices designed for humans are not ideally suitable for dogs. Furthermore, commercial devices for pets which may be specialised for dogs have used closed source approaches. Publishing these approaches allows for comparison between devices, without continuous revalidation for each new model of a device. Knowing the rate and number of steps or the distance travelled of a dog could be useful clinically for monitoring disease, or for weight loss monitoring programmes.\n\n【42】Thanks to all the dogs and owners involved in the study and to veterinary practices who allowed us to advertise for participants.

It reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, some cancers, type 2 diabetes, depression, cognitive impairment, and social isolation . Yet, older adults (65 years or older) worldwide are often inactive so that identifying modifiable factors with a high level of reach and long-term impact has become a public health priority .\n\n【2】Walking substantially contributes to daily energy expenditure, is among the most popular activities in older adults and has a low risk of adverse outcomes such as falls and injuries . Notably, errands and shopping are the main reason to leave home, which in turn is predictive physical activity in older adults . Therefore, walkable neighborhoods with ease of access to shops and services may help to promote active aging on a population basis .\n\n【3】Recent systematic reviews confirmed that cumulative neighborhood walkability indices and single walkability attributes including destination access, land use mix, and residential density are associated to older adults' physical activity and walking for transport in particular . However, associations varied depending on the neighborhood definition applied as well as between objective and perceived walkability measures. Possible explanations include that neighborhood definitions of perceived measures (e.g. 10 to 15 min walk from home) correspond more closely to participants' spatial ideas than those commonly used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like administrative districts or home-centered buffers .\n\n【4】Studies in young and middle-aged adults have examined residents' spatial ideas using GIS and mental mapping, i.e. maps drawn by study participants to delineate perceived neighborhoods . For example, Smith et al.  found that adults' perceived neighborhoods shared an average (±standard deviation) of 16 ± 20% with one mile Euclidian buffers and 36 ± 47% with one mile pedestrian network buffers, respectively. Other research also found that environmental correlates of physical activity in older adults varied by neighborhood definition \\[,\\]. For example, Villanueva et al. reported that walking odds increased by 6% to 8% for a one-point change in neighborhood walkability indices that were based on 200 to 1600 m street network buffers . However, GIS studies examining self-defined neighborhoods are scarce and walkability effects have not yet been assessed for perceived neighborhoods in older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to comparatively assess neighborhood walkability and its contribution to older adults' walking for perceived neighborhoods and pre-set pedestrian network buffers.\n\n【5】2. Materials and Methods \n========================\n\n【6】A cross-sectional study was carried out among community dwelling adults aged 65 years or older in Bielefeld, a historically evolved city with approximately 334,000 inhabitants in the north-west of Germany. The sampling frame consisted of senior housings estates listed by the local municipality (accessible housing and assisted living) and were located in the city center, in local district centers, and rural suburbs. A total of 97 residents from 26 senior housings estates answered written surveys and a subsample of 69 residents (71.1%) participated in mental mapping interviews. After exclusion of four participants, who had plotted walking destinations onto the maps but did not provide perceived neighborhood delineations, a total of 65 participants from 23 senior housing estates was included for analysis.\n\n【7】All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Bielefeld School of Public Health Institutional Review Board.\n\n【8】2.1. Survey Measures \n--------------------\n\n【9】Surveys measures included self-reported physical activity, self-rated health, and sociodemographic characteristics. Habitual durations of neighborhood walking and total walking were defined as outcome measures in this study. Both outcomes were assessed with the Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire (NPAQ; ) asking participants to recall a usual week and to report on walking durations within and outside the neighborhood, i.e. 10 to 15 walking minutes from home. The NPAQ has shown high test-retest reliability and moderate criterion-related validity against physical activity monitors in older adults . Self-rated health was measured on a five-point scale asking participants \"In general, would you say that your health is通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> excellent通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u>, very good,通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> good,通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u> fair, or通用删除7(英):<u> (5)</u> poor?\" . Sociodemographic characteristics included age, gender, marital status, and socioeconomic status and were assessed using established items from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for adults (Federal Health Reporting in Germany .\n\n【10】2.2. Mental Mapping Interviews \n------------------------------\n\n【11】Perceived neighborhoods were assessed by mental mapping interviews following established procedures . Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained study assistants asking participants to draw perceived neighborhood delineations on paper maps. The maps originated from OpenStreetMap (OSM), displayed an area of 2 × 2 km, and included the place of residence in the center, local landmarks (e.g. urban parks, water bodies), and places of interest such as shops, public buildings, and public transport. The interviewers helped to orientate on the maps and explained that any size and shape including 'circles, ovals, quads or pentagons' were allowed. Subsequently, participants were asked to (a) recall and plot destinations they usually walk to and (b) free-hand draw what 'you consider to be your neighborhood' onto the maps. The reliability of mental map-based neighborhood delineations has been established elsewhere .\n\n【12】2.3. GIS Procedures \n-------------------\n\n【13】Geospatial data from the 'Authoritative Real Estate Cadastre Information System' (ALKIS) and OSM were processed in ArcGIS 10.3.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The ALKS data base contains administrative geographic information including utilization types of land parcel features and buildings. Utilization types were coded following the GIS procedures by Dobesova and Krivka  to allow for mixed use within the same building and land parcel feature, respectively. Street and path network data including access values for pedestrians originated from OSM; the accuracy of German OSM street and path network data has been evaluated elsewhere .\n\n【14】All GIS procedures were performed for perceived neighborhoods and home-centered pedestrian network buffers. Network buffers were computed based on the OSM pedestrian network and an impedance of 400 m, which is the most frequently used buffer size in older adults . Perceived neighborhoods were digitized from paper maps that were scanned into GIS and georeferenced by assigning real-world coordinate reference points onto the images.\n\n【15】Neighborhood walkability was assessed using the index developed by Frank et al.  with minor adaptions for the European context . The composite score of four walkability attributes (household density, connectivity, land use mix, and retail floor area ratio) was calculated from standardized z-scores of these measures with a double weighting for connectivity :Household density was defined by the number of households per square kilometer of residential area, i.e. residential and mixed-use land parcel features that included residence.Connectivity was assessed by the number of intersections (valence ≥ 3) per square kilometer in the OSM pedestrian network while merging all crossings within a radius of 15 m; water bodies were excluded from the reference area.Land use mix was calculated based on ALKIS land parcel features using Shannon's index for the entropy of land use categories; water bodies were excluded from the analysis.The retail floor area ratio was defined by the share of commercial land parcel features covered by commercial buildings (footprints); commercial and mixed-use utilization types that included commerce were considered among buildings and land parcel features.\n\n【16】More detailed information on GIS procedures is available from [Supplementary Materials].\n\n【17】2.4. Data Analysis \n------------------\n\n【18】Descriptive statistics are presented as percentages or mean values and their standard deviations (±SD). Geometric comparisons between perceived neighborhoods and home-centered buffers included area (km^2^), overlap, and home-centeredness. Overlap was calculated by the percentage of shared area (intersect of both features) divided by the area of perceived neighborhoods. Home-centeredness was calculated by the Euclidian distance from polygon centroids to the senior housing estate location and expressed in meters.\n\n【19】All statistical tests were performed using the Complex Samples module in SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) to account for clustering in senior housing estates, sample weights to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection (Probability-Proportional-to-Size) and a p-value \\< 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. The Binomial test was used to compare the observed proportion of healthy older adults (reporting \"good\" to \"excellent\" self-rated health) to population-based estimates from the Federal Health Reporting System in Germany . Unpaired t-test and χ^2^ tests were used for subsample comparisons. Paired t-tests were computed for individual-based mean differences in geometric measures and walkability attributes for perceived neighborhoods and home-centered buffers. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to compare the contribution of both walkability indices to older adults' walking after adjusting for covariates. All independent variables had Variance Inflation Factor values \\< 10, indicating an acceptable level of multicollinearity, and the assumption of independence of errors was tested with the Durbin-Watson statistic. In the first step, age, gender, marital status, socioeconomic status, self-rated health, and buffer-based walkability were entered simultaneously to the regression models on neighborhood walking and total walking, respectively. Second, buffer-based walkability was removed and the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods was entered in lieu thereof. Partial F-tests were calculated to examine, if including the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods significantly improved the prediction of walking variables.\n\n【20】3. Results \n==========\n\n【21】The sample consisted of 65 older adults with a mean age (±SD) of 72.2 ± 8.6 years. Most participants were women (57.8%), lived with a partner (66.2%), and reported to be in good to excellent health (67.4%), which exceeds the population-based estimate of 51.5% for the age group ≥65 years (p \\< 0.001; ). Subsample comparisons showed that mental mapping participants were more likely to live with a partner than those denying interviews (p \\< 0.05). Age, gender, socioeconomic status and self-rated health were not significantly different between participants and dropouts. However, the proportion of participants reporting good to excellent health (67.4%)\n\n【22】3.1. Descriptive Results \n------------------------\n\n【23】Descriptive statistics are presented in . The mean of self-reported total walking was 68.5 ± 54.3 min per day with 68.5 ± 27.6% being accumulated by neighborhood walking. Comparing perceived neighborhoods and home-centered buffers, statistical significant mean differences were found for area, home-centeredness, the walkability index, and all its components (p \\< 0.05). Perceived neighborhoods covered a mean area of 0.76 ± 0.58 square kilometers and shared 10.1% to 100.0% with home-centered buffers (mean: 0.22 ± 0.59 km^2^); the average overlap was 35.8 ± 17.9%. The centroids of perceived neighborhoods located 194.6 ± 122.1 meters form senior housing estate locations, while the centroids of home-centered buffers were situated closer to the estates (mean: 32.8 ± 30.6 m). The walkability index varied −6.2 to 15.4 for perceived neighborhoods (mean: 1.00 ± 3.7 points) and −5.0 to 8.5 points for home-centered buffers (mean: −0.2 ± 3.7 points). Perceived neighborhoods were also characterized by lower household density, lower pedestrian connectivity, higher land use diversity, and higher retail floor area ratio than home-centered buffers.\n\n【24】3.2. Illustration of Neighborhood Geometries \n--------------------------------------------\n\n【25】 illustrates the geometries of perceived neighborhoods and home-centered buffers. Spatial variability was found between different senior housing estates as well as between individuals living at the same address. For most participants, perceived neighborhoods largely covered home-centered buffers (: ④--⑨) and many also exceeded them in one or more directions (: ④, ⑤, ⑦). For others, there was a partial overlap between perceived neighborhoods and home-centered buffers (: ①--③) and some also appeared to be home-centered like the buffers (: ③, ⑥, ⑨).\n\n【26】3.3. Multivariate Prediction of Walking \n---------------------------------------\n\n【27】 shows the multiple hierarchical regressions on neighborhood walking and total walking. Entering sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health and buffer-based walkability in the first step, 35.9% of the variance in neighborhood walking was explained (R^2^ = 0.359; p \\< 0.001). Buffer-based walkability as well as self-rated health were identified as significant predictors. A one-point change in buffer-based walkability was associated with an estimated increase of 4.11 min per day (95%-CI: 1.65--6.57 min/day). Entering the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods instead of the buffer-based estimate in the second step, the variance accounted for in neighborhood walking statistical significantly increased to 40.4% (ΔR^2^ = 0.046; p = 0.029). A one-point change in the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods was associated with an estimated increase of 4.79 min per day (95%-CI: 2.50--7.08 min/day).\n\n【28】For the prediction of total walking, the model including sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health and buffer-based walkability explained 42.5% of variance (R^2^ = 0.425; p \\< 0.001). Again, buffer-based walkability and self-rated health were significant predictors. A one-point change in buffer-based walkability was associated with an estimated increase of 7.58 min per day (95%-CI: 4.61--10.55 min/day) in total walking. After buffer-based walkability was replaced by the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods, 41.5% of the variance in total walking was accounted for (R^2^ = 0.415; p \\< 0.001). However, the change in R^2^ was not statistical significant for total walking (ΔR^2^ = −0.010; p = 0.320).\n\n【29】4. Discussion \n=============\n\n【30】This study examined GIS-based neighborhood walkability indices and their contribution in explaining older adults' walking for pre-set 400 m pedestrian network buffers and perceived neighborhood areas. Findings showed that total walking and neighborhood walking related to neighborhood walkability, irrespective of neighborhood definition. This is in line with previous studies on total walking and neighborhood walkability  as well as on neighborhood walking and single neighborhood walkability attributes in older adults  and supports that pedestrian-friendly urban planning policies might help to promote active aging.\n\n【31】However, despite relationships being found, this study also suggests that neighborhood definitions affect associations between walkability indices and walking. Based on the walkability index for perceived neighborhoods rather than pre-set 400 m pedestrian network buffers, an additional 4.6% of the variance in neighborhood walking was explained and the estimated increase for a one-point change in the walkability index enhanced from 4.11 to 4.79 min per day. This adds to previous findings that neighborhood walkability attributes and their associations to older adults' physical activity vary by neighborhood definition . Nevertheless, however, another finding of this study was that similar amounts of variance in total walking were explained by models including the walkability index for either home-centered buffers or perceived neighborhoods. This suggests that merely strengthening the context specificity of exposure measures does not improve the predictive power of built environment correlates. Nevertheless, the study supports previous calls to match exposure and outcome definitions spatially, i.e. to strengthen the context specificity of exposure and outcome measures at the same time .\n\n【32】Prospective assessments and spatiotemporal analyses of environmental exposures and health outcomes are required to examine how exposure area definitions affect associations and which areas are causally relevant for physical activity (Uncertain Geographic Context Problem; ). However, although causality cannot be inferred, mental mapping interviews and other qualitative methods provide valuable insights into areas that are relevant from the participants' point of view and, therefore, might help to achieve greater precision in neighborhood studies . Thus, it should be emphasized that older adults' perceived neighborhoods were significantly larger, less home-centered, and that they shared little more than a third of the area with pre-set 400 m pedestrian network buffers. This is comparable to findings that administrative districts  and home-centered buffers  differ geometrically from perceived neighborhoods in other age groups and suggests that pre-set neighborhood definitions do not correspond accurately to participants' spatial ideas. Furthermore, other mental mapping studies found that perceived neighborhoods have non-circular shapes , which is similar to the low level of home-centeredness in this study and suggests that participants include and exclude specific places, when being asked to delineate perceived neighborhoods.\n\n【33】Specifically, this study found that participants referred to more walkable areas and that they may have thought of shopping and mixed-use areas, since perceived neighborhoods were characterized by more diverse land use and higher retail floor area ratio than home-centered buffers. This adds to previous studies that have employed location monitoring to examine neighborhood walkability impacts on physical activity and activity space, i.e. a measure of spatial behavior generated form Global Positioning System data . These studies consistently found that activity space differed geometrically from commonly used buffers around homes  and some also indicated that neighborhood walkability related to areas around homes that were actually utilized for physical activity . Therefore, and consistent with the results from the present study, it may be suggested that commonly used buffers might underestimate neighborhood walkability and its contribution to physical activity in older adults. However, more research is needed to identify appropriate scales and zonings as well as neighborhood characteristics that impact on participants' spatial ideas and perceived neighborhood delineations. Particularly, further study is warranted to compare perceived neighborhoods and activity spaces or integrate both approaches to establish exposure definitions that capture areas that are actually utilized as well as those being otherwise important from the residents' perspective .\n\n【34】Finally, there are some strengths and limitations to keep in mind when interpreting these findings. This study is among the first to examine associations between older adults' walking and neighborhood walkability indices for perceived neighborhoods and home-centered 400 m pedestrian network buffers. A major strength was the assessment of perceived neighborhoods to examine residents' spatial ideas in mental mapping interviews . The interviews were conducted by trained study assistants and with reference to established procedures . As a result, 65 in 69 participants provided neighborhood delineations that were suitable for GIS analysis. However, personal contact may also be discussed as a reason for reduced study attendance , since a total of 28 (28.9%) participants refused mental mapping interviews, and singles were more likely to opt out than those living in domestic partnerships or married. Nevertheless, including a total of 65 participants from 23 different senior housing estates, this study allowed for individual and location-based comparisons of older adults' perceived neighborhoods. Further strengths include the application of administrative geospatial data that allowed to calculate the retail floor area ratio, which has frequently been neglected in previous studies . In addition, OSM data allowed to evaluate connectivity based on pedestrian rather than street networks , and it has been shown that OSM data provide more comprehensive walking route information than commercial databases .\n\n【35】Study limitations include the cross-sectional study design, recruitment of a predominantly female and healthy convenience sample, and reliance on self-reported physical activity. Cross-sectional studies demonstrate association rather than causation and might involve the risk of residential self-selection. However, studies adjusting for residential preferences indicate that neighborhood walkability is correlated with physical activity beyond residential self-selection . Furthermore, others have reported under-reporting of physical activity among women and older adults , so that recall bias cannot be ruled out for this study. However, a validated physical activity questionnaire was used  and there is no reason to assume that response bias would affect the associations to buffer-based and perceived neighborhood-based walkability indices differently. Finally, it should be noted that the study accounted for areal clustering using complex sample statistics but did not employ multilevel analysis due to small numbers of participants per senior housing estate and corresponding model insufficiencies. Therefore, replication in larger and more diverse samples is warranted.\n\n【36】5. Conclusions \n==============\n\n【37】Examining exposure area definitions for neighborhood walkability, this study found a lack of correspondence between commonly used buffers and older adults' spatial ideas of perceived neighborhood areas. Findings suggest that geometric differences between exposure areas affect the association between neighborhood walkability and neighborhood walking. This supports that findings may not be directly comparable between studies with different exposure area definitions and that exposure areas should be matched, i.e. to correspond spatially, with the spatial dimension of outcome variables. Exposure area definitions, therefore, merit particular consideration, at least when examining associations to location-based physical activity measures like neighborhood walking. Moreover, a lack of correspondence between commonly used buffers and perceived neighborhood areas also provides a possible explanation for inconsistencies in the literature on GIS-based vs. self-reported walkability measures and their associations to older adults' physical activity. However, further studies in larger and more diverse samples are required to identify neighborhood characteristics that impact on self-defined neighborhood delineations and develop exposure area definitions that integrate participants' spatial ideas and actual spatial behavior.

From January 2006 to November 2011, a prospective, observational study was conducted to compare quality of life in patients affected by advanced ovarian cancer and submitted to primary cytoreduction in the Division of Gynecology of the University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. After surgery patients were stratified into 2 groups (group A: standard surgery or group B: extensive upper abdomen surgery). All patients were submitted to standard chemotherapy. At completion of treatment, during the first follow-up visit, all eligible patients were asked to fill in quality of life questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30)  and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire-OV28 (QLQ-OV28) questionnaires. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled into our study. Nine were excluded, so finally 80 patients were considered in this study. Group A included 40 patients and underwent standard surgery (pelvic surgery); group B, included 40 patients and underwent extensive upper abdomen surgery. There were no statistical differences in terms of major surgical complication rates (15% vs. 10%). We registered same times of beginning of chemotherapy (median, 19 vs 21 days) and no severe related toxicities. Quality-of-life scores of both questionnaires were comparable between groups, with the exception of Global Health Status in QLC-30. Upper abdomen surgery is a feasible and safe therapeutic option.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the changes in BA serum concentrations and renal excretion in patients with different stage of CRF or after kidney transplantation and to elucidate whether these might play a role in the development of pruritus, a common symptom in this disease. This study was carried out on 125 patients. None of them had a history or signs of hepatobiliary malfunction. They belonged either to a control group (N = 31) or to one of the three following CRF groups: patients maintained only on a low-protein diet (diet group, N = 23); the same, together with periodic sessions of hemodialysis (dialysis group, N = 42); and patients who had undergone a kidney transplant more than 1 and less than 2 years before (transplanted group, N = 29). Serum and urine BA concentrations were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pruritus was quantified by means of a questionnaire answered at the time of sample collection. A marked hypercholanemia together with a reduction in BA output into urine and profound alterations in the profiles of these compounds in both serum and urine in patients with CRF were observed. The levels of total BAs in serum, but not the proportions of molecular species, were corrected by hemodialysis. By contrast, kidney transplant reversed BA serum patterns to normality but, due to immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporin A, total serum BA concentrations were consistently elevated in this group. Pruritus was more frequent in patients with impaired kidney function and hypercholanemia, although no significant correlation between the degree of this symptom and the magnitude of the serum concentrations of total or individual BAs were found. By contrast, in spite of hypercholanemia, once renal function had been restored by kidney transplantation, none of the patients suffered from pruritus. These results suggest that the kidney plays an important role in determining the serum BA pool size and composition and that hypercholanemia may be a contributing factor, but not the only one, determining the development of pruritus in patients with CRF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Branching morphogenesis occurs initially by bifurcation of terminal end buds (TEB) during puberty to produce a ductal network  of bilayered epithelium consisting of luminal and myoepithelial layers, the latter in close contact with a laminin-rich basement membrane embedded within a collagen/adipocyte stroma . During pregnancy, tertiary branching and formation of lobuolaveolar milk producing structures (acini) takes place in response to estrogen, progesterone and prolactin (Prl). Such processes are largely dependent on the concerted movement of cells , often in response to reciprocal signaling between the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. Such features should be recapitulated in the development of enhanced in vitro 3D models that support ductal-alveolar morphogenesis. However, current in vitro models such as Engelbrecht Holme-Swarm tumor-derived rBM or pure collagen gels do not utilize epithelial/stromal co-culture and display significant physiological and material limitations including tumor origin, batch variation and cell-mediated contraction altering porosity and elasticity of the gel structure  with implications for long-term studies. Indeed, model systems utilizing rBM could be considered more pertinent to end-stage developmental analyses highlighted by the tendency for mammary organoids to form cyst-like structures which fail to differentiate between ductal and alveolar mammary epithelium. ln this context it is noteworthy that most breast cancers arise in ducts .\n\n【2】!\n\n【3】Utilizing a controlled freeze drying and cross-linking procedure we have engineered a chemically defined porous scaffold matrix comprising two prevalent constituents of the mammary gland ECM, type I collagen and HA. Fibrous collagen type I is localized to mammary ducts , has a high tensile strength and numerous attachment sites for cells and biological mediators . HA is a highly ionisable polysaccharide secreted to the pericellular space, where it contributes to tissue hydration and, through membrane bound receptors CD44 and RHAMM, influences cell motility , proliferation  and survival . A morphogenic role for HA-CD44 signaling has been described in prostate , uretic bud  and mammary gland. HA concentration is both sensitive to exogenous estrogen and progesterone delivery  and is proportionally localized to the TEB . We have thus sought to control epithelial organoid development in vitro of a novel bipotential progenitor mammary epithelial cell line KIM-2  in co-culture with differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by varying the weight/% ratio of HA and collagen scaffold constituents. Unlike hydrogels, such a system supports seeding and differentiation of the stromal cell type by chemical mediators to form a synthetic fatpad prior to further 3D seeding with epithelial cells, recapitulating in vitro the migration of epithelium into stroma, a hallmark of mammary gland development.\n\n【4】Results and Discussion \n======================\n\n【5】An epithelial and stromal 3D co-culture strategy generates functional mammary tissue organoids \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】3T3-L1 preadipocytes have long been used as a model system to study adipogenic differentiation , are known to express high levels of two essential basement membrane proteins collagen type IV (colIV) and laminin  and have been shown to be important for mammary alveolar morphogenesis in 2D co-cultures . KIM-2 cells are a conditionally immortal mouse mammary epithelial cell line that can give rise to both the luminal and myoepithelial lineages and differentiate to produce milk proteins by lactogenic hormone supplementation . In 2D co-cultures of 3T3-L1 and KIM-2, de novo synthesis of basement membrane proteins is regulated by adipogenic differentiation and the localization of cell type (-F). 3T3-L1 and KIM-2 mammary epithelial cells organized into monotypic islands 删除20:<u></u> that further supported the differentiation of KIM-2 cells with lactogenic hormones 删除20:<u></u>. Copious laminin and colIV were localized to the stromal cell compartment 删除20:<u></u>. In transwell assays colIV protein levels were dependent upon adipogenic conversion of the 3T3-L1 compartment prior to seeding with KIM-2 cells 删除20:<u></u>. Furthermore, laminin protein levels were raised under adipogenic conditions when epithelial and stromal cell lines were overlaid for 7 days, thus demonstrating that direct contact between the epithelial and stromal cells is optimal.\n\n【7】Mindful of the well-recognized role of basement membrane in establishing appropriate epithelial polarity in mammary gland , we established a sequentially seeded stromal/epithelial co-culture model within a porous 3D scaffold matrix. Resultant collagen/HA scaffolds  exhibited homogenous intercommunicating pores mostly ranging in diameter between 100--300 µm. It was found that the addition of HA to collagen limited the collapse of the porous network with extended soaking , in addition to enhancing swelling and mass-loss properties of the scaffold compared to pure collagen scaffolds . To setup our in vitro system, stage 1 involves the generation of a 3D synthetic fatpad by immersing scaffolds in a diffuse suspension of 3T3-L1 cells. These cells are allowed to proliferate to confluence before inducing differentiation to mature adipocytes with standard adipogenic media supplementation . Stage 2 involves the introduction of KIM-2 cells throughout the scaffold, again via agitation within a cell suspension. Such a technique was found to be sufficient for diffuse seeding to full scaffold thickness (\\>1 mm, ) with both cell types located in direct contact. We had previously determined that short-term attachment of KIM-2 cells was enhanced by the presence of HA in thin film substrates of the same material as our porous scaffolds 删除20:<u></u>. Cell viability studies quantifying the live-cell indicator calcein-AM versus the nuclear localization of propidium iodide (PI) in dead cells revealed that 3T3-L1 cells experienced a mean 14.3% reduction in viability over a 1 week period in pure collagen scaffolds against a mean 10.5% reduction within 7.5%HA/collagen scaffolds 删除20:<u></u>. This reduction in viability was matched across central and edge regions of each scaffold type, however cells cultured for longer periods (1 wk\\<) revealed that the prevalence of live cells was greater at the periphery of the scaffold 删除20:<u></u>, likely due to nutrient diffusion limitations to the scaffold centre. It is also notable that cell seeded scaffolds tended to float during the latter periods of culture (2 wks\\<), possibly due to increased adipose content.\n\n【8】Following 3 wks culture of KIM-2 cells in the presence (co-culture) or absence (mono-culture) of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and exposure to lactogenic hormone cocktail (+/-Prl) during the latter 2 wks (Lactogenic/Control), KIM-2 cells formed extensive branched organoids with blunt ends that exhibited ductal or acinar morphologies much like in vivo mammary gland . These organoids were predominantly located at a depth of 160 µm from the scaffold surface 删除20:<u></u>. KIM-2 organoids displayed correct epithelial polarity with aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and ZO-1 tight junctions arranged towards a luminal cavity ( G,H respectively). Conversely integrin β-1 and colIV and laminin were localized to the basal surface ( respectively). Furthermore there was evidence that KIM-2 organized to an E-cadherin (E-cad) positive luminal epithelium surrounded basally by a smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive myoepithelium  in a similar manner to the native gland , and that β-casein is secreted and accumulates in a lumen in response to lactogenic hormones . These data demonstrate that functional polarized ductal and acinar structures can develop in the presence of a scaffold supported adipocyte 'stroma'.\n\n【9】![3T3-L1/KIM-2 co-culture in defined collagen/hyaluronic acid scaffolds generate bilayed, functional mammary epithelial organoids.\\\nH&E (a,b) and immunohistochemical (c-o) comparison of epithelial organoid formations in vitro with murine gland (scale bars  = 50 µm, except j,o  = 30 µm). Examples of branched ducts in vivo (a) and in vitro (b,c). Like the native gland at 5days gestation, epithelial organoids display polarity with AQP5 (g) and ZO-1 (h) towards a luminal cavity and integrin β-1 (e) and basement membrane constituents colIV (l) and laminin (m) at the basal surface. SMA(+) myoepithelial cells surround luminal epithelial cells (j), characteristic of the epithelial bilayer in vivo (i). With lactogenic stiumuli, organoid acinar-like structures express β-casein in a luminal cavity (o) as in the native gland (n).]\n\n【10】Mammary organoid development can be directed through defined scaffold composition \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】To assess whether the scaffold can be modified to manipulate epithelial developmental outcome, dual positive AQP5/E-cad KIM-2 organoids were scored morphologically as ducts or acini by analyzing long and short axis ratios . Strikingly, HA-incorporated scaffolds yielded organoids with proportionally more acinar-like characteristics with 7.5%HA being optimal . In addition, E-cad(+) organoids were scored for physiological polarity based on 'correct' centrally localized AQP5 versus an 'incorrect' peripheral localization. Under lactogenic stimuli, the presence of 3T3-L1 cells enhanced the frequency of physiological KIM-2 organoid development, where the further addition of scaffold HA ensured correctly polarized outcome . Further analysis through immunoblotting, revealed that HA increased E-cad expression in lactogenic co-culture  and in its precursor form in mono-culture conditions . A concomitant decrease in SMA expression in mono-culture conditions with no accompanying modulation of vimentin expression possibly indicated a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) . This diminution of basal cells is supported by flow cytometric analysis of CD24/CD49f which revealed a small but significant reduction in the percentage of myoepithelial KIM-2 cells grown on 15% HA/col films compared to pure collagen and 7.5%HA/col films 删除20:<u></u>.\n\n【12】![Mammary organoid fate is determined by scaffold composition.\\\n(a) Scoring of acinar or ductal AQP5(+)/E-cad(+) epithelial organoids determined by long axis (y)/short axis (x) ratios.

Sustained activation of ERK signaling is required for mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis , whilst inhibiting its action limits branching but allows tubule elongation in developing kidney . In addition ERK activation has been shown to limit mammary luminal cell death during mammosphere formation . An analysis of cleaved caspase 3 (cc3) activity revealed 15% HA/col cultures exhibited a lower apoptotic index compared to pure collagen scaffolds. Limiting the analysis to dual positive AQP5/E-cad cells demonstrated a similar reduction in 15%HA/col compared to 7.5%HA/col . It is worth noting, however, that there was no evidence of apoptotic cells within KIM-2 luminal cavities, possibly indicating a mechanism of localized polarity and cell rearrangement forming hollow organoids in our system. Furthermore, whilst the presence of HA resulted in a reduction in total cell mitotic index in the absence of lactogenic stimuli , there was no observable reduction in organoid size . This may be a consequence of enhanced cell migration, observed in wound-closure assays on HA/col films 删除20:<u></u>. Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2, -3 and -14 play an important role in branching morphogenesis, demonstrating compartmentalized expression between the epithelium and surrounding stroma  and recently have been implicated in mammary epithelial motility and organization . Interestingly lactogenic co-culture conditions enhanced MMP-2 gene expression over mono-culture  and was further enhanced by HA .\n\n【14】HA has been implicated in numerous biological interactions and its influence on mammary organoid development in the current study is likely a result of multifarious chemical and physical interactions. As well as interacting with a diverse number of hyaloronan-binding proteins , its biological effect is known to be dependent on chain length , with shorter oligosaccharides shown to regulate angiogenesis , EMT  and inflammation . HA is synthesized at the cellular surface by membrane associated HA synthases (HAS1-3) where it can form a substantial pericellular coat with gel-like properties  and is known to govern early (\\<minute) attachment to ECM prior to integrin tethering and adhesion maturation . This interaction is known to be attenuated by treatment with hyaluronidase or the presentation of an HA coated surface . Importantly, there was no decreased rate of cell attachment in the present study in the presence of HA, although this was assessed over a timescale suitable to establish integrin-mediated focal adhesions. However, considering the focal nature of integrin attachment  it is possible that the increased frequency of acinar-like structures in HA scaffolds may be attributed to localized electrostatic repulsion of HA coated cells and scaffold surfaces favouring rounded organoid formation, interspersed with integrin mediated adherence to regions of collagen type I.\n\n【15】Primary organoid development and stem cell enriched populations are supported using a synthetic fatpad in vitro \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The ability to grow primary mammary cells in our scaffolds would have substantial benefit. Firstly, such cells enable more relevant physiological studies such as lineage commitment and plasticity. In addition, cells from genetically altered mice could be used to allow investigation of gene function in 3D. The use of our adipocyte seeded scaffolds could also replace the mammary fat pad for stem cell transplantation studies. We therefore replaced KIM-2 cells with primary cells isolated from a transgenic mouse expressing a GFP-tagged histone H2B  expressed under the control of the Keratin 14 (K14) promoter, which is expressed in basal/myoepithelial cells but not in luminal (K18 expressing) cells in vivo . These animals had been fed with doxycyclin for 1 week prior to harvesting of mammary tissue in order to restrict GFP expression to the slower cycling stem cell compartment. Further labeling of the primary cell isolate with a fluorescent tracer dye prior to scaffold seeding enabled the real-time visualization of large branched organoids following 10 days co-culture with 3T3-L1 . Such structures exhibited basally localized GFP, in a similar manner to that of the native gland, and clustering of GFP+ cells at distal extremities. Other researchers have reported a similar localization of basal cells toward the distal tips of epithelial outgrowths in vivo . Immunohistochemistry revealed organoids with cleared lumens, surrounded by basement membrane and appropriate polarity confirmed by the expression of ZO-1 toward the apical surface .\n\n【17】!\n\n【18】We next sought to determine whether our 3D scaffolds would support mammary epithelial niche formation and substitute for fat-pad transplant experiments by sorting cells for GFP expression and co-culturing pure GFP+ populations with differentiated 3T3-L1. Following 2 wks of culture, GFP+ cells aggregated, displaying varying levels of GFP, beta-catenin and cytoplasmic localization of progesterone receptor ( respectively). Interestingly, GFP+ cells displayed a heterotypic p63 profile , probably indicating asymmetric cell division. It is known that p63 functions as a molecular switch during the stratification of epithelial tissues , and this may demonstrate the initiation of myoepithelial differentiation from a progenitor pool.\n\n【19】Conclusions \n-----------\n\n【20】We have developed an in vitro model of mammary gland that allows for the maintenance and differentiation of both epithelial and stromal derived cell lines within a defined 3D scaffold resulting in tissue formation comparable to the native gland. The major advantage of such a system is that it does not require the presence of tumor-derived rBM and retains a stable 3D environment for extended periods in culture. In addition the utility of our scaffolds has been confirmed through data demonstrating that its composition influences mammary organoid developmental outcome in addition to supporting primary stem and progenitor cell organoid development with both ductal and acinar morphology. This study presents a framework for the further development of defined 3D model systems compatible with diverse modification through spatial, biochemical and mechanical control, that may support and direct tissue development from human primary cells. Ultimately this will lead to a better understanding of developmental and disease processes, and allow for personalized medicine initiatives through tailored assays of breast biopsy material and high-throughput therapeutic drug screening.\n\n【21】Materials and Methods \n=====================\n\n【22】All animal work was carried out in accordance with the rules and guidance of the University of Cambridge local ethical committee and a project license awarded by the UK Home Office. All materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK, unless otherwise stated.\n\n【23】Collagen/hyaluronic acid scaffold and film fabrication \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Highly porous scaffolds were produced from a collagen-HA suspension using a freeze-drying technique. Firstly, a suspension of 1%weight (wt) of different component compositions were prepared from bovine type I collagen from Achilles tendon and bovine HA from vitreous humor (H7630, Sigma) in a 0.05 M pH 2.0 acetic acid solution. Each suspension was blended at 20,000 rpm using an overhead homogenizer for 30 min at 40°C. After mixing, the suspension was debubbled by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min. Two different HA weight percentages (7.5 and 15 wt-%) and pure collagen suspensions were produced which were then frozen in 316L stainless steel plates at a controlled rate to −30°C and subsequently sublimed at 0°C for 24 h under a vacuum of less than 100 mTorr, using a computer-controlled freeze-dryer. Lyophilized collagen and collagen-HA scaffolds were crosslinked in 95% ethanol solution containing 33 mM of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 6 mM of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for 4 h at 25°C. After the crosslinking, the scaffolds were washed thoroughly in distilled water (5 min×5) and were subsequently re-frozen and re-lyophilized using the previous freeze-drying cycle. Disc samples of 10 mm diameter were then cut from lyophilized sheet using a punch. Films were prepared from different collagen-HA 0.5%-wt suspensions using the same procedure. Suspensions of collagen, 7.5%HA/col and 15%HA/col were subsequently spread over 60 mm Petri dishes at a quantity suitable to obtain films of 5--7 µm thickness (assuming a density of solid collagen at 1.3 g cm^−3^ and of HA 1.0 g cm^−3^). Dried films were cross-linked with a water-soluble carbodiimide EDC in the presence of NHS following the same procedure as for scaffold production, and then re-dried in air. Before cell culture, scaffolds and films were sterilized by exposure to UV light at 500 mJ/cm^2^ and rinsed trice in distilled water and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) before incubation in PBS for 24 h.\n\n【25】Direct and transwell co-culture of 3T3-L1 and KIM-2 \n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】3T3-L1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were plated at 3×10^4^/cm^2^ in 12 well plates and maintained for 5days in DMEM + 10% new born calf serum (NBCS) (both Gibco, Invitrogen Paisley, UK). Terminal differentiation was induced by treatment for 48 h with DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco), l µM dexamethasone (DEX), 0.5 mM 3-iso-butyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 0.01 mg/ml^−1^ insulin. Following this procedure, 3×10^5^ KIM-2 cells  were added to each 3T3-L1 seeded well (Direct culture) or to transwell inserts positioned above the 3T3-L1 confluent cell sheet and each well was maintained in KIM-2 maintenance media consisting of DMEM+F12 1∶1 + 10% FCS, 0.8 mM insulin, 0.8 mM EGF and 17 mM linoleic acid (LA). Co-cultures were maintained for a period of 1 wk before analysis. For confirmation of lactogenic differentiation by KIM-2 in the presence of 3T3-L1, 1 well was rinsed in PBS and bathed in lactogenic media, DMEM+F12 1∶1 plus 10% FCS, 0.8 mM insulin, 0.2 mM prolactin, 1 mM DEX and 17 mM LA for a further week.\n\n【27】Mono-culture and Co-culture preparation of 3D cell-seeded scaffolds \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】The 3T3-L1 cell line (ATCC) was maintained in DMEM plus 10% NBCS, and passaged at \\<80% confluence. KIM-2 cells were passaged in KIM-2 maintenance media as described above. To seed 3D co-cultures, a single cell suspension of 3T3-L1 cells was adjusted to 10^6^ cells/mL in a 50 ml falcon tube. Five scaffolds were added to a 10 mL cell suspension, each scaffold being rolled against the tube sidewall using a sterile pipette to eliminate air bubbles. Cell/scaffold suspensions were removed to a rotary plate set to 0.5 Hz for 4 h at 37° to allow further penetration of cells to the scaffold centre. Cell-seeded scaffolds were then removed to a 12 well plate and incubated in 1.5 mLs DMEM plus 10% NBCS for 5 days to ensure cell confluence, confirmed by live cell fluorescence visualization with 5 µM calcein-AM (Invitrogen). Terminal differentiation was induced for 48 h as previously described prior to secondary seeding with epithelial cells. Secondary seeding of KIM-2 cells was accomplished using the same techniques but without compression of the scaffolds. Co-cultures were maintained in KIM-2 maintenance media for 1 wk before rinsing with PBS then treatment with lactogenic media, DMEM+F12 1∶1 plus 10% FCS, 0.8 mM insulin, 0.2 mM prolactin, 1 mM DEX and 17 mM LA for 2 wks. KIM-2 mono-cultures were established using the same method and grown for 3 wks total, with or without 2 wks lactogenic culture. Following incubation periods cell seeded scaffolds were snap frozen in liquid N~2~ or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for cryosectioning and paraffin embedding. Whole cell--seeded scaffolds were stained with carmine following previously published methods . Cut sections were stained with H&E and Oil-Red O as described previously .\n\n【29】3D Co-culture of 3T3-L1 and primary murine mammary epithelial cells \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Tissue from the mammary glands of H2B-GFP expressing transgenic mice  was digested overnight at 37°C in DMEM + F12 containing 1 mg/mL collagenase (10103578001, Roche, Switz) and 1000 U/mL hyaluronidase and further dissociated with 5 mg/ mL dispase, 0.1 mg/mL DNase, and trypsin-EDTA. Red blood cells were removed with ammonium chloride. These cells were then adjusted in suspension to 10^5^ cells/mL and seeded within 1 wk adipogenic 3T3-L1 seeded scaffolds. Primary epithelial seeded co-cultures were distributed within 12 well plates and maintained for a further week in 1.5 mL KIM-2 maintenance media, with or without progesterone (10 nM). Specimens were then processed as above. For the selection of H2B GFP+ cells, freshly digested primary tissue isolates were sorted on the GFP channel of a MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, USA). Propidium iodide (PI, 2.5 µg/ml) was added one minute before sample analysis.\n\n【31】KIM-2 attachment and migration on 2D films \n------------------------------------------\n\n【32】A KIM-2 cell suspension of 10^6^ cells/mL was incubated in the presence or absence of anti-CD44 (1/500, KM114, BD Biosciences, Oxon UK.) for 30 m prior to seeding on collagen, 7.5%/HAcol and 15%HAcol films at 10^5^ cells/cm^2^ and monitored by phase-contrast microscopy for 24 hrs. Cells were judged to be attached by visual observation of cell flattening and lamellopodia formation. At 48 hrs a confluent cell surface was scratched using a sterile pipette and migration monitored at 10minute intervals using time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy at x100 (Zeiss Axiovert S100, Carl Zeiss, Herts, UK). Individual cell movement was monitored by tracking cell nuclei using ImageJ software .\n\n【33】Basal and luminal epithelial FACS analysis on 2D films \n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Epithelial cells were trypsinized and labeled with the following antibodies: PE anti-CD24 (1/500 , 12-0242, eBioscience, Hatfield, UK) and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-CD49f (1/200, 313610, BioLegend, Cambridge, UK). Propidium iodide (PI, 2.5 µg/ml) was added one minute before sample analysis and cells were filtered at 30 µm immediately prior to FACS. Cells were analyzed using a CyAnTM ADP flow cytometer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Ten thousand cells per analysis were recorded.\n\n【35】Immunodetection \n---------------\n\n【36】Immunohistochemistry was carried out on Paraffin-embedded and cryopreserved sections. Paraffin-embedded samples were de-pariffinized and rehydrated before antigen retrieval by boiling in 10 mM Tri-sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 11 m. Sections were blocked for 1 hr in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in Tris buffer saline + 0.1% Tween20 (TBST) prior to incubation at 4°C overnight in primary antibodies or isotype controls. Antibodies were prepared at the following dilutions in 10% NGS + TBST; E-cad (1/500, 610182, BD Biosciences), β-casein (a gift from Bert Binas, 1/500), ZO-1 (1/250, MAB 1570, Millipore Temicula CA, USA), β-1 integrin (1/100, MAB 1997, Millipore), AQP5 (1/100, AB3559, Millipore,), SMA (1/200, ab5694, Abcam, Cambs UK), Ki67 (1/500, NCL-Ki67p, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle UK), Laminin (1/100, ab11575, Abcam), Collagen IV (1/100, ColIV, ab6576, Abcam), Cleaved-caspase 3 (1/100, CC3, 9661S, Cell Signalling, Beverly, MA USA). Signal was detected using Cy3- and Alexa-488 (Invitrogen) conjugated secondary antibodies (1/400) and nuclei stained with bisbenzimide-Hoechst 33342 before analysis by fluorescence microscopy and data capture (Zeiss Axiophot). Immunocytochemistry was carried out on cell monolayers fixed for 4 hrs in paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25%Triton X-100 before blocking in blocking buffer and antigen detection as described above. Preparation for immunoblotting and signal detection was carried out as previously described  with lanes adjusted for equal protein loading by densitometric lane analysis of β-actin (Abcam, Cambs UK) using ImageJ software. Antibodies against β-casein (1/10000), E-cad, SMA (ab5694, Abcam). Vimentin (V4630), P-ERK (9106S, Cell Signalling), ERK (610124, BD Biosciences) (all 1/1000) were used to probe against specific antigens.\n\n【37】Live cell imaging \n-----------------\n\n【38】Whole primary epithelial and GFP+ sorted cell isolates were loaded with 10 µM cell tracker dye (Celltracker red CMTPX, Invitrogen) for 30 minutes prior to seeding in adipogenic scaffolds as outlined above. Following 10 days of culture, scaffolds were removed to the environment chamber of a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP II, Leica, Germany) and GFP and cell tracker visualised by laser excitation at 488 nm and 543 nm respectively. Images were analyzed by propriety software (Leica). For an assessment of sequential 3D seeding, 3T3-L1 cells loaded with cell tracker dye were cultured in scaffolds for 48 hrs prior to seeding with KIM-2 cells transfected with an MSCV-IRES-GFP empty vector (kindly provided by Prof. Göttgens, Department of Haematology, Cambridge, UK).\n\n【39】Viability testing \n-----------------\n\n【40】3T3-L1 seeded scaffolds were halved in the vertical plane and bathed for 1 hr in complete media with 5 µM Calcein AM (Invitrogen). PI was added for the final 5 minutes of incubation (2.5 µg/ml) to label dead cells. Scaffolds were placed cut-side down on a glass coverslip and viewed under a fluorescent microscope using a 20x objective and digital image capture. Live and dead cells were recorded using ImageJ software under a 300% zoom factor. Edge measurements corresponded to within 1 imaging frame of the scaffold edge (maximum depth of 185 µm).\n\n【41】Image analysis and statistics \n-----------------------------\n\n【42】Quantification of Ki67 and CC3 signal and pixel measurement of long and short axis ratio in E-cad+/AQP5+ organoids was performed using ImageJ software point selection and line selection tools respectively. Confocal image analysis was performed using propriety software (Leica). All statistical analyses by a priori ANOVA and student T Test were performed using Excel data analysis toolpak (Microsoft, WA, USA).\n\n【43】RNA extraction and PCR of gene expression analysis \n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Total RNA from snap-frozen cell seeded scaffolds was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), precipitated in isopropanol and purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley UK). RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop products, Wilminton DE, USA) spectrophotometer and cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1 µg of RNA using random hexanucleotide primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene expression of MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-14 and cyclophillin A was detected by semi-quantitative methods using Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) and real-time quantitative methods by SYBR-green dye chemistry by following the manufacturers protocol. Real-time PCR reactions were run on an iCycler (Biorad) in triplicate and quantitative analysis performed using iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection Software (Biorad) normalized to Cyclophillin A, FW; CCTTGGGCCGCGTCTCCTT, RV; CACCCTGGCACATGAATCCTG. The following primer sequences were obtained using the PrimerBank  website : MMP-2, FW; CAAGTTCCCCGGCGATGTC, RV; TTCTGGTCAAGGTCACCTGTC, MMP-3, FW; ACATGGAGACTTTGTCCCTTTTG, RV; TTGGCTGAGTGGTAGAGTCCC and MMP-14, FW; CAGTATGGCTACCTACCTCCAG, RV; GCCTTGCCTGTCACTTGTAAA.

{"seq_id": "df59103b-6a55-4d97-a2fb-480aab7038a9", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】To ensure Paralympic medals are awarded to the best athletes and not simply to those who are least impaired, para-sport competitions are divided into \"classes\" that are defined based on the type and degree of an athlete's impairment. The process of grouping para-athletes together for competition on the basis of their impairment is known as classification. The aim of classification is to minimize the impact of impairment on the outcome of competition . Classification in para-sports is a two-step process. First, a decision is made whether an athlete's impairment is severe enough to warrant eligibility to compete. Thus, minimum impairment criteria (MIC) are established, which by definition describe the level of impairment that has an impact on performance in that sport ^^. If an athlete is eligible to compete, the second step is to allocate a sport class to the athlete to compete against others whose impairments result in a similar activity limitation .\n\n【2】The IPC Athlete Classification Code  requires all Paralympic sports to adopt an evidence-based classification system that is developed using evidence which demonstrates the relationship between impairment and performance in that sport. Consequently, classification also needs to be sport-specific, because the impact of an impairment is likely to differ depending on the unique demands of each sport (i.e. a leg amputation impacts performance in running differently than in swimming). Following the formulation of the Athlete Classification Code, the IPC adopted a Position Stand describing how classification research should be conducted . The basic approach is to correlate measures of functional impairment with measures of sport-specific performance. Once the impairment--performance relationship has been established, classes can then be formed for athletes with a similar activity limitation within the sport.\n\n【3】While the move toward sport-specific classification has progressed in sports that cater for athletes with physical and intellectual impairment, most sports for athletes with vision impairment (VI) continue to use a long-standing system that employs the same class structure irrespective of the sport. VI athletes are currently allocated to one of three different sport classes (B3, B2, or B1^^) that differ according to the severity of impairment. These criteria were developed on the basis of the World Health Organization's definitions of low vision and blindness . The current system was recently evaluated by a panel of experts across thirteen different VI sports . These experts reached consensus that the existing VI classification procedures do not achieve the aim of minimizing the impact of impairment on performance, with a lack of sport-specificity being the main limitation. Subsequently, a VI-specific Position Stand has been formulated and adopted by both the IPC and the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA). This VI position stand outlines suitable approaches for conducting research into the impairment--performance relationship in VI sports . In agreement with the expert consultation, the VI position stand highlights the need for sport-specificity in classification research. Key sport-specific decisions that need to be made are (i) which aspects of vision should be measured, (ii) how performance should best be measured in that sport, and (iii) under what conditions vision testing should take place.\n\n【4】VI judo is a Paralympic sport where particular controversy exists around the way that athletes are classified. Even though athletes are allocated one of the three classes (B3, B2, and B1), as they are in most other VI sports, during competition all athletes compete against each other regardless of their allocated class. Effectively VI judo thus has only one sport class, with all athletes competing against each other irrespective of whether they are partially sighted or completely blind. Blind athletes are afforded no handicapping or advantage during competition, with the classes only used for the purposes of allocating award ranking points for the World Ranking List on the basis of the match outcomes^^. The rationale behind this historical choice to have a single competition in which athletes from all classes compete is that the adaptations to the competition rules in VI judo increase the likelihood that those with more impairment are not disadvantaged when competing against others with less impairment . In the able-sighted equivalent, athletes commence their bout 4 m apart and must first compete to obtain an advantageous grip on their opponent before battling while in-contact. Because of the presumably high visual demands of this grip fighting , athletes in VI judo instead start with a grip of their opponent already in place. This adaptation presumably lowers the visual demands of the sport, making it more suitable for those with VI by providing an opportunity to rely largely on other sources of information (e.g. haptic, kinesthetic). However, it is doubtful whether the rule adaptations are sufficient to allow judokas with different degrees of VI to compete equitably against each other. Recent analyses of competition outcomes suggest that under the present system, blind judokas might be at a disadvantage when competing against partially sighted opponents (; ). Yet no studies have been carried out which directly relate measures of functional vision to judo performance. This information is required to determine how many classes are warranted for VI judo and where the boundaries between classes should be set .\n\n【5】A critical barrier to the design of experimental studies that investigate the impairment--performance relationship in VI judo is the lack of theoretical understanding of the visual demands of judo. Also, a theoretical model of the key determinants of judo performance affected by vision loss is required to understand the best approach(es) to investigate the impairment--performance relationship in the sport . The VI position stand  suggests that the first step in this process should be to consult with experts in a sport (i.e. athletes, coaches, administrators) to determine the measures of visual function and performance that should be chosen to model the impairment--performance relationship in a given VI sport, and under what circumstances these measures should be collected. For instance, only visual acuity and visual field are currently assessed during VI classification, yet there may be other aspects of visual function which are more important for judo (e.g. the ability to adequately perceive motion or depth might be crucial to successfully anticipate and react to an opponent's attack). Moreover, performance on these tests could be evaluated under different conditions, e.g. using one or both eyes, and with or without optical correction. The best way of testing vision is likely to depend on the nature of the sport, for instance, on the ability of athletes to wear optical correction during training or competition . Sport-specific knowledge is most of all required to understand what aspects of judo performance are most likely to be impacted by VI. Within an interactive, skill-based sport such as judo, the outcome of a match is likely to rely on an interplay of many different factors. Expert knowledge is helpful to decide what aspects of performance are mostly visually guided, and therefore would be worthwhile to measure in classification research. Expert consultation thus functions to identify a candidate list of both impairment and performance measures, which can then be tested empirically to quantify their associative strength . Expert opinion might also be desirable to make other sport-specific decisions for issues on classification research in judo, such as whether or not to account for the age at which VI was acquired .\n\n【6】The aim of this study was to establish expert opinion on the requirements for a sport-specific system of classification for VI judo. We consulted with experts to evaluate to what extent the current classification system in VI judo provides fair competition for all athletes, and to decide (i) which aspects of vision are most likely to impact judo performance, (ii) which aspects of judo performance are most likely to be impacted by VI, (iii) under what conditions vision testing for judo classification should take place, and (iv) other issues specific to classification research in VI judo.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods \n=====================\n\n【8】In this study, we applied the Delphi technique, which offers a structured method to evaluate the opinion of a panel of experts (; ). During the Delphi process, experts respond to a series of surveys. Following each survey, experts receive feedback summarizing the panel's previous answers before new questions are posed.\n\n【9】Participants\n------------\n\n【10】Eighteen participants (M ± SD = 42.6 ± 12.2 years, three female) took part in the expert panel.

The initial survey aimed to discuss current procedures in VI judo classification and address our main aim for the development of sport-specific classification in VI judo. The topics covered follow both the recommendations from the VI position stand and specific issues to VI judo (e.g. impact of VI across weight categories). The initial survey posed largely open-ended questions, with the second and third rounds posing largely closed questions based on the answers provided in the previous round(s). Each section of the survey started with a short summary of background information concerning the topic and/or a summary of previous responses and comments. To ensure that no relevant topics were overlooked, we provided panelists the opportunity at the end of each survey to raise any additional issues they felt were important but had not yet been addressed in the survey.\n\n【15】###### \n\n【16】Description of the 10 different sections covered throughout the surveys, along with the central question each section aimed to investigate.\n\n【17】               Title                                                             Central question\n  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Section 1    Aim of classification                                             Does the current system of classification within VI judo achieve its aim of minimizing the impact of impairment on the outcome of competition?\n  Section 2    Minimum impairment criteria                                       Are the current minimum impairment criteria for VI judo set appropriately or should they change, and if so how?\n  Section 3    Sport classes                                                     Is it appropriate that all eligible athletes in VI judo compete against each other, or should additional sport classes be created?\n  Section 4    Measures of visual function used during classification            Which aspects of vision are most likely to impact on judo performance?\n  Section 5    Impact of vision impairment on different aspects of performance   Which aspects of performance are most likely to be impacted by vision impairment?\n  Section 6    Vision testing conditions                                         Under what conditions should vision testing in classification for VI judo take place?\n  Section 7    Impact of VI across different weight categories                   Does the impact of vision impairment on judo performance differ across weight categories?\n  Section 8    Impact of a congenital compared to an acquired impairment         Does the impact of vision impairment on judo performance differ between athletes with congenital and acquired impairments?\n  Section 9    The use of blindfolds                                             Would the use of blindfolds be an appropriate way to ensure fair competition within VI judo?\n  Section 10   Intentional misrepresentation                                     Is the legitimacy of VI judo considered to be under the threat of athletes deliberately underperforming on classification tests?\n\n【18】During the closed questioning, statements were posed to panelists who typically had to state whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement. In these cases, the aim was to reach consensus, defined as a threshold of at least 75% agreement across panelists calculated separately for each question. This threshold is conservative when compared to other Delphi studies ( report values between 51 and 80%). Because of the technical nature of some questions, panelists were provided with the option to respond that they did not feel qualified to answer that question. In those cases, their response was excluded from the calculation for 75% agreement 删除21:<u></u>. Moreover, panelists always had the opportunity to elaborate on their answer. A summary of these comments was provided as feedback to all panelists in the following round, and those comments were used to re-phrase statements or pose additional questions where necessary in the following survey. Between rounds, responses were summarized and discussed between the authors. A follow-up survey was then drafted, which was again discussed between all authors before being finalized and sent to the panelists. Topics on which consensus was reached were no longer discussed in further surveys. Topics where consensus was not yet reached, were clarified and/or rephrased based on the comments made by the panelists 删除21:<u></u>. All three rounds were completed over a period of 8 months. No statistical analyses were applied for this study beyond the calculation of simple percentages.\n\n【19】Results\n=======\n\n【20】The first and second surveys were completed by all 18 panelists, and 17 completed the final survey^^. We now discuss the key results for each 10 section addressed in the surveys .\n\n【21】Section 1: Aim of Classification\n--------------------------------\n\n【22】The aim of Paralympic classification is to minimize the impact of eligible impairments on the outcome of competition. The panel reached consensus (83%) that this aim is not entirely fulfilled in VI judo using the existing classification system (61% no; 22% partially; 17% yes). Panelists most frequently commented that: (i) it is unfair that blind athletes should compete against partially sighted athletes; (ii) the current assessment of vision during classification does not accurately capture the functional impact of VI on judo performance; and (iii) fair competition is presently being undermined by the number of athletes believed to be intentionally underperforming on classification tests. We elaborate on these concerns in the sections below.\n\n【23】Section 2: Minimum Impairment Criteria\n--------------------------------------\n\n【24】The existing classification system considers an athlete to be eligible to compete in VI judo when their visual acuity^^ is equal to or worse than 1.0 logMAR, or when the diameter of their visual field^^ is no more than 40°. The panel unanimously agreed (100%) that the MIC for VI judo should not become more inclusive such that it would include athletes whose vision is better than the present MIC. Panelists felt the MIC should either be less inclusive (i.e. excluding some athletes who are currently eligible to compete, 62%), or that they should remain unchanged (38%). The panel agreed (80%) that further research is needed to provide an evidence-based definition of the MIC for judo. Panelists also reached consensus (83%) that athletes who meet the MIC for VI judo should also be allowed to compete in able-sighted judo competition. This view is consistent with the current regulations.\n\n【25】Section 3: Sport Classes\n------------------------\n\n【26】VI judo effectively offers only one sports class, with all eligible athletes competing against each other. The panel agreed (78%) that splitting VI judo into more than one sport class would increase the fairness of competition. The key concern raised by the panel was that blind and partially sighted athletes currently need to compete against each other. We therefore posed a follow-up question asking specifically whether a separate class for blind judokas would improve the fairness of competition. The panel indeed reached consensus (78%) that a separate class for blind athletes would be fairer than the present competition format. Reasons included that: (i) although VI judo starts with the grip in place, the rules allow athletes to (briefly) release one hand and re-grip (and some vision would assist in doing so); (ii) the ability to see some movement provides a strong performance advantage even once a grip is in place (e.g. for seeing an opponent's legs); (iii) blind judokas have a disadvantage in acquiring sport-specific skills, because they cannot make use of observational learning by seeing a technique being demonstrated to them; and (iv) blind athletes are unable to study video footage of their opponents or observe them during competition to learn about their patterns of play.\n\n【27】There is a restriction in the number of medal events at the Paralympic Games. If there were to be an increase in the number of sport classes for VI judo, but no change to the number of medal events, then events would be held at the Paralympic Games for only some of the sport classes in judo (i.e. some athletes might no longer be able to compete at the games). For VI judo, there are presently 13 medal events (seven weight classes for men and six for women) at the Paralympic Games. This means that if there were to be an increase in the number of classes for VI judo, it might not be possible to simply hold a medal event for each of the new VI classes in each of the weight categories. We therefore asked the panel for proposals on how to structure competition to deal with this restriction, if there were to be a recommendation to increase the number of sport classes. Two different proposals were raised as a result of open-questioning in the first survey, both of which we elaborated on in subsequent surveys. In Option 1, some panelists proposed that this issue could be overcome by reducing the number of weight classes, for instance by adopting light-, middle-, and heavyweight classes. In Option 2, it was proposed that all current weight categories could remain, but that only blind athletes should compete in the Paralympic Games (as is currently the case in VI football 5-a-side). The panel did not reach consensus whether they preferred Option 1, Option 2, or the present competition format (i.e. with all athletes competing within the same class): 31% preferred Option 1, 25% preferred Option 2, and 44% favored the current system. Panelists reported a variety of reasons for preferring one proposal over the other. Some panelists disliked Option 1 because they prefer the structure of VI judo and able-sighted judo to remain similar, or because they doubted that athletes from different weight categories are able to compete against each other equitably. Others opposed Option 2 because it would lead to a decrease in competitive depth, as they believed this would decrease the number of participating athletes within a class. In conclusion, although our panel clearly identified a need to change the current system , they could not readily agree how this change should be achieved.\n\n【28】Section 4: Measures of Visual Function Used During Classification\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Classification in VI judo is currently performed measuring only visual acuity and visual field, with recent work demonstrating support across all VI sports for the inclusion of additional measures during classification . The panel could not agree whether visual acuity and visual field are the only measures of visual function that should be used for classification in VI judo (42% yes, 58% no). In a follow-up question, we asked the panel to indicate which of the visual functions on a list^^, they considered important enough for judo performance to be included in classification. Results are presented in . The panel unanimously agreed that both visual acuity and visual field are important enough to be included in classification. Panelists commented that these are globally standardized measures that impact many aspects of our use of vision in daily life as well as during training or competition. A majority, however, without reaching consensus, also believed that other measures such as motion perception, dynamic visual acuity, and light sensitivity should be included in classification. The main comment was that classification research should consider many possibly relevant aspects of VI to fully understand its impact on judo performance. In conclusion, there is clear support for the continued use of visual acuity and visual field during classification, and some limited support for the consideration of other measures of vision.\n\n【30】###### \n\n【31】List of additional measures of vision impairment considered by the panel for inclusion in classification.\n\n【32】  Measure of vision       Description                                                                                                     \\% Agreement that measure is important enough to include in classification\n  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Visual acuity           A measure of the sharpness/clarity of vision.                                                                   100%\n  Visual field            A measure of the area of peripheral vision with which an individual can see (i.e. without moving their eyes)   100%\n  Motion perception       The ability to estimate the speed and the direction of a moving object                                          71%\n  Dynamic visual acuity   A measure of the sharpness/clarity of vision when observing a moving target                                     69%\n  Light sensitivity       The impact of bright lights on the ability to see clearly                                                       69%\n  Ocular coordination     The ability of both eyes to move together in cooperative fashion                                                64%\n  Depth perception        The ability to perceive the world in three dimensions, e.g. to estimate the distance to an object              56%\n  Contrast sensitivity    The ability to distinguish objects from a background                                                            53%\n  Color vision            The ability to distinguish different colors                                                                     19%\n\n【33】Panelists were asked to rate which measures they believed to be important enough to be included in classification\n\n【34】.\n\n【35】Section 5: Impact of Vision Impairment on Judo Performance\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】A sport-specific system of classification for VI judo must be based on research demonstrating the impact of impairment on sport-specific measures of judo performance . However, for judo, this is not a trivial issue. It is not immediately clear how judo performance should be measured given that competition outcome depends not only on an athlete's own ability, but also on that of their opponent. To guide the analysis of performance in judo classification research, we asked the panelists in the initial survey to list all aspects of judo performance (either VI or able-sighted) that they thought might be negatively impacted by VI. From their suggestions, we developed a theoretical model to better understand the impact of vision loss on judo performance. This model comprises of eight aspects of judo performance in which vision may play a role 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【37】!(fpsyg-10-00098-g001)\n\n【38】Having developed the model relating vision and performance in judo, we sought to establish (i) the relative importance of each aspect to overall performance and (ii) the importance of vision for each aspect. To address the former, we asked the panel to rate on a Likert scale how important each was for winning a match in VI judo 删除21:<u></u>. The aspects of performance rated most important for competitive success were offensive and defensive skills in the standing fight (both judged as very to extremely important by 88% of panelists). Other aspects of performance rated highly were the transition from standing to ground fight, and the defensive and offensive skills in the ground fight. Grip fighting skills were considered moderately to extremely important by 75% of the panelists; one panelist commented that even though VI judo starts with a grip in place, re-gripping to a more advantageous position still plays an important role in the sport. Fighting at the edge of the mat (i.e. trapping an opponent on the edge so that they have less space to move) and reading the scoreboard were both considered as slightly to moderately important by 75% of the panel. Some panelists commented that the rules for stepping out of the mat area are applied less strictly in VI judo compared to able-sighted judo, so therefore the tactical importance of fighting at the edge of the mat is lower.\n\n【39】###### \n\n【40】Relative importance of different aspects of judo performance.\n\n【41】  Aspect of judo performance                 Not at all important   Slightly important   Moderately important   Very important   Extremely important   Level of consensus for importance\n  ------------------------------------------ ---------------------- -------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- --------------------- -----------------------------------\n  Offensive skills in standing fight         0%                     0%                   13%                    19%              69%                   Very to extremely (88%)\n  Defensive skills in standing fight         0%                     6%                   6%                     31%              56%                   Very to extremely (88%)\n  Transition from standing to ground fight   0%                     0%                   19%                    38%              44%                   Very to extremely (81%)\n  Defensive skills in ground fight           0%                     6%                   13%                    44%              38%                   Very to extremely (81%)\n  Offensive skills in ground fight           0%                     6%                   19%                    31%              44%                   Very to extremely (75%)\n  Grip fighting skills                       0%                     25%                  6%                     19%              50%                   Moderately to extremely (75%)\n  Fighting at the edge of the mat            0%                     44%                  31%                    19%              6%                    Slightly to moderately (75%)\n  Reading the scoreboard                     25%                    25%                  50%                    0%               0%                    Slightly to moderately (75%)\n\n【42】Panelists were asked to answer on a five-point Likert scale ranging from \"not at all important\" to \"extremely important.\" The level of consensus was determined by taking the smallest range of answers given by at least 75% of the panelists. The list is ordered according to the rankings of the experts from most to least important to obtain competitive success in VI judo.\n\n【43】Next, we asked the panelists to rate the strength of the impact of VI on each aspect of performance during competition. Since performance in judo is always relative to an opponent, we asked the panelists to compare the relative advantage of a judoka with full vision when fighting under VI judo rules against (i) an opponent who only just meets the MIC and (ii) a fully blind opponent to establish what aspects of performance might be impacted by VI 删除21:<u></u>. Overall, the panel felt that against an opponent with full loss of vision, a fully sighted judoka would hold an advantage for each aspect of performance to some degree, including those aspects that were rated most important for winning a match in VI judo. Against an opponent with partial vision who just meets the MIC, the panel felt that the difference in vision generally offered only a mild to moderate advantage or even no advantage to the fully sighted judoka.\n\n【44】###### \n\n【45】Impact of vision impairment on different aspects of judo performance.\n\n【46】                                                                              No advantage   Slight advantage   Moderate advantage   Large advantage   Very large advantage   Level of consensus for advantage\n  -------------------------------- ------------------------------------------ -------------- ------------------ -------------------- ----------------- ---------------------- ----------------------------------\n  Fully sighted vs just eligible   Offensive skills in standing fight         44%            25%                19%                  13%               0%                     None to moderate (88%)\n                                   Defensive skills in standing fight         50%            25%                13%                  13%               0%                     None to slight (75%)\n                                   Transition from standing to ground fight   31%            31%                25%                  13%               0%                     None to moderate (75%)\n                                   Defensive skills in ground fight           75%            0%                 19%                  6%                0%                     None (75%)\n                                   Offensive skills in ground fight           69%            6%                 19%                  6%                0%                     None to moderate (75%)\n                                   Grip fighting skills                       31%            25%                19%                  25%               0%                     None to moderate (75%)\n                                   Fighting at the edge of the mat            7%             27%                27%                  27%               13%                    None to moderate (81%)\n                                   Reading the scoreboard                     50%            19%                13%                  13%               6%                     Slight to large (80%)\n\n【47】  Fully sighted vs fully blind     Offensive skills in standing fight         13%            0%                 19%                  31%               38%                    Moderate to very large (88%)\n                                   Defensive skills in standing fight         19%            13%                13%                  25%               31%                    Slight to very large (81%)\n                                   Transition from standing to ground fight   6%             13%                6%                   31%               44%                    Large to very large (75%)\n                                   Defensive skills in ground fight           25%            13%                31%                  13%               19%                    Slight to very large (75%)\n                                   Offensive skills in ground fight           13%            19%                31%                  13%               25%                    Slight to very large (88%)\n                                   Grip fighting skills                       6%             13%                0%                   38%               44%                    Large to very large (81%)\n                                   Fighting at the edge of the mat            6%             0%                 0%                   6%                88%                    Large to very large (80%)\n                                   Reading the scoreboard                     7%             7%                 7%                   20%               60%                    Very large (88%)\n\n【48】Panelists rated the extent to which performance is impacted for an athlete who is just eligible to compete in VI judo when fighting either an opponent who is just eligible to compete in VI judo, or a fully sighted opponent (under the rules of VI judo). Panelists were asked to answer on a five-point Likert scale ranging from \"no advantage\" to \"very large advantage.\" The level of consensus was determined by taking the smallest range of answers given by at least 75% of the panelists. The lists are ordered according to the rankings of the experts from most to least important to obtain competitive success in VI judo (see\n\n【49】Table 4\n\n【50】)\n\n【51】.\n\n【52】Section 6: Vision Testing Conditions\n------------------------------------\n\n【53】For athletes in all VI sports, visual function is being assessed for classification while wearing the best possible optical correction . Each eye is then tested individually, and the athlete's eligibility and sport class are determined on the basis of the results of their better performing eye. These procedures have been called into question by those within VI sport, because they may not provide a representation of the habitual vision of the athlete in their performance environment . For instance, in the case of the best optical correction, it could be that the athlete is unable to wear that correction during competition and so would compete with worse vision than that which was tested during classification. Our panel, however, agreed (76%) that the current procedure of testing VI judokas while wearing the best possible optical correction was appropriate, irrespective of whether or not the correction could be worn on the mat. The main comment was that an athlete might still benefit from using optical correction away from competition (i.e. by observing others demonstrating techniques to them in training, or to study fights of their opponents).\n\n【54】In competition, judokas rely on vision from both eyes combined, yet they are currently classified on the basis of the function of their best eye only. Crucially, when tested with two eyes together rather than the best eye only, the measured visual function of some athletes will improve whereas for others there may be no difference . The panel reached consensus (82%) that classification should be based on the results when testing both eyes together rather than the current practice of classification using the test results of the best eye only.\n\n【55】Classification is currently conducted at a competition venue or a local optometry/ophthalmology clinic prior to the start of competition. In our initial survey, some panelists raised concerns about this approach due to: (i) differences in testing conditions across the different competition events; (ii) not enough time being available for classifiers to fully examine visual function during classification prior to a competition, leaving classifiers to rely on medical documents provided by the athletes which are of various standards. One potential solution raised by panelists was the establishment of \"classification centers\" where athlete evaluation would be conducted, rather than classifiers traveling to competition venues. At these centers, both the medical assessment to establish the athlete's medical condition, as well as the tests of visual function could be conducted. All athletes need to be classified prior to taking part in competition and depending on the stability of their medical condition, their classification needs to be reviewed every year, 2 years, 4 years, or is confirmed. The panel reached consensus (82%) that they would favor the use of centralized classification centers over the current method of classification at competition. The main consideration was that classification centers would increase the quality and credibility of classification, although some panelists objected because of the additional time and (financial) resources required to travel to these centers.\n\n【56】Section 7: Impact of Vision Impairment Across Different Weight Categories\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】The same classification criteria apply to all judokas irrespective of their weight category, although it remains unknown whether the impact of VI is identical across all weight categories. The time constraints in combat sports as well as the techniques and tactics used have been shown to differ across weight categories (; ). These different task constraints imposed by an athlete's weight may require different perceptual abilities. We raised this topic with our panel, but reached no consensus whether the impact of VI differs across weight categories. About half (56%) of the panelists believed that the impact of VI is greater in the lighter weight-categories, largely because competition requires more and faster movements than matches in heavier weight categories. However, the panel clearly agreed (93%) that the impact on performance does not vary enough across weight categories to warrant the consideration of unique classification criteria for different weight categories. Some panelists commented that there may be subtle differences, but these would not warrant separate classification criteria. Others commented that separate criteria for different weight categories would render classification overly complex.\n\n【58】Section 8: Impact of a Congenital Versus Acquired Vision Impairment\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】VI classification currently does not take into account the age at which an athlete acquires their VI, even though this might have a considerable impact on their ability to acquire sport-specific skill . The panel reached consensus (79%) that in judo, the impact of impairment on performance is likely to be influenced by the age at which VI is acquired. The main comment was that partially sighted athletes might hold an advantage in skill learning over those who learn without vision (by making use of observational learning). Conversely though, some panelists noted that athletes with congenital impairments might be better able to use other sensory information (i.e. haptic, kinesthetic) than athletes with acquired impairment. Nonetheless, the majority of panelists (62%) believed that a judoka with acquired impairment has an advantage over a judoka with congenital impairment, with the remaining 38% answering that the impact on performance is the same for all judokas. Panelists commented that the answer to this question depends not only on the age at which the impairment was acquired, but also on the age at which the athlete was introduced to judo, and to individual differences in learning styles. The panel did agree (89%) that the age at which an impairment is acquired should not be taken into account for classification in VI judo. Their main comment was that the issue would be too complex to accurately account for in classification.\n\n【60】Section 9: The Use of Blindfolds\n--------------------------------\n\n【61】A seemingly straightforward method to standardize the level of impairment during competition would be to require all judokas to compete blindfolded; however, blindfolding is generally not considered an acceptable solution for most in the VI sports community . First there are ethical concerns about blindfolding, because partially sighted athletes become even further impaired. Moreover, blindfolds do not account for advantages afforded to partially sighted athletes away from competition (e.g. in training). Nevertheless, according to experts in VI sports, there may be specific situations in which the use of blindfolds is warranted . We therefore discussed with our panel the potential suitability of blindfolds for use within VI judo. The panel did not agree whether the use of blindfolds would provide an appropriate way to create fair competition in VI judo (31% yes; 69% no). In a follow-up question, the panel reached consensus (94%) that blindfolding all competitors would not decrease the fairness of VI judo: 65% believed that blindfolds would make VI judo fairer than it currently is; 29% believed that it would not impact the fairness; 6% believed that blindfolds would make VI judo less fair. Still, the panelists could not agree whether they would be in favor of the use of blindfolds in VI judo (33% yes; 67% no). Some additional concerns in terms of implementation were that the use of blindfolds might be too dangerous, because partially sighted athletes might presently rely on their vision to fall safely, or too impractical, because blindfolds might not stay on during competition. However, the panel did not agree with these concerns (too dangerous: 38% yes, 64% no; too impractical: 71% yes, 29% no). In conclusion, no consensus was reached here, although the majority of the expert panel expressed that they would not support the introduction of blindfolds in VI judo.\n\n【62】Section 10: Intentional Misrepresentation\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【63】Athletes who deliberately underperform on classification tests are guilty of the intentional misrepresentation (IM) of their abilities. The IPC considers IM to be a serious offense because it represents a significant threat to the legitimacy of Paralympic competition . However, even though strong penalties are in place, detecting IM represents a challenge, because very few objective measures are available to detect whether or not athletes provided honest answers on vision tests used during classification . The panel reached consensus (94%) that there currently are some VI judokas who intentionally misrepresent their visual abilities during classification. In a follow-up question, 88% of the panelists answered they believe there are some VI judokas currently competing who should actually be classified as not eligible, but have been classified eligible to compete because they intentionally misrepresented their visual abilities.\n\n【64】We then asked our panel to identify measures that might help to minimize IM, and to rate how effective each approach would be 删除21:<u></u>. The panel agreed that the introduction of less subjective testing methods would be \"very\" or \"extremely\" effective (94%). Other approaches rated as \"very\" to \"extremely\" effective were: out-of-competition testing (i.e. unexpected visits of classifiers to athletes to conduct classification tests), the observation of athlete behavior (e.g. in training or competition), and stricter requirements for the medical documentation of the athlete's vision condition submitted prior to classification. Measures rated at least moderately effective were: holding national federations accountable for an athlete's IM (currently, only athletes themselves are held responsible), the possibility to express doubts about the outcome of classification for individual athletes, and the introduction of centralized classification centers. The only measure for which the panel showed low agreement was the requirement for all athletes to wear blindfolds, with about half of the panel rating this as \"not at all\" to \"slightly\" effective (47%) and the other half (53%) rating it \"moderately\" to \"extremely\" effective.\n\n【65】###### \n\n【66】Relative effectiveness of measures to reduce the incidence of intentional misrepresentation in VI judo.\n\n【67】  Measures to reduce the incidence of intentional misrepresentation            Not at all effective   Slightly effective   Moderately effective   Very effective   Extremely effective   Level of consensus for effectiveness to reduce intentional misrepresentation\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------------------- ---------------------- ---------------- --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Introduce less subjective testing methods during classification              0%                     0%                   6%                     44%              50%                   Very to extremely (94%)\n  Incorporate out-of-competition testing                                       0%                     18%                  6%                     35%              41%                   Very to extremely (76%)\n  Include observation in classification                                        6%                     12%                  6%                     35%              41%                   Very to extremely (76%)\n  Introduce stricter requirements for medical diagnostic forms                 0%                     6%                   19%                    31%              41%                   Very to extremely (75%)\n  Introduce centralized classification centers                                 0%                     6%                   25%                    25%              44%                   Moderately to extremely (94%)\n  Hold national federations accountable for an athlete's IM                    6%                     6%                   19%                    31%              38%                   Moderately to extremely (88%)\n  Introduce the possibility to file doubts about an athlete's classification   6%                     13%                  31%                    41%              6%                    Moderately to extremely (81%)\n  Require all athletes to use blindfolds/eyeshades during competition          35%                    12%                  12%                    18%              24%                   Not at all to very (76%)\n\n【68】Panelists were asked to answer on a five-point Likert scale ranging from \"not at all effective\" to \"extremely effective.\" The level of consensus was determined by taking the smallest range of answers given by at least 75% of the panelists. The list is ordered according to the rankings of the experts from most to least effective.\n\n【69】Discussion\n==========\n\n【70】Providing legitimate competition for all athletes is at the heart of the Paralympic movement. Classification is therefore considered to be \"the sole means by which success in Paralympic sport is legitimized\" (, p. 19). The aim of this study was to gather expert opinions to guide the development of an evidence-based, sport-specific classification system for VI judo. We found consensus that the current classification system does not fully achieve its aim of minimizing the impact of impairment on the outcome of competition. The findings highlight the need to change the way classification is structured for VI judo, and provide clear guidance for how the relationship between impairment and performance can be examined to develop judo-specific classification. Specifically, the expert panel provided guidance on (i) which aspects of vision are most likely to impact judo performance, (ii) which aspects of judo performance are most likely to be impacted by VI, (iii) under what conditions vision testing for judo classification should take place, and (iv) other issues specific to classification research in VI judo. These findings help to design experimental studies to test the association between relevant measures of VI and measures of judo performance. They also provide theoretical underpinning for how VI limits judo performance.\n\n【71】Measures of Visual Function\n---------------------------\n\n【72】The current results provide guidance for how to best conduct empirical research to determine the impairment--performance relationship in VI judo. A critical step in sport-specific classification research is to select accurate and reliable measures of impairment that are likely to impact performance in that sport . Our expert panel identified, in addition to the current measures (i.e. visual acuity and visual field), six aspects of vision (motion perception, dynamic visual acuity, light sensitivity, ocular coordination, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity) that should be incorporated in empirical research to establish which are related to judo performance and therefore should be tested during classification. It is possible that other aspects of visual function are more predictive of judo performance than those measures currently tested. For instance, contrast sensitivity has proven to be more predictive for performance in VI shooting than visual acuity .\n\n【73】Analysis of Judo Performance\n----------------------------\n\n【74】The expert consultation also provided guidance for how best to analyze and measure judo performance. Our panelists identified six aspects of performance that they considered to be both impacted by VI and are decisive for winning a contest: grip fighting skills, offensive skills in the standing fight, defensive skills in the standing fight, transition from standing to ground fight, offensive skills in the ground fight, and defensive skills in the ground fight. Together these cover a broad range of judo skill, and empirical research should thus preferably take an equally broad perspective to performance. This might be achieved by considering the individual aspects separately, i.e. by counting the number of scores obtained in the ground fight, or calculating the percentage of successfully defended attacks in a standing fight. However, many elements of judo performance interact with each other and are therefore not independent: obtaining a slightly advantageous grip provides additional possibilities to attack, and the way an attack in the standing fight is executed largely determines the course of events during the following ground fight. Overall determinants of judo performance which bring together these measures may also be included in research to appraise performance, incorporating measures of match outcome, score count, or percentage of matches won in a tournament.\n\n【75】Vision Testing Procedures\n-------------------------\n\n【76】Wherever possible, VI classification should be conducted using the same conditions as those experienced during competition . Classification outcomes are currently determined using the test results of the best eye only, whereas in competition athletes would normally rely on both eyes. Also, in classification testing is done with the best possible optical correction, irrespective of whether or not that correction can reasonably be worn on the mat in competition. In agreement with the VI position stand, our panel reached consensus that classification should be based on results from vision tests conducted while using both eyes, because this represents the habitual function used during competition. Moreover, the panel remained of the opinion that classification should continue to be based on test results wearing the best possible optical correction, rather than on the level of vision that athletes have available when competing, largely because athletes might still benefit from better vision away from competition (i.e. in training).\n\n【77】Confounding Factors\n-------------------\n\n【78】The expert panel reached consensus that both the weight category of the judoka and the age at which they acquired their impairment should not be considered in classification, even though there was some suggestion that both mediate the impairment--performance relationship in judo. The panelists felt that an effort to address these matters would make classification overly complex. However, complexity is not necessarily a good justification for avoiding these issues. The VI position stand therefore encourages those involved in classification research to collect data on the developmental history of the impairment in combination with their developmental history within the sport wherever possible, so that the impact of impairment on performance could be compared between athletes who have similar impairments but developed at different ages. Likewise, it would be advisable to determine whether there is an interaction between the weight category of an athlete and the nature of the impairment--performance relationship to test whether the scientific evidence supports the views of our panel.\n\n【79】Intentional Misrepresentation\n-----------------------------\n\n【80】The expert panel expressed serious concerns about the threat of IM to the fairness of competition, which is an issue of broader concern across VI sports . Because VI judo presently implements only one sport class during competition, there is little advantage for a truly eligible athlete to be allocated to a class designed for athletes with more severe impairments beyond the provision of more points for the purpose of qualification. The key concern of the panel appears to be for athletes who should not meet the MIC, but misrepresent their ability to become eligible to compete. Although the primary aim of classification research is to evaluate the suitability of the sport class criteria rather than the fairness of the athletes competing within those classes, IM offers a serious threat to the legitimacy of VI sports. It would therefore seem worthwhile for both classification researchers and governing bodies of VI sports to consider measures that would prevent the incidence of IM and increase the trust of the VI sports community in their classification systems. The highest priority of our panel was to introduce less subjective testing, because current methods rely on athletes to provide their best effort and honest answers. One approach to increase objectivity in classification is to take into account the consistency of test performance, which may hold promise as an indicator whether or not the athlete provided their best effort and honest answers (; ).\n\n【81】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【82】According to our expert panel, changes are needed to the manner in which classification is conducted in VI judo. The panelists call for a re-evaluation of the minimum level of VI needed to qualify to compete, and they question the idea that all VI judokas can compete against each other equitably within a single sport class. The expert panel helped us to identify which aspects of VI are most likely to impact judo performance, and what aspects of judo performance are most likely to be impacted by VI. The Delphi method proved to be a useful tool to gather expert opinions as a starting point for the development of sport-specific classification for VI judo.

Alternaria, Botrytis, Fusarium, Geotrichum, Phytophthora, and Rhizoctonia are common and damaging plant pathogenic fungi . Phytopathogenic fungi reduce both yield and quality of crops. They are major restraints in sustainable agriculture production, especially in intensive cropping systems. Synthetic fungicides have been extensively used to control diseases caused by these pathogenic agents. Application of synthetic fungicides is one of the cheapest and the most effective approaches for the control of plant diseases . However, these chemicals may lead to toxic residues in treated products (; ). Synthetic pesticides can also cause environmental pollution due to their slow biodegradation (; ). Thus, many researchers have focused on the use of biological methods to protect crops from invasion and spread of pathogens. Indeed, management of pathogens by using antagonistic microorganisms or their secondary metabolites is now considered as a viable method for disease control (; ).\n\n【1】As biocontrol agents, many antagonistic microorganisms have been shown to be effective against various pathogens (; ). One representative candidate is Bacillus species belonging to Gram-positive bacteria. Bacillus species can produce various kinds of diffusible and volatile compounds with strong inhibitory activity against plant pathogens (; ). Among various diffusible compounds, cyclolipopeptides have many advantages compared to chemical surfactants, including low toxicity, high biodegradability, environmentally friendly characteristics (; ), and low foaming . Furthermore, cyclolipopeptides are produced by biocontrol agents to protect cells from attacks by microorganisms (; ).\n\n【2】Moreover, volatile compounds can promote plant growth  with antifungal activity . They can induce systemic resistance in crops . As for antifungal activity of volatile compounds produced by Bacillus species, they can inhibit mycelial growth of Fusarium oxysporum that causes Fusarium wilt of onion . They can also reduce postharvest decay in citrus . In order to facilitate multi-applications of diffusible and volatile compounds, a rapid and efficient approach to isolate and identify these useful compounds from Bacillus species needs to be established.\n\n【3】In view of this, the objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize bacterial antagonist with strong antifungal activity, 2) to identify volatile and agar-diffusible antifungal metabolites, and 3) to investigate in vivo antifungal activity of agar-diffusible metabolites against various plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens.\n\n【4】Materials and Methods\n=====================\n\n【5】Identification of G341\n----------------------\n\n【6】Bacterial strain G341 was isolated from four-year-old roots of Korean ginseng with rot symptoms as described previously . This strain was identified by sequence analyses of 16S rRNA and gyrA genes. Isolation of genomic DNA and PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequence were performed using previously described methods . PCR amplification for gyrA gene was performed using primer pairs p-gyrA-f/p-gyrA-r as described previously .\n\n【7】PCR fragments were purified using Wizard PCR prep Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and directly sequenced using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The same primers used for PCR amplification were used for sequencing. These sequences were compared to 16S rRNA and gyrA gene sequences available in public databases of GenBank. A neighbor-joining tree was inferred with Kimura's 2-parameter distance model . The resultant neighbor-joining tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis  based on 1000 resampled datasets. Alignment with representative sequence of B. subtilis complex and subsequent phylogenetic analyses were carried out using PHYDIT program available at <http://plaza.snu.ac.kr/~jchun/phydit/> .\n\n【8】In vitro antifungal activity\n------------------------------\n\n【9】Using in vitro dual-culture analysis, G341 was subjected to in vitro antifungal activity assay against the following nine phytopathogenic fungi: A. panax causing ginseng Alternaria blight, B. cinerea causing tomato gray mold, Colletotrichum coccodes causing red pepper anthracnose, F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici causing tomato Fusarium wilt, Magnaporthe oryzae causing rice blast, P. infestans causing tomato late blight, Pythium ultimum causing cucumber damping-off, R. solani causing rice sheath blight, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causing cucumber sclerotinia rot. Potato dextrose agar medium was used as basal medium. A plug (0.6-cm in diameter) containing mycelium was taken from 6-day-old target fungi and placed at the centre of PDA dual plates. Single G341 colonies were patched at a distance of about 3 cm from the fungus. After 3--7 days, the width of inhibition zone between bacterial colony and fungal pathogen was measured. Each treatment was repeated with five replicates. The experiment was also repeated twice.\n\n【10】Evaluation of in vivo control efficacy\n----------------------------------------\n\n【11】One-day protective activities of the fermentation broth of G341 strain and purified substances were evaluated against seven plant pathogenic fungi on plants: M. oryzae on rice plants, R. solani on rice plants, B. cinerea on tomato plants, P. infestans on tomato plants, Puccinia recondita on wheat plants, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei on barley plants, and C. coccodes on red pepper plants. These in vivo antifungal bioassays were performed as described previously . The strain G341 was cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB; BD, Sparks, MD, USA) medium at 37°C and 150 rpm for 3 days and then the fermentation broth was used for in vivo assay. Pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design (three replicates per treatment). All experiments for in vivo antifungal activities of the purified substances were conducted twice. Six estimates for each treatment were converted into percentage (± standard deviation) compared to control treatments.\n\n【12】Blasticidin-S (50 μg mL^−1^) for rice blast, validamycin (50 μg mL^−1^) for rice sheath blight, fludioxonil (50 μg mL^−1^) for tomato gray mold, dimethomorph (10 μg mL^−1^) for wheat leaf rust, benomyl (100 μg mL^−1^) for barley powdery mildew and dithianon (50 μg mL^−1^) for red pepper anthracnose were applied as positive controls. Pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design (three replicates per treatment). All experiments were conducted twice. Six estimates for each treatment were converted into a percentage (± standard deviation) compared to control treatments using the following equation:\n\n【13】Where A was area of infection (%) on leaves or sheaths sprayed with Tween-20 solution alone and B was area of infection (%) on treated leaves or sheaths.\n\n【14】Purification of antifungal antibiotics\n--------------------------------------\n\n【15】In preliminary experiment, TSB medium was used as the optimal medium for the production of antifungal substances. Strain G341 was cultured in TSB medium (4 l) at 37°C and 150 rpm for 3 days. Bacterial cells were removed after centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 6 min. The culture supernatant was successively partitioned twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and n-butanol (BuOH). Each layer was concentrated by drying and then subjected to in vitro antifungal activity against M. oryzae. Among four organic fractions obtained from culture broth of strain G341, BuOH layer (17.2 g) was found to be the most active layer, followed by the EtOAc layer (10.2 g). The BuOH layer was applied onto a silica-gel column (3.6 (i.d.) × 60 cm, Kiesel gel 60, 400 g, 70--230 mesh; E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). It was then eluted with a mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (30:9:1 and 65:25:4, v/v/v). Active fractions showing inhibitory activity against M. oryzae were collected and applied onto a Sephadex LH-20 column (2.8 (i.d.) × 45 cm, 200 g; Sigma, MO, USA) after concentration. Active fractions eluted from the Sephadex LH-20 column with methanol were evaporated to dryness and loaded onto a Sep-Pak C~18~ cartridge (10 g) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with methanol-water. Using this protocol, 220 mg of compound 1 and 24 mg of compound 2 were obtained from 4 l of culture supernatant.\n\n【16】Electrospray ionization mass and tandem mass spectrometry\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Purified antifungal substances were analyzed on a Hybrid Quadrupole-Time-Of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL, AB Sciex Insturments, CA, USA) operated in electrospray ionization (ESI) positive ion mode. These samples were dissolved in 50% MeOH/49% H~2~O/1% AcOH (v/v/v) and applied to nano-spray tip of Q-TOF MS. Compound 1 was analyzed by ESI-MS/MS without ring-opening. In contrast, compound 2 was ring-opened by cleavage of the lactone bond  and analyzed. Amino acid sequences were determined from series of b~n~ obtained from de-novo sequencing of lipopeptide. Amino acid compositions were obtained as described previously .\n\n【18】Analysis of antifungal activities of volatile compounds\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Strain G341 culture broth (50 μl) was spread onto half of a divided plate containing TSA. Following 24 h of incubation at 25°C, 5 mm mycelia plugs of M. oryzae, R. solani, B. cinerea, P. infestans, F. oxysporum, S. sclerotiorum, P. capsici, and C. coccodes were placed on the other half of the divided plate containing PDA. Plates were wrapped immediately in Parafilm to seal in volatiles. Measurements of radial mycelia growth were taken at 48 h to 72 h post incubation of the pathogen on both bacterial and control plates. The experiment was repeated twice.\n\n【20】Collection of volatile compounds\n--------------------------------\n\n【21】Headspace volatile compounds produced by strain G341 were collected using a setup recommended by  with slight modifications. Briefly, strain G341 was cultured at 37°C with shaking (150 rpm) in 200 ml of TSB in 500 ml of Erlenmeyer flasks fitted by a two-way rubber cork with insertion of glass tubes. One of the inserted glass tubes was placed just 1 cm above the culture of strain G341. The other end of the tube was connected to a nitrogen supply system to remove headspace volatiles. One end of the second tube was placed near the neck of the flask while the other end was connected to a volatile trap made of glass tube (7 cm in length and 0.4 cm in diameter) containing 150 mg of activated charcoal (Darco, 20--40 mesh, Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Before use, these traps were placed in 150 mm Petri plate wrapped in aluminum foil and sterilized in 350°C oven for 24--36 h. The neck of the conical flask was tightly sealed with Parafilm to prevent the escape of volatile compounds. TSB medium without bacteria was used as control. The stream of dry nitrogen flow was started at 12 h post inoculation of the bacterial strain and maintained at 300 ml/min for up to 48 h. Flasks were shaken throughout the collection process at 150 rpm. Volatile compounds in the activated charcoal trap were eluted into glass vials with 0.5 ml of methylene chloride.\n\n【22】GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds produced by G341\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Volatile organic compounds produced by G341 strain were analyzed by GC-MS (Shimadzu GC-MS QP5050, Shimadzu co. Kyoto, Japan). A 1-μl aliquot of methylene chloride solution containing volatile compounds was injected into the injection port of the GC-MS. A capillary column SPB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm in i.d. 0.25 μm in film thickness; PA, USA) was used. The initial temperature of the column was held at 30°C for 2 min and increased to 220°C at 5°C min^−1^. The injection port and interface were set at 240°C and 200°C, respectively. Helium carrier gas was used at a flow rate of 2.2 ml min^−1^. Mass spectra of unknown compounds were compared to those deposited in the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spec. Library (Version 2.0).\n\n【24】Statistical analysis\n--------------------\n\n【25】Analysis of variance was performed using PROC GLM procedure (SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA). If P \\> F was less than 0.01, means were separated with Duncan's multiple range test at P = 0.05 level.\n\n【26】Results\n=======\n\n【27】Antifunagl activity\n-------------------\n\n【28】Strain G341 inhibited mycelial growth of all fungal pathogens tested. Mycelial growth of A. panax, B. cinerea, C. coccodes, F. oxysporum, M. oryzae, and P. capsici was significantly inhibited by G341. However, the antagonistic bacterium was weakly active to mycelial growth of P. ultimum, R. solani and S. aclerotiorum .\n\n【29】Identification of G341 strain\n-----------------------------\n\n【30】Strain G341 exhibited phenotypic similarity with Bacillus spp. based on biochemical, morphological, and cultural characteristics . Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence (MF167634) showed that strain G341 formed a monophyletic group with species of B. subtilis complex, sharing 99% sequence similarity  and the sequence analysis of gyrA genes revealed that strain G341 shared 96.6% similarity with type strain of B. velezensis LMG 22478^T^. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of gyrA gene of G341 (MF167633) with Bacillus spp. belonging to the monophyletic group, strain G341 was identified as B. velezensis .\n\n【31】Growth curve of strain G341 and its production of antifungal metabolites\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】As shown in , strain G341 could grow relatively quickly. It reached stationary phase at 12 h after inoculation. There was almost no lag phase. The antifungal activity of its culture broth sampled at different time intervals was significantly correlated with cell growth over the four-day growth period. The strongest antifungal activity against M. oryzae was obtained at 96 h after incubation. Therefore, the optimal harvest time for antifungal metabolites of strain G341 might be at 96 h after inoculation under the culture conditions used in this study.\n\n【33】In vivo antifungal activity and structure determination\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The fermentation broth of G341 showed potent antifungal activity against M. oryzae and R. solani on rice plants, B. cinerea on tomato plants, and C. coccodes on red pepper plants. It reduced the development of the four diseases by more than 50% even at a 9-fold dilution .\n\n【35】Among four organic fractions obtained from culture broth of strain G341, BuOH fraction showed the strongest in vivo antifungal activity. The BuOH fraction also exhibited strong in vivo antifungal activity against rice blast, rice sheath blight, tomato gray mold, and red pepper anthracnose . Because the BuOH fraction was the most active one, its constituents were separated by bioassay-lead fractionation. Two antifungal substances were isolated from the BuOH fraction by repeated column chromatography such as silica-gel, Sephadex LH-20, and Sep-Pack C18. Finally, two active compounds (1 and 2) were isolated.\n\n【36】In order to identify chemical structures of the two isolated metabolites, their mass spectra were recorded by ESI-TOF mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of compound 1 showed a series of mass number (m/z 1021.5, 1035.5, and 1049.5). It revealed differences of 14 Da, suggesting that the purified compound had a different carbon chain length (-CH~2~-). Based on tandem mass spectrometry, the amino acid composition of compound 1 was determined to be Asp, Tyr, Ser, Glu, and Thr in a ratio of 2:1:2:1:1. The sequence deduced from MS/MS spectrum obtained from m/z 1035.5 ion peak of compound 1 was identical to that of bacillomycin L . Thus, compound 1 was identified as bacillomycin L with fatty acid moieties of C~14~--C~16~.\n\n【37】ESI-TOF mass spectrum of compound 2 showed \\[M+H\\]^+^ ion peaks at m/z 1449.7, 1463.7, 1477.7, 1491.7, and 1505.7. Amino acid analysis revealed that compound 2 comprised Glu, Orn, Tyr, Thr, Ala, Pro, and Ile in a ratio of 3:1:2:1:1:1:1. ESI-MS of hydrolysate of compound 2 showed a protonated peak at m/z 1481.7. The mass gain of 18 Da from m/z 1463.7 of compound 2 could be due to hydrolysis of a lactone bond. MS/MS spectrum of m/z 1481.7 ion obtained from hydrolysate of compound 2 revealed that the amino acid sequence of compound 2 was identical to that of fengycin A . Thus, compound 2 was identified as fengycin A with fatty acid moieties of C~15~--C~19~. Based on the above results, chemicals of lipopeptides produced by G341 were found to be bacillomycin L and fengycin A .\n\n【38】In vivo antifungal activity\n-----------------------------\n\n【39】Results of in vivo antifungal activities of the two lipopeptides isolated from strain G341 are summarized in . Out of four plant diseases tested, the two lipopeptides effectively suppressed the development of rice sheath blight. The in vivo antifungal spectra of the two lipopeptides were found to be different from each other. Bacillomycin L was active against rice blast, rice sheath blight, and red pepper anthracnose. However, it was virtually inactive against tomato gray mold. In comparison, fengycin A showed in vivo antifungal activity against rice sheath blight and tomato gray mold, but not against rice blast or red pepper anthracnose.\n\n【40】In vitro antifungal activity and analysis of volatile compounds of G341\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Strain G341 produced antifungal volatiles and inhibited mycelial growth of various fungal pathogens. It significantly inhibited mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum, R. solani, and B. cinerea . P. infestans, P. capsici, C. coccodes, and M. oryzae were relatively resistant to these volatile compounds produced by G341. Volatile profiles indicated that strain G341 produced 3 volatile compound: dimethylsulfoxide, 1-butanol, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (acetoin). Among them, acetoin was found to be the major compound .\n\n【42】Discussion\n==========\n\n【43】One of the biggest ecological challenges facing microbiologists and plant pathologists in the near future is the development of environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical pesticides for combating crop diseases. The use of beneficial microorganisms is considered as one of the most promising methods for more rational and safe crop-management practices . In this respect, we attempted to isolate antagonistic bacteria with strong antifungal activity against various phytopathogenic fungi. As a result, we found that G341 strain inhibited mycelial growth of various plant pathogenic fungi tested. These preliminary results suggested that B. velezensis G341 strain could produce antifungals. It is well-known that bacteria can commonly produce cell wall-degrading enzymes and secondary metabolites to hinder the growth of other microorganisms .\n\n【44】Identification of B. subtilis complex has been difficult due to their almost identical phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Recently, partial gyrA sequences coding for DNA gyrase subunit A have been found to be able to provide rapid and accurate classification and identification for B. subtilis and closely related taxa . In this study, strain G341 was found to share 99% sequence similarity with species of the B. subtilis complex based on sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene. It shared 96.6% of sequence similarity with type strain B. velezensis LMG 22478^T^ based on sequence analysis of partial gyrA gene . Thus, it is reasonable to identify the strain G341 as B. velezensis.\n\n【45】B. velezensis sp. nov. was recently isolated during a research focusing on discovering novel bacterial strains capable of synthesizing new lipopeptides with surfactant and/or antimicrobial activity . Several research groups have reported that B. velezensis have potential to control Fusarium wilt in strawberries , wheat powdery mildew , Fusarium head blight . Recently,  reported that one endophytic B. velezensis ZSY-1 strain produces volatile compounds having antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report that B. velezensis can produce both diffusible and volatile antifungal compounds. Accordingly, we investigated the control efficacy of diffusible and volatile compounds produced by strain G341 against plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi.\n\n【46】In in vivo experiment, the fermentation broth of strain G341effectively controlled the development of rice blast, sheath blight, tomato gray mold, and red pepper anthracnose. In order to identify antifungal principles produced by this strain, we isolated two antifungal compounds by partitioning with BuOH, silica-gel column chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, and C~18~ column chromatography. The two compounds were identified as bacillomycin L and fengycin A based on MS/MS analyses . Bacillomycin L is a member of the iturin group produced by B. subtilis. It is one of the extensively studied peptide antibiotics. Bacillomycin D, F, and L have been reported as antifungal peptides produced by B. subtilis (; ). Fengycin A is a biologically active lipopeptide produced by several B. subtilis . Its structure is composed of a β-hydroxyl fatty acid linked to a peptide part comprising 10 amino acids, with 8 of them being organized in a cyclic structure.  have also proved that fengycin is less toxic to tested plants. It protected these plants from some filamentous pathogenic fungi better than several peptide antibiotics such as iturin . In this study, bacillomycin L was found to be active against rice blast, rice sheath blight, and red pepper anthracnose while fengycin was found to be active against rice sheath blight and tomato gray mold . Up to date, various types of lipopeptides isolated from B. subtilis have been reported to possess antifungal activity against plant diseases . Among iturin group, iturin A produced by B. subtilis RB14 can reduce the development of damping-off of tomato (a seedling disease) caused by R. solasni . Fengycin is known to possess antifungal activity against filamentous fungi . Its hemolytic activity is 40-fold lower than that of surfactin (; ).  have reported that iturin, fengycin A, and surfactin isolated from B. subtilis strains have antifungal activity against soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi from avocado rhizoplane.\n\n【47】Strain G341 also produced volatile antifungal compounds that could inhibit mycelial growth of phytopathogenic fungi in sealed plates . Antifungal volatile compounds have been demonstrated previously in several pathogen systems. For example, trimethylamine has been shown to be able to inhibit hyphal extension and formation of arthrospore in Geotrichum candidum . Allyl alcohol an also inhibit carpogenic germination of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum in bean . Hydrogen cyanide produced by Pseudomonas has been used to control root rot of tobacco . Our data indicate that strain G341 could inhibit mycelial growth of various phytopathogenic fungi by producing dimethylsulfoxide, 1-butanol, and acetoin . Among them, acetoin was found to be a major volatile metabolite.  have reported that sulfur-based compounds benzothiazole and dimethyl trisulfide possess high fungicidal activity. Many commercially used fungicides and soil fumigants are sulfur-based. Alcohols such as 1-hexanol also have antifungal activity which can be used to prevent diseases . Acetoin can significantly reduce symptomatic leaves inoculated with soft rot causing pathogen Erwinia carotovora by inducing systemic resistance .  have reported that B. amyloliquefaciens PPCB004 can produce acetoin as a major volatile compound. Radial growth of several Penicillium species has been found to be inhibited in vitro in the presence of volatile compound of PPCB004. They have also reported that antagonist PPCB004 could significantly reduce decay incidence and severity in Valencia inoculated with P. crustosum .  reported that B. velezensis ZSY-1 strain can produce various volatile and antifungal metabolites such as 2-tridecanone, pyrazine (2,5-dimethyl), benzothiazole, and phenol (4-chloro-3-methyl).\n\n【48】Taken together, our results suggest that antagonist B. velezensis G341 can be used as a good biocontrol agent candidate, although how effective this antagonist would be under field conditions is currently unclear. Diffusible and volatile compounds produced by B. velezensis G341 might be used in agriculture as a direct contact biofungicide and biofumigant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS. Registration of myoelectrical GES and the stomach activity was carried out under free-behavior conditions in rabbits subjected to food deprivation or pre-fed before the experiment. It was done by means of chronically implanted electrodes during LH electrostimulation in the presence of food. Simultaneously using the web-camera the animals behavior was recorded. LH stimulation was produced by STM-100C stimulator (USA) with implanted bipolar nichrome electrodes. Analysis of temporal parameters of myoelectrical activity of GES and the stomach were carried out by the program AcqKnowledge (USA), and statistical analysis of the data by the program Statistica 6. Significanse of differences between the samples was assessed by the U-Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.05). Electrostimulation of \"hunger center\" of the lateral hypothalamus in pre-fed rabbits and the rabbits subjected to daily food deprivation, in the presence of food causes resultant food behavior which is accompanied by regular generations of bursts of peak potentials, frequency of which is essentially different in hungry and satiated animals and depends on intensity of artificially induced and artificially reinforced food motivation. In the process of LH stimulation arising resultant food behavior in satiated animals is accompanied by regular generation of high-amplitude slow electrical waves (SEW) by the muscles of lesser curvature (LC), the body and antrum of the stomach (AS) and this is reflected in the structure of temporal organization of slow electrical activity (SEA) in the form of monomodal distributions of SEW periods, typical of satiation state. Despite the increase in food motivation level, due to LH stimulation, additional entry of food into the stomach of satiated rabbits completely eliminates inhibitory effect of starvational motivational excitation on SEA of the muscles of LC, the body and AS. SEA alterations of the stomach muscles in hungry rabbits in the presence of food and thus arising of food-obtaining behavior during LH stimulation have two-phase character. At the initial stage of food behavior in hungry animals during LH stimulation high extent of scaterring of the values of SEW periods generated by the body and AS muscles is preserved, as evidenced by the bimodal distribution of SEW periods characteristic of the state of hunger. In spite of food entry into the stomach at the 1-st phase of LH stimulation, inhibitory effect of artificially reinforced starvational motivational excitation on pacemaker activity of the stomach is retained. At the 2-nd phase of LH electrostimulation food reinforcement eliminates inhibitory effect of food motivational excitation on myoelectrical activity of pacemaker of the stomach that gives maximal rhythm of SEW generation to the body and AS, monomodal distributions of SEW periods indicate to it. lnteraction of artificially induced and artificially reinforced food motivational excitation with afferentation from food reinforcement on neurons of the central generator of deglutition pattern and dorsal vagal complex due to LH electrostimulation and thereby arising resultant food obtaining behavior is specifically reflected in patterns of myoelectrical activity of GES, LC, the body and AS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction\n================\n\n【1】Psychoactive drugs, i.e. drugs that exert their activity on the Central Nervous System, and drugs that affect motor function are of concern when it comes to traffic safety. Since the vast majority of those who use psychoactive medication are outpatients, it is reasonable to assume that they also participate in traffic. Roadside surveys estimate the incidence of drivers who are under the influence of psychoactive drugs at between 5% and 35% . Given the worldwide increase in prescribing of psychoactive medication , traffic safety is an issue that's becoming increasingly relevant. Yearly, increasing numbers of traffic deaths are reported. Although in the U.S.A. and Europe a significant reduction in traffic accidents is evident, in other parts of the world (e.g. Africa and Southeast Asia) the number of traffic accidents has increased dramatically. In this context, the World Health Organization dedicated the 2004 World Health Day to road safety . This review updates on the effects on driving performance of the most commonly prescribed psychoactive drugs.\n\n【2】2. Methodology\n===============\n\n【3】There are various methods to examine driving ability and assess the effects of psychoactive medication on traffic safety. Epidemiological studies provide evidence about the (increased) risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents when using psychoactive medication. Although this is important information, it is gathered after accidents have happened. Ideally, one would like to have this information beforehand in order to prevent driving under the influence of these drugs. A limitation of most epidemiological studies is that the statistical analysis is based on groups of drugs instead of individual drugs. This is unfortunate, because within drug groups the effects of individual drugs on driving ability can differ significantly. Many researchers use laboratory tests to examine driving related skills and abilities such as reaction speed, working memory and psychomotor functioning. Although these skills and abilities are all of great importance to operating a vehicle it has been proven that it is very difficult to predict actual driving performance from these tests . This is caused by the fact that these skills and abilities are tested in isolation, whereas in real driving they are integrated and performed simultaneously. Also, the extent of impairment of individual skills and abilities differs greatly after administration of a psychoactive drug . This is illustrated by , showing the blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) at which different skills and abilities become impaired.\n\n【4】Driving simulators are popular to test driving skills. They are safe because no real traffic is involved and tests can be performed in a controlled environment. Traditional driving simulators were often very simple divided attention tasks. Equipment regularly consisted of a steering wheel and a computer screen. Subjects had to perform a tracking task and reaction speed task simultaneously, mimicking two important driving skills. Unfortunately, no other traffic was involved and often no road scenery was depicted on the computer screen. Therefore, these driving simulators had little predictive validity for real driving . The vital lacking element of other traffic has been introduced in most current driving simulators. Equipment of these sophisticated driving simulators often comprises a real car, a wide screen, and road scenery involving other traffic that interacts with the subject. This set-up is a great improvement when compared to the first generation of driving simulators. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined to what extent driving simulators predict actual driving in real traffic. Subjects who perform a driving simulator test are aware of the artificial environment and this may have a significant impact on their driving style and performance.\n\n【5】Given legislative restrictions of most countries, relatively few studies have been performed in real traffic. Methods to determine driving performance were often limited to subjective ratings of driving instructors or researchers and self reports by patients. The subjective nature of these measurements makes it difficult to compare different drugs or dosages. To establish this, objective measurement of the magnitude of impairment is essential. One test that does measure driving performance objectively is the standardized on-the-road driving test in real traffic. Over the past 30 years, many psychoactive drugs have been examined using this test. The methodology of the driving test, applied only in The Netherlands to examine psychoactive medication, will be described below and results from studies applying this test are summarized in this review.\n\n【6】2.1. The On-the-Road Driving Test\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】The on-the-road driving test in real traffic was developed in the 1980s  and has been applied in over 50 studies to determine the effects of psychoactive drugs on driving ability. The test has been highly standardized and has shown to be sensitive to dose-dependent impairment after administration a variety of psychoactive drugs including hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, analgesics, stimulants, and antihistamines. In the standardized driving test, subjects are instructed to drive a car over a 100-km (61 miles) highway while maintaining a constant speed (58 miles/h) and a steady lateral position within the right (slower) traffic lane. The primary parameter of the test is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm): the weaving of the car. This is shown in . It is evident from this Figure that SDLP represents the amount of vehicle control. Higher SDLP values represent increased weaving of the car.\n\n【8】A camera, mounted on the roof of the car, continuously records the position of the car within the right traffic lane, by tracking the relative distance of the car from the delineation in the middle of the road. This is illustrated in . In the right front seat, a licensed driving instructor accompanies the subject. His main responsibility is to guard safety during the driving test, and he is equipped with a brake and clutch system. If the subject or the driving instructor judges that it is unsafe to continue driving, the test is terminated before completion and the driving instructor transports the subject back to the Institute.\n\n【9】2.2. ICADTS Categorization\n---------------------------\n\n【10】The categorization system of the International Council on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety (ICADTS) will be used to indicate whether or not it is safe to drive a car when using a specific psychoactive drug . Drugs are allocated to one of the following categories: Presumed to be safe or unlikely to produce an effect;Likely to produce minor or moderate adverse effects;Likely to produce severe effects or presumed to be potentially dangerous.\n\n【11】To make the categories understandable, a comparison with blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is made. Driving impairment for the categories I, II and III are equivalent to BAC \\< 0.5 g/L (\\<0.05%), BAC 0.5--0.8 g/L (0.05−0.08%), and BAC \\> 0.8 g/L (\\>0.08%), respectively. Description and interpretation of the categories is summarized in [Box 1].\n\n【12】Category I: Presumed to be safe or unlikely to produce an effect\n\n【13】In various experimental circumstances negligible or no impairment of driving performance or performance related to driving is repeatedly demonstrated. Also for medicinal drugs that are presumed not to be dangerous based on their pharmacological profile, even though there are no experimental studies that support this presumption. For the most frequently used drugs in this category the effect has been assessed in over-the-road driving tests as equivalent to blood alcohol concentrations \\< 0.5 g/L (\\<0.05%).\n\n【14】[Advice for the patient:] Be careful not to drive before having read the warnings in the package insert.\n\n【15】Category II: Likely to produce minor or moderate adverse effects\n\n【16】Some impairment of driving performance or performance related to driving is seen in various experimental laboratory circumstances. Also for drugs that will not produce severely adverse effects, but because of a lack of sufficient experimental studies it can not be established if the effect is moderate, light or absent. For the most frequently used drugs in this category the effect has been assessed in over-the-road driving tests as equivalent to blood alcohol concentrations 0.5--0.8 g/L (0.05--0.08%).\n\n【17】[Advice for the patient:] Do not drive without consulting a healthcare professional about the possible impairing effects.\n\n【18】Category III: Likely to produce severe effects or presumed to be potentially dangerous\n\n【19】In various experimental circumstances gross impairment of driving performance, or performance related to driving, is repeatedly seen. Also for drugs presumed to be potentially dangerous based upon their pharmacological profile, but there are not sufficient experimental studies to support this presumption. For the most frequently used drugs in this category the effect has been assessed in over-the-road driving tests as equivalent to blood alcohol concentrations \\> 0.8 g/L (\\>0.08%).\n\n【20】[Advice for the patient:] Do not drive when this drug is taken and consult a healthcare professional when to start driving again after evaluation of the treatment outcomes.\n\n【21】The effect of different BAC levels on driving performance was determined in 24 social drinkers . A dose-dependent impairment was observed. SDLP increments after alcohol consumption corresponding to the most common legal limits for driving were +2.4 cm (0.05%), +4.1 cm (0.08%), and +5.3 cm (0.10%) and are often used as reference values to illustrate driving safety when using psychoactive drugs. The study revealed a steady correlation between BAC and SDLP.\n\n【22】3. CNS Drugs and Traffic Safety\n================================\n\n【23】The following sections discuss the effects on driving ability of the most commonly used psychoactive drugs, including hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, antihistamines, analgesics and stimulant drugs.\n\n【24】3.1. Hypnotics/Sleep Medication\n--------------------------------\n\n【25】Several studies have examined the residual effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics on driving ability \\[--\\]. In these studies, hypnotic drugs were taken at bedtime for 1 or 2 nights. The driving tests were performed the following morning (10--11 hours after intake) and in the afternoon (16--17 hours after intake), corresponding to the times one drives to and from work. Increment relative to placebo for benzodiazepine hypnotics are shown in .\n\n【26】 shows that benzodiazepine hypnotics significantly impair driving performance. Driving impairment was most pronounced in the morning. In the afternoon, driving impairment was less evident and absent for short-acting benzodiazepines. For long-acting benzodiazepines driving was also impaired in the afternoon; especially when using higher dosages than recommended. To illustrate the magnitude of driving impairment, effects of different dosages of alcohol are also depicted in . Most benzodiazepine hypnotics were categorized in ICADTS category II or III 删除21:<u></u>.\n\n【27】The Z-drugs zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon were developed to overcome the unwanted residual effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics. Unfortunately, the introduction of zopiclone was no improvement. Several on-the-road studies showed pronounced driving impairment after consumption of zopiclone. SDLP increments ranged between 3 and 8 cm, comparable to impairment observed for blood alcohol concentrations of 0.05% to 0.10% (above the legal limit for driving in many countries). Zolpidem, when taken as recommended, has no residual effects on driving ability and thus is a great improvement when compared to benzodiazepines and zopiclone. However, when shortening the time between intake and driving dose-dependent impairment is evident . Also, various accidents and impaired driving have been reported after inappropriate use of zolpidem . Zaleplon has no negative residual effects on driving ability. Even when taken in the middle of the night four hours before driving, twice the recommended dose of zaleplon did not affect driving performance. Results from epidemiological studies confirm that benzodiazepines and zopiclone significantly increase the risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents \\[--,\\]. New hypnotics with different mechanisms of action, such as those acting at melatonin or serotonin receptors, are both promising and needed for those patients who have to use hypnotic drugs and want to participate safely in traffic.\n\n【28】3.2. Anxiolytics\n-----------------\n\n【29】Up to 50% of the patients visiting their physician suffer from anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, or phobias. A substantial number of those patients use anxiolytics including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or buspirone. Their effects on driving ability have been extensively studied and results supported by epidemiological evidence .\n\n【30】Both benzodiazepines and TCAs significantly impaired driving performance after single dose administration. Impairment of benzodiazepines when used as anxiolytic is much more pronounced when compared to impairment when used as hypnotic drug. This difference is caused by the fact that the time between drug intake and the driving test is much greater for hypnotics (10--11 hours) when compared to anxiolytics (1 hour). The different time intervals were chosen to reflect normal use of anxiolytics (during the day, for example after awaking) and hypnotics (at bedtime).\n\n【31】Tolerance develops slowly and after a week of daily treatment with benzodiazepine anxiolytics driving remained significantly impaired . This effect was less pronounced for TCAs. In contrast, SSRIs, 5HT-antagonists and buspirone produced no significant impairment on the driving test after both acute and repeated administration. Corresponding ICADTS categories of most commonly prescribed anxiolytics are summarized in  and .\n\n【32】 and  clearly show that benzodiazepine anxiolytics and TCAs (listed as category II and III drugs) are regarded as more dangerous than SSRIs and related compounds (listed as category I drugs).\n\n【33】3.3. Antidepressants\n---------------------\n\n【34】The effects of most commonly used antidepressants on driving ability have been investigated applying the on-the-road test . Driving after intake of TCAs (including amitriptyline, doxepine and imipramine), mianserin and mirtazapin was significantly impaired after treatment initiation. Tolerance developed gradually, and after 1 week of treatment driving impairment was absent or much less pronounced. Nocturnal treatment with these antidepressants did not affect next day driving performance. In contrast to the TCAs, SSRIs (including fluoxetine, paroxetine and escitalopram), related antidepressants (venlafaxine and nefazodone), and moclobemide showed no significant effect on driving performance. The ICADTS categorization of most commonly used antidepressant drugs is summarized in .\n\n【35】3.4. Antihistamines\n--------------------\n\n【36】All antihistamines are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and thus may cause sedation. Most commonly used antihistamines have been examined using the on-the-road test . Over the past decades 3 generations of antihistamines have been developed, each improving his proceeding generation in terms of less sedation and adverse effects.\n\n【37】The oldest (first-generation) antihistamines (diphenhydramine, triprolidine, terfenadine, dexchlorpheniramine, clemastine) significantly impair driving performance after both one-time and repeated (daily) administration. Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine, ebastine, mizolastine, acrivastine, emedastine, mequitazine) may also impair driving performance, but this differs greatly among individuals. The magnitude and extent of impairment depends on the administered dose, sex, and time between driving and treatment administration. Tolerance develops after four to five days of administration, but impairment is not always absent. In contrast, third-generation antihistamines (fexofenadine, desloratadine, and levocetirizine) produce no driving impairment after both one-time and repeated administration. The ICADTS categorization of most commonly used antihistamines is summarized in .\n\n【38】3.5. Analgesics\n----------------\n\n【39】Pain itself can significantly impair driving performance . Effective treatment with Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioids may (partially) relieve the pain. Up to now, only few driving studies have been performed with analgesics. Laboratory tests of cognitive functioning and psychomotor skills generally do not show significant performance impairment in patients using NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Therefore they are listed in ICADTS category I. One driving study  examined the effects on driving of bromfenac. This NSAID, which is no longer marketed, did not affect driving or related skills. The same study also examined the opioid oxycodone. No significant differences from placebo were found, but subjects indicated that much more effort was needed to perform the driving test. Laboratory studies failed to find consistent results when testing opioids . Nevertheless, ICADTS categorizes many opioid analgesics in class II (e.g. oxycodone, and codeine) or III (e.g. morphine, tramadol and fentanyl). Opioids show a strong dose-dependent impairing effect on performance and after treatment initiation dosages are often gradually increased. This may interfere with developing tolerance to their impairing effects, and thus these drugs are often grouped in category II or III.\n\n【40】Chronic pain patients are often treated with antidepressants such as amitriptyline instead of opioids and NSAIDs. Thirteen hours after treatment administration, amitriptyline (25 mg) significantly impaired on-the-road driving performance in chronic neuropathic pain patients . After two weeks of daily use, tolerance developed to the impairing effects of amitriptyline.\n\n【41】3.6. Stimulant Drugs\n---------------------\n\n【42】Stimulant drugs are used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Purpose of using these drugs is to improve attention and daytime alertness. Two studies showed improvement of driving performance after stimulant drug use.\n\n【43】Ramaekers and colleagues  examined the effects of 3-4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (75 mg), methylphenidate (20 mg) and placebo on driving performance in 18 recreational MDMA users. The on-the-road driving test and a car following test were performed three to five hours after drug use, and the next day (27 to 29 hours after intake) to examine possible withdrawal effects. Both MDMA and methylphenidate significantly improved driving performance as indicated by reduced weaving. However, MDMA negatively affected performance in the car following test, whereas performance after using methylphenidate did not differ significantly from placebo. During withdrawal, no significant differences from placebo were found. Verster and colleagues  examined the effects of methylphenidate on driving performance in adults with ADHD. After a training session and withdrawal of methylphenidate for at least four days, patients participated in a double blind trial and performed an on-the-road driving test after intake of placebo or their regular dose of methylphenidate. In line with Ramaekers' findings, driving performance after using methylphenidate was significantly improved when compared to placebo.\n\n【44】4. Conclusions\n===============\n\n【45】Various psychoactive drugs affect driving performance. These effects are most prominent after treatment initiation and tolerance develops after chronic use. Impairment further depends on dose and half-life of a drug, time after administration, gender and age.\n\n【46】Limitations of current driving research include the fact that they have not examined driving in patients who chronically use psychoactive medication. Epidemiological data show that after long-term use of psychoactive medication tolerance develops to the impairing effects of these drugs. Patients get used to the adverse effects of drugs, and gradually they wear off as do the risks of traffic accidents . Tolerance develops slowly and is much less likely to develop after intermittent (as-needed) use. For example, increased traffic accident risks for users of benzodiazepine hypnotics have been reported after one year of chronic use . Unfortunately, on-the-road studies have focused primarily on short term use (i.e. one day to two weeks). One study did examine the effects of four weeks daily treatment with diazepam  and confirmed that tolerance develops slowly. After four weeks of treatment with diazepam SDLP increment was still significantly increased. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies have shown no significant increase in traffic accident risk after chronic use (\\> 1 year) of other psychoactive drugs such as opioids .\n\n【47】A second limitation is that individual differences between patients are often not taken into account. Most drugs are supplied in a standardized dose, not taking into account age, gender and metabolism of individual users. However, these factors are important in determining the presence and magnitude of adverse effects. In some driving studies -- but not in general, it has been shown that SDLP increment in women is significantly greater than in men . Also, elderly often perform worse when compared to healthy young adults . In this context, it is unfortunate that most experimental studies have been conducted in healthy male young adults, whereas patients using psychoactive medication are often female elderly.\n\n【48】Future pharmaceutical research should focus on developing new psychoactive medication that produces less sedation and adverse effects. These new drugs should be tested preferably in healthy volunteers followed by studies in patients who actually need the medication. Effects on driving ability after long-term use should be examined as well.\n\n【49】Finally, for many diseases a number of different treatment options are available. In terms of traffic safety, physicians should choose medication that has shown to be devoid of impairing effects on driving ability. The ICADTS categorization can help them in making this decision.\n\n【50】Disclaimer\n==========\n\n【51】Although the information presented below has been gathered and evaluated with great care, the authors will not accept any liability after use of the information by patients taking the medicines discussed.

{"seq_id": "71ba29fc-178e-4b27-af63-6fe90a11b9ec", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction \n============\n\n【1】Stunting (height-for-age Z score \\<-2) and wasting (weight-for-height Z-score \\<-2) affect ∼200 million impoverished children worldwide.^,\\ ^ These undergrown children are at increased risk for impaired cognition, metabolic syndrome, other morbidities, and mortality. Recognized causes of early stunting include intrauterine growth retardation (manifest as small for gestational age (SGA) infants), malnutrition, and infections; however, these factors account for only a subset of such impaired growth. Many observations link chronic aflatoxin ingestion with childhood stunting.^-^ Aflatoxins are toxic growth products (mycotoxins) produced by Aspergillus species^,\\ ^, of which aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most potent. Exposure typically occurs via ingestion of contaminated foods, with toxicity likely related to frequency and magnitude of exposure. Data supporting the association between aflatoxin exposure and growth impairment include: (i) the association between aflatoxin exposure and impaired weight gain in livestock; (ii) the high incidence of dietary aflatoxin exposure in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (regions with disproportionate prevalence of childhood stunting); and (iii) epidemiological and geographic correlation between the degree of stunting and the level of aflatoxinemia in African and Asian children.^-^ Aflatoxin exposure has also been implicated in kwashiorkor, and toxin-dependent intergenerational effects have been suggested by the association between maternal aflatoxinemia and SGA birth^-^.\n\n【2】Despite extensive epidemiological data correlating aflatoxin exposure and stunting, the causal role of dietary AFB1 exposure in childhood stunting has not been definitively established. Moreover, the physiological, cellular and molecular mechanisms that interconnect dietary AFB1 exposure and stunting remain unknown. Nevertheless, several indirect observations suggest that aflatoxin might hinder growth by injuring the liver and/or small intestine. For example, aflatoxins are metabolized by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) into reactive epoxides which form adducts with and disrupt the function of DNA, proteins, and other macromolecules^^. Thus, abundant expression of CYPs 1A2 and 3A4^^ in human liver likely contributes to the known hepatotoxicity of aflatoxins^^ and the established association between dietary aflatoxin exposure and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B-infected humans, livestock, and experimental models.^,\\ ^ Because various pediatric liver diseases are associated with growth hormone (GH)-resistance and stunting^^, aflatoxin-associated stunting might be mediated by hepatotoxic effects on GH-signaling. Enterocytes also express CYP3A4, and, thus, might be vulnerable to AFB1-induced toxicity.^,\\ ^ Notably, stunted children in developing countries can exhibit an idiopathic form of enteropathy characterized by intestinal villous blunting, inflammation, and malabsorption.^^ Furthermore, intestinal inflammation, like liver injury, is associated with GH resistance.^^ Thus, aflatoxin-induced intestinal injury might also promote stunting via disruption of gut absorptive and/or barrier functions. These considerations implicate toxin-induced liver and intestinal injuries as mechanisms by which dietary AFB1 exposure might contribute to childhood stunting.\n\n【3】The experiments reported here were undertaken to develop an experimental animal model of dietary aflatoxin exposure with which to investigate the causal relationship between AFB1 toxin exposure and growth disturbance and to explore candidate mechanisms responsible for this association.\n\n【4】Results \n=======\n\n【5】Establishment of a Fischer Rat Model of Dietary Aflatoxin Induced Stunting \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Rats are sensitive to AFB1-induced toxicity, and have been used for decades to investigate the biology of human aflatoxicosis.^,\\ ,\\ ^ Therefore, we investigated the effects of dietary aflatoxin exposure on growth in newly-weaned rats. Inbred, male Fischer rats were initially studied so as to limit contributions of gender or genetics on phenotypic variation. The results demonstrated dose-dependent, significant reduction in the rate of weight gain in animals given ad libitum access to chow supplemented with 1-20 parts-per-million (ppm) of AFB1 compared to those provided with (vehicle-supplemented) control chow. Growth trajectory patterns showed deceleration in toxin-exposed vs. control animals within 1 week of diet initiation, and such divergence progressively increased throughout the 6 week duration of this experiment . Tibial length, assessed at the experimental endpoint as a surrogate measure of linear growth^^, was also diminished in a dose-dependent manner among treated rats . Despite substantial effects on growth, no mortality was observed in association with toxin exposure.\n\n【7】To determine if toxin-induced growth impairment in exposed rats was associated with decreased food consumption in animals exposed to higher toxin concentrations, we compared daily food intake between cages of cohabitating rats (3/cage) for each examined level of toxin exposure over the experimental time course. Food consumption was comparable among all groups ; thus, reduced nutrient intake does not explain dose-dependent wasting and stunting in this model. To further investigate this point, AFB1-albumin adducts, which reflect the magnitude of toxin exposure^^ were quantified at the experimental endpoint. This analysis demonstrated strong correlation between level of dietary toxin contamination and detectable adduct in serum . Together, these data establish a causal role of dietary AFB1 exposure in growth impairment in rats.\n\n【8】Evaluation of Liver Injury and Function in Dietary AFB1-Exposed Rats \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Because AFB1 hepatotoxicity^,\\ ^ might mediate toxin-induced stunting, we examined sera and liver from AFB1-exposed and control Fischer rats for evidence of liver injury and dysfunction. Liver histology showed toxin dose-dependent bile duct hyperplasia (, H&E), which has previously been reported in toxin-exposed rats^^, and increased fibrosis, as assessed by Sirius Red staining (, Sirius Red). AFB1 also induced dose dependent elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, left panel). Together, these data reveal AFB1 dose-dependent liver injury. Consistent with that conclusion, hepatocellular proliferation, a measure of injury-induced liver regeneration^^, also showed dose-dependent elevation in toxin-exposed rats (, BrdU and , middle panel). Serum glucose, albumin (, right panel), and bilirubin (below the limit of detection), which reflect liver function, were not significantly affected by toxin exposure. These data demonstrate dietary AFB1-induced liver injury, but not liver failure, in this model.\n\n【10】Hepatic Growth Hormone (GH) Signaling in Toxin-Exposed Animals \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】GH and its target insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are important regulators of longitudinal growth^^, and STAT5 activation mediates the growth-promoting effects of GH^^. Hepatic GH-resistance likely contributes to the growth impairment associated with pediatric liver diseases^^. Therefore, we next examined GH signaling in livers from AFB1-exposed and control rats. This analysis showed suppression of hepatic Igf1 mRNA expression at the experimental endpoint (i.e. 6 weeks after initiating dietary toxin exposure; ). GH receptor (Ghr, ) and Stat5b (but not Stat5a, ) expression exhibited similar AFB1-induced suppression. To further examine the effects of AFB1 on hepatic GH signaling, we also assessed hepatic expression and activation (by phosphorylation) of STAT5 protein, which mediates GH effects on Igf1 expression^^. The results demonstrated marked variation in levels of phospho-STAT5 across replicate livers from animals exposed to control or 10 ppm AFB1-supplemented chow . Such variation is consistent with the pulsatile release of GH from pituitary that occurs every 3-4 hours in male rats^^; nevertheless, there was also a downward trend in levels of phosphorylated:total STAT5 protein and significant reduction of total STAT5 protein in livers from toxin-exposed rats . Together, these data suggest that AFB1 causes liver-based GH resistance.\n\n【12】Gut Morphology in AFB1-Exposed Rats \n-----------------------------------\n\n【13】Like hepatocytes, human enterocytes express CYP450s that convert AFB1 to its toxic reactive epoxide^,\\ ^; however, the CYPs that activate AFB1 in rat intestine remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the influence of dietary aflatoxin exposure on gut morphology. This analysis showed no significant difference in jejunal villous length in toxin-exposed vs. control rats; however, a downward trend was noted between 20 ppm AFB1-exposed vs. control rats (, p=0.1). Thus, gut absorptive function might be compromised by AFB1 exposure.\n\n【14】Evaluation of Dietary Aflatoxin Exposure-Induced Effects in Sprague-Dawley Rats \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Finally, to begin to explore whether genetic modifiers impact dietary AFB1-induced stunting in this model, we investigated the growth of toxin-exposed, male, outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats exposed to 10 ppm AFB1-containing chow over five weeks demonstrated relative growth impairment comparable to that seen in the Fischer animals : relative weight gain from weaning (age 3 weeks) through age 7-8 weeks in toxin-exposed Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats was 64-65% and 67-74%, respectively, of that seen in the corresponding controls. Serum AFB1-adduct levels were also similar between Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats after 5 weeks of toxin exposure . These data demonstrate that strain-related genetic differences do not significantly influence toxin-induced growth impairment, at least under these experimental conditions.\n\n【16】Discussion \n==========\n\n【17】Childhood stunting is associated with increased morbidity and mortality^,\\ ^. Indeed, more than one-third of pediatric deaths are attributable to under-nutrition, a common cause of stunting. Furthermore, under-grown children are at increased risk for chronic disease, cognitive impairment, and other morbidities^,\\ ^. These observations have motivated efforts to reduce the prevalence (and consequences) of childhood growth impairment. Recent epidemiological links between dietary aflatoxin exposure and childhood stunting suggest that AFB1 exposure could be an important, inadequately addressed contributor to childhood stunting in resource-poor settings^-^. This possibility has led, in turn, to emerging interest in efforts to reduce aflatoxin exposure as a strategy to prevent complications of under-nutrition in children^^. However, because of the heretofore lack of either intervention trials in at-risk human populations or a tractable experimental animal model, the specific causal role of dietary aflatoxin exposure in stunting has not yet been definitively established. Based on these considerations, we undertook the experiments here to develop such a model and investigate these questions. The results of our studies provide direct evidence supporting the causal role of AFB1 exposure in growth impairment in a mammalian model.\n\n【18】Rats have genetic and physiological similarity to humans; thus, the data reported here should have relevance to consideration of the mechanisms linking AFB1 exposure to impaired growth in children. Our results identify liver injury as one plausible intermediary between toxin exposure and stunting. GH resistance occurs in children with chronic liver injury^^, and our data support GH-resistance as a candidate mechanism by which AFB1 might cause stunting, at least in some circumstances. These considerations are consistent with a recently published study showing that the magnitude of aflatoxin exposure is inversely associated with IGF1 expression in children and in transformed human hepatocytes in culture ^^. Importantly, growth impairment occurred despite comparable food intake in rats exposed to a wide range of dietary toxin in this model. Thus, nutritional interventions alone might be insufficient to improve growth in toxin-exposed children. Because human intestinal epithelial cells, like hepatocytes, express CYPs capable of converting AFB1 into the reactive epoxide^,\\ ^, AFB1 exposure might also promote stunting through enteropathic effects. With this in mind, it is intriguing that in areas where dietary AFB1 exposure is endemic, a malabsorptive condition known as environmental enteropathy is prevalent^^. Such enteropathy is associated with histologic changes in the small intestine, particularly villous blunting. Although the studies reported here did not demonstrate significant toxin-induced blunting, we did observe a downward trend in intestinal villous length in animals exposed to the highest toxin concentration. Thus, future studies employing this model should investigate gut absorptive and barrier function in larger cohorts of animals.\n\n【19】The paradigm described here should also enable future efforts to discover genetic or environmental modifiers of aflatoxin-induced stunting in rats, which might suggest novel strategies to mitigate the growth-related consequences of childhood aflatoxin exposure. Although the studies here did not demonstrate strain-specific differences in AFB1-induced growth-impairment, genetic modifiers of aflatoxin-induced HCC have been reported in mice^^. Environmental modifiers of toxin-induced liver cancer in mice have also been reported, with enteric microbiota affecting risk in that model.^^ This observation is especially provocative in the context of emerging interest in understanding the enteric microbiome\\'s role in human diseases. Enteric microbiotal contributions to AFB1-induced stunting could also be investigated with this model. For example, if commensal enteric microbial flora affect aflatoxin-epoxide formation or detoxification in rats, as suggested in other species^^, altering such flora (e.g. by depletion with enteral antibiotics) might augment or diminish toxin-induced pathophysiology. Either possibility justifies further examination of the influence of the enteric microbiome on aflatoxin-related disease. For example, although speculative, comparative analyses of \"germfree\" rats and gnotobiotic rats reconstituted with enteric flora from aflatoxin-exposed stunted- or normally grown-children might identify specific microbes as environmental modifiers of aflatoxin-induced stunting. A homologous approach in mice was recently used to demonstrate microbiotal contributions to the development of kwashiorkor^^. Such analyses should enlighten our current understanding of the scope of influence of the enteric microbiome on human health and disease more generally.\n\n【20】Finally, the relevance of the levels of dietary aflatoxin exposure of rats examined here to acute and chronic human exposures should be considered. The range of toxin exposure (from 1-20 ppm) in these studies was empirically selected based on pilot data showing reduced weight gain in newly weaned rats exposed to a 5 ppm AFB1-contaminated diet over ∼6 weeks . Industrialized nations typically limit aflatoxin in human food to less than 20 parts per billion (ppb^^). Nevertheless, a recent review of mycotoxin contamination of foods in African countries over the last 2 decades reported peak aflatoxin levels up to 355 ppb in maize and 500 ppb in other foods^^. Furthermore, during outbreaks of human aflatoxicosis, levels of AFB1-contamination detected in the regional food supply fell within the range of those studied here. For example, analyses of locally-grown maize during the 2004-2005 outbreak in Kenya showed that 10% of analyzed samples exhibited AFB1 levels \\>1 ppm^^ with peak levels from 4-46 ppm^^. Nevertheless, the actual range and variability in acute and chronic human dietary aflatoxin exposure in resource-poor countries is difficult to estimate because of the lack of regular, standardized testing.\n\n【21】Serum AFB1-albumin adduct levels in response to specific AFB1 exposures across species with differing susceptibility to AFB1-induced carcinogenicity have previously been reported, offering additional opportunity to consider the relevance of the exposures here to observed human intoxications. For example, one study reported a ratio of AFB1 adduct-to-toxin exposure of ∼1 pg adduct/μg AFB1/day/kg body weight in rats exposed to 20 μg AFB1/kg/day for 14 days^^. That study also estimated that human aflatoxin-adduct formation more closely resembles that of AFB1-sensitive (e.g. rat) versus resistant (e.g. mice) species. Another study demonstrated that humans and rats exposed to a single, comparable, lower (15 ng/kg) dose of AFB1 exhibit similar adduct levels^^. In this case, a ratio of ∼40 pg adduct/μg AFB1/kg was reported. Thus, AFB1-albumin adduct formation varies substantially with respect to magnitude and chronicity of toxin exposure, with higher adduct-to-exposure ratios levels of reported in rats and humans exposed to less toxin. These findings are consistent with other analyses suggesting that adduct formation as a function of toxin exposure is saturable^,\\ ^. By comparison, the rats examined in the studies reported here were exposed to a higher range of daily and cumulative AFB1 (calculated based on measured food intake) and also exhibited greater adduct-to-toxin exposure ratios (assessed at the experimental endpoint; ). Nevertheless, as in the studies above, these ratios also declined with increasing levels of exposure. For example, rats exposed to 1 ppm AFB1 toxin-containing diet ingested ∼54-126 μg AFB1/kg/day over the experimental course and exhibited a serum adduct-to-toxin exposure ratio at the experimental endpoint of ∼1 ng adduct/μg AFB1/kg/day; in contrast, those given 20 ppm-containing diet took ∼1.1-4.2 mg/kg/day and exhibited a ratio of ∼100 pg adduct/μg AFB1/kg/day . Notably, the levels of AFB1-albumin adduct in the experiments reported here (68-181 ng/mg, ) exceed those reported in human cases of acute aflatoxicosis (including fatal cases) associated with the 2004 outbreak in Kenya^^. Together with the lack of mortality or apparent liver synthetic dysfunction in the rats studied here, these observations suggest that humans are relatively more susceptible than rats to toxic effects of dietary AFB1. One possible explanation for this observation relates to species-specific differences in hepatic aflatoxin-epoxide detoxification, specifically with respect to the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) which detoxify the unstable CYP-derived aflatoxin-epoxide preventing its toxic reaction with DNA, albumin, and other cellular components. Rats express an inducible, α class GST isoform highly efficient in AFB1 detoxification, whereas humans express a μ class GST with lower activity. Thus, differences in hepatic GST expression likely affect susceptibility to AFB1-induced toxicity. Whether the AFB1 exposure regimen employed here affected hepatic α GST expression is unknown. Nevertheless, these data raise the possibility that humans are even more susceptible than rats to toxin-induced stunting, and justify further use of this animal model to investigate strategies with which to mitigate such effects.\n\n【22】Experimental Methods \n====================\n\n【23】Chemicals and other reagents \n----------------------------\n\n【24】AFB1 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was suspended in glycerol trioctanoate (Sigma-Aldrich) to create a stock solution (0.5 mg/mL), which was added to standard rodent chow (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) to create diets containing 0, 1, 5, 10, or 20 ppm of AFB1. Food, with and without AFB1, was stored at 4 ° C until placed in animal cages.\n\n【25】Animal husbandry and experimental design \n----------------------------------------\n\n【26】Three-week old (newly weaned) male inbred F344 Fischer or outbred Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory, Portage, MI) were housed in groups of three animals per cage for each level of toxin exposure under controlled light/dark cycles, and allowed ad libitum access to water and toxin-supplemented or vehicle-treated (i.e. control) chow throughout the experiment. Dietary consumption (per cage) was quantified daily and rats were weighed once or twice weekly. At 8-9 am on the day of the experimental endpoint, rats were injected with 100 mg/kg BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 hour prior to bleeding and sacrifice (from 9-10 am) for collection of sera and tissues. Liver tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C or fixed in formalin for histological and immunohistochemical analyses (described below).\n\n【27】Small bowel longitudinal length was measured and the proximal 25% isolated and processed for histological analysis of villous height as previously described^^. Briefly, the intestinal lumen was flushed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 10% neutral-buffered-formalin, with the mucosal surface subsequently exposed by longitudinally incising the bowel; the proximal jejunum was pinned mucosal surface up on a wax tray and fixed in 10% formalin at 4°C overnight; the tissue was subsequently covered with 2% agar, then cut into uniform sections, layered, and placed into a tissue cassette and in formalin for subsequent processing. Tibias were recovered and cleaned in 1 M NaOH prior to determination of tibial length, performed using a stadiometer.\n\n【28】Laboratory safety and precautions \n---------------------------------\n\n【29】AFB1 is mutagenic, and it and its derivatives should be handled using appropriate precautions. Aflatoxin-containing chow was prepared in an approved fume hood using PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 (LabDiet) and commercially available AFB1. Toxin was first suspended in glyceryl trioctanoate prior to mixing with powdered chow. Chow was prepared biweekly with strict adherence to use of personal protective equipment including lab coat, face mask, eye protection and gloves. Work areas were thoroughly cleansed with 10% bleach after chow preparation. Toxin exposed and control animals were housed in marked cages in an approved, dedicated, marked animal room in which no other experimental animals were housed. Animal cages were changed weekly, with soiled bedding, residual chow, and disposable equipment saturated with 10% bleach prior to disposal in a HEPA-filtered dump station. At the experimental endpoint, animals were moved to chow- and toxin-free clean cages prior to transfer to the lab where serum and tissue harvest occurred. Non-harvested animal tissues were disposed of as biohazardous waste.\n\n【30】Histological and immunohistochemical analyses \n---------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Liver and gut tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin- (H&E) and Sirius Red (using standard methodology) and for hepatocellular BrdU incorporation (as previously described^^). Villous length was quantified in H&E stained sections of gut using AxioVision microscope software (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), with 200-300 villi measured from each animal in each toxin-exposed cohort as described^^.\n\n【32】Gene and Protein Expression Analyses \n------------------------------------\n\n【33】Hepatic expression of specific genes was characterized using qRT-PCR as previously described^^. Data were standardized to the expression of β2-microglobulin (B2M) to calculate fold-differences in gene expression. Specificity was verified for each gene using melt-curves and by simultaneous analysis of a reaction mixture containing all components except reverse transcriptase. Gene specific qRT-PCR primers included: B2M forward-GCTCGGTGACCGTGATCTTT, reverse-TTGAGGAAGTTGGGCTTCCC; Igf1 forward-TGGTGGACGCTCTTCAGTTC, reverse-TCCGGAAGCAACACTCATCC; Ghr forward-ATGTTTCCTGGAAGTGGGGC, reverse-TTCAGGGGAACGACACTTGG; Stat5a forward-CCCTCAGGCTCACTACAACA, reverse-CGGCGTAAAAGTTCCTCCAC; Stat5b forward-CCTTGTACGGCCAGCATTTC, reverse-AGGAGCTGGGTGGCCTTAAT. Liver tissue lysates were prepared and protein immunoblotting conducted as previously described^^ using anti-STAT5 and anti-phospho-STAT5 (Y694) antibodies (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA).\n\n【34】Serum analyses \n--------------\n\n【35】Sera were submitted to the St. Louis Children\\'s Hospital Clinical laboratory for analyses. AFB1-Lysine adduct was determined by isotope dilution mass spectrometry as described^^.\n\n【36】Statistical analyses \n--------------------\n\n【37】Data were analyzed using PASW Statistics version 22 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Numerical data comparisons between groups were conducted using the unpaired Student\\'s t-test for pair-wise comparisons and ANOVA for multiple groups with Tukey\\'s test used for post-hoc comparisons. Rates and proportions were compared between groups using chi-square analysis. Significance (α) was set at 0.05.

Where most current approaches act disjointedly on clients and the social and physical context, we take the clients' own behavior within the dynamics of everyday context as the point of departure. From this point, healthy behavior is not a distinguishable action, but a chain of activities, often embedded in other social practices. Therefore, changing behavior means changing the social system in which one lives, changing a shared lifestyle or changing the dominant values or existing norms. Often, clients experience that this is not that easy. From the everyday-life perspective, the basic strategy is to support the client, who already has a positive intention, to 'get things done'.

{"seq_id": "301f0bd7-af11-403d-8fd4-e38981c6e040", "title": "", "text": "【0】Accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is linked to aging and pathophysiology of a variety of diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Advanced glycation endproducts are formed via the Maillard's reaction between carbonyl groups of reducing sugars and free amino groups from proteins or other macromolecules. The accumulation of AGEs in the body leads to structural and functional modifications of tissue proteins, adversely affecting the function of those proteins. Long lived proteins such as skin collagen, lens crystallins and cartilage proteins are more susceptible to AGEs accumulation over time due to their longer half-life.\n\n【1】Some AGEs form protein-protein cross-links and certain species naturally exhibit fluorescence properties. Measurement of skin autofluorescence (SAF), is currently being tested as a non-invasive tool to estimate the degree of AGEs accumulation in the human body/skin. SAF has been shown to provide a measure of cumulative metabolic stress and correlate with collagen-linked fluorescence and both, fluorescent (pentosidine) and non-fluorescent (N^ε^-(carboxymethyl)-lysine) AGEs. Several validation studies simultaneously measured SAF and specific AGEs from skin biopsy samples at the same measuring site, and reliably demonstrated that SAF is a good proxy for tissue accumulation of AGEs.\n\n【2】SAF is calculated as the average light emission intensity in the 420--600 nm wavelength range after ultraviolet-A excitation with a peak maximum intensity of 370 nm. A confounding factor of SAF measurement is the degree of skin pigmentation, i.e. darker skin attenuates the detectable signal as it absorbs more light than lighter skin. Skin reflectance (SR) is a metric of the amount of light reflected by the skin, measured in the 320--420 nm wavelength range and is dependent upon skin pigmentation. To address the issue of the effect of skin pigmentation on SAF values, Koetsier et al. developed an adjusted algorithm that incorporates information about the degree of UV light absorption in the spectral regions of melanin.\n\n【3】Increased skin concentrations of AGEs are associated with type 2 diabetes and have been shown to add diagnostic value to the conventional risk scheme for cardiovascular risk assessment in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, it has been reported that SAF based decision trees perform better in detecting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in intermediate-risk persons compared to the conventional method of assessing fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Although SAF shows promising translational impact, it is still at the experimental and investigational stage. Further large, cross-sectional, case-controlled and case-series studies are needed to gather more SAF data to establish reference ranges in different ethnic populations and skin types before this technique can be widely used in primary care setting for the diagnosis and management of different diseases, especially diabetes. Several recent studies have tried to address this issue by providing SAF reference values for Dutch, Chinese, Slovak and Qatari populations. However, all of these studies have highlighted the importance of gathering more SAF measurements in larger cohorts.\n\n【4】Obesity-related diseases are prevalent in Middle Eastern countries and Saudi Arabia is among the top ten countries with respect to prevalence of diabetes. Thus, large-scale studies to establish reference SAF ranges in Arab populations may help in earlier diagnosis of diabetes in this region. To date, a recent study carried out in Qatar has been the only study to report SAF values in an Arab population, and in contrast to studies in other populations, suggested a gender discordance in SAF values. We aimed to determine reference SAF values for the general Saudi population and compare it to other cohorts reported in the literature. A secondary objective was to ascertain whether the general Saudi population has higher SAF or steeper age-dependent rise compared to other cohorts, given the higher prevalence of diabetes. We examined whether gender, ethnicity, obesity, smoking, physical activity, hypertension and diabetes were correlated with SAF and explored the performance of the risk stratification scale with respect to high/low SR values.\n\n【5】Results\n=======\n\n【6】Baseline characteristics of skin reflectance and skin autofluorescence values in a Saudi population\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Skin reflectance and SAF values were established for a total of 1,999 participants (median age 38 yrs (18--98 yrs)), of which 1,122 were men (56%, median age 39 yrs (18--98 yrs)) and 877 were women (44%, median age 38 yrs (18--80 yrs)). A summary of numerical and categorical data is presented in tabular form for this cohort ( and , respectively). There was no significant difference in age between the two genders (, p-value 0.08). Comparison of the whole cohort (n = 1,999) versus the healthy participants (n = 1,038) shows that in the healthy cohort, the ratio of men:women in the overweight and obese categories is approximately 1:1 , whereas there is a higher ratio of men:women in these categories in the full population (approximately 3:2). Saudi nationals constituted 57% of the whole cohort with a similar distribution of males (56%) and females (44%) as in the healthy cohort.\n\n【8】Mean SR was 9.5 (±3.0) percent and the majority of individuals had SR values below 11%. A weak but significant difference between SR values of males and females was observed, with median values of 8% and 9% respectively (, p-value « 0.01). Mean SAF was 2.06 (±0.57) arbitrary units (AU) for the entire cohort. There was a significant difference in the SAF values of men and women, with median values of 1.77 AU (0.79--4.84 AU) and 2.20 AU (0.75--4.59 AU) respectively (, p-value « 0.01).\n\n【9】As expected, skin autofluorescence directly correlated with age  and despite the fact that women had significantly higher SAF values than men across the whole age range, with a gender effect size of 0.92 AU (95% CI: 0.83--1.02, p-value 2.2 × 10^−16^), the relationship between age and SAF was similar, as indicated by similar slopes in both linear regression models . The statistical models fitted for male and female participants of the healthy cohort (no hypertension, no diabetes) are:\n\n【10】Further, we tested the relationship of SAF with a wide range of skin pigmentations to explore the validity of the implemented SR adjustment method in Middle Eastern populations. For that purpose, we categorised the study participants into two groups: high SR (\\>10%) and low SR (\\< =10%) and tested for group differences between SAF values for individuals with low and high SR . After correcting for the confounding factors age, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, we found significant differences in SAF for women (p-value 9.5 × 10^−6^), but not for men (p-value 0.12). The mean standardized difference (MSD) was used to quantify the magnitude of the effect of SR on SAF. For men, the MSD was close to zero (no effect, both SR groups), whilst for women with high SR the MSD was 0.32 AU SAF (95% CI: −0.46 -- −0.18). This gender discrepancy in SAF values has not been reported for other populations, with the exception of a single study in a Qatari population. It further indicates that the correction factor used by the AGE reader is not appropriate for the women in this cohort as it overestimates their risk for AGE-related morbidities.\n\n【11】In order to take the effect of differential SR values in the female participants into account, we stratified the female sub-cohort into high and low SR groups and developed the following, SR-adjusted linear regression models:\n\n【12】To highlight further population differences we established regression models (SAF vs age) for a healthy sub-population (defined by the absence of disease, as assessed by a questionnaire) and compared these with data reported for other cohorts .\n\n【13】Over the entire age range (\\~18--75 years) the SAF values for healthy men were similar to those reported for Dutch. and Slovak. populations. Comparable SAF values have also been reported for Chinese individuals up to the 4^th^ life decade, although, in later ages they showed a less steep increase in SAF. In contrast, the female participants of the Saudi cohort demonstrated considerably higher SAF values over the entire age range than all other cohorts (on average 0.5 AU higher than the Dutch). This observation is consistent with a Qatari study, where women had significantly higher SAF values than men across the whole age range, with a gender effect size of 0.42 AU (95% CI: 0.30 -- 0.54, p-value \\< 0.001). The mean SAF values reported for the Qatari cohort (2.27 ± 0.63 AU) were higher than those found in the Saudi cohort (2.06 ± 0.57 AU). This difference is probably due to different age distributions in the two cohorts (median age 48 yrs and 38 yrs for the Qatari and Saudi cohort, respectively) and the inclusion of a relatively high number of individuals suffering from type 2 diabetes in the Qatari cohort (51% as opposed to 14% in the Saudi cohort).\n\n【14】In addition to the observed association between SAF and age, the following variables showed strong correlations (as defined by Pearson's correlation coefficient, r): weight, BMI, hip circumference and waist circumference (each r \\> 0.81), as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r \\> 0.57) for both men and women. As expected the correlation of waist:hip ratio with waist circumference and BMI,  was stronger in men (r = 0.65 and r = 0.44, respectively) than in women (r = 0.52 and r = 0.22, respectively), whereas age was more strongly correlated with hip circumference and BMI in women than in men.\n\n【15】Smokers had median SAF values of 1.81 AU (1.04--4.0 AU) compared to non-smokers with median SAF values of 2.0 AU (0.75--4.84 AU). After correcting for the confounding factors age, BMI, diabetes and SR, however, no significant effect size remained for smoking in both genders (MSD close to zero). The same was true for the effect of physical activity.\n\n【16】The influence of body mass index and waist to hip circumference on SAF\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】A high level of obesity (as defined by the WHO for BMI \\> 30) was found in this cohort where the average BMI was 30.24 (± 6.28) and the median BMI was 30. No significant difference in BMI was found between men and women (; p-value, 0.74). Only 20% of the cohort had a normal or low weight (BMI \\< 25) and the remaining individuals were either overweight (33%, BMI \\> = 25 and \\< 30) or obese (47%, BMI \\> = 30). More men were overweight or obese than women (47% vs 33%, respectively) as shown in . This is in contrast to WHO country profile for Saudi Arabia, which reported that 33% of the population is obese with higher obesity rates in women (39.1%) compared to men (28.6%). The median SAF values were 1.78 AU (1.13--2.37 AU) in under-weight individuals, 1.89 AU (0.75--4.84 AU) in normal weight individuals, 1.91 AU (0.79--4.59 AU) in over-weight individuals and 2.04 AU (0.86--4.72 AU) in obese individuals. Although the differences in median SAF values seem to be striking, many of them diminish after correcting for the known covariates age, gender, diabetes and SR. After correction, there remained a significant SAF difference in overweight men, when compared to men whose weight was in the normal range, with an average increase of 0.32 AU (95% CI: 0.13--0.50, p-value 0.003). This difference was only observable for male and not for female participants. However, multivariate modelling with orthogonal partial least squares regression (OPLSR), which takes the synergistic variable effects into account clearly shows a dependency of SAF on waist to hip ratio for both women and men ( and  respectively), with BMI having a high model importance in women, validated with permutation resampling (n = 999 iterations; ).\n\n【18】Gender dependent associations between SAF and diabetes\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】We directly compared the subset of people with diabetes (n = 284) with an equal-sized subset of age, gender and BMI matched controls (n = 284). Female and male diabetic subjects had significantly higher SAF values across the entire age range than their non-diabetic counterparts . The association between SAF value and age was diminished in diabetic subjects (r = 0.36) compared to healthy participants (r = 0.46). Other correlations between variables that were discordant for diabetic subjects and healthy participants  were a positive association between waist circumference and waist hip ratio (diminished in diabetic subjects), an inverse correlation between diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (stronger in diabetic subjects) and an inverse association between height and BMI (stronger in diabetic subjects). The effect size for non-diabetes/diabetes for men 0.41 AU (95% CI: 0.24--0.58. p-value 5.0 × 10^−5^) was slightly lower than the one for women, 0.53 AU (95% CI: 0.34--0.73, p-value 1.5 × 10^−5^). OPLSR models confirmed the positive association between diabetes and SAF value in both women and men ( respectively).\n\n【20】Association of hypertension with SAF\n------------------------------------\n\n【21】Based on the categorical data indicating whether participants were hypertensive (assessed by a participant questionnaire), a small but non-significant effect of hypertension on SAF (SMD = 0.126 AU, 95% CI: 0--0.25, p-value 0.072) was found. This effect was diminished if only patients that were hypertensive at the time (with systolic BP \\> 160 and diastolic BP \\> 100) were included, thereby taking into account the effect of medication. However, the OPLSR model shows that hypertension was a significant predictor of SAF values for both women and men and co-mapped with self-reported diabetes ( respectively).\n\n【22】Adjusted scheme for CVD risk stratification\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Using SAF values to stratify an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major application of the AGE reader. Risk stratification is based on the initial study and validation of the method in a Dutch cohort by Koetsier et al. whereby individuals are assigned a CVD risk group 1--3. The Saudi cohort shows significant gender differences in SAF compared to other cohorts , and the SR value influences the SAF value in women despite the adjusted algorithm . The majority of women, especially with higher SR in Saudi cohort are classified to be at higher CVD risk according to Koetsier et al. risk stratification model . However, this is not supported by the data for other known risk factors of CVD, i.e. hypertension, overweight/obesity, diabetes, cholesterol, tobacco use and lack of physical activity in our study, where there is no marked gender effect. Moreover, the CVD risk score proposed by Koetsier's model is not consistent with the mortality incidence reported in the literature for Saudi population (23.5% for Saudi women and 27% for Saudi men). Therefore, we propose the following, adjusted risk stratification schemes for Middle Eastern populations, stratified for gender and SR :\n\n【24】Risk group 0: (No CVD risk \\< mean SAF + 1SD):\n\n【25】Risk group 1: (limited increase of CVD risk \\> mean SAF + 1SD AND \\< mean SAF + 2SD):\n\n【26】Risk group 2 or 3: (increased or definite CVD risk \\> mean SAF + 2SD):\n\n【27】A comparison of risk score distributions generated from the conventional and proposed scheme for Saudi cohort is illustrated in . By using the conventional model for women with high SR (the most extreme group), 235 participants (74%) were assigned to the medium and high risk categories (2 and 3), whereas using the modified risk stratification developed here only 10 participants (3%) were assigned to the medium to high risk categories . Similarly, when conventional algorithm was applied to healthy Saudi cohort (women with high SR), 118 participants (73%) were assigned to the medium to high risk categories (2 and 3), whereas using the modified risk stratification developed here only 4 participants (3%) were assigned to the medium to high risk categories. Similarly, the conventional model over-estimated the CVD risk for women with low SR and men in the full current cohort, healthy sub-cohort and hypertensive sub-cohort that is corrected in the proposed model .\n\n【28】Discussion\n==========\n\n【29】We provide reference SAF data for the first time in a Saudi population with potential application in a wide-range of translational and clinical studies. Skin autofluorescence assessment is not only important for cardiovascular risk assessment and diabetes screening, but has also been shown to have diagnostic value in renal failure , retinopathy, neuropathy, foot ulceration and schizophrenia. We show a gender dependent association of SAF with age, SR value, diabetes, hypertension and obesity, discussed below. Half of our cohort was physically active (reported exercising for more than 30 minutes per day) and approximately 20% were smokers. We found no association of SAF with smoking or exercise. These results are contrary to previous reports, that associate increased SAF values with smoking, particularly in cohorts with central adiposity and a decrease of SAF in physically active individuals, although other studies have found no such association between smoking and SAF values.\n\n【30】Gender bias in SAF values\n-------------------------\n\n【31】The mean SAF value of the study cohort was 2.06 AU (SD, 0.57), which is considerably higher than the values reported for other populations. We found a significant gender difference in SAF values, where women had higher SAF values compared to men. This is in contrast to most other studies that indicate no gender difference in SAF values in Dutch, Chinese and Slovak populations. One previous study reported 0.2 AU higher SAF values in female smokers, compared to male smokers (p-value 0.02) but no gender difference in SAF values was observed in non-smoking subjects. Similar gender differences in SAF were reported in a recent Qatari study, with a cohort made up of mainly Arabs (57%), South Asians (28%) and Filipinos (10%). According to WHO country profile, cardiovascular mortality is higher in Saudi males accounting for \\~14% of all deaths due to non-communicable diseases between the ages of 30-70 years compared to Saudi females (\\~7%), therefore the higher SAF values observed in females is unlikely to be a true representation of higher cardiovascular risk. The majority of our cohort were Arab individuals similar to Qatari cohort, thus the gender difference in SAF values among Arabs may be attributable to genetic contributions.\n\n【32】Some previous studies suggested that genetics play a role in skin and lens fluorescence. Indeed, a recent genome-wide association study has reported an association between N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) acetylation status and SAF in people with and without diabetes of European decent. However, the male participants in our cohort had similar SAF values to age matched Dutch, Slovak and Chinese individuals, and no sex-chromosome linked associations have been reported so far.\n\n【33】Women in the Middle Eastern region keep their arms covered due to cultural reasons and usually have a lighter skin colour than males. Indeed, females in our cohort had significantly higher SR than males (median SR: 9% and 8%, respectively), consistent with lighter skin colour. The Middle East has the highest level of vitamin D deficiency in the world, and the prevalence is higher in women than in men, largely attributable to lifestyle and behavioural differences between genders. Consequently this may partially explain the higher SAF values found in the Saudi women, since vitamin D deficiency is associated with diabetes and obesity. Further studies are needed to determine the association between vitamin D deficiency and SAF in Saudi women. An alternative explanation for gender differences in SAF may be the residual effect of application of skin creams, lotions and sunscreen, predominantly by women. Skin products can have fluorescent properties that may serve to produce a cumulative effect to increase the SAF signal in women. However, the evaluation phase of our study indicates that the effect of skin lotion on SAF values is vastly reduced by a single wash using soap and water  and this, together with the fact that participants were excluded from the main study if they had applied lotions or skin products within 48 hours prior to the study, would suggest that this explanation does not in itself account for the observed differences. Further, appropriately controlled studies are needed to investigate this phenomenon.\n\n【34】Within the female subset, based on both univariate and multivariate analyses, we found that women with darker skin colour (SR ≤ 10%) had lower SAF measurements than those with lighter skin colour (SR \\> 10%). This is an unexpected finding as we used the SR independent SAF measurement software for SAF assessment. Since there was no SR effect in men, which had considerably smaller SAF values, we conclude that the implemented correction method for SR may not be appropriate for individuals with SAF values higher than the reference values proposed by Koetsier et al. This also implies that the SAF modelled risk score is underestimated for subjects with SR ≤ 10% at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Similarly, risk scores were overestimated for individuals with higher SAF values (related to higher SR). Therefore, we suggest that the cardiovascular risk assessment provided by the AGE reader may need to be revised for different ethnic populations and have proposed a modified risk stratification algorithm.\n\n【35】SAF association with cardiovascular disease co-morbidities\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】In the current study, only 52% of the cohort, comprising 1,038 individuals was defined as healthy, i.e. no self-reported disease, with systolic BP of 100-139 and diastolic BP of 50-89 millimetres of mercury. This compares poorly with other random catch population studies reporting SAF values (Dutch, Slovak and Chinese) where the incidence of obesity in those countries is 18.8%, 25.4%, and 5.7%, respectively. Nevertheless, the SAF values for the subset of Saudi men were similar to these other populations. The Qatari population was the most closely matched to the Saudi population in terms of prevalence of diabetes, obesity etc. and also reported a similar gender bias that did not correlate with mortality from CVD.\n\n【37】Higher SAF values were observed in overweight and obese individuals based on the OPLSR models, which showed that waist-to-hip ratio in men and both BMI and hip circumference in women were strong coefficients in the equation . These observations are in agreement with other literature that reports higher mean SAF values in centrally obese individuals compared to non-obese individuals (p-value 0.001). We find an SAF increase of 0.15 AU in obese people compared to normal weight people in our study similar to the study by den Engelsen et al. who reported a SAF increase of 0.13 AU in a sub-group of individuals with central obesity compared to the sub-group of people without central obesity, after adjusting for age and smoking.\n\n【38】We report for the first time, a direct association between SAF value and the presence of hypertension. The coefficient plots for the OPLSR model show co-mapping of hypertension and diabetes as factors that contribute to higher SAF values . Obesity is an acknowledged and independent risk factor for CVD, hypertension and diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with cardiometabolic dysfunction (e.g. hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dyslipidemia). Although we proposed vitamin D deficiency as a possible reason for gender bias in SAF reading, the CVD mortality statistics, which are worse for men, do not support vitamin D deficiency as a reason for increased SAF levels.\n\n【39】The conventional classification of CVD risk, based on SAF data from Koetsier et al. in a Caucasian population, is clearly not applicable to the Saudi population since it places 334 (59%) women with low SR and 235 (74%) women with high SR of our study cohort in high risk groups (2 and 3). Even for the healthy sub-cohort, it massively overestimates the CVD risk by assigning 181 (58%) women with low SR and 118 (73%) women with high SR into high risk categories. This is not supported by the data from epidemiology studies and identifies the need to adjust the risk stratification scheme based on reference SAF values in this ethnic population. We revised the risk stratification for both men and women (with high and low SR) to match the documented mortality associated with cardiovascular disease in the Saudi population. This was achieved by setting the upper SAF limits for risk group 0 and 1 to the mean SAF plus one and two standard deviations per age group, respectively. This resulted in down-weighting of individuals, especially women from the high risk to lower risk category in the full cohort and in both healthy and hypertensive sub-cohorts . Validation of this modified risk stratification scheme is now warranted in other Middle Eastern populations.\n\n【40】Limitations of our study include that we did not recruit subjects from populations outside Jeddah, however, Jeddah is a multi-ethnic city with people from different Middle Eastern countries and around the world. We did not perform tests for glucose or HbA1c. Many subjects may have pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes which may have a pronounced effect on the average SAF values reported for this population. Since this study was conducted in public places, it was not possible to conduct blood tests for practical reasons. Moreover, at our study sites, it would not have been possible to find people in fasting state to perform reliable glucose testing. We are aware that we did not gather data about duration of diabetes in diabetic subjects. We also did not screen for renal function and smoking status, other likely contributors to SAF. Since the study population was relatively large (n = 1999), for reasons of practicality we were reliant on self-reported data. We might have excluded subjects with self-reported diseases, however, we also present data for a healthy sub-cohort.\n\n【41】In summary, we provide reference SAF values for the first time in a cross-section of Saudi population. Besides an increase of SAF with age, which has been described previously, we observed higher SAF values in women than in men. Therefore, we advocate that gender differences should be taken into consideration in developing and implementing SAF-based risk engines for disease screening and/or monitoring. Reference SAF values must be established in different ethnic populations before SAF can be used in clinical settings. Further larger studies are needed in different ethnic groups and different geographic locations to understand the contribution of genetic variations, environmental factors and different life styles to the variance in SAF.\n\n【42】Methods\n=======\n\n【43】Study design\n------------\n\n【44】The cross-sectional study was approved by the research ethics committee of King Abdulaziz University. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. Bioethical regulations as described in the \"Regulations of Research Bioethics on the living Creature\" by the National Bioethics Committee (King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology) were strictly observed by all persons associated with the project while dealing with the study subjects. A questionnaire was used to gather information about demographical variables (age, gender), ethnicity (country of birth, nationality), lifestyle factors (smoking habits, physical activity) and medical history (presence of age related diseases in the subject and his/her first degree relatives and medicine taken). All participants had physical examination to measure height, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference, blood pressure, skin reflectance (SR) and skin autofluorescence (SAF). All adults were invited to take part in the study who could communicate in Arabic or English. The subjects who provided written informed consent were included in the study. Subjects below the age of 18 or with Fitzpatric class 5-6 skin type were excluded from the study.\n\n【45】Study population\n----------------\n\n【46】This study was performed at various locations including King Abdulaziz University, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Al-Salaam Mall and Mall of Arabia between November 2013 and April 2014 in the city of Jeddah, the largest urban center in the western Saudi Arabia. A total of 2,385 subjects provided the informed consent and completed the questionnaire. However, 239 subjects couldn't wait and left the stall before their SR and SAF was measured (The same AGE reader was used for all subjects). Among the remaining 2,146 subjects who completed the procedure, valid SAF measurement was not possible in 147 subjects due to skin darkness. Therefore, data are presented for 1,999 individuals. There was no statistical difference in the demographics of those participants who left or were excluded from the study before completing the full set of measurements and those who completed the study regardless.\n\n【47】Skin autofluorescence measurement\n---------------------------------\n\n【48】The SAF measurements were performed non-invasively using a fully automated AGE reader with a built-in spectrometer (DiagnOptics Technologies B.V. Groningen, the Netherlands) which has been described in more details previously. The output of the AGE reader was a SR corrected SAF value as described in details previously. Three measurements were made for each participant by slightly changing the position each time at healthy intact skin on volar side of dominant forearm approximately 5-10 cm below elbow fold. Average SAF value was calculated by the AGE reader software version 2.3, which performs a correction to the SAF value if the UV reflectance from skin is between 6% and 10%. However, valid SAF measurement for skin with UV reflectance below 6% is not possible with the current AGE reader SU software used in our study. AGE reader uses UV-A light with a peak excitation wavelength at 370 nm to illuminate \\~4 cm^2^ skin area. Skin autofluorescence is calculated as the ratio between emission light intensity in the 420--600 nm wavelength range and the excitation light intensity in the 300--420 nm wavelength range, mulitiplied by 100 and is expressed in arbitrary units. Before taking the measurements, participants were asked about the use of tanning agents, creams, lotions or perfumes on the forearm within the previous 48 hours and if they had used such agents, SAF measurement was not performed for them. They were asked to wash the forearm thoroughly with soap, refrain from using such agents before measurement and come back after two days. We observed the effect of skin lotion application and subsequent washing with soap and water on SAF and SR values in a pilot study . We show that application of skin lotion increases SAF value by 18% and decreases SR value by 11%, consistent with the results reported previously. Washing with soap and water reduces the effect of skin lotion on SAF and SR values by 62% and 65% respectively.\n\n【49】Reproducibility and robustness of AGE Reader measurements is already well-established. For example, McIntyre et al. report a coefficient of variation of 8% for different operators and 7% for repeat measurements performed on a single subject by the same operator. We conducted a pilot study to gather data about intra-personal and operator variance and found both, the SAF and the SR measurements, to be robust with low inter-operator (CV: 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively) and intra-personal (CV: 6.2% and 8.1%, respectively) variance .\n\n【50】Statistical analysis\n--------------------\n\n【51】Numeric data are expressed as mean (±SD) if normally distributed and as median (min-max) if non-normally distributed. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution (alpha = 0.05). Testing for population differences was accomplished with 2-sided t-testing, or, if the data violated the assumptions of normal distribution and homoscedasticity, with 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum testing. Categorical data were expressed as counts and population differences were tested with the chi-square test.\n\n【52】Correlation analysis was performed with Pearson's correlation and heatmaps were generated to visualize correlation coefficients for gender and diabetes individually. The upper triangular matrix of  depicts correlations for women and the lower triangular matrix correlations for men. Similarly in , the upper triangular matrix depicts correlation for individuals with diabetes and the lower triangular matrix correlations for non-diabetic subjects.\n\n【53】The comparison of SAF reference values across cohorts was based on linear regression models, established with mean SAF values per age group that were extracted from the following publications: Dutch study, Chinese study and Slovak study.\n\n【54】The effect size of covariates are expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD, sometimes known as Cohen's d), after adjusting the outcome variable SAF for confounding factors. For example, the effect size of the variable gender on SAF was calculated after removing the influence of confounding factors age, diabetes, BMI and SR by means of linear regression:\n\n【55】with being the residuals of a linear regression model established with the confounding factors age, diabetes, BMI and SR. The size effect was calculated with the following formula:\n\n【56】Whereas is the average value of the corrected SAF for group (in the example above: male and female) and s is the pooled standard deviation:\n\n【57】With and is the number of observations in group . The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated with a non-central t-distribution parameter as implemented in the R package MBESS (V 3.3.3), that is available via CRAN repository .\n\n【58】To assess whether SAF values can be predicted and to improve our understanding of the relationships among the predictor variables an orthogonal partial least squares regression (O-PLSR) model  was trained for each gender separately. PLSR is a multivariate data modelling technique that is particularly helpful in situations where there are multiple predictors and where these are (multi-) collinear or non-independent. The method combines features from principal component analysis and multiple regression such that, the input data (e.g. age, BP, BMI, weight etc.) and outcome measure (SAF) are described by latent variables. These latent variables (also termed principal components) represent composites of the original variables and are chosen in a way that maximises the covariance between them. OPLSR is an extension of the traditional PLSR approach which has been shown to yield more parsimonious models that are easier to interpret. Similar to other modern predictive modelling techniques, (O)PLSR can easily overfit the data, which is why the number of principal components is usually determined with statistical re-sampling techniques. The presented OPLSR analysis was performed with the software SIMCA (V13), which produces model performance measures in form of Q^2^Y (estimated prediction accuracy of the model) and R^2^X (explained variance of the combined predictors) based on seven-fold cross validation. Both measures maximally take values of 1. However, for biological models the R^2^X and Q^2^Y usually have much lower values due to noisiness of the data and high inter-sample variation. The robustness of both models was tested by permutation analysis, where the sequence of the SAF values is shuffled in order to evaluate the likelihood of achieving similar high model R^2^X and Q^2^Y values by chance. We consider both of the trained OPLSR models (male and female) to be statistically robust , due to considerably smaller R^2^X and Q^2^Y values in the permutation models.\n\n【59】The optimal number of components were chosen according to a cross validation scheme. The OPLSR model for women showed similar and reasonably good predictive abilities (2 components, R^2^X = 0.45, Q^2^Y = 0.39) than the OPLSR model for men (2 components, R^2^X = 0.38, Q^2^Y = 0.30). The proposed scheme for adjustment of the CVD risk factor stratification was based on linear models established with the mean SAF values and standard deviations per age and gender group.\n\n【60】With exception of OPLSR analysis, all computation were performed with the statistical programming language R (V 2.15.2) on a 64 bit operating system running a Windows 7 distribution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The mean (SD) age of the bilastine and placebo groups was 8.5 (1.6) and 8.5 (1.8) years, respectively. In the bilastine group, 105 (52%) subjects were aged 6--8 years, and 97 (48%) aged 9--11 years. Respective numbers in the placebo group were 95 (49.7%) and 96 (50.3%). Subjects in the bilastine and placebo groups were mainly male (62.9% and 61.8%, respectively) and Caucasian (93.1% and 92.7%). Mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) in the two groups was 18.0 (3.5) and 18.1 (3.5) kg/m^2^, respectively. Subjects were diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (98.0% and 93.7%) or chronic urticaria (2.0% and 6.3%), with a mean (SD) time since diagnosis of 4.1 (2.5) and 4.0 (2.7) years, respectively.\n\n【24】There was no significant difference in the incidence of TEAEs between the two groups: 137 events were reported in 67.8% of children receiving bilastine compared with 129 events in 67.5% receiving placebo (p = 0.952). Rates of children with related-TEAEs in the bilastine and placebo groups were 5.4% and 7.9%, respectively (p = 0.337); rates of children with serious TEAEs were 1.0% and 3.1%, respectively (p = 0.165), although none were considered to be treatment related; and rates of children with TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively (p = 1.0).\n\n【25】The most frequent TEAEs (≥ 5% frequency) in the bilastine and placebo groups were headache (13.4% vs. 12.6%), allergic conjunctivitis (9.9% vs. 9.4%), cough (8.9% vs. 7.9%), nasopharyngitis (7.9% vs. 4.7%), pharyngitis (7.4% vs. 6.8%), allergic rhinitis (6.4% vs. 10.0%), pyrexia (5.0% vs. 10.0%), and viral infection (4.5% vs. 5.2%), respectively.\n\n【26】Discussion \n==========\n\n【27】Results from the post hoc PK study of bilastine in children aged 6--11 years with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or urticaria align with those from a larger pediatric population (aged 2--11 years) which indicated a lack of age dependence for bilastine PK . The current PK analysis was limited to children aged 6--11 years, which is in line with the approved pediatric indication for bilastine in Europe: ≥ 6 years of age with a body weight of ≥ 20 kg. Pediatric data in the full dataset (aged 4--11 years) were best described by a two-compartment disposition model , which is the same used to describe bilastine PK in adults . Both AUC~0--24~ and C~max~ metrics between children (aged 6--11 years) and adult groups were very similar, with a complete overlap of pediatric bilastine plasma concentrations with those of adults, and pediatric/adult ratios for AUC~0--24~ and C~max~ were close to unity (0.93 and 0.91, respectively). These results support the suitability of the pediatric dose of bilastine 10 mg.\n\n【28】Safety data were derived from analysis of a subset of data (in children aged 6--11 years) from the phase III, placebo-controlled randomized trial of bilastine in children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or chronic urticaria . In this post hoc analysis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of TEAEs in children receiving bilastine (10 mg) or placebo, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse effect in both groups (13.4% vs.12.6%, respectively). These results confirm that, in children, bilastine 10 mg has a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of placebo . In adults, bilastine at the recommended dose of 20 mg has an excellent safety profile, with good tolerability and no sedative effects or cardiotoxicity \\[, --\\].\n\n【29】In conclusion, analysis of PK and safety data in children aged 6--11 years supports the suitability of the pediatric dose of bilastine 10 mg and confirms that its safety profile is similar to that of placebo.\n\n【30】Under the direction of the authors, editorial assistance was provided by Robert A.

With the development of cancer treatment over recent decades, the number of cancer patients with stroke is expected to rise. The occurrence of cerebrovascular disease is not uncommon in cancer patients; 15% of them had a thromboembolic complication during their clinical course . Mechanisms underlying stroke in patients with cancer can be divided into three types: cancer-unrelated mechanisms (conventional stroke mechanisms; atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, lacunar infarction, etc.), cancer-related mechanisms, and treatment-related mechanisms . It has been recently reported that embolism caused by hypercoagulopathy is the main mechanism of cancer-related stroke, especially in cancer patients without conventional stroke mechanisms ,\n\n【2】The association between cancer and venous thromboembolism is well established. Previous studies have demonstrated that a specific form of venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis migrans, may appear months or even years before the signs and symptoms of cancer emerge . This rare disorder is considered as a clue to the presence of hidden malignancy. In addition, it has been well known that deep venous thrombosis, which is a more common form of venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism also lead clinicians to suspect occult cancer --. However, it is not known if the occurrence of ischemic stroke, which is suspected to be related to cancer, should lead clinicians to suspect occult malignancy.\n\n【3】We investigated the clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of cancer-related stroke among patients without conventional stroke mechanisms. We hypothesized that hidden malignancy could be detected in cryptogenic stroke patients without overt cancer when they showed the distinctive characteristics of cancer-related stroke.\n\n【4】Methods \n=======\n\n【5】Patients and Grouping \n---------------------\n\n【6】This retrospective analysis was conducted using data collected from a prospective registry of patients who presented at our institute between December 2006 and October 2011. The inclusion criteria for this study were: (a) subjects with focal neurologic deficits that presented within 7 days of the onset of symptoms, (b) subjects with acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), and (c) subjects undergoing diagnostic workups, including vascular and cardiologic studies. Among 2562 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the following patients were excluded from the study:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> those who had one or more evident stroke etiologies (conventional stroke mechanisms) by the Stop Stroke Study Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (SSS-TOAST) classification ,通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> those who had not undergone MRI or for whom no relevant lesions were seen on DWI,通用删除7(英):<u> (3)</u> those who had incomplete workups for stroke etiology (either vascular or cardiologic studies),通用删除7(英):<u> (4)</u> those in whom plasma D-dimer was not examined within 24 hours from admission,通用删除7(英):<u> (5)</u> those who had a history of recent surgery, myocardial infarction, or deep vein thrombosis, or any signs of infectious or immunological diseases, which may influence plasma D-dimer levels, or通用删除7(英):<u> (6)</u> those who had primary intracranial tumor.\n\n【7】Since we excluded all the patients with conventional stroke mechanisms, subjects included in this study were considered to have cryptogenic stroke. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of active cancer at the time of stroke:通用删除7(英):<u> (1)</u> the cryptogenic stroke with active cancer (cancer-related stroke, CA-stroke group) and通用删除7(英):<u> (2)</u> the cryptogenic stroke without active cancer (CR-stroke group). Active cancer was defined as a diagnosis of cancer within 6 months prior to enrollment, any treatment for cancer within the previous 6 months, or recurrent or metastatic cancer, as previously described . A typical example of CA-stroke is presented in . As a disease control group, patients with locally advanced lung cancer or distant organ metastases, and without a history of stroke were recruited for comparison purposes (CA-control group). All patients gave written informed consent, and the institutional review board in Samsung Medical Center approved this study.\n\n【8】![A typical example of cryptogenic stroke with active cancer (cancer-related stroke).\\\nThe patient was a 55-year-old female, who was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung one year ago. Neurologic examination revealed motor aphasia, right-central facial paralysis, and right hemiparesis. Initial D-dimer levels were 20.56 µg/mL. Diffusion-weighted MRI (A) shows multiple lesions involving multiple vascular territories. MR angiography (B) reveals no significant stenosis or occlusion of the craniocervical arterial vasculature. Comprehensive workup including transesophageal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring demonstrated no sources of cardioembolism.]\n\n【9】Workups \n-------\n\n【10】Demographic and clinical data were collected at admission and included sex, age, and vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and smoking habits. Routine laboratory data were collected for all patients and included fibrinogen and D-dimer within 24 hours after admission. The plasma levels of D-dimer were determined by immunoturbidimetry on a STA-R automated analyzer (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) (reference values in our laboratory ≤0.5 µg/mL).\n\n【11】Hemostatic markers of prothrombotic tendency, including antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipid antibody, lupus anticoagulants, and β2-glycoprotein-1 antibody) were measured in patients younger than 50 years to exclude hypercoagulable state caused by other than cancer. Diagnostic work-up to detect other rare caused of stroke (e.g. vasculitis) was performed in selected patients based on the attending physician's discretion. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography, 12-lead electrocardiography, Holter and/or telemetry monitoring, and brain MRI. In addition, transcranial Doppler or transthoracic echocardiographic bubble test was underwent in selected patients in whom DWI pattern suggested embolic stroke mechanism.\n\n【12】The typical MRI protocol included at least DWI, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and vascular images (3D time-of-flight MR angiography (MRA) and contrast-enhanced MRA including extracranial internal cerebral artery and vertebral artery). The DWI parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR), 2550 ms; echo time (TE), 75 ms; matrix, 128×128; 3 directions; field of view (FOV), 24 cm; section thickness, 5 mm; and intersection gap, 2 mm. DWI was obtained with b values of 0 and 1000 s/mm^2^. We analyzed DWI data in all patients. DWI patterns were classified as single/multiple lesions involving a single vascular territory and multiple leisons involving multiple vascular territories. The involvement of multiple vascular territories was defined by multiple ischemic lesions in the: 1) unilateral anterior and posterior circulation, 2) bilateral anterior circulation, or 3) bilateral anterior and posterior circulation.\n\n【13】Statistical Analyses \n--------------------\n\n【14】Statistical analyses were performed using a commercially available software package . All data are presented as the median (25^th^--75^th^ percentile) or number (percentage). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution of continuous variables. Since the distributions were not normal (P\\<0.05), Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare continuous variables between groups. Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. We used the Bonferroni correction to account for multiple tests.\n\n【15】The optimal D-dimer value for diagnosis of CA-stroke among patients with cryptogenic stroke was established with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scatter plot . An alternative way to establish an optimal cutoff value for a test is to determine the optimal decision point from an ROC curve, whereby equal weight is given to the sensitivity and specificity of the test. The sum of the sensitivity and specificity values is highest at this point. To calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of diagnostic tests, we used this cutoff point.\n\n【16】Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the independent contribution of factors in CA-stroke vs. CR-stroke. Variables significant at P\\<0.2 on univariable analyses were considered explanatory variables and were entered together into multivariable models. Plasma levels of D-dimer were treated as a continuous variable (Model 1) or categorized as quartiles (Model 2) in multivariable analyses. A p-value \\<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【17】Results \n=======\n\n【18】During the study period, a total of 348 patients with cryptogenic stroke (217 men and 131 women) were ultimately enrolled in this study. Among them, 71 (20.4%) patients had active cancer at the time of presentation of stroke. The mean patient age was 61 years old (standard deviation, 15; full range, 18--94 years). As a disease control group, 33 patients with active lung cancer without a history of stroke were also included.\n\n【19】Baseline characteristics of patients with CA-stroke, CR-stroke, and CA-control are presented in . The median time interval between stroke onset and the diagnosis of cancer was 5 months (25^th^--75^th^ percentile, 2--25 months) among patients with CA-stroke. In terms of the primary cancer, lung cancer was most frequently observed, followed by hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, and breast-gynecologic malignancies. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma as the histologic subtype and systemic metastasis. Approximately one third of CA-stroke patients had received chemotherapy possibly causing coagulopathy (all cisplatin treatments) within 6 months of stroke onset.\n\n【20】10.1371/journal.pone.0044959.t001\n\n【21】###### Baseline characteristics.\n\n【22】删除20:<u>!</u>\n\n【23】

Certain clinical, laboratory, and radiological features could help physicians determine stroke etiology early. Among them, the pattern of ischemic lesions demonstrated by DWI has been reported to be correlated with the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of stroke or even serve as a surrogate marker of specific causes of stroke .\n\n【48】In this study, the pattern of multiple ischemic lesions extending to multiple vascular systems was an independent predictor of CA-stroke. It has been well known that multiple acute stroke lesions on DWI are presumably caused by multiple emboli , Our previous study using microembolic signals detected by transcranial Doppler also suggested the embolic nature of CA-stroke . However, it cannot be said that the feature is unique for CA-stroke, because the same topography on DWI could also result from cardiogenic, paradoxical, and aortogenic embolic strokes .\n\n【49】The notable characteristic of CA-stroke is high plasma concentrations of D-dimer. The D-dimer levels are a direct measure of activated coagulation and have been used as a means of hypercoagulability . The elevated D-dimer levels in CA-stroke suggest that hypercoagulopathy plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CA-stroke, which is a consistent finding with previous studies , Interestingly, the D-dimer concentrations were also significantly higher in CA-stroke than CA-control, which might mean that certain trigger factors are needed in the development of CA-stroke. Recent studies demonstrated that tissue factor-bearing cancer-derived microparticles have a significant role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in patients with cancer , We are investigating the possible role of the microparticles in the development of CA-stroke. Concerning the high predictability of D-dimer to diagnose CA-stroke, we think that the D-dimer levels in conjunction with lesion patterns on DWI can be used as a discriminating marker for CA-stroke in patients with cryptogenic infarction.\n\n【50】Clues to Occult Cancer in Stroke Patients \n-----------------------------------------\n\n【51】Since a hypercoagulable state is a common condition in patients with cancer, the cancer patient is predisposed to the development of venous thrombosis. In this regard, the possible role of venous thrombosis as a clue to occult malignancy has been widely investigated. Studies show that superficial venous thrombosis, idiopathic deep vein thrombosis, and bilateral deep vein thrombosis correlate with subsequent cancer diagnosis , However, there is a paucity of data regarding the clues to hidden malignancy in patients with ischemic stroke.\n\n【52】In this study, we found cancers in all the patients who had compatible features with CA-stroke among the CR-stroke group. In other words, clinicians should suspect occult cancer when they diagnose ischemic stroke involving multiple vascular territories with high D-dimer levels and without identifiable causes of stroke or elevated D-dimer which are consistent with findings from one previous study . Regarding location, histology, and extent of cancer, malignancies in patients with CA-stroke and hidden malignancies in patients with CR-stroke had similar features. Adenocarcinoma in the lung, gastrointestinal, or hepatobiliary system with systemic metastasis was the most frequently encountered type of cancer. The findings are in line with what has already been established in previous studies of deep vein thrombosis --. Those characteristics of cancer might be useful as a guide to screen occult cancer in patients with cryptogenic stroke.\n\n【53】Strengths and Weaknesses \n------------------------\n\n【54】We included CA-control patients who had similar extent and histology of cancer to CA-stroke patients. Therefore, the possible effects of cancer itself in elevating D-dimer levels can be eliminated. In addition, we excluded patients who had possible conditions that could raise levels of D-dimer. That may allow us to assume that elevated D-dimer concentrations are a CA-stroke-specific finding.\n\n【55】It is important to note that this study also had some limitations. First, the results should be interpreted with caution, because they were based on data obtained from a single center. Accordingly, our results need independent confirmation through future studies. Second, not all the patients of the CR-stroke group underwent cancer workup. Screening of occult cancer in patients with CR-stroke was determined by the discretion of attending physicians who have many experiences with CA-stroke and was largely based on the DWI pattern and D-dimer levels. Therefore, it may be difficult to generalize our results to all settings even though the ROC curve was good and we found occult cancer in all patients in the CR-stroke group who had ischemic lesions in multiple vascular territories and high D-dimer levels. More systemic approaches are needed to avoid missing hidden malignancies. Third, although all the included subjects underwent cardiologic evaluation including standard electrocardiography, Holter and/or telemetry monitoring and transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography was not performed in all patients, mainly due to coagulopathy, bleeding tendency, mental change, or acute illness related to systemic cancer or stroke, itself. Therefore, it may be possible that some cardioembolic sources with high primary risk for ischemic stroke could not be detected in this study.\n\n【56】Conclusion \n----------\n\n【57】In conclusion, acute ischemic lesions involving multiple vascular territories on DWI and plasma D-dimer levels are independent predictors for CA-stroke. Those laboratory and radiologic features also serve as clues to occult cancer in patients with cryptogenic stroke but without active cancer at the time of stroke. Future study is warranted to optimize strategies for diagnosis and treatment of occult cancer in those patients.\n\n【58】[^1]: Competing Interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\n【59】[^2]: Conceived and designed the experiments: SJK MJA OYB.

The short developmental timeframe of these diseases (from the 1980s onward, roughly within one generation) decreases the likelihood that a changing genetic component is significantly involved. Hence, researchers are assessing the potential effects of environmental factors, such as diet and antibiotic exposure. Furthermore, the increase in immune disorders and atopic diseases parallels a decrease in prevalence of infectious diseases over the same time period, which can be attributed to increased vaccine and antibiotic treatments, and improved sanitation standards. An in-depth look at the effects of these \"hygienic\" environmental factors suggests that lack of exposure to infectious agents may be the culprit for the increase in immune-mediated and atopic disease prevalence, a concept most commonly referred to today as the \"hygiene hypothesis\". This review aims to provide readers with the historical and current perspectives of the hygiene hypothesis and to elaborate on the modern scientific and medical applications of this theory. We also discuss the increasing evidence connecting the hygiene hypothesis to the development of atopic disease and immune-mediated disorders, in addition to discussing future therapies capitalizing on this knowledge.\n\n【2】A history of \"hygiene\" in immune modulation\n===========================================\n\n【3】One of the first observations relating infectious agents and immune dysregulation occurred in Western Nigeria, where Greenwood noted the low incidence of rheumatoid arthritis and deduced that this low incidence may be attributed to immunological disturbance resulting from frequent exposure to malaria . Greenwood et al also observed suppressed spontaneous autoimmune disease, characterized by delayed Coombs test positivity and reticulocytosis in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (a causative agent of rodent malaria). In the late 1970s, a discrepancy between urbanized and rural environments emerged when Gerrard et al observed a lower prevalence of allergy in indigenous populations in Northern Canada compared to urban Caucasian populations.\n\n【4】In 1989, Strachan proposed the hygiene hypothesis of allergic disease after observing that hay fever was less common among children with older siblings. He reasoned that children growing up in larger families may experience increased exposure to microbes in early childhood due to inevitable unhygienic contact with older siblings or prenatal exposure from the mother infected by similar unhygienic contact. Strachan proposed that this increased microbial exposure in early life could protect children from developing immune hypersensitivities later in life. Strachan et al supported this theory by assessing family history, medical records, and allergy skin prick test results in a cohort of 11,765 children and found that household size was inversely correlated with the development of hay fever. Additional epidemiological studies supporting the hygiene hypothesis associate a reduction in allergen sensitization with pet exposure, daycare attendance, and an increased number of siblings. Early childhood infections have also been associated with decreased atopy in children. A retrospective case-control study showed that atopic patients exhibited a lower prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii, Helicobacter pylori, and hepatitis A when compared to non-atopic controls. More recently, single-strand polymorphism analysis and culture techniques were used to identify microbial exposures among two cohort studies of European children. In both cohort studies, researchers found that children growing up on farms in Central Europe encountered a wider range of microbial exposures and had a lower prevalence of asthma and atopy than the reference group. A closer look at the immunological mechanisms behind Strachan's hygiene hypothesis of allergic disease will enhance the connection between early life infectious exposures and the development of immune tolerance.\n\n【5】Immunological support for the hygiene hypothesis\n================================================\n\n【6】In 1986, just prior to Strachan's proposal of the hygiene hypothesis, Mosmann et al described the T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell subtypes, providing an immunological basis for this otherwise observational theory. They discovered that fully differentiated murine CD4^+^ T-cells secreted two separate cytokine profiles (Th1: IFN-γ; Th2: IL-4) and that the different cytokines produced two different inflammatory responses. Th2 cells play a primary role in the allergen sensitization process. Infection with viruses and intracellular bacteria generally stimulates Th1 immune responses, which suppress Th2 cytokine activity through the induction of IFN-γ. Consequently, the concept of a Th1 versus Th2 balance arose whereby a Th1-dominated immune phenotype (brought on by early life microbial exposures) was thought to inhibit atopic immunopathology. Research related to helminth parasites stimulated the need for further explanation beyond this binary view, as these organisms paradoxically induce Th2 responses while suppressing allergic reactivity. T-cell plasticity and additional T-cell phenotypes (eg, Th17, Th9, and T regulatory \\[Treg\\] cells) have more recently been implicated in the control of hypersensitivity disorders. Additionally, many innate cytokines (eg, IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and cell types (eg, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and epithelial cells) also play significant roles in hypersensitivity disease. It is now understood that the process of allergen presentation and consequent initiation of the allergic response involves both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. Thus, the immunological foundation of the hygiene hypothesis has been modified to consider the balance between many adaptive and innate immune cell populations. Further, extending the hygiene hypothesis to account for the role of various parasites (ie, intestinal helminths) and microbiota compositional shifts provides insight into how early life environmental exposures shape the human immune system. These extensions are known as the \"old friends\" and \"microflora\" hypotheses, respectively.\n\n【7】The old friends hypothesis: parasitic helminths\n===============================================\n\n【8】The old friends hypothesis, proposed by Rook et al, notes the co-evolution of microorganisms and macroorganisms, such as parasitic helminths, with the development of the human immune system. Similar to the hygiene hypothesis, it suggests that these organisms are required for normal immune system development. For example, a study in Gabon found that school children diagnosed with schistosomiasis, caused by infection with helminth parasites from the Schistosoma genus, exhibited lower levels of allergen reactivity than their uninfected classmates. Since then, additional studies have highlighted this seemingly protective effect of helminths in many mouse models of allergic diseases.-- A live Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. polygyrus; a murine helminth parasite) infection reduces lung cellular influx, eosinophilia, allergen recall responses, bronchial hyperreactivity, and histopathology in ovalbumin (OVA)- and house dust mite (HDM)-driven mouse models of asthma. Additionally, Schistosoma mansoni infection has been shown to be protective in an experimental mouse model of fatal anaphylaxis, probably due to the induction of a regulatory IL-10-producing B cell population. There is also experimental animal model evidence suggesting the ability of helminths to ameliorate symptoms of T1D and colitis . Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop T1D, which is significantly inhibited when they are infected with H. polygyrus or the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis.-- Helminth infection has also been shown to reduce inflammation in murine models of colitis. Studies such as these support live helminth infection as a potential therapy to combat hypersensitivity and other immune disorders; however, referring back to Strachan's original hygiene hypothesis, the question of whether live helminth infection in early life is an effective treatment to protect against the development of these disorders is still unclear. Future therapeutics to treat immune dysregulation may involve the excretory/secretory (ES) products of these parasites and/or the intestinal microbiota ( and ).\n\n【9】The microflora hypothesis\n=========================\n\n【10】The microflora hypothesis is another modern extension of the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that early life perturbations (driven by factors such as antibiotic use, infection, or diet) to the bacteria residing in the human intestine (the intestinal microbiota) disrupt the normal microbiota-mediated mechanisms promoting immunological tolerance and consequently bias the immune system toward a state that promotes hypersensitivity disorders. Current research focuses on the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota influences immune system development and homeostasis, and potentially confers protection against immune dysregulation.--\n\n【11】A mutualistic bond\n------------------\n\n【12】The human intestine is a densely populated zone in the body harboring a diverse microbial community of 500--1,000 different bacterial species among other microbes such as archaea, eukarya, and viruses. The most striking illustration of the importance of the intestinal microbiota for mammalian immune development comes from studies conducted in germ-free (GF) mice, in which the lack of a microbiota results in reduced Peyer's patches, smaller germinal centers and fewer plasma cells, and increased susceptibility to pathogen invasion when compared to conventionally raised mice.-- Although GF murine models are valuable in mechanistic studies, they do have many caveats. To fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the relationship of the gut microbiota with atopic disease development, many different murine models, including GF, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated models, along with models supplemented with specific bacterial species, should be used. In addition, murine systems with a reconstituted human immune system would be even more valuable.\n\n【13】Specific bacterial species within the microbiota have been shown to induce expression of antimicrobial peptides (eg, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron induction of regenerating islet-derived 3γ expression by Paneth cells) and mucin production, which ultimately confers protection against pathogen invasion, and combined with regular stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, contributes to intestinal homeostasis.-- The presence of the microbiota can stimulate CD4^+^ T-cell proliferation, Th17 cell differentiation through the induction of IL-1β, and accumulation of colonic Tregs.-- The intestinal microbiota also metabolizes food components that are indigestible by mammalian enzymes, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and dietary fiber. This produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are essential energy sources for many host tissues and prominent immune modulators.-- There are many factors that likely contribute to the development of immune dysregulation: perturbations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota, caused by environmental factors such as antibiotic exposure, birth mode, or diet, are one potential explanation linking early life hygiene with the development of atopic and immune-mediated disorders .\n\n【14】The intestinal microbiota in atopic disease: human studies\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】A longitudinal study comparing the early life intestinal microbiota compositions of school-age asthmatic and non-asthmatic children showed that significant decreases in overall gut microbial diversity at 1 week and 1 month of age were correlated with asthma development at school age. Additionally, a recent characterization of the gut microbiota of 166 Canadian infants revealed an increased Enterobacteriaceae/Bacteroidaceae ratio in children sensitized to food allergens at 3 months and 1 year of age compared to non-sensitized children. Also, lower gut microbial richness was observed at 3 months of age only. Studies such as these suggest that therapeutic microbial intervention early in human life may be favorable, and highlight the need for animal studies in which experimentation to confirm causality is possible.\n\n【16】Many human studies lend support for the hygiene and microflora hypotheses by assessing the impact of early life environmental factors known to disturb the intestinal microbiota on atopic disease development later in life. For example, antibiotic usage in the first 2 years of life has been associated with the development of asthma at 7.5 years of age in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, antibiotic usage was reported to precede the manifestation of wheeze in the first 2 years of life in a questionnaire-based analysis of the KOALA (acronym in Dutch for \"Child, parents and health: lifestyle and genetic constitution\") Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands. Birth by Caesarean section was associated with lower total microbial diversity, delayed colonization with Bacteroidetes, and decreased Th1 responses in the first 2 years of life. Breastfeeding promotes colonization with commensal microbes such as Bifidobacteria spp. and provides the intestinal microbiota with necessary nutrients in the form of HMOs. Specific HMOs, short-chain galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) and long-chain fructooligosaccharides (FOSs), administered in the first 6 months of life have been shown to reduce the cumulative incidences of AD, recurrent wheezing, and allergic urticaria. In line with Strachan's original proposal, one study found that an increased number of older siblings was associated with decreased colonization with Clostridium difficile and Clostridium cluster 1, and a decreased risk of developing AD. Correlative human studies such as these shed light on the environmental factors that may be associated with atopic disease through manipulation of the intestinal microbiota; however, research regarding factors such as antibiotic exposure, breastfeeding, and birth mode remains controversial, and there are studies that suggest these factors have little or no effect on atopic disease development.-- Additional longitudinal human studies are necessary to determine which early life factors are most influential in promoting the intestinal dysbiosis associated with the development of immune hypersensitivities, and animal model research is a crucial complementary approach to elucidate the mechanisms behind these associations.\n\n【17】The intestinal microbiota in atopic disease: mouse models\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Murine model studies mechanistically support a link between the intestinal microbiota and atopic disorders through the experimental manipulation of microbiota compositions. In an OVA-driven model of asthma, Forsythe et al show that oral supplementation with live Lactobacillus reuteri reduced airway hyperresponsiveness as well as levels of TNFalpha, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, IL-5, and IL-13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while treatment with Lactobacillus salivarius had no effect. Intranasal supplementation of mice, polysensitized to birch and grass pollen allergens, with Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus paracasei at the time of sensitization resulted in reduced IgE-dependent basophil degranulation in response to allergen challenge. Only B. longum displayed protective effects when mice were supplemented prior to allergen sensitization. Additionally, oral supplementation of mice with B. longum protected against airway inflammation, increased Peyer's patch and splenic Tregs, and blocked serum IgE induction in OVA-sensitized animals.\n\n【19】More recent research focuses on the earliest time point at which gut microbial intervention must occur to prevent the onset of hypersensitivity disease. In an OVA-driven model of allergic inflammation, neonatal (but not adult) exposure of previously GF mice to a conventional microbiota reduced the severity of allergic inflammation characterized by decreased accumulation of invariant natural killer (NK) T-cells to the lung and reduced serum IgE levels and eosinophil frequencies in the BALF. Arnold et al show in OVA- and HDM-driven mouse models of allergic inflammation that oral infection of neonatal mice with H. pylori prior to OVA or HDM challenge resulted in the significant reduction of eosinophils in the BALF, and a decrease in IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine levels when compared to uninfected mice and infected adult mice. Russell et al found that perinatal vancomycin treatment of OVA-challenged mice alters gut microbial composition and exacerbates asthma-related immune responses, which may be driven by increased serum IgE levels and reduced Treg populations. Interestingly, perinatal treatment with streptomycin did not result in exacerbated disease after OVA challenge, but perinatally streptomycin-treated mice showed exaggerated lung inflammation when compared to untreated or vancomycin-treated mice in a Th1/Th17-driven model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This highlights the ability of altered microbiota compositions to differentially control disease severity depending on the immunological basis of the disease. Additional studies including human subjects and supporting mechanistic animal models are necessary to provide a holistic view of the role of the intestinal microbiota in atopic disease. Currently, there is also increasing evidence supporting a role of the intestinal microbiota and early life environmental exposures in other immune-mediated disorders. For the purpose of this review, we focus on IBD and T1D.\n\n【20】The hygiene and microflora hypotheses and immune-mediated disorders\n===================================================================\n\n【21】IBD\n---\n\n【22】IBD is an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both of which are highest in prevalence in North America and Europe. The presence of intestinal bacteria appears to be required for the development of experimental colitis, while the composition influences the severity of IBD. GF IL-10-deficient mice show no evidence of experimental colitis, while IL-10-deficient mice housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions spontaneously develop the disease. Additionally, antibiotics have been shown to attenuate the symptoms of experimental colitis.-- Exposure of SPF IL-10-deficient mice to antibiotics displays differential and localized roles of specific bacteria in mediating experimental colitis. For example, treatment of SPF IL-10-deficient mice with vancomycin--imipenem and metronidazole eliminated anaerobic bacteria and reduced colonic injury, while ciprofloxacin and vancomycin--imipenem decreased cecal inflammation and reduced the prevalence of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis.\n\n【23】Some human studies suggest that early life antibiotic exposure is associated with IBD.-- This discrepancy is likely because antibiotics in murine IBD experiments are typically given as treatment after disease onset, whereas human studies are often retrospective and assess the effects of antibiotic exposure prior to disease onset. In a nested case-control study, children diagnosed with IBD at approximately 8 years of age were 2.9 times more likely to have received antibiotics in the first year of life. Additionally, antibiotic exposure in the first 3 months of life was associated with childhood CD. Conversely, antibiotic combination therapy has been shown to be effective in treating UC in humans. Thus, effects after antibiotic exposure in humans are likely disease specific and/or dependent on when antibiotics are administered (ie, before or after disease onset).\n\n【24】Diet may also play an important role in IBD. Maternal secretory IgA (a component of breast milk) has been shown to alter the intestinal microbiota composition and the expression of genes associated with intestinal inflammation. Additionally, a systematic review negatively correlated breast milk exposure with the development of early onset IBD in humans, suggesting a protective effect of breastfeeding on IBD development.\n\n【25】Altogether, these results suggest that IBD is driven by the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is strongly influenced by early life environmental factors. Early life diet (breastfeeding) is likely protective against IBD development, while effects of antibiotic exposure are more complicated. If antibiotics are given in early life, they may result in an intestinal microbiota that promotes IBD development. However, after disease onset, antibiotics alleviate disease severity by shifting the prevalence of specific microbes that may be promoting the disease.--, Regardless, factors related to early life hygiene are involved in IBD development, and there is also evidence that the hygiene and microflora hypotheses are applicable to immune-mediated disorders not associated with the GI tract, such as T1D.--\n\n【26】T1D\n---\n\n【27】The prevalence of childhood T1D, an autoimmune disorder resulting from T-cell mediated destruction of beta cells in the pancreas, is steadily increasing worldwide, and developed countries such as Canada and the UK exhibit the highest incidences of the disease. Epidemiological evidence supports a link between environmental factors associated with the hygiene hypothesis and the onset of T1D. Having older siblings is negatively correlated with childhood onset T1D, suggesting a protective effect. Furred pet exposure seems to also play a role, as one study found in a birth cohort of 3,000 children: children exposed to an indoor dog were less likely to develop T1D than unexposed children. Breastfeeding has been associated with protection from T1D, and children born by Caesarean section exhibit a higher risk of T1D than children born vaginally.--\n\n【28】Lending support for the microflora hypothesis, a recent study compared the gut microbial compositions of children with T1D and healthy children and concluded that children with T1D showed a significant increase in Bacteroides spp. which was later reduced to that of controls after insulin treatment for 2 years. Oral administration of Lactobacillus johnsonii isolated from bio-breeding (BB) diabetes-resistant rats was shown to delay the onset of T1D in BB-diabetes prone rats. Additionally, MyD88-deficient NOD mice are protected from disease onset in SPF environments, and segmented filamentous bacteria have been reported to protect female NOD mice from disease development. Additionally, antibiotic therapy in mice has been shown to protect against virus-induced T1D through the alteration of intestinal microbiota composition. However, in humans the contribution of antibiotics to T1D development is currently unclear, as a population-based human cohort study found no association between T1D and antibiotic exposure in the first 8 years of life. Thus, similar to atopic disease and IBD, early life factors common to industrialized countries such as birth mode, diet, and antibiotic exposure seem to play a role in T1D development. However, additional mechanistic research is needed before significant conclusions regarding the gut microbial composition and immunological consequences can be made. The use of appropriate animal models will be critical in continuing to determine whether the relationship between microbiota composition and immune dysregulation is causal, or an effect of a dysregulated immune environment. Regardless, research related to the hygiene, old friends, and microflora hypotheses supports early life intervention as the primary therapeutic component for averting immune dysregulation in the form of atopic and immune-mediated disorders.\n\n【29】Future therapeutics\n===================\n\n【30】Future therapeutic options to prevent the development of immune dysregulation will likely involve the millions of micro- and macroorganisms living commensally or symbiotically (microbiota), or even parasitically (helminths) in the human body. In this section, we discuss potential helminth-based  and microbiota-based therapies  in the prevention of these disorders.\n\n【31】Helminth-based therapies\n------------------------\n\n【32】Clinical trials to date have focused on the use of live helminth infection as an ameliorative, rather than preventative, strategy due to the potential for diminished vaccine responsiveness in mice and humans infected with helminths early in life.-- The majority of early phase clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of live helminth infection have been conducted in CD and UC patients. Initial clinical trials using ova from the porcine whipworm, Trichuris suis, or larvae from the human hookworm, Necator americanus, have not yet found any cause for major safety concerns in IBD or asthma patients.-- T. suis ova administration seemed to reduce intestinal inflammation in a small number of CD and UC patients, and administration of N. americanus larvae to CD patients resulted in a nonsignificant improvement in intestinal inflammation scores.-- These initial clinical trials were promising, although follow-up studies with the inclusion of placebo control groups show mixed results.\n\n【33】Live helminth parasites release a suite of ES immunomodulatory products that likely mediate many of their suppressive effects in models of allergic disease and experimental colitis. In mice exposed to both OVA- and Alternaria alternata-driven asthma models, administration of ES material from the murine intestinal nematode, H. polygyrus (HES), was sufficient to suppress lung eosinophilia and histopathology in response to antigen challenge. HES appears to suppress lung inflammation when given at the point of antigen sensitization and antigen challenge, making it a promising therapeutic candidate. Soluble products from several different helminth parasites have also been shown to reduce measures of disease severity in murine models of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced and dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis and T1D.-- Administration of helminth ES products rather than live helminths has not yet begun in human patients, but evidence from murine models suggests that this is a promising approach for future clinical trials.\n\n【34】Researchers are beginning to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the potent immunoregulatory effects of these helminth products. ES products from N. americanus mediate the rapid proteolysis of eotaxin, an eosinophil chemoattractant, and HES can stimulate the induction of Tregs through a TGF-β-dependent pathway. Whether the administration of helminth products modifies the composition of the intestinal microbiota is not yet reported. However, infection of mice with live helminth parasites results in a marked disruption of intestinal microbiota composition, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effects following helminth infection could be due to an indirect modulation of the microbiota.-- The relative contribution of the microbiota or helminth-secreted products in ameliorating immune dysregulation remains to be determined. If microbiota compositional shifts following helminth infection are shown to have a direct role in disease modulation, future probiotic administration to drive the microbiota composition toward that seen during helminth infection may be a novel therapeutic approach.\n\n【35】Microbiota-based therapies\n--------------------------\n\n【36】Probiotics are live bacteria which, when administered, are beneficial to host health. Animal model research using probiotics shows their ability to ameliorate symptoms in atopic disease, IBD, and T1D.-- Additionally, probiotic administration in humans has been shown to protect against allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, AD, and UC.-- However, research thus far reveals many gaps in probiotic therapy, likely due to individualized disease phenotypes that may or may not be linked to the specific microbial species tested.-- Consequently, prebiotic and synbiotic therapeutics are also being explored.\n\n【37】Prebiotics are chemicals or food components (eg, inulin, pectin, GOSs, and FOSs), which are indigestible by pancreatic and intestinal enzymes, but are important in the growth and proliferation of intestinal microbiota. Prebiotic substances can induce the production of SCFAs by intestinal microbes, which have been shown to promote effector (Th1 and Th17) and anti-inflammatory IL-10-producing FoxP3^+^ and non-FoxP3^+^ T-cell differentiation. As such, they continue to be a promising microbe-based therapeutic option to modulate intestinal immune responses. Supplementation of mice with a mixture of short-chain GOS, long-chain GOS, and pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides prior to OVA challenge suppressed airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness compared to controls. Additionally, Trompette et al show that a high-fiber diet (diet supplemented with 30% pectin) metabolized by the gut microbiota increases the concentrations of circulating SCFAs and decreases allergic inflammation in the lungs of an HDM-driven model of allergic inflammation. In humans, prebiotic oligosaccharide formula supplementation in the first 6 months of life has been associated with decreased incidences of allergic manifestations until 2 years of age, supporting early life intervention in humans. Additionally, prebiotics have been implicated in protection from IBD development. Human leukocyte antigen-B27 transgenic (HLA-B27, TG) rats supplemented with FOS and inulin prior to disease onset showed decreased intestinal inflammation compared to untreated rats; however, FOS-treated rats compared to inulin-treated rats showed less intestinal inflammation, suggesting FOS as a more effective prebiotic treatment for spontaneous colitis. Conversely, FOS was not an effective treatment for CD, as patients receiving the treatment after 4 weeks exhibited higher GI symptoms compared to the placebo group, despite the reduced IL-6 and increased IL-10 production from lamina propria dendritic cells.\n\n【38】Synbiotic therapies involve supplementation with both pre- and probiotics. In a murine model for cow's milk allergy, mice fed the synbiotic mixture (GOS, FOS, and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V) showed increased galectin-9 expression by intestinal epithelial cells, which correlated with reduced acute skin reaction and mast cell degranulation. Similar results were measured in humans fed the synbiotic mixture, suggesting a mechanism by which this therapy may be effective in protecting against AD in humans. Conversely, a clinical trial using a similar synbiotic mixture, Immunofortis^®^, found no difference in AD severity in the synbiotic group versus the placebo group. However, this research group did later find in infants with AD that supplementation with this mixture for 12 weeks correlated with decreased prevalence of wheezing and asthma medication usage after 1 year. Synbiotics are also potential therapeutics for IBD. In a controlled pilot trial involving 18 patients with active UC, short-term synbiotic therapy combining B. longum and inulin-oligofructose significantly reduced chronic inflammatory biomarkers of the disease, including decreased TNFα and IL-1α levels.\n\n【39】The effects of early life factors such as diet and antibiotic exposure discussed throughout this review suggest that the application of live helmiths/helminth ES products, and pro-, pre-, and synbiotics prior to disease onset may be key in averting disease development, because interventions occurring later in life or after disease onset may be ineffective after the neonatal immune developmental window has closed. The timing of this developmental window could be driven by epigenetic alterations to specific, microbially regulated factors, such as the CXCL16 gene described by Olszak et al. In previously GF mice colonized neonatally with a conventional microbiota, the presence of a conventional microbiota decreased hypermethylation of CXCL16, which consequently decreased accumulation of invariant NK T-cells in the colon (this did not occur in previously GF mice colonized until they reached adulthood). This suggests that microbe-based therapeutics aimed at protecting against hyperinflammatory diseases are age-sensitive. Additionally, the incongruity of current research highlights the need for future microbiota-based treatments that are constructed as individualized therapeutics specific to the disease phenotype and microbiota of the affected patient.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【41】The progression of research since Strachan's 1989 proposal of the hygiene hypothesis exemplifies the scientific method in health research, progressing from observational theory to experimental therapy. The hygiene hypothesis has been expanded today to include commensal and symbiotic intestinal microbes, which are profoundly involved in human immune development, and parasitic helminths, which are also strong therapeutic candidates to protect against immune dysregulation. More research addressing the early life \"critical window\" for microbiota intervention, currently being assessed in mice for hypersensitivity diseases, is needed if researchers hope to use these therapeutics to prevent immune dysregulation in humans.-- Children undergo large shifts in their intestinal microbiota compositions throughout the first few months of life; thus, it may be possible in the near future to shift the gut microbial composition using pro-, pre-, and synbiotics toward a microbiota that promotes immune tolerance.\n\n【42】LT Stiemsma is supported by the University of British Columbia Four-Year Fellowship.
