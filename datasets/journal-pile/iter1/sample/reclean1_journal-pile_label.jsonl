A domino-like structural transition that is allosterically modulated by the target cell membrane.\nStaphylococcal alpha-toxin forms heptameric pores on eukaryotic cells.

Subsequently, the pre-pore transforms into the final pore by membrane insertion of an amphipathic beta-barrel, which comprises the \"central loop\" domains of all heptamer subunits. The process of membrane insertion was analyzed here using a set of functionally altered toxin mutants. The results show that insertion may be initiated within an individual protomer when its NH2 terminus activates its central loop. The activated state is then shared with the central loops of the residual heptamer subunits, which results in cooperative membrane penetration. This cooperation of the central loops commences while these are still remote from the lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, it is subject to modulation by the target membrane, which therefore acts across a distance much like an allosteric effector.

These 11 cases were characterized by EBV viremia (11 cases), recurrent upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media or sinusitis (10 cases), secondary neoplasia diseases (8 cases), reduction of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio (7 cases),and autoimmune thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia (2 cases). Conclusion: XMEN often manifests as male onset, recurrent upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media or sinusitis, EBV viremia, lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma, autoimmune diseases and reduction of CD4(+)/CD8 (+)T cell ratio. NKG2D expression in NK cells is significantly reduced, and gene sequencing analysis shows a pathogenic mutation in MAGT1 gene.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Suspicions were first raised in Vietnam when staff at a small private health care facility, Hospital A, in Hanoi began to fall ill after caring for a business traveler recently arrived from Hong Kong \\[\\]. This individual had been admitted to Hospital A on February 26^th^删除21:<u>(Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>, where he received care for 4 days in the general medical ward and 4 days in the intensive care unit. On March 5^th^, he was transferred to a facility in Hong Kong where he died one week later; he was subsequently confirmed to have SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. \\[\\].\n\n【2】Enhanced infection control practices, cohorting of patients, and increased use of barrier protections were initiated on March 6^th^, after it was recognized that a severe respiratory illness was affecting several staff members. There were no negative pressure rooms at the hospital. N95 respirators, goggles, and face shields were made available to staff on March 12^th^\\[Uyeki, personal communication\\]. Transmission of SARS-CoV among staff, visitors, and patients of Hospital A, and their close contacts outside the hospital, ultimately resulted in 62 cases of SARS in Northern Vietnam. Ninety percent of the 62 cases and all of the deaths (n = 6) occurred among individuals who visited or worked at Hospital A, which was temporarily closed on March 18^th^, 2003.\n\n【3】Hospital A is a small (\\<60 bed) private facility in Hanoi, providing inpatient specialist, laboratory, and nursing services. At the time of the outbreak, in addition to Vietnamese staff, several expatriate nurses and physicians were employed, often as clinical specialists on short-term contract from France. This report describes SARS-CoV secondary attack rates among the cohort of hospital staff at Hospital A and presents the results of a nested case-control study designed to identify risk-factors for SARS-CoV transmission after admission of the index patient. The primary objectives were to ascertain the extent of SARS-CoV transmission among the clinical and non-clinical staff at the hospital and to determine the nature of the initial exposures to the index patient that resulted in a substantial transmission event.\n\n【4】Methods\n=======\n\n【5】Cohort study population and enrollment\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】We conducted a survey of symptoms and exposures among the cohort of workers at Hospital A, and a nested case-control study to assess risk factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection after admission of the index case. For the latter study, only individuals who had worked at least one shift during the time the index patient was hospitalized were included 删除21:<u>(Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>.\n\n【7】During the outbreak, in the final two days that the hospital was open (March 17--18, 2003), investigators obtained a comprehensive list of hospital employees and held meetings with individual units (i.e. security, nursing, etc.) to recruit study participants. Upon providing written consent, participants were asked to complete a short, self-administered questionnaire and to provide a serum specimen for determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV. Questionnaires were translated into Vietnamese and responses were back-translated into English. Information was collected regarding the participant\\'s contact with the index patient during his stay in the hospital from February 26^th^(evening) to March 5th, as well as their symptoms from the time the index patient was admitted to the hospital until 10 days after he was transferred (\\~1.5 incubation periods \\[-\\]). Self-reported symptoms were checked against case investigation forms for 42 staff members. Participants were asked about whether they had ever engaged in a series of activities relating to exposure to the index patient. Questions were simplified in order to minimize translation errors, ensure that the activities would apply for multiple different staff job categories (e.g. nurse and security guard), and to facilitate self-administration.\n\n【8】All exposure variables were comprehensive for the period that the index patient was hospitalized at Hospital A. For example, did you enter the general ward, referred to whether or not the subject entered the general ward at least once at any time during the index patient\\'s hospitalization. Variables were not all exclusive. For example subjects were asked whether they ever came within 1 meter of the index patient, and whether they ever did so without a mask (respirator). Further information pertaining to the number and duration of potential encounters was not requested due to time constraints and concerns about recall bias.\n\n【9】A physician who provided care for SARS patients at Hospital A throughout the outbreak (this physician resided temporarily at the hospital while the outbreak was ongoing) served as a proxy respondent for the staff who had died (n = 6) or were too ill (n = 1) to respond at the time of the survey. This physician had assisted WHO investigators in conducting the initial staff interviews in early March following recognition of respiratory illnesses among staff. Work shift schedules were available for 30.0% of the Hospital staff and were used to verify staff responses. The protocol was approved following expedited review by the hospital institutional review board and the Vietnamese Ministry of Health.\n\n【10】Laboratory confirmation of cases\n--------------------------------\n\n【11】Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection was performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) and was based either on detection of RNA from SARS-CoV in clinical specimens (viareverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, RT-PCR), or by serology, as previously described \\[\\]. Case definitions and laboratory assays employed during the outbreak in Vietnam are described in detail elsewhere \\[\\].\n\n【12】Nested case-control study\n-------------------------\n\n【13】To determine which work-related activities may have been associated with contracting SARS-CoV infection after admission of the index case, a case-control study was performed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for study cases and controls are outlined in Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【14】Study cases were defined as persons having: (i) the presence of SARS-CoV antibody in at least one serum specimen collected prior to March 24^th^; or (ii) for SARS cases confirmed by means other that serologic testing (i.e. viral culture or RT-PCR), illness onset on or before March 5^th^, the last day the index patient received care at Hospital A. SARS Co-V infections resulting from exposure to the index patient were presumed to have resulted in antibody conversion on or before March 24^th^(18 days after the index patient\\'s discharge) based on a conservative estimated timeline that includes a 6 day incubation period plus a 12 day interval to seroconversion. The estimated 6 day incubation period is based on the observed median number of days from exposure to illness onset among persons in Vietnam who reported only a single potential exposure to a SARS patient (n = 28). The 12 day estimated interval to seroconversion is based on the observed median number of days from illness onset to SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion among cases in Vietnam for whom the date of seroconversion is known within 48 hours (n = 17). This time frame is expected to exclude individuals who contracted infection from someone other than the index, while capturing the majority of individuals who were infected during index case\\'s hospitalization in Hanoi, including a proportion of those who could have been infected on the last day of exposure to the index patient. The timing of illness onset alone was insufficient as a case selection criterion for the case-control study as this information was unavailable for many study enrollees.\n\n【15】Controls were defined as individuals within the study cohort who (i) were never identified as SARS cases, (ii) worked at least one shift during the time the index patient was hospitalized, and (iii) did not exhibit evidence of SARS-CoV specific antibodies within at least 18 days after last exposure to the index case.\n\n【16】Statistical analyses\n--------------------\n\n【17】Exposure and demographic variables used for analyses were dichotomous categorical; unknown or missing data was rendered as a negative response. Non-parametric tests (Fisher\\'s exact, Cochran\\'s Chi-square) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess differences between groups using negative responses as the referent. The threshold for statistical significance was established at a p-value\\< 0.05.\n\n【18】Advanced age (\\> 50 years) and underlying medical conditions were not significant correlates of case status in this outbreak \\[Uyeki, personal communication\\] and were therefore not included in the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).\n\n【19】Results\n=======\n\n【20】Survey of hospital workers\n--------------------------\n\n【21】A staff census prepared in February 2003, indicated that 193 individuals were employed at Hospital A at the time of the SARS outbreak. The distribution of personnel between clinical and non-clinical roles is shown in Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. Twenty-nine of the 36 SARS cases (81%) at Hospital A occurred among clinical personnel with direct patient care or ancillary clinical roles. Direct patient care activities included primary medical functions such as patient examination and diagnostic evaluation, performance of procedures, and conduct of ongoing care and monitoring. In addition, non-clinical personnel were affected as well, with 19% of cases (n = 7) occurring among housekeepers and other cleaning staff (n = 5), kitchen staff (n = 1), and receptionists (n = 1). Several of the affected housekeepers entered the index patient\\'s room on the night he was admitted to clean vomitus and respiratory secretions from the floor and walls, and various kitchen staff entered his room to deliver meals or collect service trays. Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> depicts the epidemiologic curve of SARS illness among Hospital A personnel.\n\n【22】Two peaks of illness onset among staff were evident, on March 4^th^, and 9 days later on the 13^th^删除21:<u>(Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. All but one of the non-clinical staff cases became ill during the first apparent wave of the outbreak, which encompassed the period the index patient was an inpatient at Hospital A. Housekeepers and certain members of the kitchen staff had access to the index patient\\'s room(s) during his stay, for purposes of cleaning and meal delivery. Overall, observed attack rates were highest among personnel with direct patient care responsibilities. Notably, however, nursing staff at Hospital A who were assigned to the operating Room (Op.Rm.)/intensive care unit (ICU) had significantly lower attack rates (7.1, p \\< 0.006) than did nurses in other staffing categories. Though mid-wives might not be anticipated under normal circumstances to have had opportunities for direct contact with the index patient, several women who had had complicated deliveries were hospitalized in the inpatient ward or ICU during the index patient\\'s stay; two briefly shared a room with him.\n\n【23】Staff enrollment\n----------------\n\n【24】Overall, 79% of Hospital A staff completed the exposure and symptom questionnaire, and 64% contributed at least one serum specimen. The lowest rates of participation in the exposure and symptom survey occurred among physicians and ICU nurses staffing categories (58.6%, 57.1%, respectively), but in both instances participation increased to over 64% for the serosurvey 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Staff work schedules were used, where possible, to independently verify a worker\\'s presence at Hospital A during the index patient\\'s hospitalization. A comparison between staff work schedules and worker responses is shown in Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. In general, there were fewer non-clinical staff than clinical staff participants in the serosurvey, but overall, serosurvey participation met or exceeded 50% in all but five staffing categories, these being, \\'kitchen\\', \\'dental\\', \\'laboratory\\', \\'administration\\', and \\'reception\\'.\n\n【25】The questionnaire was completed by proxy for seven individuals who had died or were too ill to complete the questions at the time of survey administration. Removal of these respondents from the study pool did not substantively affect study findings (shown below), therefore these responses were included analyses as appropriate.\n\n【26】Symptomatic illness among Hospital A staff\n------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Results of the survey regarding symptoms of illness experienced by study participants are summarized in Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【28】Consistent with findings from a clinical study of SARS patients conducted in Vietnam \\[\\], fever, fatigue, myalgia, chills, anorexia, headache, and cough were the most frequently reported symptoms experienced by SARS infected staff at Hospital A. These symptoms occurred in over half of SARS cases, and all occurred at levels significantly above those reported by employees without SARS-CoV infection. Dizziness, shortness of breath and vomiting were also reported at significantly higher frequencies among SARS cases than uninfected staff, but nevertheless were reported by = 40% of SARS cases. Only diarrhea, sore throat, and rash were not reported at higher frequencies among SARS cases than uninfected staff. The background occurrence of rash was low among all participants, but both sore throat and diarrhea occurred at appreciable background rates (19% and 20%, respectively) among staff not infected with SARS-CoV.\n\n【29】Serologic profiles of Hospital A employees\n------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Of the 124 Hospital A staff who participated in the serosurvey, 36 (29%) had at least one serum specimen that tested positive for the presence of antibody to SARS-CoV antigen 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Four Hospital A staff members with confirmed SARS-CoV infection did not complete the questionnaire or participate in the serosurvey. All 32 confirmed SARS cases that did participate in the survey tested positive for the presence of antibody to SARS-CoV antigen. Four additional, previously unrecognized, seropositive individuals were identified as a consequence of the serosurvey. Thus, 4 of the 36 initially identified SARS cases during the outbreak did not have serological confirmation, and they were replaced by the 4 additional, previously unrecognized, seropositive individuals identified as a consequence of the serosurvey (n = 36).\n\n【31】These 4 newly identified seropositive individuals (2 general ward nurses, 1 laundry worker, and 1 receptionist) had mild illness and were not identified during the outbreak despite active surveillance conducted among staff at Hospital A. Among this group, the 2 General Ward nurses reported having had at least three symptoms associated with SARS illness in this outbreak (the first reported fatigue, headache, and shortness of breath; the second also reported headache along with myalgia, chills, dizziness, anorexia, and vomiting), but neither reported having experienced fever or cough, which were inclusion criteria in the WHO SARS case definition used at the time. Both nurses also reported experiencing diarrhea during the study period. However, diarrhea was common among all Hospital A workers (23% of all reporting workers) regardless of SARS case status. Neither the laundry worker nor the receptionist reported having experienced symptoms significantly associated with SARS illness in Vietnam, with the exception that the latter reported vomiting.\n\n【32】Nested case-control study\n-------------------------\n\n【33】Twenty-two study cases and 45 controls were identified 删除21:<u>(Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. (Confirmed SARS cases not included in the study were excluded on the basis of illness onset date, date of seroconversion, or insufficient information to classify.)\n\n【34】Nearly all activities associated with physical proximity to the index patient or to his hospital rooms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV infection by univariate analysis 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. However, touching the index patient (with or without personal protective equipment in the form of gloves, gown, face mask) or speaking to him in his room, were not significantly associated with SARS-CoV infection. Having had a job that involved direct patient care or sanitation/kitchen duties was also not associated with SARS-CoV infection. Having a non-clinical staff position was nominally protective (O.R. = 0.2, p = 0.011) against SARS-CoV infection, as was having had an upper-respiratory infection (\\'head cold\\', O.R. = 0.2, p = 0.039) within the prior 6 months.\n\n【35】Multivariate analyses were not performed due to the limited size of the study population.\n\n【36】Discussion\n==========\n\n【37】SARS has been documented, under certain circumstances, to be highly communicable in hospital settings. Attack rates among workers with direct patient care roles have been observed as high as 10.0 and 11.8% in Canada and Hong Kong, respectively \\[,\\]. This study examined early events after the admission of a patient with SARS-CoV infection into a small hospital, at a time before the risks from unprotected exposure to SARS patients were fully appreciated. Our findings highlight the potential SARS transmission risks to hospital workers from potentially infectious surfaces and from proximity to a symptomatic patient.\n\n【38】During several other outbreaks, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV was suggested as an important route of transmission in hospitals and residential settings \\[-\\]. Our findings do not allow us to discriminate between potential transmission via large droplet versus dilute aerosols, although large scale transmission through a concentrated \\'plume\\' of virus seems less likely here, as proximity to the index patient was nearly universal among those who were infected. These findings have important implications for worker protection, as many different categories of workers perform activities that may bring them into proximity with a SARS-CoV infected individual.\n\n【39】Overall, we found that hospital workers who had greatest opportunity for proximity to the index patient were clinical staff, and among clinical staff, those with direct patient care duties experienced the highest attack rates and death rates among all categories of Hospital A workers. When Hospital A closed during the SARS outbreak, a second hospital (Hospital B) was designated to care for suspect SARS cases. There were no SARS cases among staff at Hospital B, and a serosurvey conducted among workers at the facility revealed no inapparent or asymptomatic infections despite the presence of numerous confirmed SARS cases in the wards \\[\\]. The reasons for the disparity in infection rates among staff between Hospitals A and B is unclear, but comparing outcomes between the two hospitals in general supports the importance of enhanced infection control measures, barrier protections, and patient isolation, as control measures within hospitals.\n\n【40】A previous study of clinical workers at Hospital A suggested that the proportion of doctors and nurses using masks as a precautionary measure increased significantly after the initiation of secondary cases and that the use of masks had a significant impact on diminishing SARS-CoV transmission \\[\\]. The potential benefits of enhanced infection control practices and barrier protections are also in evidence when looking at differences among workers at Hospital A who provided direct patient care. Among nurses at Hospital A, those who administered clinical care to critically ill or post-operative patients (Op.Rm./ICU nurses) experienced the lowest attack rates among all nursing categories, and though few (3 of 8) reported having engaged in any of the activities identified as being associated with risk for SARS-CoV infection 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>, it is possible that the lower overall attack rate for this group of nurses reflects the fact that routine infection control precautions employed by Op.Rm./ICU to protect vulnerable patients in the ICU also provided these nurses with protection against exposure to SARS-CoV. Studies from other SARS outbreaks have shown that nurses charged with providing intensive care to patients experienced relatively fewer instances of SARS-CoV infection \\[\\], unless assisting with a high risk procedure such as an endotrachael intubation \\[,\\].\n\n【41】During the course of this study, four workers, none of whom had been previously identified as cases, were found to have been infected with SARS-CoV. None of the four reported having had cough or fever, but two complained of diarrhea and another had a sore throat. A similar study conducted among health care workers in Singapore, revealed serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection in two workers (of 112 exposed individuals) who experienced only mild symptoms of illness \\[\\]. Both of these individuals had had fever and multiple systemic or upper respiratory symptoms, but neither developed pneumonia. Together, these reports and observations suggest that SARS-CoV infection can manifest with relatively mild symptoms, which can be easily masked against a background of unrelated illnesses in the community. The epidemiologic significance of mild (or asymptomatic) infections remains unclear however, and in this instance it is not known whether any of the four serologically positive individuals without pneumonia transmitted SARS-CoV to their contacts.\n\n【42】There were several limitations to this study. The first is the small sample size employed for the nested case-control, which contributed to a general lack of precision in measures of effect (odds ratios), and precluded our ability to look for independent risk factors through multivariate analyses. In addition, because of the need to minimize the complexity of the questionnaire, we were unable to assess either the duration, or the intensity of potential exposures, both of which are likely to be important modifiers of absolute risk. However, our streamlined approach using generalized questions allowed us to rapidly survey a large fraction of the hospital worker population, rather than just medical professionals. Finally, there were several potential sources of bias in this study which could have affected our results and conclusions. Although we performed the study prior to closure of the hospital, while the staff were still actively engaged in the outbreak investigation, we failed to achieve full staff participation, particularly among physicians and certain categories of nurses. This could have introduced a selection bias favoring enrollment of persons with less opportunity for direct contact with the index patient. Similarly, we questioned individuals about their exposure to the index patient 13 days after he was transferred to Hong Kong, and used a proxy to complete exposure questionnaires for deceased individual. Either of these could have introduced non-systematic information (recall) bias to our findings. We attempted to minimize the influence of these potential sources of bias by using case investigation forms and physician notes to verify self-reported information when ever possible.\n\n【43】Many of the job-related activities identified in this study as potential risk factors for SARS-CoV infection, such as entering the patient\\'s room, and touching a visibly contaminated surface relate to \\'proximity\\' contacts and possibly fomite involvement. These types of contact are broadly applicable to many different job categories from receptionist to physician, implying that our concept of occupational categories at risk for nosocomial infection may need to be broadened to include many different kinds of workers without direct patient care duties \\[,\\].\n\n【44】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【45】The outbreak of SARS in northern Vietnam investigated here serves as a tragic reminder of the profound impact that the introduction of a highly communicable, virulent pathogen can have on the relatively closed community of a small hospital. In such instances, very early events following introduction can be pivotal in determining the ultimate magnitude of the outbreak and the degree of spread within the hospital. Appropriate recognition of those at highest risk of exposure and illness in conjunction with rapid, accurate identification of potential cases at the earliest stages of illness, are vital to minimizing the extent of spread. The results of this investigation highlight the diversity of workers at risk for nosocomial exposures and contribute to our understanding of risk factors for SARS-CoV transmission, which may include being in proximity to an infected patient or touching a contaminated surface.\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests\n===================</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors\\' contributions\n=======================</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Determining the actions of distinct TGF-beta isoforms and their inhibitors during early corneal wound healing is an essential step in guiding therapeutic intervention. Bovine serum-free corneal cell and wounded organ cultures were challenged with a range of concentrations of TGF-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3; IL-10; and neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against TGF-beta1 (CAT-192) or -beta2, (CAT-152). Cultures were assessed for re-epithelialization, proliferation (cell counts and cresyl violet assay), morphology (histologic examination), repopulation of the area under the wound, and myofibroblast transformation (alpha-smooth muscle actin) between 0 and 5 days. TGF-beta1 delayed re-epithelialization, increased repopulation of the stroma, increased keratocyte proliferation and was the only isoform to promote myofibroblast differentiation. The anti-TGF-beta1 mAb, CAT-192 promoted re-epithelialization and reduced repopulation of the stroma. Exogenous TGF-beta3 had little effect on re-epithelialization but reduced repopulation of the stroma. IL-10 promoted corneal re-epithelialization at low doses but inhibited this response at high doses. Stromal repopulation was prevented by all doses of IL-10. TGF-beta2 or the anti-TGF-beta2 mAb, CAT-152 had little effect on any repair parameter. The results confirm TGF-beta1 as the principal isoform in corneal wound healing and suggest that inhibition of the action of TGF-beta1 can promote corneal wound healing. Treatment with the anti-TGF-beta1 mAb CAT-192 accelerates corneal re-epithelialization but reduces cell repopulation of the stroma. The cytokines TGF-beta3 and IL-10 have opposing actions to that of TGF-beta1.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Similarly isolates that use the CXCR4 co-receptor are classified as X4 tropic viruses. Certain viruses use both co-receptors to enter the host cell and are referred as dual/mixed tropic viruses or R5X4 viruses. The use of both co-receptors may be due to the presence of either dual clones or a mixture of pure R5 and X4 virus clones or both in the viral population in a given sample .\n\n【3】At the present time CCR5 antagonists are the only widely available entry inhibitors. In clinical practice, they have been proven to be effective in patients harboring exclusively R5-tropic viruses and may not be effective against X4-tropic or dual/mixed HIV-1 strains --. Therefore, determining tropism of the patient\\'s HIV strain is necessary prior to using CCR5 antagonists in HIV treatment regimens. HIV-1 tropism can be evaluated either by cell-based phenotypic assays or predicted by nucleotide sequence-based genotypic methods. Although phenotypic assays are the most reliable means to assess HIV-1 tropism, they are expensive, laborious and require special facilities and expertise. Thus, genotypic methods have been proposed as an alternative as they are less time consuming and expensive. Genotypic methods are based on analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the V3 region of the gp120 envelope protein. Genotypic prediction of tropism relies on bioinformatics algorithms and/or characteristics of the V3 sequence such as positive charges at positions 11 and/or 25, global net charge and the loss of potential N-linked glycosylation sites --. Paired genotypic/phenotypic data generated from comparative studies have led to the validation of genotypic approaches in predicting tropism of HIV-1 subtype B . However, the utility for non-B subtypes remains uncertain due to the lack of sufficient datasets. In addition, accurate prediction of tropism of non-B strains is complicated by the high genetic variability within the V3 region ,\n\n【4】Cameroon, a country in West Central Africa where multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) have been reported, hosts broad HIV-1 genetic diversity --. Regional co-circulation of divergent HIV-1 variants has an impact on the global HIV-1pandemic. Non B subtypes and CRFs were originally identified in West Central Africa and increased global travel and immigration have contributed to their spread. These diverse non B subtypes and CRFs are responsible for about 90% of current HIV-1 infections worldwide , Indeed, increasing cases of HIV-1 infection with non-B subtypes have been reported in Europe and North-America --. According to Brennan et al, group M infections account for 97.3% of HIV-1 cases in Cameroon and more than 99% of them are due to non-B subtypes . In Cameroon, as in many other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, introduction of CCR5 antagonists into clinical practice is anticipated in the future. To facilitate their appropriate incorporation into antiretroviral treatment, there is an urgent need to investigate the tropism of diverse HIV-1 strains and the use of genotypic methods to predict their tropism accurately. Countries in West Central Africa such as Cameroon may benefit from using genotypic methods as they are less labor-intensive and potentially more cost-effective. Considering that co-circulation of multiple HIV-1 subtypes may present a major challenge for tropism determination in this region, it is important to address the suitability of genotypic tools to predict tropism of HIV-1 strains circulating in this region of Africa.\n\n【5】The primary aim of this study was to assess the ability of genotypic methods to predict co-receptor usage of HIV-1 variants circulating in Cameroon.\n\n【6】Material and Methods 删除19:<u>{#s2}</u>\n====================\n\n【7】Ethics statement 删除19:<u>{#s2a}</u>\n----------------\n\n【8】The study was approved a FDA Institutional Review Board, the US HHS/Food and Drug Administration Research in Human Subjects Committee and the exempt reference number is 01-044B. Specimens used had all been previously obtained for another purpose and were de-identified for the purpose of this study.\n\n【9】Samples specimens 删除19:<u>{#s2b}</u>\n-----------------\n\n【10】Paired PBMC and plasma specimens from HIV-1 infected patients from urban areas in Cameroon were analyzed. Paired specimens were collected at the same time point for each patient. Overall, the median age of the study population was 27 (IQR: 10, 35) and 59% were female.\n\n【11】Culture of Primary HIV-1 isolates 删除19:<u>{#s2c}</u>\n---------------------------------\n\n【12】Primary HIV-1 isolates were obtained by co-cultivation of patient PBMCs with PHA-stimulated PBMCs from HIV-1 negative healthy donors as previously described .The growth of virus was monitored using a p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Perkin Elmer (Cat No: NEK050B) performed according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Culture supernatants of co-cultures that were identified as positive for HIV by p24 antigen ELISA were retested to confirm the amounts of antigen, and virus cultures were harvested and stored at −70°C until further use.\n\n【13】Phenotypic characterization of co-receptor usage 删除19:<u>{#s2d}</u>\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Phenotypic characterization of co-receptor usage was determined by infecting GHOST cells that expressed either CD4 alone (parental) or CD4 along with either CCR5 or CXCR4. Briefly, GHOST-CCR5, GHOST-CXCR4 and parental GHOST cells were seeded in 24-well plates with 2.5×10^4^ cells per well in 1 mL of Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS). After 24 hours, the medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing the primary isolate (5 ng of p24 antigen). After 2 hours of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO2, virus containing media was removed and fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS with antibiotics. Positive and negative control viruses for each co-receptor were included in the assay. After 4 to 7 days of infection, GFP expression was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Culture supernatants were harvested at days 7 and HIV replication was determined by measuring p24 antigen levels using the Perkin Elmer kit.\n\n【15】RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification 删除19:<u>{#s2e}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Isolation of viral RNA from plasma specimens was performed by using Virus QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturers\\' instructions. cDNA was obtained by using Superscript III First-strand synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen 18080-051) in a 20 µl volume with in-house primers that have been previously published . Amplification was performed by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) with ready-to-use Master Mix from Promega (Promega, Madison, WI, USA cat M7505). Each run was performed in a 30 µl PCR mixture which included 0.4 µM of each outer (forward HXB2 coordinate 6203--6224 and reverse primer HXB2 coordinate 7514--7531) and an inner primer (forward HXB2 coordinate 6322--6350) previously published . PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles (94°C, 30 s; 55°C, 30 s; 68°C, 80 s) and a final extension step at 68°C for 10 min. Each 1.2 kb amplicon was purified using the ExoSAP-IT (USB, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, cat 78200). After purification, samples were sequenced by the DNA sequencing core facility of CBER/FDA.\n\n【17】Phylogenetic analysis 删除19:<u>{#s2f}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【18】All retrieved sequences were loaded and assembled into vector NTI advance 11 software (Invitrogen) to generate contigs. Sequences were aligned with identical regions of reference sequences of known HIV-1 group M (sub-) Subtypes/CRFs 2013 reference sequences from the Los Alamos database 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html>)</u> using CLUSTALW  Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 5  and trees were constructed from the generated sequences by the neighbor-joining method. Clustering of sequences with a bootstrap value of more than 70% was used to determine the HIV-1 subtype.\n\n【19】Genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism 删除19:<u>{#s2g}</u>\n-------------------------------------\n\n【20】Genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism was based on the env-V3 loop amino acid sequences retrieved from the translation of nucleotide sequences into their protein equivalent using Transeq . CCR5 (R5-tropic) and CXCR4 (X4-tropic) genotype were identified by using bioinformatics algorithms Geno2pheno (G2P) 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://co-receptor.bioinf.mpisb.mpg.de/cgi-bin/co-receptor>)</u> and WebPSSM 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://ubik.microbiol.washington.edu/computing/pssm/>)</u>. Predictions by Geno2pheno were done with false positive rates (FPR) chosen at 5% (G2P-FPR5), 10% (G2P-FPR10) and 15% (G2P-FPR15). Predictions with WebPSSM were done by using the two subtype B matrices (PSSMsinsi and PSSM~X4R5~). Tropism prediction was performed either by applying rules separately or in combination. This included a) the 11/25 rule (11/25) for which positively charged amino acids (R or K) at either position 11 and 25 of the V3 region are required to predict an X4-tropic virus and b) the net charge rule for which a global net charge of the V3 ≥5 to predict an X4-tropic virus. The net charge of the V3 sequence was determined using the peptide-property calculator from Innovagen 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://www.innovagen.se>)</u>.\n\n【21】The other approaches were a) - the Delobel rule for which one of the following criteria should be met for predicting X4-tropic virus: 11 R/K and/or 25K; 25R and a net charge ≥ +5; or a net charge ≥ +6  and b) the Garrido rule which predicts X4-tropic if any of the 11/25 or Net charge rules classified it as X4 .\n\n【22】Statistical analysis 删除19:<u>{#s2h}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【23】In this study, the phenotypic GHOST cell assay was taken as the reference test to determine viral tropism. Specificity rate for R5 prediction was obtained from the ratio of samples predicted as CCR5 of the total CCR5 tropic samples in GHOST cell assay. Sensitivity rate for X4 prediction was obtained from the ratio of samples predicted as X4 over the total CXCR4 using samples in the GHOST cell assay.\n\n【24】Results 删除19:<u>{#s3}</u>\n=======\n\n【25】Phenotypic characterization of co-receptor usage 删除19:<u>{#s3a}</u>\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Of the 95 PBMC samples selected for this study, GHOST cell infectivity could be successfully performed for 62 isolated viruses (65.26%). The failure of virus isolation and expansion of the remaining samples was likely due to the unavailability of sufficient viable HIV-1 infected cells in the sample. Our experiments revealed that 49 (79.03%) virus isolates were able to infect GHOST cells expressing CCR5 co-receptor, while 8 (13%) infected GHOST cells expressing CXCR4 co-receptor exclusively. Five of the 62 (8%) viruses were able to infect cells that expressed both CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors.\n\n【27】Phylogenetic analysis 删除19:<u>{#s3b}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【28】In the matched plasma samples, partial env sequences were successfully obtained for 55 (88.7%) out of the 62 phenotyped specimens. Overall, within the 55 sequences generated, 7 HIV-1 subtypes were identified. The genetic classification of these subtypes is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Briefly, 41 (74.5%) of the samples analyzed were from patients infected with subtype CRF02_AG and 14 (25.5%) from patients infected with non-CRF02_AG strains (distributed as follows: 5 CRF22_01A1 (9.1%), 2 F2 (3.6%), 2 A1 (3.6%), 2 G (3.9%), 2 D (3.6%) and 1 CRF11_cpx (1.8%)).\n\n【29】![Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 partial env region genome sequence.\\\nAnalysis was performed using the neighbor-joining methods in Mega 5 program.

Failure of amplification and/or sequencing of the remaining samples (11.3%) were probably due to the high genetic variability within the envelope region. As genotypic approaches do not discriminate viruses using exclusively CXCR4 co-receptor (X4-exclusive) from R5X4 viruses, they were both predicted as X4-tropic viruses. Genotypic prediction of co-receptor usage is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 2A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Briefly, using G2P, according to the specific FPR criteria, the range of R5-tropic viruses was between 76.4% and 89.1%; while X4-tropic viruses were predicted in 6 (10.9%) to 13 (23.6%) samples of the 55 analyzed. With PSSM, depending on the matrix used, R5 tropism was assigned in 45 (81.8%) to 47 (85.5%) of the 55 samples. By using predictive rules based on the presence of a basic amino-acid residue at position 11 and/or 25 or the net charge of the V3 region, R5- tropic virus was predicted in 48/55 (87.3%) and 51/55 (92.7%) samples, respectively. According to the net charge, only 4/55 (7.3%) of the samples had an X4-tropic virus. The proportion of samples predicted to harbor an R5-tropic virus was 83.6% with the Garrido rule and 90.9% with the Delobel rule (通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 2A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【32】![Prediction of HIV-1 co-receptor usage by using genotypic methods.\\\n(A) Prediction was assessed for the total number of samples.

However, the proportion of viruses predicted to be X4-tropic was almost two times higher within non CRF02_AG subtype compared with CRF02_AG. The 11/25 rule was the only method which predicted higher rates of X4 tropism among samples harboring CRF02_AG (通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 2B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【34】Correlation between phenotypic and genotypic predictions of co-receptor usage 删除19:<u>{#s3d}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Next we measured phenotypic predictions for matched PBMC viruses of a set of patient plasma specimens. Paired phenotypic and genotypic results were available for 55 samples. Of these, 43 (78.2%) were shown to harbor viruses with an exclusive CCR5 phenotype, five (9.1%) harbored a dual/mixed virus population and seven samples (12.7%) were infected with a virus using exclusively CXCR4 co-receptor (X4-exclusive). Of the 55 samples, 41 were from patients infected with HIV-1 CRF02_AG. Among them, 31 (76%) of the virus population showed an R5 phenotype, while the X4 and R5X4 phenotypes were present at the same rate of 12% (通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Dual/mixed tropic viruses were mostly (4/5) reported as R5-tropic viruses with predictive tools.\n\n【36】![Alignment of V3 sequences from HIV-1 infected plasma from Cameroon.\\\nPredictions by different algorithms were compared with phenotype characterization.

Specificity rates of genotypic methods varied between 83.7% and 97.7%. Sensitivity to predict X4-tropic viruses was fairly low, ranging from 33.3% to 50%. Sensitivity of each method generally increased when R5/X4 viruses were excluded from the analysis, except for the 11/25 rule ([table 1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). G2P-FPR5, net charge and Delobel\\'s rule displayed a specificity over 95% with a sensitivity up to 42.9%, when dual/mixed were excluded. G2P-FPR15 and Garrido\\'s rule were the most sensitive tools, with a sensitivity of 50% in predicting X4-tropic and 57% in predicting X4-exclusive. However, in comparison to G2P_FPR15, performance of Garrido\\'s rule was better in terms of specificity (93% vs 84%). With regard to HIV-1 subtype, for 7/9 predictive tools specificity for predicting R5-tropic virus was comparable for both CRF02_AG (87% to 100%) and non-CRF02_AG (83% to 100%) subtypes. However, decreased specificity from more than 85% in CRF02_AG subtypes to 75% for non-CRF02_AG subtypes was observed with G2P_FPR10 and G2P_FPR15. In contrast, prediction of X4-exclusive viruses, was about two times less sensitive for CRF02_AG compared with non-CRF02_AG viruses (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【38】10.1371/journal.pone.0112434.t001\n\n【39】###### Performance of Genotypic approaches to predict tropism of HIV-1 strains circulating in Cameroon.\n\n【40】删除20:<u>![]</u>删除18:<u>(pone.0112434.t001)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone-0112434-t001-1}</u>\n\n【41】                     All virus populations (n = 55)   CRF02_AG subtype (n = 41)   Non CRF02_AG subtypes (n = 14)                                \n  ----------------- -------------------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------------- ------- ------ ------ ------- -------\n  G2P (FPR5)                      95.3                          33.3                           42.9                100.0   20.0   20.0   83.3    100.0\n  G2P (FPR10)                     86.0                          41.7                           57.1                90.3    30.0   40.0   75.0    100.0\n  G2P (FPR15)                     83.7                          50.0                           57.1                87.1    40.0   40.0   75.0    100.0\n  PSSMSINSI                       93.0                          41.7                           42.9                93.5    30.0   20.0   91.7    100.0\n  PSSMX4R5                       86.05                          33.3                           42.9                87.1    20.0   20.0   83.3    100.0\n  Position 11/25                  93.0                          33.3                           28.6                90.3    30.0   20.0   100.0   50.0\n  Net charge                      97.7                          25.0                           42.9                96.8    10.0   20.0   100.0   100.0\n  Delobel\\'s rule                 97.7                          33.3                           42.9                93.7    11.1   20.0   100.0   100.0\n  Garrido\\'s rule                 93.0                          50.0                           57.1                93.0    40.0   40.0   100.0   100.0\n\n【42】FPR; false positive rate.

However, it was comparable to the partial env based prevalence of 72.3% reported in blood donor in Cameroon . 9.1% of the sequences analyzed were assigned to CFR22_01A1. This was higher than the 5.5% or 6.6% respectively reported in rural population and blood donors , In our sample set, subtypes A, G, F2 and the recombinant form CRF11_cpx were also present with a rate comparable to those reported in previous studies (ranging from 2 to 4%). Several reports of HIV-1 epidemiology have shown differences in prevalence of strains co-circulating in Cameroon. These differences were mainly related to the sample population and/or to the viral region analyzed. Nevertheless, most of them have shown a high genetic diversity of HIV-1 in this country. Although our study was not designed to describe prevalence of HIV-1 strains in Cameroon, the diversity highlighted here confirms the complexity of HIV-1 epidemic and its dynamic throughout the population. It is well known that HIV-1 genetic diversity has a profound impact on many aspects of the pandemic including diagnostics, vaccine development and response to antiretroviral therapy. The future prospect of including CCR5 antagonists as a treatment option for management of HIV-1 infection in Sub-Saharan countries raises concern about the reliability of laboratory methods used to determine tropism of non-B subtypes and CRFs.\n\n【45】In this study, we have shown that genotypic methods were highly specific in predicting R5-tropic variants. There was no significant difference in specificity of most genotypic methods for CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG strains. Our results were consistent with previous studies reporting specificity of over 80% in non-B subtypes and CRFs , Along with specificity, sensitivity of a test to detect X4-tropic viruses is important in clinical settings. Indeed, it has been shown that patients undergoing therapy with CCR5 antagonists may experience virological failure due to the pre-existence of X4-tropic variants --. In our study, sensitivity of CRF02_AG virus populations was extremely low compared to other circulating viruses. Using WebPSSM, the observed sensitivity was no greater than 30% among CRF02_AG strains. This rate was lower than the 70% reported by Raymond et al. but comparable to those reported by Esbjornsson et al. Although sensitivity rates found in our study were slightly lower than those previously reported, our results were in agreement with the fact that Geno2pheno failed to detect most non-B subtype X4-tropic viruses , The sensitivity of predictive tools was not significantly improved (25% to 33%) by using new simple rules such as 11/25 or net charge. However, it was enhanced to 50% when they were combined with the Garrido rule. This result was lower than the 58% reported by Seclen et al. However, sensitivity rates in non-B subtypes of genotypic approaches seem to vary between studies of HIV-1 non-B subtypes , This lack of consistency highlights the need for further studies including testing a larger number of samples using both genotypic and phenotypic methods for paired comparative to assess performance of genotypic assays. In our dataset, we observed that R5X4 virus populations were mostly misclassified as R5-tropic variants by genotypic approaches. This finding could be attributed to the high variability of the V3 loop and to the presence of minority X4-tropic variants. In summary, genotypic methods performed relatively well overall in predicting R5-tropic viruses of clinical isolates regardless of HIV-1 subtype. But, sensitivity of these methods for prediction of diverse HIV-1 strains needs to be improved. In our study, with a specificity of 93% and a sensitivity of 50%, the Garrido\\'s rule provide the most optimal balance between specificity and sensitivity for predicting R5 or X4 tropism of HIV-1 strains circulating in Cameroon. It has been demonstrated that HIV infection involving the CXCR4 co-receptor requires CXCR4-associated sequences in the V3 region in combination with other determinants in the gp120 region --. In this context, sequences outside the V3 region which have also been shown to be involved in viral tropism may be worthy of consideration for inclusion into these algorithms in order to improve accuracy of tropism predictive tools.\n\n【46】It should be noted that our findings were obtained using a limited sample size of representative diverse strains and testing a larger number of specimens in this region may be needed to provide more accurate and reliable information about the use of prediction tools for HIV tropism determination of highly diverse HIV-1 strains.\n\n【47】Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#s5}</u>\n===========\n\n【48】In light of the emerging and ongoing genetic diversity of HIV in the global AIDS pandemic, optimization of new antiretroviral regimens involving CCR5 antagonists is important. Therefore, evaluation of genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism should also include non-B subtypes and CRFs as they are co-circulate in some settings. Our study findings suggest that currently available genotypic methods based on V3 sequence need further optimization for their use with highly diverse strains to accurately predict tropism.\n\n【49】The authors would like to thank Dr Vittorio Collizzi for his instruction; Dr. Owen Wood for technical support; Dr Xue Wang and Dr Krishnakumar Devadas for review of this manuscript.

{"seq_id": "a43fba9c-c6a5-404f-b215-d8cc0ed61d39", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】Despite recent medical advances a large number of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) continue to suffer from long term consequences (). There have been many longitudinal studies of TBI patients . TBI can cause lasting physical and mental difficulties (, ) often with hidden psychological, cognitive, and behavioral problems (; ). These problems can have a serious impact on the quality of life not only of the TBI individuals but also of their families (; ). Although initial severity of brain injury is an important prognostic factor for the long term outcome, many recent studies have highlighted the influence of psychosocial and many demographic variables on the outcome of the TBI (; ).\n\n【2】The influence of cognitive factors in the overall functional outcome following the TBI has been emphasized in recent studies by , The authors found that neurocognitive deficits showed a stronger association with functional outcome than emotional and behavioral difficulties among 87 patients with moderate to severe TBI (). Within the neurocognitive deficits and frontal lobe deficits, particularly manifested through impaired speed of information processing, was a more important prognostic factor for social and occupational functioning than verbal memory problem for example (). Similarly, the role of emotional adjustment as a coping strategy to improve psychosocial rehabilitation following the TBI was emphasized in a recent study by .\n\n【3】Despite the prominence of behavioral and emotional problems in the post-acute stage of the TBI, proper assessment scales for these domains in the post-acute stage are lacking. The neurobehavioral scale devised by  has been validated among TBI individuals but does not distinguish between psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions and neurobehavioral symptoms such as lack of motivation. Similarly, the neuro-psychiatric inventory (NPI) (), which is designed for patients with neurodegenerative disorders, also combines items of psychiatric symptoms with behavioral and emotional symptoms. Delusions and hallucinations can arise from a brain injury but they could also be the manifestation of a psychiatric disorder which may be associated with the brain injury at all ages (). It is therefore necessary to carry out a full psychiatric diagnostic assessment of the brain-injured patients in order to differentiate between the two because the treatment will depend on the exact cause of these symptoms. Also both these scales measure symptoms but not the level of handicap which is a more relevant measure of outcome at the post acute stage of rehabilitation.\n\n【4】Previous measures have not addressed the specific subjective experiences of the TBI individuals and their families. Studies reporting on the correspondence between the patient and the carer reports have found that there are discrepancies between self and other reports.  found that, when administering the European Brain Injury Questionnaire (EBIQ), carers generally reported greater problems particularly when the items related to attitudes and behaviors. This was in comparison to self and other reports of a nonbrain-injured control group, who revealed no such pattern of differences (). On the other hand, carers may not be able to report on the inner emotional feelings of the patients; therefore both patient and carer reporting will be desirable for a holistic assessment.\n\n【5】Outcome measurement is essential for identifying areas of difficulty, planning interventions, and assessing the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes (), and establishing sound psychometric properties of any instrument is essential to the potential utility in clinical or research practice (). There are a number of measures which are used to assess outcome in TBI, but few are considered to be fully established or validated for measuring post-acute outcome (; ). The psychometric properties of many of the existing scales are poor or have not been properly assessed (; ).\n\n【6】The World Health Organization (WHO)'s International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) model (, ) provides an important framework for the development of post-acute measures in TBI. The terms 'disabilities' and 'handicaps' are now referred to as 'activities' and 'participation' respectively (, ). Most outcome measures tend to focus on measuring disability and impairment, as they are perceived as easier concepts to define and measure in comparison with the concept of participation (). Participation focuses more on the difficulties that an individual encounters in relation to their social context following from their injury () and concentrates more on the individual's own perspective of their injury. In post-acute rehabilitation, the recovery or change of the individual is slower and less dramatic, and thus outcome measures which have been developed for acute settings are often insensitive to gradual change (), due to their apparent ceiling effects (). The main focus of rehabilitation at this stage is upon the individual's psychosocial adjustment, specifically reducing obstacles to community reintegration due to behavioral, emotional, and cognitive difficulties ().\n\n【7】Despite the existence of a plethora of outcome measures following TBI, it has been argued that there is a lack of established or well validated instruments to measure post-acute outcome in this population (; ). The psychometric properties of many of the existing scales are poor or have not been properly assessed (; ). At present most available outcome measures used in this population are devised by professionals with little or no input from the TBI individuals and their families. One notable exception is the Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory (NFI) (). Although the authors used patient and carer interviews along with other methods for gathering information for the questionnaire items, it is unlikely that they analyzed interview data using a structured standardized method of qualitative data analysis.\n\n【8】Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a post-acute outcome measure with items generated from the TBI individuals' and their families' own accounts of the consequences of the TBI with particular emphasis on producing a neurobehavioral scale. The reasons for developing our scale are: (a) there are not many scales available that could be used to assess progress at the post-acute stage of recovery from the TBI; (b) most existing scales measure symptoms rather than the level of participation; (c) most existing scales are devised by professionals with minimum input from patients and their carers; (d) as far as we know no scale used structured and standardized qualitative method of analysis of patient and carer interview data in order to develop questionnaire items; (e) most existing scales for use at the post-acute stage either do not report on their full psychometric properties or do not have good psychometric properties or recruited an inadequate number of patients to assess their psychometric properties ; (f) most post-acute scales do not emphasize the neurobehavioral outcome following the TBI; and (g) most scales either do not have parallel versions for use by the patients and the carers or even if they do, they do not provide adequate good quality psychometric data on the comparison between the patient and the carer reporting .\n\n【9】Method\n======\n\n【10】The questionnaire was devised according to the following guidelines proposed by the UK Medical Research Council: (a) a questionnaire should be simple to use, (b) should not take long to complete, (c) could be re-usable in different settings, (d) could be completed by a proxy respondent, (e) sensitive and specific to the condition for which used, (f) valid, and (g) reliable 通用删除1(英):<u>(see 通用删除8(英):<u>[www.mrc.ac.uk]</u>)</u>.\n\n【11】The first phase of this study involved carrying out in-depth interviews with adults with TBI and their relatives and then analyzing the data derived from these interviews using qualitative methods. The themes and concepts derived from the transcripts were then used to develop two parallel patient (Patient -- Head Injury Participation Scale \\[P-HIPS\\]) and carer (Carer -- Head Injury Participation Scale \\[C-HIPS\\]) questionnaires, which focused on measuring 'participation' (). The focus of the questionnaire was on how each symptom had been a problem for the individual during the past four weeks. The second phase of this study focused on the field-testing of the newly developed outcome measure in order to assess its psychometric properties. At this stage a neurobehavioral subscale was produced using a factor analysis (the Patient -- Head Injury Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale \\[P-HINAS\\] and the Carer -- Head Injury Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale \\[C-HINAS\\]). Further details from the qualitative stage of the study have been published elsewhere ().\n\n【12】Stage 1: Development of the questionnaire: Qualitative study\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Using qualitative methodology we gathered information from a group of 59 individuals; 32 patients with TBI and 27 family, friends, or paid carers regarding their perceptions of consequences of the TBI. Potential interviewees were identified via TBI services in the Cardiff area, Wales, UK. Approximately 300 patient files were screened to identify individuals with probable moderate or severe disability resulting from a TBI sustained whilst aged over 16. The actual level of disability was subsequently determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Purposive sampling method was used in order to get views from individuals with a mix of disability levels, gender, and age at injury. All interviews were conducted at least one year post injury and all interviewees had returned to a home environment for at least six months prior to being interviewed.\n\n【14】Semi-structured interviews that focused on narratives of personal experience were conducted with individuals and their carers. Interviewees were asked to describe their lives prior to the injury and then to describe the consequences of the TBI that had been most important to them. Open-ended questions were designed to collect as much information as possible on the impacts of the injury on the lives of patients and their carers, and to identify those areas, which interviewees considered to be particularly significant. These interviews were all recorded onto minidisk and transcribed in full.\n\n【15】Initially, a simple concordance programme was used (a) to identify a list of the most frequent terms used in the interviews, and (b) to highlight differences of word use in patient and carer interviews. The concordance results subsequently provided the elements of a user-friendly language in terms of which the questions in the subsequent instruments could be posed, and were also suggestive of some initial themes for analysis. Following that, the full interview transcripts were repeatedly read over in combination with listening to the recorded interviews. Emergent themes reported by participants as being important in the outcome following the TBI were then coded. The coding process was akin to that described by , and was later facilitated by the use of NUDI\\ST (N5) (Qualitative Solutions and Research Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia), a qualitative software data analysis package (). The coding exercise generated items for inclusion in the questionnaire.\n\n【16】Forty-nine identical questions were selected for the final drafts of both versions of the P-HIPS and the C-HIPS, with only slight differences in wording so that in the patient version the items refer to the self whereas, in the relative/carer version the items refer to the person they care for. The same ranking system (eg, '0' = not a problem, '1' = mild problem, '2' = moderate problem, and '3' = serious problem) has been used for all questions. The emphasis was on assessing 'participation' and thereby the impact of each symptom on the individual rather than simply rating the presence of symptoms. For example a patient may have a visual problem, but this does not cause any problem for his day to day activities because he wears spectacles. In this case the patient will report 'not a problem' in the 'difficulty with eyesight' section of the C-HIPS/P-HIPS. This approach is seen particularly important at the post-acute stage of outcome as the residual symptoms tend to plateau by that time. In the C-HIPS there are an additional nine questions concerning the effect that the TBI has had on the carers/relatives themselves, which were included to give a measure of carer burden.\n\n【17】Before finalizing, the two versions of the questionnaire (ie, the P-HIPS and the C-HIPS) were sent for comments to all the original sample of the TBI patients who took part in the qualitative stage of the study, their carers, and some professionals working with the TBI patients. Comments were gathered from patients and their carers on the questionnaire items, language used in the questions, layout, and color of the paper. In the light of the comments and feedback received, the draft versions of the questionnaire underwent minor revisions in content. Before finalizing the questionnaire, we checked whether participants were consistently missing any particular item or providing the same answer. We also checked for possible floor or ceiling effect from the spread of overall scores from all participants.\n\n【18】Stage 2: Field testing of the questionnaire: Quantitative study\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】### Participants\n\n【20】The two parallel versions of the questionnaire were field-tested on a cohort of 113 TBI patients (90 males; mean age: 42 years; SD: 13 years) and carers (14 males; mean age: 52 years; SD: 11 years) of 80 of these patients. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) Patients must have experienced the TBI at least one year prior to taking part in the study; (b) Patients must have had the TBI whilst aged over 16; and (c) Carers must have known the individual for at least four weeks as they were reporting on the previous four-week period.\n\n【21】### Procedure\n\n【22】Ethical approval for this study was granted by the West Midlands Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (MREC), UK. Participants were recruited from the TBI services nationwide in the UK including many neurorehabilitation units. All participants completed by post the newly developed questionnaire along with the postal version of the Glasgow Outcome Scale -- Extended GOSE, () and the Mayo Portland Adaptability Inventory-3 (MPAI-3) (). Once these were returned, our newly developed questionnaire was sent out again immediately. Sixty-five carers sent the completed C-HIPS back twice, which helped to calculate the test retest reliability of the C-HIPS.\n\n【23】Results\n=======\n\n【24】In this paper we primarily present data related to the C-HIPS and the C-HINAS and some comparison between the C-HIPS and the P-HIPS, and the C-HINAS and the P-HINAS. The data relating to the P-HIPS and the P-HINAS are presented in a separate paper ().\n\n【25】Sample characteristics\n----------------------\n\n【26】Carers reported that 41% of the patients had lower severe disability according to the GOSE. Twenty-five percent had upper severe disability, 17% had lower moderate severity, 10% had upper moderate severity, 4% lower good recovery, and 3% had upper good recovery. The three main causes of the TBI reported by participants were road traffic accidents (66.1%), falls (17.3%), and assaults (7.9%). Other reported injuries included sports injury and cycling accidents. Analysis showed that 97.5% of carers knew the individuals with TBI prior to their injury. There was a sub-group of 66 patient/carer pairs that took part in this study. These data were used to calculate the inter-informant reliability.\n\n【27】Factor analysis\n---------------\n\n【28】This was done by carrying out a principal components analysis (). Initially we included all factors with an eigenvalue ≥1 using a varimax rotation method. This was done on the C-HIPS and the P-HIPS and similar factors were detected for both. However, in order to compare the P-HIPS domains with the C-HIPS domains we have used the same P-HIPS factor structure for the C-HIPS (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The Keiser Meyer Olkin statistic for sampling adequacy was 0.87, suggesting if factor analysis is conducted, the factors extracted will account for substantial amount of variance. Scree plot analysis identified four factors for rotation, accounting for 52.84% of the total variance (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, Factor 1 is the biggest factor consisting of 20 items related to emotion and behavior. The items of this factor are put in a separate scale and the patient version is named as the P-HINAS and the carer version as the C-HINAS. Factor 2 is the second biggest factor consisting of 13 items relating to independence and community living (Carer -- Head Injury Community Living Scale \\[C-HICLS\\]). These included preparing meals, travel, and lack of independence. Factor 3 consists of 9 cognitive items (Carer -- Head Injury Cognitive Assessment Scale \\[C-HICAS\\]). Factor 4 is the smallest and consists of 7 items related to physical handicap (Carer -- Head Injury Physical Assessment Scale \\[C-HIPAS\\]). The P-HINAS and the C-HINAS scales can be used on their own to assess neurobehavioral outcome following TBI or with items from other factors, particularly the cognitive factor (C-HICAS). We have found from the subsequent use of the C-HIPS/P-HIPS among our clinic patients that they and their carers found the question on sex life too sensitive to answer. Therefore, we suggest that this item should be excluded before this questionnaire is used in day to day practice.\n\n【29】Internal consistency\n--------------------\n\n【30】Cronbach's alpha for the total C-HIPS revealed a coefficient of 0.95 for the total score and 0.90 for the additional carer burden section. The alpha coefficients of the four C-HIPS domains are 0.92 for the C-HINAS, 0.92 for 'Independence/Community Living', 0.91 for 'Cognition', and 0.84 for 'Physical'.\n\n【31】Criterion-related validity -- GOSE\n----------------------------------\n\n【32】The correlation between the C-HIPS's total scores and the GOSE category ratings was --0.61 (p \\< 0.001, N = 77). The GOSE category ratings spanned a wide range of scores on the C-HIPS. This is particularly marked for the first two parameters. Lower and upper good recovery scores did not show a wide range of scores. However, there were relatively small numbers of individuals in these two groups (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【33】Criterion-related validity -- MPAI-3\n------------------------------------\n\n【34】The correlation between the C-HIPS's total scores and the MPAI-3's total scores was 0.70 (p \\< 0.001, N = 73). 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> illustrates the comparisons between the domains of the C-HIPS and those of the MPAI-3. The correlations between the domains of both questionnaires were all significant (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), however correlations above 0.69 were found between the C-HINAS and the MPAI-3 'Pain/Emotion' score (r = 0.70), the C-HIPS 'Independence/Community Living' scale and the MPAI-3 'Social Participation' score (r = 0.71). The C-HIPS 'Cognition' scale had its highest correlations with the MPAI-3 'Physical/Cognition' score (r = 0.70). The C-HIPS 'Physical' domain had correlated well with all three MPAI-3 domains; 'Pain/Emotion' Score (r = 0.75), 'Physical/Cognition' (r = 0.72) and 'Social Participation' score (r = 0.76). The MPAI-3 Total Score correlated significantly with all four domains of the C-HIPS (r = 0.60--0.82, p \\< 0.001).\n\n【35】Test re-test reliability\n------------------------\n\n【36】The C-HIPS total scores for the 49 items showed good test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation; ICC = 0.95) (p \\< 0.001, N = 65), with individual item's reliability ranging from 0.65 to 0.89 (p \\< 0.001, N = 61--65). The test-retest reliability of the four domains were 0.93 (p \\< 0.001, N = 65) for the C-HINAS, 0.95 (p \\< 0.001, N = 65) for 'Independence/Community Living', 0.92 (p \\< 0.001, N = 65) for 'Cognition', and 0.93 (p \\< 0.001, N = 65) for 'Physical'. The ICC for the carer burden section was 0.87 (p \\< 0.001, N = 64) with a range of 0.48 to 0.82 (p \\< 0.001, N = 63--65) for individual items.\n\n【37】Inter-informant reliability\n---------------------------\n\n【38】The ICC is 0.83 for the comparison of the total scores of the C-HIPS and the P-HIPS for the 66 patient/carer pairs that took part in the study. For individual items the ICC ranged from 0.57 ('difficulty with concentration') to 0.95 ('difficulty with headaches'). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed significant differences in the responses of the patients and the carers in the following seven items out of the 49 common items of the patient and carer versions of the HIPS, (p \\< 0.05): (a) difficulty with planning and organization, (b) lack of independence, (c) preparing meals, (d) temper/irritable, (e) argument with close family, (f) reduced interest in family, and (g) strain on family. The ICC for the individual domains for the C-HIPS and the P-HIPS were 0.82 (p \\< 0.001) for the C-HINAS/P-HINAS, 0.86 (p \\< 0.001) for 'Independent/Community Living', 0.74 (p \\< 0.001) for 'Cognition', and 0.91 (p \\< 0.001) for 'Physical'.\n\n【39】Discussion\n==========\n\n【40】The qualitative methodology that was employed to assess the patients' and the carers' own perspectives of the consequences of TBI is believed to have elicited areas of outcome that have not previously been considered by health professionals (). Through analysis of the transcripts of the in-depth interviews the aim was to develop a new outcome measure that accurately reflected the views of patients and carers concerning what they felt were the most important consequences of the TBI. It is thought that this method of development, which has not been conducted before for TBI measures, should ensure that the questionnaire has good content and face validity. During the development of the scale the importance of emotional and behavioral consequences of TBI to the patients and their carers became obvious, yet these very areas are often neglected by clinicians and service providers while planning for the long term rehabilitation of these patients. The C-HIPS and the C-HINAS were constructed to measure 'participation' as defined by the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) ().\n\n【41】 reported validation data on their NFI. Although 72 items included in this scale have similarities with items in the C-HIPS, the authors did not describe in detail how they developed the questionnaire. They stated that the items were taken from a bigger scale, the General Health and History Questionnaire (GHHQ) and the items were originally formulated and compiled from interviews with patients with brain injury and family members, and from thorough reviews of the brain injury literature. However, it is unlikely that they have used same rigor and qualitative methodology like ours to analyze data collected from interviews with patients and carers.  also had to exclude 35 of the original 105 items from the final version of the NFIas they did not meet strong statistical criteria for inclusion in the scale; nevertheless the authors thought many of these items were clinically important. In their validation study () the authors did not provide any data on reliability of the NFI, which is an important aspect of psychometric properties of any scale. The authors have compared the NFIscores with a personality scale such as the Minnesota Multiple Personality Inventory (MMPI) () score but not with any standardized neurobehavioral outcome measure such as the one produced by . However, in subsequent studies the authors have compared the NFI() with functional measures such as Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (). The same group also compared the depression subscale scores of the NFIwith a clinical diagnosis of depression according to the DSM-IV () criteria () and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) () scores () among 172 outpatient clinic attendants with TBI.\n\n【42】In the past, measuring the patient's own perspective of their injury has been criticized due to lack of insight and memory problems that are commonly experienced by individuals with TBI, and therefore proxy reports were deemed as more accurate and reliable (). However, it is argued that carers will not be able to report patient's inner feelings and may interpret patient's behavior using their own explanations which may be different from patient's own interpretation of events. The reports of carers may also be biased by their emotional status, the severity of patient's problems, and the familiarity with the patient (). The carers, however, are likely to report certain behaviors such as aggression more frequently than the patients themselves.\n\n【43】Comparisons between the reports of the 66 patient/carer pairs indicate that there is generally high agreement between self- and other-reports. The overall ICC for the total score is good. This is similar to the ICC reported for the Brain Injury Community Rehabilitation Outcome Scale (BICRO-39) () and also the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) () where the agreement between patients and carers was also investigated. For the CIQ moderate to very good agreement was found for all 15 items. Although the inter-rater reliability of the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) () has been investigated, no study has assessed patient-proxy agreement. Similarly, to date no studies have investigated the patient/proxy agreement of the Community Outcome Scale (COS) (). Although FIM and Functional Assessment Measure (FAM) showed good inter-informant reliability (ICC: 0.85 for FIM and 0.83 for FAM) (), they show ceiling effects when used at the end of rehabilitation () and one year post-injury (). No data are available on FIM/FAM's predictive value. In the current study, significant differences were found between the reports of the patients and the carers on seven items in the HIPS. In line with previous research into this area, it is the carers who are reporting the greatest difficulties in day-to-day life for these items and most of these 7 items potentially have a greater impact on the family carers than the patients themselves. Comparing our results with those of the 63-item EBIQ (), the authors reported 42 significant differences between patients and carers, with most of these showing over-reporting from the cares. Comparatively, the results of the current study have demonstrated that although there are differences in the patient and carer reports for the core 49 items of the HIPS these are less than in the EBIQ. These high levels of agreement indicate that in situations where the patient is unable to self-report, using a proxy informant would be useful.\n\n【44】The C-HIPS was compared with the MPAI-3 and GOSE to establish its criterion-related validity. There is no accepted 'gold standard' in this area; therefore two instruments were selected that were deemed to be most appropriate for the purposes of this investigation. Comparisons with the MPAI-3 revealed a good correlation for the carer total scores, which was slightly lower than the P-HIPS's total score correlations with the MPAI-3 (0.87) . This illustrates the trend for carers to report similar levels of problems on both scores, however this does not show that the two scales are similar in their 'item content', factor structure and effectiveness to measure change in outcome. The good correlation between the C-HINAS and the MPAI-3 'Emotion' subscale suggests similar trends for these two domains. The correlations among the other domains of the C-HIPS and those of MPAI-3 are in the right direction as well.\n\n【45】Compared with the MPAI-3, a lower but negative correlation with the GOSE was expected, which can be explained largely due to its broad categorical nature in comparison with the newly developed C-HIPS. Investigating how each GOSE category rating compared against total scores, it was possible to see that there was a large variation of scores particularly with the 'Lower SD', 'Upper SD', and 'Lower MD' categories which also had the highest group numbers (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【46】Cronbach's alpha for the total and domain scores of the C-HIPS including the C-HINAS were found to be high, with all coefficients above 0.8. This indicates that these questionnaires have good internal consistency. The results further demonstrate that the test-retest reliability of the C-HIPS's total scores and domain scores including the C-HINAS are good (all \\>0.87). The results are broadly comparable with the test-retest coefficients for the domain and total scores for the CIQ (all \\>0.83) () when it was administered to 16 patients with TBI. However, this is a relatively low cohort number for the assessment of test-retest reliability. The DRS showed a test-retest coefficient of 0.95 when raters assessed 40 patients with TBI (). However, 3 other TBI specific outcome measures, namely GOSE (), The Rivermead Head Injury Follow Up Questionnaire (RHFUQ) () and the COS () do not provide any information on their test-retest reliability properties. Similarly the BICRO-39 was validated using a small cohort size of 33 (). There are no data available on EBIQ's concurrent validity and test retest reliability (). The test retest reliability of the total score and individual items according to the C-HIPS and the C-HINAS are between good and very good.\n\n【47】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【48】The types of reliability and validity investigated here have demonstrated that the C-HIPS and the C-HINAS have strong psychometric properties, and builds upon the results of the P-HIPS and the P-HINAS (). The sensitivity of this instrument to detect change following from a 'real world' intervention needs examination in the future, as these are essential to its potential clinical utility (). It is thus believed that this outcome measure will be of value in clinical practice assessing how the items covered in the questionnaire affect TBI individuals in their day-to-day life, with a particular emphasis on the neurobehavioral outcome both from a patient and carer perspective.\n\n【49】We made sure that the cohort represented participants with all levels of severity of outcome and all ages and different causes of TBI. Although the C-HIPS and the C-HI-NAS will be useful in day to day assessment of outcome of TBI patients, it is worth pointing out here that an accurate impression of consequences of brain injury requires blending information collected from several sources (). These include data from various tests, outcome scales, direct observation combined with patient and carer interviews, and patient examination (Hartlage et al 1987).\n\n【50】This study was funded by the Wales Office for Research and Development for Health and Social Care, UK (R00/1/050). We are very grateful to all patients and carers who took part in this study. We would also like to thank all the organizations that were involved in the recruitment of individuals for this study. These were: participating Headways, UK, TRACS (Birmingham), Rehab UK (Birmingham), and NHS Brain Injury Services, UK. We would also like to thank Dr Caroline Burrow (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) for collecting some data for the quantitative part of the study.\n\n【51】Each question asks whether a particular symptom has been either 'not a problem', or a 'mild', 'moderate' or 'serious' problem in the day-to-day life of the person you care for during the past four weeks.\n\n【52】There are 56 questions in total and they all follow the same format. The first 48 questions ask about problems experienced by the brain-injured person you care for during the past four weeks. The last 8 questions ask about how the consequences have affected you.\n\n【53】Example Question\n----------------\n\n【54】One question asks whether the hearing of the person you care for has caused her/him problems over the last four weeks.\n\n【55】  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            Not a Problem                                                                                 Mild Problem                                                                           Moderate Problem                                                               Serious Problem\n  ------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Difficulty Hearing\\   □\\                                                                                            □\\                                                                                     □\\                                                                             □\\\n  (Loss of hearing)         Either the symptom is not present or the symptom is present but does not cause difficulties   The symptom causes some mild problems with day-to-day life, but these are manageable   The symptom causes problems that have a moderate impact upon day-to-day life   The symptom causes problems that have a serious impact upon day-to-day life\n\n【56】  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】Therefore for the 'Difficulty Hearing' Question\n===============================================\n\n【58】If the person you care for does not have any difficulty hearing, then tick the 'Not a Problem' box.

The elicitor treatment caused an increase in the pool size of octopamine and tyramine amides (N-p-coumaroyloctopamine, N-feruloyloctopamine, N-p-coumaroyltyramine and N-feruloyltyramine), as well as a decrease in that of chlorogenic acid and putrescine amides (caffeoylputrescine and feruloylputrescine).

The increase in Jin in the cases of octopamine and tyramine amides was accompanied by an increase in flux for the transformation (Jout), indicating a rapid turnover of these compounds in the elicitor-treated tuber tissue. The result of the flux analysis indicated that the actual activation of the biosynthesis of octopamine and tyramine amides after the elicitor treatment was greater than that estimated from the changes in their levels in the potato tissue.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Pectinases are enzymes that contribute to pectin degradation through various mechanisms. Based on mode of action and preferred substrate, these enzymes can be briefly classified as pectin methyl esterases (PME, E.C 3.1.1.11) and pectin acetyl esterase (PAE, E.C 3.1.1.6) which removes methoxyl and acetyl residues from pectin to produce polygalacturonic acid, and the other subclass of homogalacturonan degrading group of enzymes which are broadly termed depolymerases breaking the α-1,4 linkages either by hydrolysis, i.e. polygalacturonases (PG, E.C 3.2.1.15) or via transelimination mechanism, namely, polygalacturonate lyases (PGL, E.C 4.2.2.2) and pectin lyases (PNL, E.C 4.2.2.10) \\[\\]. Pectinase produced by various microorganisms are useful in a number of industrial applications and can be apparently classified into acidic and alkaline pectinases according to their pH requirement for optimum enzymatic activity. Acidic pectinases from fungal sources (Aspergillus niger,Penicillium notatum,andBotrytis cinerea) are used in the fruit juice industries and wine making. Alkaline pectinases, mostly from bacterial sources especiallyBacillus sp. are mainly used in the degumming and retting of fiber crops, pretreatment of pectic wastewater from fruit juice industries, coffee and tea leaf fermentation, oil extraction, virus purification, etc. \\[, \\]. Decorticated ramie fibers contain 20% to 35% gum, which consists of pectin, hemicellulose, lignin, and so on. The pectinase is commonly considered as the key enzyme during enzymatic degumming of ramie fibers, especially PGL, and hemicellulases may also play a role for enzymatic degumming, but lignin-degrading enzymes have little effect on the degumming process \\[--\\]. Studies on the optimization of culture conditions and media, fermentation methods (solid-state, submerged fermentation), and screening of strains have been done to enhance PGL and PG production \\[--\\]. The gene that encodes PGL (pels) has also been expressed in recombinantPichia pastoris GS115 \\[\\] and homologously overexpressed inBacillus subtilis\\[\\] to obtain high production of the PGL. However, studies showed that high PGL or PG activity in pectinase does not mean the removal of more pectin \\[, \\], which showed that a suitable degumming enzyme system was also very important for promoting enzymatic degumming.\n\n【2】Our previous study had proved that the alkaline pectinase produced from wild-typeBacillussp. Y1 had more suitable enzyme system with powerful and fast degumming ability and suitable characteristics for degumming of ramie fibers, especially the high tolerance for H~2~O~2~ \\[\\]. What is more, the synergistic action was also found between the alkaline pectinase and H~2~O~2~ on the degumming and bleaching of ramie fibers. The protease component in the crude pectinase was further substantiated to be an important factor in degumming process, and synergistic action between protease and pectinase was also found during degumming. These studies showed that the alkaline pectinase ofBacillussp. Y1 had unique advantages and deserved further study. To further enhance pectinase production, some statistical design methods, for example, the mixture design, fractional factorial design (FFD), central composite design (CCD), and response surface methodology (RSM), were employed to optimize the media compositions, such as the ratio between three carbon source components, suitable media components, and its concentrations in this study. Statistical methods are effortless, time-saving, and considering interactions among variables. The single factor method was also applied to optimize culture conditions including culture temperature and inoculation amount.\n\n【3】2. Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n========================\n\n【4】2.1. Microorganism and Media 删除19:<u>{#sec2.1}</u>\n----------------------------\n\n【5】Bacillussp. Y1 was previously isolated from a soil sample collected from some bast fiber degumming factory, China, and conserved on nutrient agar slants at 4°C in our laboratory.\n\n【6】The seed culture medium consists of 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L peptone, 5 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L K~2~HPO~4~, 0.5 g/L MgSO~4~·7H~2~O, and 5 g/L pectin. The pH of the seed medium was adjusted to 8.0. The strain was incubated on a shaker at 100 rpm and 37°C for 8 h and transferred to the fermentation medium to produce pectinase.\n\n【7】During optimization, the submerged fermentation was conducted in 300 mL Erlenmeyer flasks by taking 50 mL of medium containing 54 g/L wheat bran, 42 g/L starch, 3 g/L (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~, 2 g/L MgSO~4~·7H~2~O, 1 g/L Na~2~CO~3~, 1 g/L Tween-80, and initial pH 8.5 on a swing shaker (100 rpm) at 34°C for 72 h, according to previous experiments. After fermentation, the supernatant of the culture broth was obtained through centrifugation to determine the enzyme activity.\n\n【8】2.2. Optimization of Culture Conditions 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2}</u>\n---------------------------------------\n\n【9】Based on preliminary work in our laboratory, the effects of culture temperature and inoculation amount on pectinase production were studied using single factor experiments. Strain Y1 was cultured through submerged fermentation (SmF) in 300 mL shaking flask at 30, 34, and 37°C for 60 and 72 h, with inoculum sizes of 0.65, 1.30, 2.17, and 3.03 mL of the seed medium (with the OD600 about 5.77) volume per 50 mL of fermentation medium, respectively. The optimum conditions were selected by comparing the enzymes activity of the fermentation liquor.\n\n【10】2.3. Optimization of Culture Media Components by Experimental Designs 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】### 2.3.1. Mixture Design of the Carbon Source 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.1}</u>\n\n【12】Mixture design was performed using design expert software \"Minitab\" (Minitab Inc.). All experimental designs were randomized. Mixture design strategy, which uses a limited number of experiments to study multicomponent systems, is based on statistical analysis. The experimental region can be represented by a regular simplex. This region is a triangle because the sum of the component proportions is united. The experimental region is explored at a point of composition that corresponds to an ordered arrangement. The mixture design method assumes that pectinase production is a function of its carbon source composition. Three carbon source components are present in the culture media, namely, starch, wheat bran, and sucrose, which comprises 7% (w/v) of the total. These three components were mixed according to a mixture design matrix that prescribes ten experiments (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The response surfaces for PGL production were obtained using the Minitab statistical software. The quadratic model of response Y and independent variables were expressed as follows:$$\\begin删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>\n{Y = \\beta_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{a}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{b}</u>X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{c}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{ab}</u>X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{ac}</u>X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{bc}</u>X_删除19:<u>{b}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n\\end删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>$$\n\n【13】where X~a~ is starch; X~b~ is wheat bran; X~c~ is sucrose; Y is the predicted response; β~a~, β~b~, and β~c~ are the linear coefficients; β~ab~, β~ac~, and β~bc~ are the interactive coefficients.\n\n【14】### 2.3.2. Fractional Factorial Design 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.2}</u>\n\n【15】Fractional factorial design (FFD) was used to screen the factors that significantly affect pectinase production from the carbon source (x~1~), (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~ (x~2~), K~2~HPO~4~ (x~3~), MgSO~4~ (x~4~), Tween-80 (x~5~), and initial pH (x~6~). The experimental design included 19 experiments with three central points. In FFD, the statistical design was expressed as coded values for convenience, in which --1, 0, and +1 stand for the low, high, and middle levels, respectively. Based on the results of previous experiments in our laboratory, the factors and levels of the factors in FFD are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【16】### 2.3.3. Central Composite Design 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.3}</u>\n\n【17】The central composite design (CCD), which uses the response surface methodology (RSM), was adopted to further optimize the significant variables selected using the FFD method. These variables included the carbon source (x~1~), (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~ (x~2~), and initial pH (x~6~). The MgSO~4~ and Tween-80 concentrations in the media were 3 and 1 g/L, respectively. A 2^3^ factorial rotatable central composite design with six star points (α = 1.68) and six replicates at the center points (n~0~ = 6), which led to 20 experiments (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), was used to optimize the levels for pectinase production. The quadratic model of response Y (for each parameter) and independent variables were expressed as follows:$$\\begin删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>\n{Y = \\beta_删除19:<u>{0}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{1}</u>X_删除19:<u>{1}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{2}</u>X_删除19:<u>{2}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{6}</u>X_删除19:<u>{6}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{11}</u>{X_删除19:<u>{1}</u>}^删除19:<u>{2}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{22}</u>{X_删除19:<u>{2}</u>}^删除19:<u>{2}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{66}</u>{X_删除19:<u>{6}</u>}^删除19:<u>{2}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{12}</u>X_删除19:<u>{1}</u>X_删除19:<u>{2}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{16}</u>X_删除19:<u>{1}</u>X_删除19:<u>{6}</u> + \\beta_删除19:<u>{26}</u>X_删除19:<u>{2}</u>X_删除19:<u>{6}</u>} \\\\\n\\end删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>$$\n\n【18】where Y is the predicted response; β~0~ is the intercept; β~1~, β~2~, and β~6~ are the linear coefficients; β~11~, β~22~, and β~66~ are the squared coefficients; and β~12~, β~16~, and β~26~ are the interactive coefficients.\n\n【19】For the mixture design and CCD, the Minitab statistical software was used to obtain the optimal values for these factors and \"STATISTICA\" software was used to generate the response surfaces.\n\n【20】All experiments were carried out in triplicate and mean values were applied.\n\n【21】2.4. Measurement of Enzyme Activity 删除19:<u>{#sec2.4}</u>\n-----------------------------------\n\n【22】The PGL activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of unsaturated bonds in the product at 235 nm. The reaction mixture contained 2 mL of 0.2% (w/v) polygalacturonic acid (Sigma Chemical Co. type P3889) in 0.05 M glycine--NaOH buffer (containing 0.44 mM CaCl~2~) at pH 9.6 and 20 μL of the diluted enzyme solution. The reaction mixture was incubated at 45°C for 15 min. Then, the reaction was terminated by adding 3 mL of 0.03 M phosphoric acid. The product was checked using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2550). One enzyme unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of unsaturated galacturonic acid per min with a molar extinction coefficient of 4600 \\[\\].\n\n【23】The PG activity assay was performed by incubating 0.5 mL of the suitably diluted enzyme with 1 mL of 0.5% pectin (Sigma Chemical Co. type P9135) in 0.05 M glycine--NaOH buffer (pH 9.6) at 55°C for 30 min. PG activity was determined by measuring the amount of[d]删除19:<u>{.smallcaps}</u>-galacturonic acid liberated by the enzyme action using a spectrophotometer \\[\\]. One unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of galacturonic acid from polygalacturonic acid per min under the assay conditions.\n\n【24】3.

It was demonstrated that the optimum temperature and inoculation amount for production of pectinase fromBacillussp. Y1 was 34°C and 1.3 mL (with the OD600 of the seed medium about 5.77) per 50 mL of fermentation medium, respectively.\n\n【27】3.2. Mixture Design for Optimizing the Proportion of Different Carbon Sources 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Many carbon sources have been used in submerged fermentation withBacillussp. Y1 to screen suitable carbon sources for pectinase production in preliminary work . It was found that three carbon sources, namely, starch, wheat bran, and sucrose, were suitable for producing pectinase usingBacillussp. Y1. In the present study, their proportion in the mixed carbon source was further optimized by the mixture design method. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> showed the activities of the PGL and PG in crude pectinases at 72 h of fermentation, and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> displayed the response surfaces and contour plots of the carbon sources on PGL and PG activity. The optimal proportion of the three carbon sources in the mixture for the PGL and PG production was determined using the Minitab statistical software, which was 0.36, 0.40, and 0.24 for starch, wheat bran, and sucrose, respectively. The quadratic model of response Y and independent variables were expressed as follows:$$\\begin删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>\n{PGL\\left( 删除19:<u>{ U/mL}</u> \\right)\\operatorname删除19:<u>删除20:<u>{}</u></u> = 10.072X_删除19:<u>{a}</u> + 7.977X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + 2.529X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + 32.782X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + 28.957X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + 42.920X_删除19:<u>{b}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n\\end删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>$$$$\\begin删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>\n{PG\\left( 删除19:<u>{ U/mL}</u> \\right)\\operatorname删除19:<u>删除20:<u>{}</u></u> = 5.142X_删除19:<u>{a}</u> + 3.862X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + 6.268X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + 13.207X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{b}</u> + 5.187X_删除19:<u>{a}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n{\\mspace删除19:<u>{2060mu}</u> + 11.928X_删除19:<u>{b}</u>X_删除19:<u>{c}</u>} \\\\\n\\end删除19:<u>{matrix}</u>$$\n\n【29】TheF-value andP-value of the PGL model were 7.80 and 0.034 (P \\< 0.05) and 11.14 and 0.018 (P \\< 0.05) for the PG model, so the estimated models fit the experimental data adequately. The coefficient of determinationR^2^ was 0.9070 and 0.9330 for the PGL and PG model, respectively, indicating that the model was able to comprehend a 90% of data variability.\n\n【30】A verification experiment was conducted to evaluate the reasonability of the proportions, in which the three substrates were mixed according to the proportions and were used as carbon sources in submerged fermentation ofBacillussp. Y1. It was proved that the pectinases fromBacillussp. Y1 using the mixed carbon sources had higher activities of PGL and PG (19.7 and 10.1 U/mL, respectively) than that using a single carbon source (No. 1, 7, and 9 in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). Therefore, compared to the initial components of carbon source used in experiment, the carbon source mixture composed of 36% starch, 40% wheat bran, and 24% sucrose was more suitable for pectinase production ofBacillussp.

Therefore, the final optimal medium components and fermentation conditions were as follows: carbon source, 10.5% (consisting of 3.8% starch, 4.2% wheat bran, and 2.5% sucrose); (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~, 0.37%; MgSO~4~, 0.3%; Tween-80, 0.1% (w/v); initial pH, 8.2; and inoculation amount of 1.3 mL (with the OD600 of the seed medium about 5.77) per 50 mL of fermentation medium on a swing shaker (100 rpm) at 34°C for 60 h.\n\n【42】4. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec4}</u>\n=============\n\n【43】A number of the genusBacillus and related genera are known to produce extracellular pectinase, which have been applied in ramie bast fibers industry \\[, \\]. Even though some studies about enzymatic degumming and pectinase production had already been done, more effective degumming enzymes are still needed to boost the application of enzymatic degumming technology in the industry \\[, \\]. In our previous study, it was found that the alkaline pectinase produced from wild-typeBacillussp. Y1 had more effective enzyme system to fast and forceful remove gum of ramie fiber. For example, the gum loss reached to 39.7% (the residual gum was 14.5%) after treatment of 2 h with lower PGL dosage (40 U PGL per gram of ramie fibers) \\[\\]. The pectinase had also the high tolerance for H~2~O~2~. What is more, the synergistic action was also found between it and H~2~O~2~ on the degumming and bleaching of ramie fibers. The protease component in the alkaline pectinase fromBacillussp. Y1 was further substantiated to be an important factor for its high degumming ability, and the synergistic action between protease and pectinase on degumming was also proved. These studies showed that the alkaline pectinase ofBacillussp. Y1 had unique advantages and deserved further study.\n\n【44】For further enhancing the enzyme activity ofBacillussp. Y1, statistical approaches were employed to optimize components of media. Our preliminary study about the effect of different carbon sources on the pectinase production  had shown that starch, wheat bran, and sucrose were good carbon source for producing pectinase by theBacillussp. Y1. In the study, an appropriate ratio of the three carbon sources was obtained by mixture design strategy, and higher PGL and PG activity were obtained by using the optimized carbon source mixtures compared to any a single carbon source. Martins et al. reported thatThermoascus aurantiacus 179-5 could produce a maximum of 43 U/g of PG and 40,180 U/g of pectin lyase when grown on orange peel, sugar cane bagasse, and wheat bran as carbon sources under solid-state fermentation \\[\\]. Silva et al. also found that maximum activity of PG (30 U/g) and pectin lyase (20 U/g) were obtained when wheat bran and orange bagasse were used as the carbon source byPenicillium viridicatum Rfc3 in SSF \\[\\]. Khan et al. foundA. niger ATCC 16404 was hyperproducer (5.38 U/mL) of pectinase using a substrate combination of wheat bran and mosambi peel as carbon source moistened with the micronutrient solution under SSF cultivation at 65% moisture and 5.0% pectin as an additional carbon source \\[\\]. It was also found that the mixed carbon sources not only enhanced the enzyme production, but also boosted other biological products, e.g. lysine production \\[\\].\n\n【45】The conventional method of ''change-one-factor-at-a-time\" for optimizing conditions of enzyme production is laborious, time-consuming and may lead to unreliable results and less accurate conclusions. Response surface methodology (RSM), which includes factorial designs and regression analysis, involves full factorial search by examining simultaneous, systematic, and efficient variation of all components. It is useful for small number of variables (up to five), but impractical for a large number of variables, due to a high number of experimental runs required. Therefore, for screening more than five factors, FFD is recommended \\[\\]. In the study, the FFD was used to identify the critical variables that possible influenced the pectinase production. It was confirmed by FFD method that carbon source, (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~, and initial pH were the most significant factors for production of both PGL and PG during submerged fermentation. It also reported that C:N ratio and pH were the major factor that influenced the pectinase production \\[\\], and lactose, tryptone, and (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~ had also significant influence on the activity of pectinase \\[\\]. The effects of surfactants and MgSO~4~ on pectinase production have been previously reported \\[, \\]. However, Tween-80 and MgSO~4~ did not have a significant effect on the pectinase production byBacillussp. Y1.\n\n【46】It was reported that the PG production byBacillus pumilus dcsr1 increased to 21.0 and 25.3 U/mL in shake flasks and lab fermenter, respectively, by the optimization of variables using Plackett--Burman design (PB) and RSM \\[\\]. The enhancement from 9.0 to 13.7 U/mg DW/mL in PG production ofKluyveromyces wickerhamii was achieved after pH, temperature, and incubation period were optimized via RSM \\[\\]. By optimization using RSM, PGL production increased to 2.68 U/mL, 1.4-fold increase compared to the production before optimization, during submerged fermentation ofDebaryomyces nepalensis \\[\\], and further increased to the maximum PGL activity of 8.73 U/mL, 2.9-fold increase, after optimization via PB design and RSM \\[\\]. By optimization of fermentation conditions using PB and RSM tools, a 2.7-fold enhancement in the PG production was achieved withB. subtilis NRRL B-4219 under submerged fermentation \\[\\]. TheP. griseoroseum T20 strain presented an increase in PL production of more than 400 fold and an increase of at least 14-fold in PG production in submerged fermentation after optimization via RSM \\[\\]. Based on the results of FFD experiments, we used RSM to optimize these critical parameters in this study. The predicted and experimental values were very close, which all reflected the accuracy and applicability of RSM. According to the model, the production of pectinase ofBacillussp. Y1 was affected by the interaction of carbon source with (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~ and initial pH. Compared to pectinase production in unoptimized medium, a 2.00-fold and 3.44-fold in PGL and PG production (27.0 and 40.0 U/mL, respectively) were achieved by submerged fermentation using the optimized medium in shake flasks. Moreover, the fermentation period at maximum pectinase production was shortened from 72 h before optimization to 60 h after optimization (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). In our previous study, the gene that encodes PGL (pels) has also been homologously overexpressed inBacillus subtilis to enhance the PGL production \\[\\]. In further work, we will further increase pectinase activity ofBacillussp. Y1 using genetic engineering method.\n\n【47】5. Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec5}</u>\n==============\n\n【48】By mixture design, FFD, CCD, and single factor experiments, the final optimal medium components and fermentation conditions for pectinase production ofBacillussp. Y1 were determined as follows: carbon source, 10.5% (consisting of 3.8% starch, 4.2% wheat bran, and 2.5% sucrose); (NH~4~)~2~SO~4~, 0.37%; MgSO~4~, 0.3%; Tween-80, 0.1% (w/v); initial pH, 8.2; and inoculation amount of 1.3 mL (with the OD600 of the seed medium about 5.77) per 50 mL of fermentation medium on a swing shaker (100 rpm) at 34°C for 60 h. After optimization, PGL and PG activity (27.0 and 40.0 U/mL, respectively) increased to twofold and 3.44-fold, respectively, and the fermentation time shortened 12 hours (from 72 h to 60 h). The results are valuable for pectinase production ofBacillussp. Y1, reducing production cost, and providing a basis for further research, such as genetic means to further increase enzyme activity.\n\n【49】This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 31870562), Natural Sciences Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2016CB27), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu (BK20151278), and the Science and Technology Project of Qufu Normal University (xkj201608).\n\n【50】Data Availability\n=================\n\n【51】The data and materials supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article.\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflicts of Interest\n=====================</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![The effects of culture temperature and inoculation amount on PGL (a,c) and PG (b,d) production at 60 and 72 h.](BMRI2019-8146948.001)删除19:<u>{#fig1}</u></u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![Response surfaces and contour plots for PGL (a, b) and PG (c, d) production in the mixture design experiments.](BMRI2019-8146948.002)删除19:<u>{#fig2}</u></u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![The response surface and contour plots showing relative effect of two parameters on PGL (a-f) and PG production (g-l) while other at constant level.

The specific autoimmune mechanisms underlying MS involve unchecked activation of autoreactive T cells (, ). Neuronal antigens present in the periphery may first prime the encephalitogenic T cells that subsequently migrate into the CNS where, upon re-encountering their cognate antigens, they release pro-inflammatory molecules mediating neuronal damage (, ). Many crucial studies on the pathogenesis and possible treatments of MS have been carried out using a mouse model of autoimmune CNS disease that in many ways mimics MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by immunization with various neuronal antigens such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP) (--). The characteristic inflammation seen in EAE with perivascular CD4^+^ T cell and mononuclear cell inflammation, the clinical symptoms of progressive ascending paralysis, and the relative ease of disease induction make EAE a relevant model for MS and also a powerful model for the study of immune regulation of Th1- and Th17-dependent autoimmunity (, ).\n\n【2】Healthy individuals have myelin reactive T cells in their system, albeit, at a lower frequency than MS patients, indicating that mechanisms are in place to control these myelin-reactive T cells and prevent MS (). Immunomodulation and Foxp3^+^ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a pivotal role in protection and recovery from EAE and MS by suppressing autoreactive T cells and either the absence of tTreg cells or their abnormal functions can exacerbate the severity of EAE (--). In addition to classically described CD4^+^CD25^+^Foxp3^+^ Treg cells, Foxp3^neg^ Tr1 cells, regulatory B cells, and CD8^+^ regulatory T cells may have various roles in regulating different aspects of the autoimmune response in EAE as discussed in Ref. (--). The initial observations indicating a role of Treg cells in inhibition of CNS inflammation came from experiments that showed a suppressive cell population arising during the recovery stage of EAE that was able to prevent EAE and suppress T effector cells when transferred into healthy animals (--). It has subsequently been shown that a transfer of in vitro-induced Treg cells could ameliorate EAE (). Studies by Lafaille and colleagues showed that MBP T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice crossed onto a RAG-deficient background that precluded a development of Treg cells succumbed to spontaneous EAE (). Correspondingly, a depletion of Treg cells in vivo by anti-CD25 antibody exacerbates EAE (). In the early stages of MS, patients have the same frequency of Treg cells in their peripheral blood although frequencies of Treg cells are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients (, ). However, in patients suffering from MS, Treg cells may have a reduced capacity for suppression and this functional defect has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS (--). Therefore, therapies focused on functions of Treg cells have been proposed as an excellent approach to block neuroinflammation some of which are reviewed in Ref. (, ).\n\n【3】Peripherally Induced Regulatory T Cells Protecting from EAE 删除19:<u>{#S2}</u>\n===========================================================\n\n【4】A majority of Foxp3^+^ regulatory T cells develop in the thymus and such Treg cells are indispensable for the maintenance of immune homeostasis (--). However, the sudden onset of the autoimmune disease is not known to be preceded by perceivable perturbations in the functions of Treg cells despite the recognized genetic associations between T cell-related genes and MS as well as known defects in the functions of Treg cells implicated in the pathogenesis of MS (, --). Therefore, despite their crucial role in mitigation of the ongoing neuroinflammatory disease and preventing spontaneous autoimmunity in some MS models, the mechanisms dependent on thymically produced tTreg cells appear insufficient to prevent the initial priming of encephalithogenic T cells and block EAE after an immunization with relevant neuronal antigens (, --). Similarly, although depletion of Treg cells inhibits spontaneous recovery from EAE, some expanding Treg cells that accumulate in CNS during EAE may not be fully efficient in controlling autoimmunity due to various reasons including possible resistance of effector T cells to Treg-mediated suppression (, --). Overall, the regulatory capacity of tTreg cells can be overwhelmed by the inflammatory injury acutely induced in healthy animals resembling the sudden onset of MS in patients.\n\n【5】However, EAE can be effectively prevented by the pre-administration of neuronal antigens in the non-inflammatory context. The first indication of such actively induced tolerance was provided in 1958 by a group who showed that a form of EAE could be prevented by previous administration of autoantigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (). Further, lymph node cells transferred from rats that were treated with MBP administered without pro-inflammatory adjuvant protected recipient rats from a subsequently induced EAE (). These early observations were then expanded in the context of the mechanisms responsible for the induction of extrathymic peripheral tolerance (, ). Extensive work by Stephen Miller and his co-workers showed that mouse spinal cord homogenates as well as various purified myelin derived peptides chemically coupled to splenocytes induced immune tolerance that prevented subsequently induced EAE (--). Additionally, tolerance preventing EAE could also be induced by microparticles that mimic apoptotic cells bearing myelin antigens (). The T cell tolerance induced by neuronal antigenic materials relied on various immunological mechanisms including T cell anergy, however, functions of Treg cells were particularly important for the long-term maintenance of this induced tolerance (, ). Work by other investigators showed that treatment with tolerogenic antigens and also presentation to T cells of MOG and PLP by extrathymic dendritic cells (DCs) of the peripheral immune system could specifically prevent EAE and also increase the numbers of Treg cells (--). In non-EAE experimental models, DCs can convert pTreg cells de novo in addition to increasing the numbers and enhancing the functions of pre-existing Foxp3^+^CD25^+^ tTreg cells (--). Therefore, despite some clear indications of a de novo induction of pTreg cells, it remained unclear whether the newly converted pTreg cells were indispensible to prevent symptoms of EAE (, ). Results of recent experiments using Hopx^−/−^ mice with specific deficiencies in the functions and survival of pTreg cells but not tTreg cells helped to resolve this issue (, ). The severity of the EAE is the same in Hopx^−/−^ and Hopx^+/^^+^ mice consistent with the unaltered functions of their tTreg cells (, ). However, following treatment with tolerizing myelin antigens, the Hopx^−/−^ mice are unable to maintain long-lasting tolerance that prevents a subsequent induction of EAE (). This defect is caused by altered suppressor functions and an increased death of Hopx^−/−^ pTreg cells after their normal conversion from the anergic T cells following the responses to tolerogenic antigens. However, peripheral tolerance in Hopx^−/−^ mice can be completely restored by transferred Hopx^+/^^+^ Foxp3^neg^ precursors that give rise to functional pTreg cells (). In contrast, a transfer of similar numbers of pre-existing Hopx^+/^^+^ Foxp3^+^ tTreg cells fails to restore tolerance and prevention of EAE in Hopx^−/−^ mice following a treatment with tolerizing myelin antigens (). Hopx-sufficient pTreg cells are stable and maintain Foxp3 expression also under pro-inflammatory conditions (, ). In agreement with the crucial roles of such de novo differentiated pTreg cells that convert from the initially tolerized T cells, a deletion of Treg cells does not interfere with the initial induction of tolerance that depends on anergic T cells, but instead, it breaks the long-lasting maintenance of such tolerance that relies on pTreg cells that develop from the initially tolerized T cells (, ). Further, the induction of the pTreg cell-dependent tolerance and protection from EAE is compromised in the absence of CD5 that is required in T cells for their efficient conversion into pTreg cells (). Similar, antigenic presentation by DCs in the absence of the pathways that increase expression of CD5 in T cells also fails to induce pTreg cells and to maintain long-lasting tolerance (). Overall, consistent with a known division of labor between tTreg cells and pTreg cells proposed to help determine the outcomes of general auto-inflammatory responses, maternal--fetal conflict, and mucosal tolerance, pTreg cells and tTreg cells have complementary but also separate functions in regulation of neuroinflammation (, --).\n\n【6】Mechanisms Responsible for Induction of pTreg Cells 删除19:<u>{#S3}</u>\n===================================================\n\n【7】In contrast to pre-existing tTreg cells, antigen-specific pTreg cells first need to be converted extrathymically from the Foxp3^neg^ precursors through the mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. In the absence of this active de novo conversion of pTreg cells, animals remain fully susceptible to EAE similar to what is observed in mice that have a global genetic deficiency preventing either extrathymic generation of such pTreg cells or their functions and survival (, ). Although multiple types of APCs may have tolerogenic functions in EAE including macrophages (, ), DCs are particularly well equipped to regulate immune responses (--). In the steady state, defined by the absence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, the outcome of T cell activation by DCs results in T cell tolerance (, --). DCs first pulsed with neuronal antigens ex vivo and then re-injected into animals could prevent EAE similar to soluble tolerogenic antigens that can also be picked up by DCs in vivo (--). The anti-EAE tolerance is mediated by the inherent functions of endogenous DCs and an experimental induction of such tolerance was first achieved by delivering MOG in vivo using recombinant chimeric antibodies specific for DEC205 expressed on DCs (). Overall, the experimental targeting to DCs or expression in DCs of MOG and other neuronal antigens has been established to induce anti-EAE tolerance (, --, ). As part of their tolerogenic program, DCs induce a de novo induction of Foxp3 expression in extrathymic T cells converting them into pTreg cells and such pTreg cells were then also found to protect from EAE (--, ). Tolerogenic DCs are characterized by production of various immunomodulatory metabolites and cytokines including TGF-beta and retinoic acid (, --). The tolerogenic functions of DCs can also be facilitated by the engagement of specific immunomodulatory molecules such as CTLA-4 and PD-L1 (, --). In addition to the pathways that directly affect the cell-intrinsic induction of Foxp3 expression, induction of immune tolerance and pTreg cells also depends on the specificity of T cells to self and tolerizing antigens (, ). Such antigenic specificity is reflected by CD5, a complex regulator of T cell signaling whose expression in T cells parallels TCR signal strength during thymic selection of self-reactive T cells (--). Recently, CD5 was shown to instruct the extrathymic conversion of self-reactive CD5^hi^ T cells into pTreg cells by modulating their responsiveness to effector cell-differentiating cytokines through blocking the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (). In addition to thymic mechanisms, expression of CD5 in T cells can also be increased extrathymically to promote conversion of pTreg cells by tolerogenic BTLA^hi^ DCs through engagement of HVEM, a receptor for BTLA (). Overall, CD5 increases a probability of pTreg cell conversion from T cells that have responded to either high-affinity self-peptide-MHC in the thymus or to tolerizing antigens presented by DCs of the peripheral immune system, and this mechanism may facilitate a specific formation of pTreg cells especially in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (, ).\n\n【8】The Suppressor Mechanisms of Treg Cells Relevant to Inhibition of MS and EAE 删除19:<u>{#S4}</u>\n============================================================================\n\n【9】There are multiple molecular mechanisms of immune suppression by Treg cells as excellently described in Ref. (, --) and others. The Treg cells isolated from MS patients have generally been shown defective in their ability to suppress effector T cell responses and some of such Treg cells have also a decreased expression of crucial CTLA-4 as well as Foxp3 (--, ). In another mechanism, CD39 expressed by Treg cells removes inflammatory ATP by converting it into AMP, a substrate for CD73 that is expressed by human Th17 cells, astrocytes, and endothelial cells of the blood--brain barrier (, --). Therefore, a lower frequency of CD39^+^ Treg cells in MS patients may contribute to a defective suppression in MS (). Other surface molecules expressed by Treg cells that have been shown to modulate immune suppression include Neuropilin-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT (--). Human Treg cells also suppress effector T cells by interfering with Ca2^+^ signaling in effector T cells and this suppressor function appears to be defective in Treg cells in some MS patients as well (, ). In addition to various functional deficits, the Treg cells found in MS patients may acquire the proinflammatory phenotype of effector T cells. David Hafler's group showed that MS patients have increased Th1 Treg cells that express IFN-γ, TBX21, and CXCR3 (). Overall, it is clear that defects in Treg cell functions exacerbate the course of MS and could drive disease progression.\n\n【10】It remains unclear if the crucial molecular mechanisms of suppression differ between tTreg cells and pTreg cells. Although Hopx is expressed in both tTreg cells and pTreg cells, only pTreg cell functions and survival rely on Hopx (, ). The relevant molecular pathways controlled by Hopx in pTreg cells remain incompletely understood but Hopx can block expression of IL-2 in these cells (). Treg cells, in general, rely on extracellular sources of IL-2 for their proliferation and survival and a treatment with recombinant IL-2 promotes proliferation and functions of regulatory T cells although high doses of recombinant IL-2 in vivo can also lead to a disappearance of Treg cell populations despite their initial expansion (, --). In the absence of Hopx, pTreg cells have increased expression of the intrinsic IL-2 coinciding with their decreased suppressor ability and increased cell death. The normal functions of Hopx^−/−^ pTreg cells can be restored by genetically ablating IL-2 expression, suggesting that increased intrinsic IL-2 expression in the absence of Hopx may be detrimental in pTreg cells (). However, since Hopx directly modulates the expression of the AP-1 transcription complex in pTreg cells and also possibly affects other molecular pathways, the relevant complex functions of Hopx may likely be context dependent and involve other mechanisms that directly modulate pTreg cell responses ().\n\n【11】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#S5}</u>\n==========\n\n【12】Studies using EAE have helped to define the pathology associated with the human disease MS and helped establish that Treg cells are vital to prevent CNS autoinflammation. Currently used therapies for MS are still not curative and often produce harmful side effects (, --). Therefore, achieving tolerance through de novo-induced pTreg cells that are specific for various myelin antigens might be an attractive option to effectively treat MS in addition to efforts focused on enhancing the functions of already existing Treg cells during the course of disease.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions 删除19:<u>{#S6}</u>\n====================</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Both authors wrote and approved the final version of the manuscript.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest Statement 删除19:<u>{#S7}</u>\n==============================</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding 删除19:<u>{#S8}</u>\n=======</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported in part by grants from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (RG5019A) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (R01AI113903) (both to DH).

Fifteen patients with anal fissure (ten females and five males) had bowel symptoms assessed and anal endosonography performed preoperatively and two months after lateral internal anal sphincterotomy.

All were continent preoperatively, but after lateral internal anal sphincterotomy, three females became incontinent to flatus (two of whom had a preoperative external sphincter defect). In contrast to lateral internal anal sphincterotomy in males, division of the internal anal sphincter in most females tends to be more extensive than intended. This is probably related to their shorter anal canal.

{"seq_id": "f360dcce-7eee-413a-9332-95df3e18b365", "title": "", "text": "【0】Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a natural alkaloid with anti-herbivorous properties produced by Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, which is present in a wide range of beverages including coffee, tea and soft --mainly cola- drinks. Caffeine is a well-known bioactive compound with stimulating effects on the central nervous system, along with a range of other potentially positive effects on human health. Such effects range from enhancing long-term memory, improving sports performance, inactivating breast cancer-associated myofibroblasts, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or even reducing the risk of mortality among coffee consumers. However, it should also be noted that caffeine intake habits are often linked to living styles and thus it is difficult to draw epidemiological conclusions linking caffeine intake to health.\n\n【1】Caffeine may be an environmental pollutant, and has also been proposed as an easily detectable marker for untreated wastewater. Indeed, the presence of caffeine in the natural environment is one of the best indicators of anthropogenic contamination. Caffeine bioactivity on human health and the environment has led to the development of processes to remove caffeine, either to yield decaffeinated products or to degrade environmental caffeine. Decaffeination, namely the caffeine removal process, is used industrially to produce low-caffeine beverages and can also be implemented for environmental remediation. One intriguing option is to use microorganisms to perform decaffeination processes. Some microorganisms have been reported to degrade caffeine, such as Aspergillus tamarii, Trichosporon asahii, Pseudomonas sp. or P. putida.\n\n【2】In this work, we report a diversity analysis aiming to characterise bacterial communities growing on coffee leach waste, using high througput sequencing, culturing, and electron microscocopy techniques. To achieve this goal, we have chosen one of the most widespread coffee preparation systems, Nespresso, due to its popularity and standard nature. In fact, Nespresso-compatible machines are highly standardized coffee making devices (same capsule type, same basic design, same pressure: 19 bars), and they represent a unique oportunity for a massive biological screening. Here we present the first attempt to do so. We have sampled the inner drip tray below the capsule container, in which coffee lyxiviate accumulates. We have analysed ten domestic and semi-domestic machines and studied the dynamic colonization process in a brand new Inissia Krups machine operated in our laboratory. This is the first systematic analysis of the microbial diversity associated to coffee machines. Our results may shed light on the microbial arsenal of caffeine degraders with important implications for both medicine and biotechnology.\n\n【3】Results and Discussion\n======================\n\n【4】The waste coffee in the capsule container of nine different Nespresso machines operated for at least one year was sampled (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). In one case (CityZ model), the cup tray was also sampled independently as it does not connect with the capsule container. The high throughput sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons from all the machines revealed a significant bacterial diversity, with the total number of identified genera ranging from 35 to 67. Although relatively similar microbial profiles were detected, there was an important variation in the frequency of particular taxa. Enterococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. proved to be the main taxa as they were moderately to highly abundant in nine out of the ten samples analysed. Other frequent genera were Stenotrophomonas, Sphingobacterium, Acinetobacter and, to a lesser extent, Coprococcus, Paenibacillus or Agrobacterium. Dysgomonas was very frequent in the Inissia machine, accounting for 15% of the sequences (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). No differences were detected between machine models (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) or use (domestic vs. communal).\n\n【5】One of the two most frequent genera found in the coffee machines was Pseudomonas, which is also one of the few reported examples of a caffeine-degrading bacterium. Indeed, Pseudomonas sp. has been known to catabolise caffeine since the seventies, and is reported to degrade up to 15 g/L of caffeine through an N- demethylation reaction, which along with C-8 oxydation represent the two potential catabolic pathways. Species reported to display caffeine degradation abilities are P. alcaligenes and P. putida (strains C1, CBB1 or CBB5). In fact, P. putida N-demethylation genes have been used to genetically engineer a caffeine \"addicted\" version of E. coli, and caffeine removal from sewage by bioremediation with P. putida has also been proposed.\n\n【6】The abundance of Enterococcus spp. in caffeine-rich leach might not necessarily involve unreported caffeine degradation abilities in Enterococcus, but it might simply be a consequence of tolerance to certain caffeine levels. The same applies to other frequent taxa. Interestingly, this genus has previously been associated with coffee, along with several others detected in this work. For example, Acinetobacter sp. has been isolated during coffee fermentation, while Stenotrophomonas sp. Curtobacterium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. are abundant in the coffee seed.\n\n【7】The colonisation process of the wasted coffee leach was studied in an experiment using a brand new Krups Inissia machine (located in a separate room within our laboratory). The experiment lasted two months, during which leach samples were taken and bacterial diversity analysed, with a significant variation in the taxonomic profiles detected. The initially high species richness was substituted by a relatively simpler, but still highly variable, species composition (species richness significantly dropped 14 days after the beginning of the experiment; t-test p-value = 0.039). During the first 11--13 days, Pantoea sp. Cloacomonas sp. and, to a lesser extent, Brevundimonas sp. were relatively abundant but amounts decreased to undetectable levels by the end of the experiment. All these taxa were largely substituted by Pseudomonas sp. Acinetobacter sp. and Sphingobium species, which reached a peak and then fluctuated (Sphingobium sp. Bacillus sp.) or reached the highest levels at the end of the experiment (Pseudomonas sp. Acinetobacter sp.) as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The first 30 days exhibited greater instability in the bacterial communities, as deduced by the consecutive peaks of very abundant taxa, which were substituted by a more balanced bacterial composition after one month. As in other studies on different environments, these results strongly suggest a long ecological succession during the first month, in which generalist bacterial taxa, including enterobacteriaceae genera such as Pantoea, are the first colonizers but are then displaced by successive waves of other taxa. The main keyplayers observed during this succession were, in order (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>): enterobacteria (genus Pantoea; peaking 4--11 days after the beginning of the experiment), Firmicutes (three genera of the bacillaceae family: Bacillus, Terribacillus, Paenibacillus; peaking after 14--21 days); and, finally, the sphingomonadales genus Sphingobium (proteobacteria), the actinomycetales genus Curtobacterium (actinobacteria), and the pseudomonadales genus Acinetobacter (proteobacteria), peaking after 28, 31 and 49 days, respectively. These taxa gave way to a different bacterial profile dominated by Pseudomonas sp. and Enterococcus sp. after two months of the experiment. This profile was very similar to that found in the nine other coffee machines sampled (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) which had been operated for a longer time, suggesting that the particular physico-chemical conditions (cycles of high temperature, constant caffeine accumulation, etc.) of coffee leach, rather than the influence of the user or the number of uses, are the main force shaping the composition of the microbial community. A mathematical modelling performed on the dynamic series of 16S rRNA gene data revealed statistically significant correlations among the detected taxa, indicating that the distribution of bacterial genera in time is not random (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【8】Most of the taxa we identified during the colonisation process of the coffee machine operated in our laboratory have previously been found in natural coffee-related environments. Species belonging to the genera Acinetobacter and Bacillus, and also some enterobacteria, have been detected during the natural fermentation of coffee beans, whereas Paenibacillus and other Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes species have proved abundant in the composting process of coffee hulls. Despite some reports describing the ability of different Sphingobium species to degrade toxic molecules, such as bisphenols and hydroquinones, this is the first report where Sphingobium sp. has been associated to a caffeine-rich environment.\n\n【9】In addition to the 16S rRNA gene monitoring, we followed up changes in the coffee leach microbial diversity through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows a dynamic series of samples taken at different time points (4, 8, 14, and 21 days after the first day of operation) during the first month. Microbial biomass increased throughout the analysis, and variations in the composition and viscosity of the coffee leach were also evident. For example, a filamentous matrix was observed at days 8 and 21 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). At day 14, the sample was dominated by a single shape of bacterial cells, which interestingly coincided with an overwhelming relative abundance of Bacillus spp. in that sample (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Further experiments are needed to determine whether microbial community changes are the cause or the effect of the variations in the composition of coffee leach as shown by SEM.\n\n【10】Our results show, for the first time, that coffee leach from standard capsule machines is a rich substrate for bacterial growth; that caffeine content does not prevent a rich bacterial biodiversity from rapidly colonising coffee leach; and that microbial succession from an initial pool of generalist bacteria gives way to an apparently coffee-adapted but still highly variable bacteriome. This bacteriome is rich in species previously reported to be associated with the coffee plant and/or the coffee fermentation processes. Colonising bacteria might be of environmental origin , whereas heterogeneity of bacterial composition may relate to factors such as cleaning habits and, specially, the frequency of machine use (with higher frequencies presumably correlating with increased volume and temperature of the coffee leach). Further studies comprising more coffee machines, deep genome sequencing of the microbial communities therein, and even functional metagenomics, are required to contribute to shed light on the microbial ecology of coffee leach in capsule machines.\n\n【11】The presence of bacterial genera with pathogenic properties and the fast recovery of the communities after rinsing the capsule container, strongly suggest the need for frequent maintenance of the capsule container of these machines. Maintenance should employ bacteriostatic compounds, and avoid contact of the coffee leach with other parts of the machine to avoid unintended contamination of the beverage. On the other hand, the resistant microbial communities we describe here (microbial consortia, individual caffeine degrading/tolerant species or as a source of metabolic pathways and genes) may represent a promising tool for biological coffee decaffeination processes and for environmental caffeine decontamination.\n\n【12】Methods\n=======\n\n【13】Sampling\n--------\n\n【14】Nine Nespresso machines, which had been operated for at least one year, used either at home (domestic) or in academic departments, institutes or biotechnology companies (communal) in the Valencia (Spain) area were aseptically sampled (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The coffee lixiviate from wasted capsules present in the drip tray placed below the capsule container was sampled using a sterile Pasteur pipette. In one case (CityZ), the small space under the drip grid and cup support facilities was sampled and treated separately (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). In all cases, the average temperature of the room where the coffee machines were operated was close to 25 °C.\n\n【15】Additionally to these machines, a Krups Inissia machine was purchased for the present work and normally operated in our laboratory for five months with a daily use of around 1--5 capsules per day. Sampling was performed at increasing time lapses and consisted of the removal of most (except 5 mL, approximately) of the lixiviated liquid. When the volume of the lixiviate was smaller than 5 mL, no samples were taken. All the detachable pieces (drip grid and cup support, drip tray and capsule container were thoroughly rinsed once (day 28) with tap water.\n\n【16】In all cases, 2 mL aliquots of the samples were immediately used for DNA isolation, whereas the remaining volume was stored at −80 °C.\n\n【17】Scanning electron microscopy\n----------------------------\n\n【18】Aliquots from each sample were filtered through a 0.2 micrometre filter (Corning Inc.), fixed with a 2% paraformalin - 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution, and lightly washed with filtered-sterile phosphate buffer (PBS). Then, small pieces of the filters were placed inside microporous capsules (30 μm pore size, available from Ted Pella Inc. product number 4619) and subjected to successive dehydration steps in growing ethanol solutions up to 100% ethanol, following critical point drying in an Autosamdri 814 (Tousimis). These fragments were then placed on SEM stubs with silver conducting paint TAAB S269 and examined under a scanning electron microscope Hitachi S-4100.\n\n【19】DNA isolation and PCR amplification\n-----------------------------------\n\n【20】Two mL aliquots of each sample were centrifuged at 11,000 g for 3 min and the resulting pellets were washed twice with sterile PBS buffer (NaCl 8 g/L, KCl 0.2 g/L, Na~2~HPO~4~ 1.44 g/L, KH~2~PO~4~ 0.24 g/L, pH adjusted to 7.4). A widely-used DNA isolation protocol based on lysozyme treatment and alkaline lysis, suitable for the treatment of both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, was used to obtain metagenomic DNA. Briefly, each sample was treated with 2 mg/mL lysozyme (30 min, 37 °C) to ensure the lysis of Gram positive bacteria, and DNA was isolated with an alkaline solution (Tris 300 mM, SDS 1.25%, sucrose 5%, EDTA 10 mM; adjusted to pH 8.0) followed by precipitation with 3M potassium acetate (pH 5.0) and isopropanol. The quality of the DNA was checked on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and quantified with Nanodrop-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Universal primer sequences 28F (5′-GAG TTT GAT CNT GGC TCA G-3′) and 519R (5′-GTN TTA CNG CGG CKG CTG-3′), were chosen for the PCR-amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene since they targeted the V1-V3 hypervariable region (commonly analysed in metagenomic studies) and produced an amplicon of a suitable length (500 bp) for the subsequent sequencing library construction. A short (9--11 nucleotides) barcode sequence followed by a four-nucleotide spacer (CGAT) was included at the 5′ end of the oligonucleotides used as forward primers to enable sequence assignment to samples after high-throughput sequencing. All the amplifications were performed under the following conditions: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 54 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min; finalized by a 10-min elongation at 72 °C. The resulting amplicons were checked on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and purified by precipitation with 3M potassium acetate (pH: 5) and isopropanol. Pure amplicons were quantified with the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and an equimolar pool of amplicons was prepared from all the samples.\n\n【21】16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatic data analysis\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】A sequencing library was constructed with 100 ng of the equimolar pool by the amplicon fusion method (Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit, MAN0006846, Life Technologies). The library was quantified with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalizer (Agilent Technologies Inc, Palo Alto, California) prior to clonal amplification, and emulsion PCRs were carried out applying the Ion PGM Template OT2 400 kit as described in the user-guide (MAN0007218, Revision 3.0 Lifetechnologies) provided by the manufacturer. The library was sequenced in an Ion 318 Chip v2 on a Personal Genome Machine (PGM IonTorrent, Lifetechnologies) at Lifesequencing S.L (Lifesequencing, Valencia, Spain), using the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Publication Number MAN0007242, Revision 2.0, Lifetechnologies). Raw sequences obtained from the sequencing centre were processed with the MOTHUR software. A summary of sequencing statistics is available in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>. Short (\\<100 bp) and low quality (\\<Q10, \\<90% accuracy) reads were removed in a first step, and sequences were then assigned to samples based on barcode matches (allowing a maximum of 3 mismatches in primer search and 1 mismatch barcode search). The resulting sequences were trimmed by removing primer, barcode, and spacer sequences. All sequences were aligned to the ribosomal 16S Greengenes database using the kmer method (8-mers) for finding template sequences and the Needleman method for sequence alignment. Penalties for mismatch, gap opening, and gap extension were set as default (−1, −2, and −1, respectively). Finally, sequences were classified using BLAST searches against the same database. The similarity percentage cut off was set at 70%.\n\n【23】Consortia identification and visualization\n------------------------------------------\n\n【24】In order to identify microbial interactions, we used taxonomic data of samples from the ten machines. A method used a recently described multidimensional scaling and a biological significance filtering of the interactions. Basically, the procedure was as follows: fluctuation scaling of replicas was validated by a Poisson distribution selection. Then, linear correlation coefficients were converted into distances and displayed by multidimensional scaling.

The conserved role of Sir2 in extending life span in lower organisms raises the possibility that the mammalian orthologue of Sir2 may also play a similar role. In mammals, there are seven homologues of Sir2, SIRT1--7, of which SIRT1 is most similar to the yeast Sir2 and is considered to be the orthologue of yeast Sir2. SIRT1 has been shown to regulate multiple cellular functions, including cellular stress response, cell differentiation, development, and metabolism (). Activators of SIRT1 improve cellular mitochondria function and protect mice from metabolic diseases (; ). Furthermore, SIRT1 transgenic mice also display beneficial phenotypes similar to mice on a calorie-restricted diet (leaner and more metabolically active; ), supporting an antiaging role of SIRT1.\n\n【2】Recent studies also revealed a paradoxical role of SIRT1 in tumorigenesis, possibly as a result of SIRT1\\'s inhibitory effect toward tumor suppressors such as p53. Inhibition of SIRT1 by small molecule inhibitors or down-regulation of SIRT1 by siRNA results in arrested cell growth and apoptosis in several tumor cell lines, including breast, lung, and colon cancer lines, suggesting a role for SIRT1 in tumor cell growth (; ). In addition, inhibition of SIRT1 results in reactivation of tumor suppressor gene transcription in human breast and colon cancer lines (), suggesting a role for SIRT1 in silencing tumor suppressor genes. Together, these studies suggest a possible role of SIRT1 in promoting tumorigenesis. However, recent work with SIRT1 transgenic and knockout mice also suggests a role for SIRT1 in tumor suppression (; ). Therefore, the biological effects of SIRT1 are complex. In this study, we show that c-Myc and SIRT1 form a negative feedback loop that inhibits c-Myc--induced cellular transformation. These results support a tumor suppression function of SIRT1.\n\n【3】Results and discussion\n======================\n\n【4】During our investigation of SIRT1 regulation, we found that there are three potential c-Myc--binding sites (E-box) localized at the SIRT1 promoter. This finding led us to hypothesize that c-Myc may regulate SIRT1 expression. Indeed, overexpression of c-Myc increased SIRT1 expression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1 a]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, down-regulation of c-Myc decreased SIRT1 expression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1 b]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Furthermore, SIRT1 expression is higher in c-Myc--proficient fibroblasts (TGR and Myc3) than that of Myc-deficient cells (HO15; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1 c]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). These results suggest that c-Myc may act to enhance SIRT1 expression. To investigate whether c-Myc regulates SIRT1 expression at the transcriptional level, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) of SIRT1 transcripts. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1 d]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, there were more SIRT1 transcripts in c-Myc--proficient cells than those of c-Myc--deficient cells, suggesting that c-Myc induces SIRT1 transcription. Finally, to directly demonstrate that c-Myc binds at the SIRT1 promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using anti--c-Myc antibodies. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1 e]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, Myc binds one E-box (E1) but not other E-boxes (E2 and E3) of the SIRT1 promoter. Overall, our results suggest that c-Myc promotes SIRT1 expression by elevating SIRT1 transcription.\n\n【5】![c-Myc induces SIRT1 expression.

To confirm the specificity of this interaction, we used SIRT1 siRNA to down-regulate SIRT1. c-Myc failed to coimmunoprecipitate with SIRT1 in cells transfected with SIRT1 siRNA (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 a]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), confirming the specificity of the c-Myc--SIRT1 interaction. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of c-Myc also pulled down SIRT1 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 b]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). To examine whether the SIRT1--c-Myc interaction is direct, we incubated purified c-Myc and SIRT1 under cell-free conditions and found that SIRT1 interacts with c-Myc in vitro, suggesting that SIRT1 directly interacts with c-Myc (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 c]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【7】![SIRT1 interacts with c-Myc and deacetylates c-Myc at K323.

Because SIRT1 is a protein deacetylase, it is possible that SIRT1 could regulate c-Myc activity by deacetylating c-Myc. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 d]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, overexpression of wild-type (WT) SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1-H363Y, resulted in hypoacetylation of c-Myc. Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 using SIRT1 siRNA resulted in c-Myc hyperacetylation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 e]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Finally, SIRT1^−/−^ cells showed that c-Myc hyperacetylation compared with SIRT1^+/+^ cells; reconstitution of SIRT1^−/−^ cells with WT SIRT1, but not inactive SIRT1-H363Y, decreased c-Myc acetylation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 f]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). These results suggest that SIRT1 deacetylates c-Myc in cells.\n\n【9】We further explored potential SIRT1 deacetylation sites of c-Myc. Previous studies have identified several potential acetylation sites of c-Myc (; ). We found that Lys323 (K323) is a major SIRT1 deacetylation site because overexpression of SIRT1 was unable to reduce c-MycK323R acetylation as it was with the WT c-Myc. Thus, although the c-MycK232R mutant is not able to be acetylated, SIRT1 overexpression was not able to reduce the acetylation status of the mutant below that of basal levels (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 g]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Confirming this result, the loss of SIRT1 did not increase acetylation levels of the K323R mutant (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2 h]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). These results suggest that K323 of c-Myc is the major SIRT1 deacetylation site.\n\n【10】c-Myc has previously been shown to be acetylated, which enhances c-Myc stability (; ). Because SIRT1 deacetylates c-Myc, we hypothesized that SIRT1 affects c-Myc stability. In support of our hypothesis, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased the c-Myc protein level without affecting the c-Myc mRNA level (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3 a]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 increased c-Myc expression with no effect on c-Myc transcripts (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3 b]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). To confirm these findings, we used SIRT1^+/+^ and SIRT1^−/−^ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3 c]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, there was increased expression of c-Myc in SIRT1^−/−^ cells. Reconstitution of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, decreased c-Myc expression 通用删除1(英):<u>(通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S1 a]</u>)</u>. These results suggest that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc expression at the posttranscriptional level. We next examined whether SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks protein translation. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3 d]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased c-Myc stability. Conversely, loss of SIRT1 expression enhanced c-Myc stability . Reconstitution of SIRT1^−/−^ cells with WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, restored the c-Myc half-life to the level of WT MEFs . These results suggest that SIRT1 negatively regulates c-Myc stability.\n\n【11】!通用删除8(英):<u>[SIRT1 decreases c-Myc stability.

It is possible that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability through FBW7. We used the MycT58A mutant to investigate this possibility. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3 e]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, MycT58A is more stable than WT c-Myc, which is consistent with previous findings (; ). However, SIRT1 still decreased MycT58A stability, suggesting that SIRT1 and FBW7 regulate c-Myc stability through distinct pathways.\n\n【13】Because we have shown that K323 is a major SIRT1 deacetylation site of c-Myc (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2, g and h]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), we further examined whether SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability through K323.

Although SIRT1 decreased the stability of WT c-Myc, it had no effect toward MycK323R. These results suggest that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc stability by deacetylating K323.\n\n【14】We next investigated how SIRT1 affects c-Myc function by examining the expression of c-Myc target genes. We first examined the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT), which is a direct target gene of c-Myc (; ). Consistent with its negative regulation of c-Myc, overexpression of SIRT1 decreased TERT expression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4 a]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, overexpression of the catalytically inactive SIRT1 mutant SIRT1-H363Y did not affect TERT expression. Furthermore, TERT expression is clearly higher in SIRT1^−/−^ cells than that of SIRT1^+/+^ cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4 b]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), confirming that SIRT1 negatively regulates TERT expression.\n\n【15】![SIRT1 inhibits Myc target gene expression through c-Myc.

We found little expression of TERT in Myc^−/−^ HO15 cells. However, HO15 cells stably reconstituted with c-Myc (Myc3) showed enhanced TERT expression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4 c]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Importantly, overexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, suppressed TERT expression, suggesting that SIRT1 negatively regulates TERT expression through c-Myc.\n\n【17】To further confirm the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 toward c-Myc, we also examined the expression of other c-Myc target genes. c-Myc has been shown to activate cyclin B1 expression and suppress Gadd45 and p21 expression (). We found increased expression of cyclin B1 and decreased expression of Gadd45 and p21 in SIRT1^−/−^ cells and cells transfected with SIRT1 siRNA (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4, d and e]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, overexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, results in decreased cyclin B1 expression and increased Gadd45 and p21 expression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4 f]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).

In addition, Myc has also been shown to regulate cancer cell energy metabolism by inducing genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT) expression (, ). We also found that SIRT1 decreased Myc-induced LDHA expression by Western analysis and both LDHA and mSHMT expression by QRT-PCR (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4 h]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>; and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S2, a and b]</u>, respectively). Overall, these results strongly suggest that SIRT1 negatively regulates c-Myc activity.\n\n【18】The inhibitory effect of SIRT1 on c-Myc raised the possibility that SIRT1 could negatively regulate cell growth and transformation. To specifically examine how SIRT1 affects c-Myc--induced cell growth, we used Myc^−/−^ HO15 cells, and HO15 rat fibroblast cells stably reconstituted with c-Myc (Myc3). As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5 a]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, expression of c-Myc greatly increased colony formation. However, coexpression of WT SIRT1, but not catalytically inactive SIRT1, with c-Myc significantly decreased c-Myc--induced colony formation. Furthermore, we performed soft agar assays to examine how SIRT1 affects anchorage-independent cell growth. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5 b]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, Myc3 cells displayed anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar. However, expression of SIRT1 significantly decreased the colony formation in soft agar, whereas catalytically inactive SIRT1 only slightly affected colony formation. These results suggest that SIRT1 inhibits c-Myc--dependent cellular transformation. To confirm that SIRT1 suppresses cell growth by deacetylating c-Myc, we used the MycK323R mutant to perform cell growth experiments. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5 c]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, although SIRT1 could suppress WT c-Myc and MycT58A-induced cell growth, it had no effect on MycK323R-induced cell growth. These results suggest that SIRT1 exerts its antitransformation effects by deacetylating K323 of Myc. SIRT1 also decreased MycT58A-induced cell growth and colony formation of FBW7^+/+^ and FBW7^−/−^ cells 通用删除1(英):<u>(通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S3 a]</u>)</u>, suggesting that SIRT1 regulates c-Myc activity independently of the FBW7 pathway.\n\n【19】!通用删除8(英):<u>[SIRT1 inhibits c-Myc--induced cellular transformation.

Cells were then implanted into athymic nude mice. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5 d]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and Fig. S3 b, overexpression of SIRT1 significantly inhibited tumorigenesis in nude mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate a tumor suppression role of SIRT1 in vitro and in vivo.\n\n【21】In this study, we present evidence that c-Myc induces SIRT1 expression, and SIRT1 in turn deacetylates and down-regulates c-Myc, resulting in decreased c-Myc target gene (i.e. TERT) expression and cellular transformation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5 e]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Consequently, this Myc-SIRT1 negative feedback loop can restrain Myc\\'s transformational activities. Although it has been established that SIRT1 has several important roles in metabolism and cellular stress response, its role in tumorigenesis remains controversial because both pro- and antitumorigenesis effects of SIRT1 have been suggested. It is possible that SIRT1\\'s role in tumorigenesis is context dependent. For example, senescence is important for suppression of tumor initiation; however, it is thought to drive tumor growth by secreting inflammatory factors and tissue-disrupting enzymes (). It is possible that SIRT1 inhibits the initiation of tumor in premalignant cells by inhibiting c-Myc. However, cancer cells could become addicted to SIRT1 as a result of SIRT1\\'s antiapoptosic functions. In support of this notion, inhibition of SIRT1 induces cell cycle arrest and death only in cancer cells but not noncancerous cells (). Therefore, SIRT1 might have both tumor suppression and promotion roles depending on the stage of cell transformation.\n\n【22】Feedback mechanisms have previously been demonstrated for the regulation of Myc activity. For example, Myc induced expression of ribosomal protein L11, which in turn binds Myc and blocks Myc transcriptional activity (), forming a negative feedback loop. Myc also induces L23 expression, which blocks Miz1 function and p21 and p16 transcription, thereby acting as a positive feedback loop to further potentiate Myc\\'s ability to promote cell growth (). We showed that through a negative feedback loop, SIRT1 could decrease the expression of c-Myc target genes (e.g. TERT) and increase expression of tumor suppressors (e.g. p21 and Gadd45). Our results are consistent with previous findings that SIRT1 can limit replicative life span () and TERT expression ().\n\n【23】In addition, through this Myc-SIRT1 feedback loop, SIRT1 could also modulate cells\\' energy metabolism. It has been established that in addition to regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis, c-Myc also regulates energy metabolism through the induction of LDHA and mSHMT (; ), which are important for cellular transformation. We showed that SIRT1 also blocks Myc-mediated expression of LDHA and mSHMT, providing another route by which SIRT1 regulates glucose metabolism in addition to its known role in regulating glucose metabolism. One can also postulate that Myc-induced redox metabolism could change the NAD/NADH ratio, which in turn affects SIRT1 activity. This is another possible feedback mechanism that requires further investigation.\n\n【24】In summary, our experiments suggest that a c-Myc--SIRT1 negative feedback loop suppresses cell growth and transformation. These experiments also provide a rationale using SIRT1 activators as cancer prevention agents in the future.\n\n【25】Materials and methods\n=====================\n\n【26】Cell culture\n------------\n\n【27】HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS.

Changes in gene expression were quantified based on the 2^ΔCt^ value normalized to GAPDH.\n\n【40】Colony and soft agar colony formation assays\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Cells were plated in 60- or 35-mm dishes. After 2 wk, cells were stained with 2% methylene blue, and colonies were counted.\n\n【42】The soft agar colony formation assay was performed as described previously (). In brief, Myc3 Rat1 cells were infected with either control, SIRT1, or SIRT1-H363Y retroviruses. Cells were plated in 0.3% top agarose in 35-mm dishes and cultured for 2 wk. Colonies were counted at room temperature under a light microscope (ECLIPSE 80i; Nikon) using a 4× NA 0.10 objective lens (Nikon).

The parenthood experience is largely influenced by many factors including parents' confidence levels, emotional well-being, social networks, and the quality of their support system \\[\\]. Such environmental factors are capable of acting as a security blanket to buffer against the stressors that comes with parenthood, or add on to the stress parents are already facing, and such negative experiences can deter couples from becoming parents again. It is crucial to maintain positive emotional well-being in parents as studies have shown that maternal psychosocial stress can influence dynamics in the family \\[-\\].\n\n【3】In view of the dipping fertility rate \\[,\\], the Singapore government has been coming up with attractive incentive packages \\[-\\]; however, these have proven to be futile in boosting fertility rates. Low fertility rates are associated with multiple factors including an economic drain \\[\\], parental expectations of childbirth, and previous negative birth experiences \\[,\\]. Previous studies have found that perinatal experiences were one of the major factors affecting birth rate \\[,\\]. Negative perinatal experiences such as a lack of support during this crucial period may influence a parent's decision to give birth again \\[\\]. In Singapore, perinatal support is mainly provided by maternity hospitals \\[\\]. Unlike certain parts of Western Europe, continuity of care post hospital discharge by community care nurses is lacking in Singapore \\[\\].\n\n【4】To assist parents in transiting smoothly into parenthood, antenatal classes and postnatal educational sessions are available at the hospitals in Singapore \\[\\]. However, because of early discharges \\[\\] and having so much to teach, parents are overloaded with too much information \\[\\], which limits the effectiveness of these educational sessions. In a local study, mothers found that informational support provided by the hospital was unsatisfactory \\[\\] as the most crucial period for parents is usually the first few weeks post discharge, when parents are left to handle stressful situations on their own. Moreover, current perinatal services in Singapore focus much of their attention on supporting women's transition to early motherhood during hospitalization and pay less attention to fathers. A study conducted in Canada revealed that fathers did not feel supported by the hospital environment with regard to promoting their involvement with their newborn \\[\\]. Therefore, there is a need for a theory-based educational program that focuses on facilitating smooth transition to parenthood for both parents.\n\n【5】Previous local studies were mainly focused on first-time mothers \\[\\] or the early postpartum period \\[\\]. There is a limited amount of educational programs that are developed for both first-time and experienced parents across the perinatal period. Support for parents from the antenatal period until the postnatal period is recommended in both international \\[-\\] and local \\[\\] studies. Additionally, most of the available educational programs are delivered face-to-face, in which information is relayed didactically \\[,\\]. The shortage of midwives and nurses limits the feasibility of such programs as they are not cost-effective \\[\\].\n\n【6】With the advancement in technology, the use of technology-based educational programs with new parents during the postnatal period both internationally \\[,\\] and in local context \\[\\] have found to be successful in influencing parental outcomes in the postnatal period. However, because of the lack of a rigorous experimental study design \\[,\\] and limited postnatal focus \\[,\\], there is a need to develop an intensive family-oriented perinatal educational program that is professionally based and provided at a low cost, utilizing technology to enhance accessibility to all parents without compromising its effectiveness on parental outcomes. As such, this study aims to develop a technology-based supportive educational parenting program (SEPP) to support both fathers and mothers across the perinatal period by targeting different variables through the different components of the SEPP.\n\n【7】Theoretical Framework\n---------------------\n\n【8】The theoretical framework guiding the SEPP is Bandura's self-efficacy theory and Bowlby's attachment theory \\[,\\]. According to Bandura's self-efficacy theory \\[\\], parenting self-efficacy (PSE) is considered one of the major determinants of competent parenting and the well-being of a newborn and is related to parental emotional well-being such as postnatal depression and the social support available for parents. Bowlby also theorizes that early parent-to-infant attachment provides the foundation of psychological well-being and, later, the development for infants in building social relationships, which can be influenced by PSE, emotional well-being, and social support \\[\\]. Social support is associated with high PSE, which is in turn related to better emotional well-being and enhanced parental bonding with their newborn \\[,\\], which may ultimately lead to better parenting satisfaction. Hence, PSE, parental bonding, emotional well-being, and social support are interrelated variables, and the SEPP aims to target these variables to improve parental outcomes. This theoretical framework is represented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【9】Aims\n----\n\n【10】The aims of the study were to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> examine the effectiveness of the SEPP on parental outcomes, including PSE (primary outcome), parental bonding, postnatal depression and anxiety, social support, and parenting satisfaction; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the SEPP compared with routine perinatal care; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> process evaluation of the SEPP by assessing its strengths and weaknesses from parents' perspectives.\n\n【11】Hypotheses\n----------\n\n【12】The hypotheses are 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> When compared with those in the control group receiving routine care, parents receiving the SEPP will report significantly (a) higher levels of self-efficacy in newborn care, (b) higher levels of parental bonding, (c) lower levels of depression and anxiety, (d) higher levels of social support received, and (e) higher levels of parenting satisfaction and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> It is more cost-effective to provide the SEPP than routine care.\n\n【13】![Theoretical Framework showing interrelationship between outcome variables.

Couples (n=118 participants) recruited from a tertiary hospital will be randomly assigned into the two groups (intervention group receiving the SEPP and routine care or control group receiving only routine care). Data will be collected via questionnaire surveys using locally validated and reliable instruments, medical reviews, semistructured face-to-face interviews, and telephone interviews.\n\n【17】Components of the Supportive Educational Parenting Program\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Parents who are assigned to the intervention group will receive the SEPP and routine perinatal care provided by the hospital. Parents in the control group will receive only routine care. The routine care includes antenatal check-ups with an obstetrician and short postnatal stays in the hospital. During antenatal check-ups, the progress of the pregnancy is assessed via maternal bio-physiological profile, height and weight, and abdominal palpation. Antenatal educational classes are available; however, they are charged and not fully utilized by parents because of their lack of awareness \\[\\]. During postnatal stay, parents will receive care from an obstetrician, nurses, and lactation consultants. Parent-craft educational classes are available. However, because of the short hospital stays, most of the parents are too tired to attend these sessions \\[\\]. The SEPP consists of three main components, as presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【19】In Singapore, the mobile phone penetration rate was approximately 98% in 2016 \\[\\], which is the highest globally. Moreover, under the smart nation initiative, Singapore is moving toward delivering holistic health care to the population through technological innovations \\[\\]. Hence, delivering the SEPP in the form of a mobile health (mHealth) app is not only feasible but also a sustainable and convenient form of education delivery for health care professionals (HCPs) and parents.

The discussion forum will be a platform for parents to ask any questions they might have. All parental queries will be answered by a trained midwife (research assistant 1, RA1) once a day for the first 4 weeks post childbirth because this period is the most stressful period for new parents in the early post-partum period \\[,\\]. Additionally, other parents can also provide insights to these queries by sharing their personal experiences. According to Bandura's self-efficacy theory \\[\\], self-efficacy and a help-seeking behavior (social support) can be enhanced when tasks are learned from others in a similar situation; therefore, parents are encouraged to interact with other parents in the discussion forums. Daily push notifications regarding important milestones on parenting will be sent to users. Each notification appears on the user's home screen, which aims to pique the user's interest and serves as a reminder to continue exploring the rest of the content-rich app. Participants' access to the mHealth app will be monitored (by adding the function of time spent in accessing materials) to record the dosage of the intervention each participants receives. The app was developed by an external vendor who is an expert in mHealth app development. The research team and the external app developer have been keeping in close contact for the development of the app. Screenshots of the features of the app as examples are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figures 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>-通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【28】To ensure consistency, the same RA (RA1) will deliver the telephone-based prenatal and postnatal educational component in the SEPP to all the participants in the intervention group. The protocol for the SEPP has been validated by an expert panel consisting of five HCPs (one nursing professor who is experienced in postnatal educational programs, one senior consultant-neonatologist, one senior consultant-obstetrician, and two experienced midwives in perinatal education) and two sets of parents.\n\n【29】The participants recruited will be couples (a father and mother dyad is considered one couple). The inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants who are mothers are shown in [Textboxes 1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"boxed-text\"}</u> and [2.]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"boxed-text\"}</u>\n\n【30】The inclusion criteria for fathers are those who 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> are 21 years and above, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> are able to read and speak English, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> have a mobile phone with Internet access, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> plan to stay in Singapore for the first 3 months post delivery. The exclusion criteria for fathers are those who have self-reported physical or mental disorders that will interfere with their ability to participate in the study and/or are a single parent.\n\n【31】All couples are recruited antenatally and will be told beforehand that they may be excluded from the study if mothers are to experience complication during their pregnancy and the delivery of their newborn.\n\n【32】Sample Size Determination\n-------------------------\n\n【33】On the basis of previous studies, psychosocial and educational interventions in the perinatal period generally produce a medium size effect on outcome variables \\[,\\]. Hence, the SEPP intervention can also be assumed to have a medium effect size on outcome variables. A repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to test for differences between two groups (intervention and control) and within four separate time points and for interaction (group x time) effects. The required sample size for the detection of a medium effect size of 0.3 (analysis of variance \\[ANOVA\\] F value) at a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% (two-sided) is 45 in each group \\[\\]. Considering a 30.0% (30/100) attrition rate based on previous studies \\[,\\], a minimum of 118 participants (45x2 + 45x2x30%=90 + 28=118), with 59 in each group, is needed. A purposive sample of approximately 16 participants will be needed for the process evaluation. Parents with differing mean parenting efficacy (primary outcome) scores from both the intervention and control groups (8 from each group) will be selected to participate in the face-to-face interviews, until data saturation is attained.\n\n【34】Randomization\n-------------\n\n【35】The research randomizer will be used to randomly generate one set of 59 numbers ranging from 1 to 118. Generated numbers are assigned to the intervention group and the remaining to the control group. All 118 numbers will be placed in an opaque envelope. The principle investigator who will not be involved in the recruitment will hold the random numbers and pass it to RA1 for recruitment. After assessing eligibility and obtaining informed consent, the participants will be asked to pick a number from the opaque envelope, in which the number picked will determine the groups assigned.\n\n【36】Outcome Measures and Instruments\n--------------------------------\n\n【37】Patients' demographic data (eg, age, gender, ethnicity, and education) will be collected. In addition, the following instruments will be used to measure parental outcomes:\n\n【38】1.  Parenting Efficacy Scale (PES): This 10-item PES scale \\[\\] is used to measure parental beliefs on self-efficacy. Nine of the items refer to specific behaviors related to infant care (eg, feeding and bathing), and the last item is a global evaluation of parenting ability. The total score of PES ranges from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher PSE. The Cronbach alpha value of the PES was .74 in the previous study \\[\\].\n\n【39】2.  Parent- Infant Bonding Questionnaire (PIBQ): This is an 8-item, 4-point Likert scale used to measure the parental bonding of both parents \\[\\]. The total scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores suggesting ineffective bonding between mother and infant and vice versa. The cut-off score indicating poor bonding between parent and infant is indicated at 2 \\[\\]. The Cronbach alpha for this questionnaire was .7 in the previous study \\[\\].\n\n【40】3.  Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS): This is a 10-item scale widely used to measure parents' postnatal depression \\[,-\\]. The total score of the EPDS ranges from 0 to 30. The recommended cut-off score of 12 or 13 is used for screening probable cases of postnatal depression. The sensitivity of the EPDS ranges from 68% to 80%, with 77% specificity and a Cronbach alpha of .88 \\[\\].\n\n【41】4.  State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): This is a 40-item 4-point Likert scale used to measure parental anxiety level. The total score for the STAI ranges from 40 to 160, with higher scores indicating greater levels of parental anxiety. The scale has been tested widely in various studies \\[-\\]. The Cronbach alpha for the STAI was .8 in a previous local study \\[\\].\n\n【42】5.  Perceived Social Support for Parenting (PSSP): This is a 4-item scale \\[\\] used to measure the social support parents receive from their partners or others. The score of the 5-point Likert scale ranges from 0 to 20 for the support received from partners or others. The instrument showed high internal consistency and had a Cronbach alpha of .81 in a previous study \\[\\].\n\n【43】6.  What Being the Parent of a Baby is Like (WBPL): The evaluation subscale of the WBPL will be used to measure parenting satisfaction \\[\\]. It consists of 11 items, and each item is a 10-point semantic differential scale ranging from 0 (none of the phenomenon) to 9 (a great deal of the phenomenon). In previous studies, the Cronbach Alpha ranged from .91 to .92 \\[,\\].\n\n【44】7.  Health care utilization and program-related expenses sheet: This sheet will be used to capture all direct health systems cost related to health care services utilized antenatally and postnatally because of maternal or infant related health issues such as hospital admissions and outpatient contacts, health professional's time, program-related time, and during pregnancy, for the first and 3rd month after delivery. The study will take an all-payer health system perspective in which it will attempt to capture all resources that are used by the participants, regardless of who the payer is (ie, government or consumer), including the program cost. The measurement period begins from entry into the program until 3 months post birth.\n\n【45】8.  A semistructured interview guide will be used for the process evaluation. Individual face-to-face interviews will be conducted immediately after the intervention (1 month post birth) to identify strengths and weaknesses and to comment on the content, activities, effectiveness, and delivery methods of the SEPP for participants in the intervention. Parents in the control group will be asked to comment on the current routine perinatal care provided by the hospital. All interviews will be audiorecorded.\n\n【46】Study Procedure\n---------------\n\n【47】The study consists of two phases: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> planning intervention strategies for the intervention group, including the development of the educational content to be covered during the antenatal and postnatal periods and the development of the mHealth app, audio, and videos related to postnatal care, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> implementation of the SEPP and investigating its effectiveness on parental outcomes.\n\n【48】This study has been approved by the ethics board, and recruitment at the antenatal clinics has started at the study venue. The principle investigator and her team will inform nurse managers and clinicians at the antenatal clinics before a RA (RA1) commences the process of recruitment. Before contacting potential participants, the attending nurses and/or clinicians will be approached to assess each couple's physical and psychological well-being before inviting them to participate in the research study. The referred couples will once again be assessed using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. There will be no undue influence or coercion used to recruit couples into the study. Each couple will be given details of the purpose of the study and ample time to ask questions and to consider before deciding to participate. It will be strongly emphasized that their participation is solely voluntary and that they may choose not to participate without any harm or compromise in the care they receive. Verbal and written consent will be obtained from the couple, both mother and father, thereafter. Both first-time and experienced mothers, regardless of their parity, who meet the inclusion criteria, along with their partners, will be recruited. RA1 will visit the antenatal clinics regularly to recruit participants according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be responsible for randomizing the participants.\n\n【49】Once consent has been taken, demographic and baseline data of the participants will be obtained, and randomization will take place. In addition, recruited couples will be asked for their contact details so that they can be contacted for subsequent follow-ups. RA1 will keep in constant contact with the participants to ensure the birth of the newborn. For participants in the intervention group, telephone-based antenatal education session will be delivered by RA1 at the participants' convenience at a prearranged timeslot.\n\n【50】After childbirth, all couples will be reapproached in the postnatal wards by the RA before their day of discharge post childbirth. Before making contact in the postnatal wards, the nurse-in-charge will be approached by RA1 to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of the participants. For participants in the intervention group, the postnatal education session will be delivered by RA1 in the postnatal wards on the day of discharge from the hospital. RA1 will assist parents in downloading the mHealth app and demonstrate the functions of the app before discharge. Participants will also be given individual usernames and passwords for access to the mHealth app. Access to the app will expire automatically in 4 weeks. RA1 will be responsible for answering the queries in the discussion forum and to monitor and correct any inappropriate content shared among parents.\n\n【51】Data Collection\n---------------\n\n【52】A single-blind technique will be adopted, in which the RA (RA2) responsible for the collection of data post intervention or post discharge will not be aware of the treatment allocation, which will be conducted by another RA (RA1). RA2 will be responsible for the collection of all interim and postintervention data, including the process evaluation interviews. Outcome measures will take place at the following time points for all parents: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> during pregnancy, before randomization (baseline); 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> after childbirth, before hospital discharge (interim data); 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> post intervention for the SEPP intervention group and at the end of week 4 post childbirth for the control group (posttest 1); and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> 2 months after the SEPP for the intervention group and 3 months post childbirth for the control group (posttest 2). The period when parents are prone to facing various challenges is at 1 month post birth. Hence, the rationale for collecting posttest 1 data during that time. At 3 months post birth is when some working mothers return to work, signifying a change in environment relating to the rational for collecting posttest 2 data. Before contacting parents for the posttest data, a message will be sent to ensure parents' availability. In the process of data collection, if either parent feels tired, RA2 will respect the parents' decision to continue or terminate the data collection to ensure parents' comfort. The consolidated standards of the reporting trial flowchart for this study is presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> \\[\\].\n\n【53】Process Evaluation\n------------------\n\n【54】Process evaluation will be conducted with the main objective of obtaining parents' opinions and comments of the SEPP intervention. Purposive sampling of parents will be done based on the parenting self-efficacy scores of parents immediately after the end of the intervention (at 1 month post childbirth). This will be done through a semistructured face-to-face interview. Each interview will take approximately 20 to 30 min and will be audiorecorded. Parents will not be included for interview if they refused to be audiorecorded. The recruitment for process evaluation will continue and will only be terminated once the proposed number of interviews is reached or when data saturation is achieved. The semistructured interview guide has been reviewed and approved by the ethics board.\n\n【55】Data Analysis\n-------------\n\n【56】All quantitative data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM Corp). Missing data will be replaced (assuming 10%) for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Both ITT analysis and per-protocol analysis will be conducted to compare any differences between groups. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and range for continuous dates, frequencies, and percentages will be used for nominal and ordinal data. Cronbach alpha will be used to test the internal consistencies of the questionnaires. Inferential statistics such as the independent t test or ANOVA will be used to compare differences of outcomes between or among demographic subgroups. Presuming that outcomes variables are normally distributed, parametric tests will be used. Repeated measures ANCOVA adjusted for confounding variables will be used to test the effect of intervention on outcome variables across four time points. Univariate ANCOVA will be used to test the differences in outcome variables between two groups at the interim and two posttests data separately.\n\n【57】![The consolidated standards of reporting trial flowchart.

All recorded audio will be transcribed verbatim by the RA2 concurrently with data collection to capture nonverbal information. Transcribed data will be classified into different categories, with similar ideas grouped in a category highlighted in the same color. Related codes or categories will be collated together to form subthemes, which will be reviewed and combined to form themes \\[\\]. Two investigators will be involved in the analysis process to compare and discuss the categories, subthemes, and themes that are generated and to achieve consensus. Rigor or trustworthiness, including credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability, will be considered carefully \\[\\].\n\n【59】Ethical Considerations\n----------------------\n\n【60】Ethics approval has been obtained from the National Health Group Domain Specific Review Board (NHG DSRB) before the commencement of the study (Ref. No: NHG DSRB: 2016/00651) in June 2016. All participants are given a set of participant information sheets consisting a brief introduction and the purpose of the study, with the advantages and disadvantages of the study conveyed clearly. The participants are guaranteed anonymity and are informed of the right to withdraw at any point of the study without affecting any subsequent care received.\n\n【61】Results\n=======\n\n【62】Phase 1 of the study has been completed. Educational materials for both antenatal and postnatal education, audio and videos files, and the mHealth app have been developed. For phase 2, the recruitment of study participants commenced in December 2016 and is still ongoing. The targeted aim of recruiting 118 couples will be ongoing for a period of 12 months. The total number of participants approached thus far are 211, and 162 were screened (not interested and did not comply to one of the inclusion criteria). The current enrollment is 49 couples (for both the intervention \\[n=27\\] and control \\[n=22\\] groups). The projected timelines for the completion of the data entry and analysis for investigating the SEPP's effectiveness on parental outcomes is around December 2017.\n\n【63】Discussion\n==========\n\n【64】Theoretical framework--based and technology-enhanced educational programs have shown effectiveness \\[,\\] in influencing parental outcomes in the postnatal period. Previous studies have used varied technologies including telephone calls \\[\\], Web-based programs \\[\\], and mHealth apps \\[,\\] to influence postnatal depression \\[\\], parenting satisfaction, and self-efficacy \\[\\]. The only local study \\[\\] that has used an mHealth app in supporting parents has influenced parental outcomes. However, the effectiveness was tested short-term (1 month post childbirth), and the study showed no influence on parental postnatal depression. A few studies \\[,\\] recommended the need of providing long-term perinatal educational support to parents. Specifically, the previous local study \\[\\] recommended a long-term evaluation of the effectiveness of the educational program beyond 1 month. As such, this study will address this gap in literature by providing empirical support for the feasibility and effectiveness of the SEPP in enhancing parental outcomes across the perinatal period. This will also be the first study in Singapore that will examine the cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention delivered to parents.\n\n【65】We are hopeful that the provision of this technology-based educational program, which includes telephone calls and an mHealth app, will provide a clinically useful and potentially cost-effective solution to improve parental outcomes. This may eventually lead to more positive perinatal parenting experiences, which may influence the psychosocial well-being of both parents and their newborn, leading to better family dynamics and reducing associated health care and social burdens. It may also impact the future reproductive decisions of parents.\n\n【66】It is worthy to note that this study is being tested in a multiracial population, which enhances its relevance in the local context as participants in the study venue have similar demographic profile to Singapore's general population, with the majority of its population being Chinese, followed by Malays and Indians. However, being a single-centered study, it limits its generalizability to an international population and requires further evaluation.\n\n【67】The authors would like to thank the National University of Singapore for the National University Health System Clinician Research grant FY2015 通用删除1(英):<u>(Ref No.: NUHSRO/2016/023/CRG/02)</u>.

The use of the placebo remains the standard practice of biomedical research in spite of the fact that various revisions of the Helsinki Declaration have sought to limit its use. In Canada, the Tri-council policy statement: Ethical conduct for research involving humans adopted a very restrictive position with respect to the use of placebos, precisely defining the situations in which its use would meet the demands of ethical research. The positions taken by the various ethical decision-making bodies are, however, hardly shared by regulatory bodies such as the Food and drug administration (FDA), the Council for international organization of medical sciences (CIOMS) or the European agency for the evaluation of medicinal products (EMEA). This divergence of opinions reveals two quite different conceptions of what constitutes the ethical. In the case of decision-making bodies in the ethical field, it is clearly medicine's Hippocratic Oath which explains their reluctance to use placebos. The first responsibility of the doctor is to \"do no harm\" to his or her patient. This duty is inherent to the medical profession and as such is not grounded in the view of medicine as a contract for care. In the case of regulatory bodies, it is the vision of \"medicine as contract\" which is in view; and it is this notion that justifies the use of placebos once free and informed consent has been obtained. It is also worth noting that these regulatory bodies make frequent use of arguments based on utilitarian ends. In an unprecedented move, the World medical association published in October 2001 a clarification note about the use of placebos. An analysis of this text raises the question about its real meaning: clarification or concession?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "05f89b8e-40d4-426d-9770-d58854258968", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction 删除19:<u>{#Sec1}</u>\n============\n\n【1】The relation between speed and accuracy has been extensively explored in the context of what has become known as the Fitts task, where task requirements are either spatially (Fitts ; Fitts and Peterson ) or both spatially and temporally (Schmidt et al. Wright and Meyer ) defined. This relation, which was found to be universally applicable in a wide variety of situations (albeit with some modifications, depending on the specific task requirements, e.g. Schmidt et al. ), using different end effectors, limbs and participant populations  asserts that faster movements, as they allow less opportunity for online error correction, are less accurate than slower ones.\n\n【2】Speed--accuracy relationship 删除19:<u>{#Sec2}</u>\n----------------------------\n\n【3】In a highly influential article in 1954, Fitts删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fn\"}</u> formulated a logarithmic relation between the duration and the required spatial precision of repetitive aimed upper limb movements, basing his theoretical model on information theory. A decade later, Fitts together with Peterson () demonstrated that a logarithmic relation exists for discrete movements as well. This relationship was shown in later experiments to hold for different subject populations, end effectors and experimental paradigms (Wallace and Newell ; Meyer et al. Plamondon and Alimi ). Whereas some researchers anchored the logarithmic relationship in a different theoretical basis than that of Fitts (e.g. Crossman and Goodeve ), others found an altogether different trade-off relation; for example, Schmidt et al. (), described a linear speed--accuracy trade off using a modified Fitts paradigm, where both movement time and amplitude were controlled, and spatial error was the dependent variable. Wright and Meyer () concluded that a logarithmic trade off was present when the task was spatially defined, and a linear relation came through when the task was temporally constrained.\n\n【4】There has been evidence of models' breakdown on tasks of a low ID (Beamish et al. ), of high frequency (e.g. Crossman and Goodeve ; Schmidt et al. ), of slow speeds (e.g. Schmidt et al. ), when comparing movements performed under different task conditions (e.g. discrete vs. rhythmic; Smits-Engelsman et al. ) or when performing two-handed movements of disparate difficulty (Kelso et al. ) but, to our knowledge, it has never been demonstrated that the relation may be non-monotonic.\n\n【5】Discrete versus rhythmic movements 删除19:<u>{#Sec3}</u>\n----------------------------------\n\n【6】Hogan and Sternad () define discrete movements as ones preceded and succeeded by postures and occupying a non-negligible duration containing no posture, while rhythmic (or, synonymously, cyclic, repetitive or reciprocal) movements are commonly characterized by their periodicity. These authors make the point that there is a continuum between unambiguously rhythmic and unambiguously discrete movements, such that one may refer to the \"degree of discreteness\" and the \"degree of rhythmicity\" of a movement, rather than necessarily classify it as one or the other .\n\n【7】Whereas most researchers studying the speed--accuracy trade off focused on tasks of a discrete nature, some studied and compared both discrete and repetitive movements (Fitts ; Fitts and Peterson ; Crossman and Goodeve ; Schmidt et al. Guiard ; Smits-Engelsman et al. Buchanan et al. ). Their findings were not always in agreement. Fitts and Peterson () concluded that both types of movement follow the same type of behavior, later known as Fitts' Law, with different slopes. Fitts' law describes a dependence between the time to complete a movement and the distance and size of the target (or the task's ID). It is interesting to note that Fitts and Peterson found cyclic movements took longer to complete than discrete movements of the same ID (Fitts and Peterson ). Crossman and Goodeve () and Guiard () also found Fitts' Law to apply to both types of movement, at least approximately.\n\n【8】In contrast, Schmidt et al. () found that when movements are temporally constrained, while in discrete-aiming tasks the endpoint error is directly related to the amplitude and inversely related to the movement time, for reciprocal movements, the endpoint error is directly related to the amplitude and independent of the movement time.\n\n【9】Smits-Engelsman et al. () demonstrated that, contrary to Fitts and Peterson's () results, when participants performed the same task in a discrete, and in a cyclic manner, for the same ID, the latter allows participants to reach twice the speed of the former. They posited that had cyclic movements been but a concatenation of discrete ones, there should have been little difference in the performance between the two. Their results are in line with the view that discrete and cyclic movements are governed by different control principles. Further support for the idea that cyclic and discrete movements are separately controlled comes from a brain-imaging study (Schaal et al. ), as well as from theoretical considerations (Guiard ).\n\n【10】Finally, Buchanan and colleagues performed a series of studies exploring the use of two different units of action, rhythmic and discrete, both separately and within the same movement, and found that as participants approach targets of higher ID, their movements become more discrete in nature, while they are more harmonic in nature when approaching a target of low ID (Buchanan et al. ). As Guiard pointed out earlier, such a correlation between harmonicity and task ID may in fact be a secondary effect, and the result of the slowing down of movement as one reaches to a target of higher ID, as predicted by Fitts' law (Guiard ).\n\n【11】In the traditional paradigm, participants either perform the task as fast as possible (e.g. Fitts ), or at a high frequency (movement time = 180--500 ms, Schmidt et al. Wright and Meyer ), and accuracy is measured at the endpoints of the movement only.\n\n【12】We hypothesized that under further modification to the traditional paradigm, continuously constraining the movement both spatially and temporally, this relationship would be maintained. That is, accuracy would diminish as speed would increase.\n\n【13】Participants were asked to perform horizontal reciprocal flexion/extension movements with their forearm. The experimental paradigm was designed such that timing cues were not explicit, but rather, timing was implicitly dictated by a closed shape on a phase-plane display (where speed is plotted vs. position). The phase plane afforded a way to display target amplitude and frequency of movement to participants without giving them any explicit timing cues (e.g. via a metronome). It is widely used to study dynamical systems, especially those that typically underlie the production of rhythmic behavior (e.g. limit-cycle oscillators; Kelso and Tuller ). A key feature of the phase plane is that it \"suppresses time\"; that is, a phase-plane plot fully characterizes the dynamics of a one-dimensional oscillator yet does not explicitly represent time. Therefore, by using a phase-plane display we were able to give precise instructions about target amplitude and frequency, while minimizing requirements for processing explicit timing information. In order to study which characteristics of the movement change based on visual feedback, we included in each experimental block a few \"blind\" trials, in which the participants did not get visual feedback on their movements.\n\n【14】Unlike the traditional paradigms used in studies of the speed--accuracy trade off, in our task, the closed shape displayed on the phase plane specified both the allowed speed ranges (slow, intermediate or fast), and the allowed movement amplitude. As such, accuracy is not required only at the endpoints, but rather along the entire path. That is, the task required spatio-temporal accuracy, as opposed to strictly spatial accuracy.\n\n【15】To our knowledge, the relation between speed and accuracy in a task that requires co-modulation of speed and position throughout the task, as opposed to tasks that are either spatially or temporally defined, has not been explored.\n\n【16】Methods 删除19:<u>{#Sec4}</u>\n=======\n\n【17】Participants 删除19:<u>{#Sec5}</u>\n------------\n\n【18】Twenty-three healthy adult participants without any known neurological disorders or tremor were tested using their dominant hand in this experiment (age, 52.7 ± 22.3 years; range 22--81 years; 10 females; 13 males). All participants gave their informed consent to participate. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and of the University of California, San Diego.\n\n【19】Equipment 删除19:<u>{#Sec6}</u>\n---------\n\n【20】The equipment used for this experiment consisted of a modified version of the elbow-angle measurement device described in Doeringer and Hogan . A forearm support, consisting of a commercially available wrist splint (Futuro splint wrist brace) strapped to a flat aluminum plate atop a lightweight aluminum tube, was hinged via precision ball bearings to a stationary support, mounted on a table in front of the seated participant. The forearm support was deliberately designed to be as light as possible, to minimize its effect on the natural behavior of the limb. Its moment of inertia was \\~0.0056 kg m^2^, an order of magnitude less than the mean value of the participants' forearm moment of inertia, \\~0.075 kg m^2^.\n\n【21】The forearm support was connected to the shaft of a rotary incremental encoder  with a position resolution of 0.0003 radians per count. The encoder was in turn connected to a counter card inside a computer running the real-time Linux operating system. Using this angle sensor, we were able to display both the position and the velocity of the elbow directly to the participant in real time. The computer controlled the recording of the data, as well as the display, which was a 17-in. monitor, positioned \\~80 cm from a participant's eyes. Data were recorded at 200 Hz. A large, opaque plastic cover was placed parallel to the table, and above the apparatus, such that during the experiment, the participant's forearm was occluded from view (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).Fig. 1The experimental setup. a The forearm is strapped to the angle-measuring device, and is occluded from the participant's view by an opaque cover.

The target forearm behavior was indicated by a region of the phase plane; this region was a doughnut shape formed from two ellipses displayed on the screen. Each ellipse corresponds to a sinusoidal motion about the elbow, with the nonzero width of the doughnut shape allowing for a range of amplitudes and frequencies. The protocol consisted of 3 blocks of 20 trials each. The three blocks were differentiated by the shapes of their target regions; the shape displayed was either 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> a tall thin region (fast, small-amplitude sinusoid), 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> a circular region, or 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> a wide region (slow, large-amplitude sinusoid; see Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). We kept the same dependence between the arm state variables (angular position and velocity) and the display for all blocks because we wanted to minimize unnecessary relearning of the relationship. That is, the same conversion factors were used between the arm state variables and the display in all the blocks. The order of presentation was altered and balanced across participants, such that approximately half of the participants were tested first on the fast block and approximately half were tested first on the slow one; the second block of trials always consisted of the medium-speed condition. Before each block of 20 trials, participants were allowed to practice the movement until they felt comfortable with the task, which usually took about four 40-s practice trials. Each test trial lasted for 20 s. For each block of 20 trials, 5 of them (the second, the last, and three randomly selected) were blind; during these trials, participants could see the doughnut-shaped target region, but not the trace corresponding to their own forearm motion. The instructions to the participants were as follows:Table 1Frequency and amplitude values for the center of each of the three ellipses, as well as the allowed ranges for those parametersEllipseFrequency (Hz)Amplitude (degrees)CenterRangePerformed (mean ± SE)CenterRangePerformed (mean ± SE)Tall (fast)2.31.3--5.51.9 ± 0.076.73.3--10.27.9 ± 0.31Round (medium)0.550.36--0.850.72 ± 0.0216.312.9--19.814.8 ± 0.23Wide (slow)0.160.07--0.30.20 ± 0.00724.620.6--28.622.9 ± 0.23Center frequency values correspond to the frequency of a movement trace along the center of each doughnut.

On some trials, the cursor will not be visible; you won't be able to see the trace of your movement on the screen. In those trials, continue to try and move within the guidelines even though you cannot see the trace (demonstrate).\"\n\n【24】Data analysis 删除19:<u>{#Sec8}</u>\n-------------\n\n【25】Data were analyzed using MATLAB^®^ (7.0.1, The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Trend was removed from the position data, so as to reduce the effects of drift. This was achieved by removing the best straight-line fit from the angular position data. Position and each of its three derivatives, were filtered using a zero-phase (bidirectional) digital filtering with a first order Butterworth filter (bidirectional filtering doubles the filter order) with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz. Velocity was calculated as the difference between every two consecutive points in the filtered position record, multiplied by the sampling frequency and then filtered as described above. In a similar fashion, acceleration and jerk were calculated.\n\n【26】Some of the metrics described below were applied to complete movement cycles, whereas others were applied to each phase-plane quadrant separately. We divided the movement trace from each trial into four quadrants: around positive and negative target peak velocity (N and S, respectively; centered at the forearm's neutral position, at zero crossings in the position trace) and around movement reversals: from extension to flexion and from flexion to extension (E and W, respectively; see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【27】### Accuracy 删除19:<u>{#Sec9}</u>\n\n【28】Each 20-s trial was given a numerical score that represented the percent of the total trial time that was spent inside the target zone on the phase plane. This procedure was repeated separately for each quadrant in the phase plane, as defined above.\n\n【29】### Variability in phase-plane path 删除19:<u>{#Sec10}</u>\n\n【30】Movement traces from each phase-plane quadrant in each trial were resampled to a uniform length. The edges of the resultant vectors were removed, to avoid edge-effects due to resampling. The values from each quadrant were then normalized by the maximum value in that quadrant, and the variability in the path was calculated by taking the standard deviation of the path across the repetitions within the given quadrant.\n\n【31】### Acceleration time as a percent of half-cycle time 删除19:<u>{#Sec11}</u>\n\n【32】The movement trace from each trial was segmented into half cycles (flexion or extension of the elbow), defined by zero crossings in the velocity trace. In each half cycle, the time to peak velocity was calculated, and divided by the total half-cycle time. A smaller proportion of movement time spent prior to reaching peak velocity has been interpreted as indicative of a longer proportion of movement time spent visually directing the movement (Ricker et al. ).\n\n【33】### Smoothness 删除19:<u>{#Sec12}</u>\n\nThe smoothest rhythmic movement can be defined using a \"mean squared jerk\" (MSJ) measure (Nelson ). Accordingly, to evaluate smoothness in each trial, we calculated the average of the rate of change of acceleration (jerk) squared, and divided it by the mean-squared jerk of a corresponding maximally smooth rhythmic movement (Hogan and Sternad ), to obtain the unitless mean-squared jerk ratio (MSJR):$$\\documentclass[12pt]删除19:<u>{minimal}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsmath}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{wasysym}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsfonts}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amssymb}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsbsy}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{mathrsfs}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{upgreek}</u>\n                \\setlength删除19:<u>{\\oddsidemargin}</u>删除19:<u>{-69pt}</u>\n                \\begin删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$ {\\text删除19:<u>{MSJ}</u>} = {\\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>{{t_删除19:<u>{2}</u> - t_删除19:<u>{1}</u> }}}\\int\\limits_删除19:<u>{1}</u>^删除19:<u>{2}</u> {{\\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{2}</u>}\\left| {{\\frac{{{\\text删除19:<u>{d}</u>}^删除19:<u>{3}</u> x}}{{{\\text删除19:<u>{d}</u>}t^删除19:<u>{3}</u> }}}} \\right|}^删除19:<u>{2}</u> {\\text删除19:<u>{d}</u>}t $$\\end删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$$$\\documentclass[12pt]删除19:<u>{minimal}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsmath}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{wasysym}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsfonts}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amssymb}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsbsy}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{mathrsfs}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{upgreek}</u>\n                \\setlength删除19:<u>{\\oddsidemargin}</u>删除19:<u>{-69pt}</u>\n                \\begin删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$ {\\text删除19:<u>{MSJR}</u>} = {\\frac{{{\\text删除19:<u>{MSJ}</u>}_{\\text删除19:<u>{movement}</u>} }}{{{\\text删除19:<u>{MSJ}</u>}_{\\text删除19:<u>{ms}</u>} }}} $$\\end删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$where MSJ~ms~ is the MSJ of the corresponding maximally smooth movement.\n\n【35】As described in appendix II of Hogan and Sternad (), the minimum-MSJ movement is strictly periodic and essentially sinusoidal. Accordingly, we used a sinusoid of the same duration, amplitude and number of peaks as the corresponding maximally smooth movement. Zero crossings in the velocity data were used to define peaks in the position data. Data points before the first and after the last velocity peak were discarded, so that a direct comparison can be made with the corresponding sinusoid. A ratio value approaching unity would indicate a mean-squared jerk value comparable to that of a maximally smooth movement, whereas a value much greater than one would imply the movement is highly fragmented.\n\n【36】### Frequency 删除19:<u>{#Sec13}</u>\n\n【37】The average frequency of movement in each trial was estimated by calculating the reciprocal of twice the average peak-trough horizontal distance in the position record.\n\n【38】Harmonicity 删除19:<u>{#Sec14}</u>\n-----------\n\n【39】Harmonicity of the movement is determined by the features of the acceleration trace (single or multi-peaked, with or without zero crossings) around movement reversals, and provides a measure of the harmonic or inharmonic nature of the movement (Guiard ). For every movement half cycle, between two zero crossings in the position record, the unitless harmonicity index was calculated as follows: when a single peak in acceleration occurred in the half cycle, the harmonicity value was set to one; when an inflection occurred in the half-cycle acceleration trace, movement harmonicity was computed as the ratio of the minimum to the maximum absolute value of the acceleration within the given half cycle; finally, if the acceleration trace within the half cycle changed its sign, the harmonicity value was set to zero (Guiard ; Buchanan et al. ). Harmonicity values were then averaged across the entirety of each 20-s trial. A harmonicity value approaching one indicates a highly harmonic movement, whereas a value approaching zero implies mechanical energy is dissipated in the vicinity of movement reversal (Buchanan et al. ).\n\n【40】### Posture 删除19:<u>{#Sec15}</u>\n\n【41】A posture can be defined by a non-negligible duration in which only negligible movement occurs, and, if found in a series of reciprocal movements, may indicate the movements are of a discrete nature (Hogan and Sternad ). Around every movement reversal in each trial, the acceleration trace was scanned for values approaching zero, that is, below a certain threshold (ε = 0.1 rad/s^2^), which were maintained for a duration greater than δ = 6 ms. If this condition was met, it was determined that posture occurred at this movement reversal. The percent of movement reversals in each trial that contained postures was then calculated.\n\n【42】Statistical analysis 删除19:<u>{#Sec16}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【43】Unless otherwise noted, a non-parametric paired test, the sign test, was used to test the significance of differences between data sets. This non-parametric test was chosen to eliminate the need for assumptions regarding population distributions required in parametric tests. The Holm--Bonferroni correction was applied where necessary, to avoid type-I error.\n\n【44】Results 删除19:<u>{#Sec17}</u>\n=======\n\n【45】Velocity traces from each of the three experimental blocks (slow, medium and fast) of one participant are shown in Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【46】The frequencies at which the participants performed the three blocks (slow, medium, and fast), with and without visual feedback, are plotted in Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Average movement frequencies were slightly but significantly higher during the vision trials, compared with the blind trials, in the slow and the medium blocks (p \\< 0.0005). Figure 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> demonstrates that participants did not perform the task at the entire range of allowed frequencies, but rather executed the task at a narrow range of frequencies.Fig. 3Frequency values for the vision and no-vision conditions in each of the three blocks (slow, medium, fast).

As we expected, accuracy scores on the vision trials expressed as the percent of the movement time spent inside the target zone on the phase plane, were lower (significantly, p \\< 0.005) when participants performed the medium block compared to the slower block. However, rather than a further drop in accuracy when tracing the tall ellipse on the phase plane, participants' accuracy scores were significantly (p \\< 0.0125) higher in that block compared to the medium one. Aging often affects motor performance in terms of speed as well as accuracy (e.g. Smith et al. Poston et al. ). In order to test whether age plays a role in the observed differences among the blocks, we separated the participant population into two groups, by age: a young group (22--39 years, 10 participants) and an old group (65--81 years, 13 participants), and repeated the analysis separately for each group. As expected, the younger group performed better than the older group (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, this difference between the groups reached significance only in the intermediate block, and the overall trend was maintained in both groups. Having established that this trend is consistent in both age groups and that in two out of the three blocks performance did not differ significantly between the two groups, we re-pooled the data for further analysis. Using paired statistical analysis ensured that each participant served as his/her own control, as relative, rather than absolute, performance was compared across experimental conditions. Performance in the absence of visual feedback was significantly lower in each of the blocks (22, 48 and 32% lower than the vision scores in the slow, medium and fast blocks, respectively; p \\< 0.003). In the blind trials, as in the vision trials, a significant drop in accuracy was found between the slow and medium blocks (p \\< 0.0001), and a significant increase between the medium and the fast blocks (p \\< 0.0005).Fig. 4Accuracy (percent time in doughnut) values for the three vision (black) and three blind (white) blocks.

Error bars represent standard error</u>\n\n【48】This non-monotonic relation between the accuracy on the task and the speed at which the task is performed suggests that there may be multiple sources of movement accuracy, and that these become either more or less important depending on the movement speed. We explored the differences among the blocks in an effort to identify potential sources of accuracy.\n\n【49】We analyzed the accuracy data from each quadrant separately (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). A Freidman test was used to examine the effect of quadrant on movement accuracy, followed by a multiple comparison test, where warranted. In the slow block, accuracy values from all four quadrants were similar (86.2 ± 2.4--87.2 ± 3.5%) and did not differ significantly from one another. In the fast block, a main effect of quadrant on movement accuracy was found (p \\< 0.025). In this block, there is evidence that movements were on average more accurate at movement reversals (E and W, 80.3 ± 3.4 and 82.1 ± 2.6%, respectively), than around target peak velocity (N and S, 76.7 ± 3.1 and 74.7 ± 2.7%, respectively), but a significant difference was found only between the S and the W quadrants. In the intermediate block, a main effect of quadrant on movement accuracy was also found (p \\< 0.0001). In this block, the trend observed in the fast block reaches significance. The E (80.1 ± 1.7%) and W (77.3 ± 2.2%) quadrants each are significantly more accurate than the N (61.5 ± 3.5%) and S (65.1 ± 2.1%) quadrants, whereas there is no significant difference between the E and W or between the N and S quadrants.Fig. 6Accuracy values by quadrant.

Error bars represent standard error\n\n【50】A Freidman test revealed a significant main effect of quadrant on movement variability (p \\< 0.0001). Post hoc tests showed that the variability in the movement path in all three blocks was significantly higher in the N and S quadrants than in the E and W quadrants (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).Fig. 7Variability in the phase-plane path by quadrant.

Indeed, using the MSJR measure, we found that smoothness decreased with decreasing movement speed (p \\< 0.005; see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). We employed a power-law model to represent the change in MSJR with the average frequency:$$\\documentclass[12pt]删除19:<u>{minimal}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsmath}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{wasysym}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsfonts}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amssymb}</u> \n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{amsbsy}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{mathrsfs}</u>\n                \\usepackage删除19:<u>{upgreek}</u>\n                \\setlength删除19:<u>{\\oddsidemargin}</u>删除19:<u>{-69pt}</u>\n                \\begin删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$ {\\text删除19:<u>{MSJR}</u>} = a \\times {\\text删除19:<u>{frequency}</u>}^删除19:<u>{b}</u> $$\\end删除19:<u>{document}</u>$$Fig. 9MSJR (relative smoothness) values for the three vision blocks (slow, medium, fast).

It is important to note that an MSJR value close to unity, as found for the fast block (MSJR = 1.21) indicates movement that is nearly maximally smooth. The smoothest back-to-back sequence of discrete movements was found to yield an MSJR value of 6 (Hogan and Sternad ); in the medium condition the mean MSJR value was 6.35, and in the slow condition it approached a value of 600.\n\n【54】Harmonicity values for the three blocks are shown in Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Differences among all blocks were significant (p \\< 0.0001; see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Of particular note is that the mean harmonicity value for the fast vision block was 0.95 (0.97 in the blind trials; the difference is significant p \\< 0.0005), indicating movements of harmonic nature, whereas the mean harmonicity values for the medium and slow blocks were 0.3 (0.25, ns) and 0.0008 ns (0.004, ns), respectively, supporting an interpretation that they are composed of a string of discrete action units (Guiard ; Buchanan et al.

Error bars represent standard error\n\n【56】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#Sec18}</u>\n==========\n\n【57】Summary of results 删除19:<u>{#Sec19}</u>\n------------------\n\n【58】We found a non-monotonic relation between the speed of movement and the combined accuracy of speed and position. While accuracy scores dropped from the slow to the medium speed, they increased between the medium and the fast speeds. This trend persisted in the data regardless of the age of the participants performing the movements. We explored potential indicators of different movement types in the three experimental blocks, which may point to utilization of alternative sources of movement accuracy. We found that movements in the fast block were nearly maximally smooth, and nearly maximally harmonic. In contrast, movements in the medium and slow blocks were approximately as smooth as the smoothest concatenation of discrete movements, or less, and had mean harmonicity values not greater than 0.3, supporting an interpretation that they are composed of a string of discrete action units (Buchanan et al. ). Furthermore, nearly 100% of movement reversals in the slow block and more than 50% of those in the medium block were punctuated by postures, compared with 1% of movement reversals in the fast block.\n\n【59】These results suggest that when performing movements in the fast block, which were more rhythmic in nature, participants may have used the elastic properties of the limb to achieve not only high smoothness, and to conserve mechanical energy (Guiard ; Mottet and Bootsma ), but also to achieve repeatability (van Mourik and Beek ), and hence accuracy.\n\n【60】In contrast, in the medium and the slow blocks, participants may have made use of visual feedback to achieve movement accuracy, and within these blocks, slower movements afford more time for visual corrections, and are therefore at once more accurate and less smooth.\n\n【61】Indeed, in the slow block the accelerative phase in each half cycle was the shortest of all three blocks, consistent with the interpretation that more time was spent processing visual feedback in each half cycle (Buchanan et al. ). This may also be the result of a more flat target velocity profile, indicated by the short, wide ellipse on the phase plane. In the intermediate block the accelerative phase was significantly longer, affording less time for visual feedback processing. Whereas accuracy remained approximately constant throughout the entire cycle in the slow block, in the intermediate block, where less time was available for visual feedback-based corrections, it was significantly lower around ±target peak velocity (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). While yet less time was available in the fast block for such corrections, average accuracy values around ±target peak velocity were higher in this block, suggesting a different, non-feedback-based mechanism was employed to achieve accuracy in those trials.\n\n【62】While the task requirements in the intermediate block afforded less time for vision-based corrections than in the slow block, participants in fact relied on that feedback to a larger extent in this block, as evidenced by the larger relative drop in accuracy upon withdrawal of visual feedback in the intermediate block (\\~50%) compared with the slow block (\\~20%). The shape of the target ellipse in the slow block allowed for a relatively wider spread of speeds (in terms of percent of mean target peak speed), thus less susceptible to removal of visual feedback than the medium block. A drop of 30% in the accuracy of the fast trials upon withdrawal of visual feedback suggests that participants benefit from visual feedback in this block, most likely for calibration of the neutral position, as well as the horizontal and vertical extent, over successive cycles within a trial.\n\n【63】In the intermediate block, movements were not only less accurate in the N and S quadrants, but also most variable in those quadrants. In fact, these quadrants exhibited a higher variability compared with the E and W quadrants in all three blocks. The different number of cycle repetitions in each block limits the ability to compare variability from block to block. Yet, it is interesting to note that in the E and W quadrants, where path variability is lower, movements in the intermediate block are on average more variable than the corresponding movements in both the fast and the slow blocks. This may indicate that an instability emerges as movements are performed close to the boundary between two types of movements (Buchanan et al. ).\n\n【64】The finding that movements performed at the fastest speed required by the experimental paradigm were more accurate than at the intermediate speed, in terms of co-modulation of speed and position throughout the movement, was surprising because we expected the broadly applicable principle that there is a trade off between movement speed and accuracy to apply here as well.\n\n【65】Movement amplitude 删除19:<u>{#Sec20}</u>\n------------------\n\n【66】It may be argued that in the fast block participants had the benefit of smaller-amplitude movements, which may have contributed to the increased accuracy. While we believe movement amplitude plays an important role, it is not likely to be the sole reason for the increased accuracy observed in the fast block compared with the medium block. When comparing the slow and the medium blocks, movement accuracy declines in the medium compared with the slow, despite a decrease in amplitude, suggesting that the smaller amplitude in the fast block is not uniquely responsible for the increased accuracy.\n\n【67】Mechanical filtering? 删除19:<u>{#Sec21}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【68】It may be that \"mechanical filtering\" due to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the inertial properties of the moving limb or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the increase in stiffness with speed (Nagasaki ; van Galen and de Jong ) account for the smoothing of the movement at high frequencies. We demonstrate that this is not the case, as evidenced by a small, yet significant, increase in intermittency with vision in the fast block, compared to the no-vision condition 通用删除8(英):<u>\\</u>, despite a nonsignificant change in frequency (see Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). In other words, the smoothness is found to be significantly different between two conditions where the limb moves at essentially indistinguishable frequencies. The observation that movements at the highest frequency were approaching maximal smoothness cannot, therefore, be dismissed as a mere artifact of biomechanics. That does not, however, exclude the possibility that the mechanical properties of the limb were being harnessed to produce a highly smooth movement. This is a subtle, yet important point: while we argue that mechanical filtering is not the reason for high smoothness values at high frequencies, the mechanical properties of the limb are likely exploited, such that all that needs to be set for a movement is the neutral position and muscle stiffness, thereby pre-programming the amplitude and frequency of the movement (Nelson ), and intervention is only in the form of an escapement---a mechanism whereby energy is released at exactly the amount needed to compensate for dissipative losses (Kelso et al. ) thereby operating as a limit-cycle oscillator.\n\n【69】Information processing versus energy-saving considerations 删除19:<u>{#Sec22}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【70】Many of the theories that were brought forth to describe the reasons for the speed--accuracy dependence, though successful in describing the kinematic aspects of the movement, do not consider the biomechanical muscle properties and their role in controlling endpoint accuracy (cf. van Galen and de Jong ; Guiard ; Khan and Franks ; Smits-Engelsman et al. ). Smits-Engelsman et al. (, ) suggest three of the possible reasons for what they found to be a higher information-processing rate in cyclic than in discrete movements: use of spinal neural oscillators, alternative sources of force, and a more cost-effective use of the recruited force. They cite physiological studies showing that contractions are more effective when they occur in muscles which have just previously been stretched, and when they are eccentric, rather than concentric. Smits-Engelsman et al. () offer an explanation for what may happen at the discrete/rhythmic interface: they argue that possibly, when performing cyclic movements, alternative sources of force recruitment are used, such as the elasticity of muscles and tendons. These may account for a check on the increase in impulse variability and may, in fact, contribute to the observed higher accuracy scores in the fast block.\n\n【71】Furthermore, in a rhythmic movement, the limb need not come to a full rest at the position extremes, such that acceleration does not equal zero at those points. Energy is saved in eliminating the need to coordinate agonist and antagonist muscle activity to reach a full stop before initiating the next movement portion (Guiard ). That maximally smooth movement is within 2% of that which minimizes energy expenditure has been demonstrated mathematically (Nelson ). Energy-saving considerations have been brought up in the context of gait patterns---e.g. running versus walking (Alexander )---and choice of gait type has been discussed in terms of both speed and step amplitude (Srinivasan and Ruina ), and these may well be paralleled in the upper limbs.\n\n【72】Discrete versus rhythmic movements: can it explain our findings? 删除19:<u>{#Sec23}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【73】Our salient finding that at the highest examined movement speed (the fast block), as well as at the largest examined movement amplitude (the slow block), accuracy was higher than at an intermediate speed and amplitude (the medium block) seems at odds with the theories put forth by Schmidt et al. (): they posited that, for discrete rapid aiming movements, increased speed necessitates increased impulse size, which, in turn, leads to an increase in output variability; for reciprocal movements, they asserted that output variability is proportional to movement amplitude only. However, on the reciprocal task at hand, we found movements at larger amplitudes to be more accurate. What may account for this finding? It has been suggested that continuous cyclic arm movements, if performed sufficiently slowly, exhibit kinematic features that suggest they may be executed as a sequence of discrete movements (Buchanan et al. Hogan and Sternad ), which may be described as overlapping movement units (Morasso and Mussa Ivaldi ; Flash and Henis ; Krebs et al. ). If, as we argue, the movements in the slow and the medium blocks in our experiment fall under this definition -- that is, if they are executed as a string of discrete movements, as is suggested by the smoothness and harmonicity analyses---then Schmidt et al.'s () theory regarding discrete movements holds for these two blocks. Namely, the faster speed in the intermediate condition compared to the slow condition resulted in increased error. That is, if we consider the slow and the medium blocks in isolation from the fast block, then the model suggested by Schmidt et al. () correctly predicts the decrease in accuracy with an increase in speed.\n\n【74】Can the movements in the slow and the medium blocks be classified as more discrete in nature and ones in the fast block as more rhythmic in nature?\n\n【75】Indeed, a remarkable parallel can be observed between the fast (\\~2 Hz) movements in our experiment and maximally smooth movements on the one hand; and between the movements in the medium (\\~0.6 Hz) and slow (\\~0.2 Hz) ranges in our experiment and a concatenation of discrete movements on the other (Doeringer and Hogan ). The former are fast, yet relatively accurate and smooth, while the latter exhibit a decrease in accuracy and increase in smoothness with increasing speed. This is despite the fact that the task instructions were uniform throughout the experiment, calling for cyclic movements only (none of the tasks was discrete in nature).\n\n【76】Schaal et al. (), using functional neuroimaging, found that rhythmic movement activated a small number of unilateral primary motor areas, whereas discrete movement activated additional contralateral nonprimary motor areas and showed a strong bilateral activity in the cerebrum and the cerebellum. These researchers studied movements that belonged unambiguously to one of the two categories (discrete and rhythmic). The results of the current study, together with results from Buchanan et al. (), suggest the task conditions under which participants may choose to switch from employing one type of movement to another, thereby allowing a directed exploration of the brain-activation pattern associated with the \"grey area\" between distinctly continuous and distinctly discrete movement generation.\n\n【77】Two regimes 删除19:<u>{#Sec24}</u>\n-----------\n\n【78】These findings suggest a possible separation of the frequency/amplitude plane of repetitive movements into what may be called a \"truly cyclic\" regime, at frequency values in the vicinity of the inverse of the visual reaction time (\\>1 Hz), and small amplitudes, where movements approach maximal smoothness, and a \"pseudo-cyclic\" regime at lower frequencies and higher amplitudes, where movements are not maximally smooth, and higher speed results in decreased accuracy and increased smoothness. Movements in both regimes are rhythmic in the sense that no planned stop is made between half cycles, and movement is performed continuously. Any postures, as defined quantitatively above, are the result of the very slow required movement, and are likely a manifestation of the motor system's inability to perform movements that are that slow in a smooth manner (Doeringer and Hogan ). However, movements in the \"pseudo-cyclic\" regime share many features with discrete movements. In our experiment, amplitude and frequency were co-varied, and therefore, we cannot comment on their individual contributions to the choice of regime. Additionally, within what we term the \"truly cyclic\" regime, accuracy and smoothness may vary with speed, but we cannot comment on the form of the function, since we only measured behavior on a single frequency in that regime. Nagasaki's results 通用删除7(英):<u>(1991)</u> suggest a third regime, above 3--4.3 Hz, where movements cease to be \"rhythmic\" and adopt a symmetric non-linear control mechanism. The boundaries that define these regimes may well depend on the executing limb and/or the limb segment.\n\n【79】Plamondon and Alimi () suggested a model for rapid-aimed movements in which intermittency is not the result of feedback-based \"corrections\", but is part of a well-trained feedforward loop, which echoes suggestions made by Meyer et al. () and Elliott et al. (). Intermittency, then, may be, at least in part, the result of limitations on the frequency/amplitude of the basic submovement. That is, there may be limits on the duration and amplitude of what may constitute a single, uninterrupted smooth motion. Movements that take longer to complete, or that stretch over larger amplitudes may necessitate the concatenation of several such movement subunits. As such, these movements would be characterized by high intermittency, as the jerk of a reciprocal maximally smooth movement is 1/6th of that of the smoothest back-to-back sequence of discrete movements (Hogan and Sternad ).\n\n【80】At the high-frequency end of the \"pseudo-cyclic\" regime, movements are inherently less smooth than maximally smooth movements, unable to benefit from the biomechanically induced increased accuracy privileges of the \"truly cyclic\" regime and, at the same time, have more limited time than lower-frequency movements to make use of feedback during the movement. Such a mechanism is congruent with our findings that show smoothness to decrease monotonically with decreasing speed, and that reveal movements in the intermediate block to have the lowest accuracy scores of all three examined frequencies.\n\n【81】It is important to keep in mind that the two \"regimes\" that we describe are not the result of different experimental procedures. Rather, the results are all the more illuminating because the type of task required of the participants was identical: they were asked to perform a rhythmic motion in all three conditions. That they produced a maximally smooth movement in one of the conditions (fast, small-amplitude movements), and more intermittent movements in the two other conditions (slower, larger-amplitude movements), and that the accuracy score was not a monotonic function of speed suggests that when crossing a frequency/amplitude boundary, participants switch to a different, possibly more energy-efficient mode, characterized by maximal smoothness and relatively higher accuracy. A similar notion of a frequency-dependence of the control mechanisms underlying cyclic motions was advanced by Nagasaki (), though he investigated transitions at higher frequencies. He also noted a decrease in energy expenditure when participants moved at frequencies greater than 3.3 Hz.\n\n【82】Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#Sec25}</u>\n===========\n\n【83】In summary, we tested participants on a task involving rhythmic forearm movements at three speeds. We found that movement smoothness decreased with decreasing speed. However, accuracy of speed and position measured throughout the trajectory was not a monotonic function of speed. Movements at the intermediate condition were significantly less accurate than movements performed at either a higher or a lower speed. We suggest a model of rhythmic movements where the plane of the movements' frequency/amplitude combinations is separated into two regimes. In the high-frequency, small-amplitude regime, movements approach maximal smoothness, possibly due to an exploitation of the elastic properties of the limb for achievement of movement accuracy. In the low-frequency, large-amplitude regime, movements are not maximally smooth, possibly due to the increased required duration and distance, and are more intermittent and more accurate with decreasing frequency, probably due to the dependence on sensory feedback for achievement of movement accuracy. The results of this study warrant further investigation into the individual contributions of movement duration and movement amplitude to movement smoothness.\n\n【84】This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research (NICHD/NCMRR) grant 1 R01-HD045343 and NIH grant 2 R01-NS036449; and the VA Veterans Affairs grants B3688R and B3607R.

The combined effects of peritonitis and the continuous exposure to dialysis fluid remain the most likely candidates affecting the peritoneum in the long term. The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of peritonitis and dialysis on longitudinal peritoneal function. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was utilized to quantify longitudinal changes in low-molecular-weight solute transfer (D/P(creat)) and ultrafiltration (UF) in 233 patients treated with CAPD. Of these, 166 represented an unselected cohort (Group 1) studied prospectively from commencing treatment for up to 54 months, and 67 were selected patients (Group 2) with PET data available at commencement of the study, having been on dialysis for a minimum of 18 months. PETs were performed either 6-monthly or following peritonitis episodes. Data on the short-term effect of peritonitis kinetics were pooled for groups 1 and 2. Single, isolated episodes (n = 86) had no significant effect on D/P(creat) or UF, whereas recurrences or clusters of infection (n = 70) caused increases in D/P(creat) and reductions in UF, the significance of which increased with the number of episodes. There were significant correlations between both changes in D/P(creat) and UF with the cumulative dialysate leukocyte count, regardless of infecting organism, suggesting that intensity of peritoneal inflammation is also important. Those organisms associated with greater change in peritoneal kinetics, e.g. S. aureus, Pseudomonas, also had the highest neutrophil counts. The longitudinal changes in peritoneal kinetics were analysed for patients in group 1 only. There was a highly significant increase in D/P(creat) after 6 months treatment; this increased further with time on treatment, reaching further significance at 42 and 48 months. There was an associated reduction in UF. In view of the short-term effects of peritonitis on kinetics group 1 was further subdivided into patients who were either peritonitis free or only experienced isolated infections, group 1a, and those that had multiple infection episodes, group 1b. Treatment drop-out, due to death or technical failure occurred at double the rate in group 1b, who also had significantly higher D/P(creat) and lower UF at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of treatment. Group 1a subsequently caught up, however, indicating that peritonitis is not the only factor influencing long-term changes in peritoneal kinetics. These data suggest that solute transfer increases and UF declines with time on peritoneal dialysis.

The goal of this consensus report is to critically appraise the evidence and to subsequently present interpretive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of regenerative therapy for the treatment of furcation defects and recommendations for future research in this area. A systematic review was conducted before the consensus meeting. This review aims to evaluate and present the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of different regenerative approaches for the treatment of furcation defects in specific clinical scenarios compared with conventional surgical therapy. During the meeting, the outcomes of the systematic review, as well as other pertinent sources of evidence, were discussed by a committee of nine members. The consensus group members submitted additional material for consideration by the group in advance and at the time of the meeting. The group agreed on a comprehensive summary of the evidence and also formulated recommendations for the treatment of furcation defects via regenerative therapies and the conduction of future studies. Histologic proof of periodontal regeneration after the application of a combined regenerative therapy for the treatment of maxillary facial, mesial, distal, and mandibular facial or lingual Class II furcation defects has been demonstrated in several studies. Evidence of histologic periodontal regeneration in mandibular Class III defects is limited to one case report. Favorable outcomes after regenerative therapy for maxillary Class III furcation defects are limited to clinical case reports. In Class I furcation defects, regenerative therapy may be beneficial in certain clinical scenarios, although generally Class I furcation defects may be treated predictably with non-regenerative therapies. There is a paucity of data regarding quantifiable patient-reported outcomes after surgical treatment of furcation defects. Based on the available evidence, it was concluded that regenerative therapy is a viable option to achieve predictable outcomes for the treatment of furcation defects in certain clinical scenarios. Future research should test the efficacy of novel regenerative approaches that have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of therapy in clinical scenarios associated historically with less predictable outcomes. Additionally, future studies should place emphasis on histologic demonstration of periodontal regeneration in humans and also include validated patient-reported outcomes. Based on the prevailing evidence, the following clinical recommendations could be offered. 1) Periodontal regeneration has been established as a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of various furcation defects, among which Class II defects represent a highly predictable scenario. Hence, regenerative periodontal therapy should be considered before resective therapy or extraction; 2) The application of a combined therapeutic approach (i.e. barrier, bone replacement graft with or without biologics) appears to offer an advantage over monotherapeutic algorithms; 3) To achieve predictable regenerative outcomes in the treatment of furcation defects, adverse systemic and local factors should be evaluated and controlled when possible; 4) Stringent postoperative care and subsequent supportive periodontal therapy are essential to achieve sustainable long-term regenerative outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Women, except for those with a history of hysterectomy, underwent a urine pregnancy test, as pregnancy is a contraindication to computed tomography scanning. There were no positive urine pregnancy tests among the study participants. Participants then completed weight, height, waist/hip circumferences, and blood pressure measures (millimeters of mercury \\[mmHg\\]). Height was measured to the nearest 0.25 inch, and weight was measured to the nearest 0.25 lb using a standard balance scale. Height and weight measurements were used to calculate a body-mass index for each subject using the Quetelet\\'s equation (kg/m^2^)\\[\\]. Automated Welch Allyn^©^sphygmomanometers were used to measure heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in each arm using a size-appropriate cuff. The measures were taken after the participant was seated quietly for 5-minutes with both feet flat on the floor and the back comfortably supported. An average heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure was calculated for each subject based on two separate measures.\n\n【11】Demographic and health behavior measures\n----------------------------------------\n\n【12】The NTHH study utilized standardized questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to collect a selected number of demographic and health behavior information. Age was registered as a continuous variable (years). Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic, and other. Education was measured by the question, \\\"What is the highest grade or year of school that you completed?\\\" Responses were then categorized as \\\"less than high school\\\", \\\"high school graduate/GED\\\", or \\\"some college or greater\\\". Smoking status was assessed by asking, \\\"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?\\\" Subjects were categorized as smokers if they responded \\\"Yes\\\".\n\n【13】Physiologic and clinical measures\n---------------------------------\n\n【14】The presence of coronary calcium was measured using a 16-slice MSCT scan and characterized as a dichotomous variable, consistent with previous studies \\[,\\]: presence of calcification (Agatston score 通用删除7(英):<u>(31)</u> of greater than zero) or no calcification (Agatston score of zero). The MSCT took images every 3 mm from the carina to the base of the heart, and double inspiration was used to minimize breathing motion artifact on images. The participant had an electrocardiogram machine attached to correlate the heart rate with the images for the Vitrea software to calculate quantitative calcium scores. The total time in the scanner was 10-15 minutes, which was open with no contrast was given. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) quantification was reviewed and interpreted by a radiologist from Radiology Associates at the Center for Diagnostic Imaging at the University of North Texas Health Science Center who was blinded to participant characteristics.\n\n【15】Clinical factors included history of a first degree relative with heart disease, depression symptomatology, hypertension, diabetes, and lipid status. Fasting (8 hour) blood was collected for serum chemistries and analyzed using a commercial laboratory. History of a first degree relative with heart disease was categorized as yes or no. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptomatology (Cronbach α.85-.90)\\[\\]. The CES-D measures current level of depressive symptomatology with emphasis on the affective component, depressed mood. The CES-D score was dichotomized into high depressive symptomatology (scores ≥ 17) and low depressive symptomatology (score \\< 17) based on previous research. Hypertension was considered present if the blood pressure was greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg for systolic or diastolic pressure, the subject reported being diagnosed with hypertension, or the subject was taking antihypertensive medications. Diabetes was considered present if the fasting glucose level was greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, the subject reported being previously diagnosed with diabetes, or the subject was taking any diabetic medication. Hyperlipidemia was considered to be present if the participant had a LDL≥160 mg/dL, the participant reported being previously diagnosed with high cholesterol, or the participant was taking a lipid lowering medication.\n\n【16】Self-reported racial discrimination and response to unfair treatment\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Self-reported racial discrimination (hereafter referred to as discrimination) and response to unfair treatment were measured using the Experience of Discrimination (EOD) instrument, which was validated in English and Spanish among a population of low-wage African American, Latino, and white workers (Cronbach\\'s alpha ≥ 0.74, r = 0.79)\\[,\\]. The EOD asks about ever experiencing discrimination, being prevented from doing something, being hassled or made to feel inferior because of race, ethnicity, or color in each of the following nine domains: at school; getting a job; at work; getting housing; getting medical care; getting service in a store or restaurant; getting credit, bank loans or a mortgage; on the street or in a public setting; or from the police or in the courts. The instrument was available to participants in English or Spanish. Discrimination was modeled as a dichotomous variable (no discrimination/any discrimination). Response to unfair treatment was measured by asking respondents, \\\"If you have been treated unfairly, do you usually 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> talk to other people about it or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> keep it to yourself?\\\" Based on the instrument\\'s guidelines, participants were categorized as passively responsive in which they internalized their action, or actively responsive in which they talked to others or did something about their experience.\n\n【18】Statistical analyses\n--------------------\n\n【19】All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0\\[\\]. Descriptive statistics are provided for all variables. Counts and frequencies are provided for categorical data, and means and standard deviations are provided for continuous variables. Independent sample t tests and chi-square analyses were performed to test for differences in independent variables between participants with a CAC score of zero and those with a CAC score greater than zero 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Logistic regression was performed, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated 删除21:<u>(Tables 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>.

final model. Multicollinearity was assessed using Tolerance and Variation Inflation Factor (VIF) with all variables in the final model. No collinear relationships were identified. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether depression symptomatology (i.e, CES-D) should be included in the final adjusted model. This was examined due to a lack of literature supporting the inclusion of depression symptomatology and the lack of significance in the unadjusted association between depression and CAC. A full regression model was composed with depression, and another model was composed without depression. The change in the -2 Log Likelihood was used to assess change in the fit of the model. Including depression symptomatology in the model decreased the -2 Log Likelihood. Missing data were imputed for discrimination and CES-D using the individual mean imputation method, which imputes a value based on how a subject responds to other questions. This method was chosen because of its simplicity and accuracy\\[\\]. Missing data were not imputed for CAC scores (10.7% missing), unfair treatment (1.6% missing), gender (0.4% missing), education (0.4% missing), smoking (1.8% missing), diabetes (0.9%), hypertension (2.1%), hyperlipidemia (1.2% missing), 1st degree family member with a history of heart disease (3.0% missing), BMI (0.9% missing), and age (0.5%missing). There were no missing data for race/ethnicity, hypertension status, or diabetes status. This resulted in a final sample size of 510.\n\n【74】Results\n=======\n\n【75】Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> depicts the characteristics of the study population. One hundred eighty-six participants (32.6%) had CAC present with scores ranging from 0 to 5098 Agatston (mean = 33, standard deviation = 385). Participants with CAC were older, male, white, had higher BMI, smoked, were diabetic, were hypertensive, had hyperlipidemia, and had a first degree relative with heart disease (p \\< 0.05 for all variables) compared to participants without calcification. The prevalence of CAC was similar in different education level groups, those reporting high or low depressive symptomatology, and those actively or passively responding to unfair treatment. Among those reporting any discrimination, 46.8% were African American, 36.1% were Hispanic, and 17.1% were white. Discrimination was reported by 35.5% of participants with coronary calcification and by 38.6% of participants without calcification (p = 0.50).\n\n【76】Results of the simple logistic regression model are shown in Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. Age and BMI were significantly associated with CAC. Men were 2.5 times more likely to have CAC present compared to females, while African Americans and Hispanics were 45% and 63%, respectively, less likely to have calcification compared to whites. Those who smoked, had diabetes, had hypertension, and had hyperlipidemia were more likely to have CAC present. Those with a 1^st^degree relative with heart disease were approximately 1.5 times more likely to have CAC present. Education, depressive symptomatology, response to unfair treatment, and discrimination were not associated with CAC presence in these unadjusted models.\n\n【77】Race/ethnicity did not modify the relationship between discrimination and CAC. However, response to unfair treatment was found to significantly modify this relationship (p \\< 0.001). Hence, the simple logistic regression model assessing the relationship between discrimination and CAC and the multiple logistic regression results were stratified by active and passive response to unfair treatment. The sensitivity analysis found depression symptomatology to decrease the fit of the model; hence, it was not included in the final adjusted model.\n\n【78】The simple logistic regression models for discrimination and CAC stratified by response to unfair treatment are presented in Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. Among those who passively responded, participants who had experienced discrimination were 25% more likely to have CAC present, although this was not statistically significant. Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> provides results for the adjusted logistic regression model. Among those who actively responded to unfair treatment, only increasing age, being male, and being Hispanic were significantly associated with the presence of CAC. Among those who passively responded to unfair treatment, increasing age, being male, being African American, and having a positive smoking status were significantly associated with CAC. Interestingly, the odds of having CAC present were approximately 3 times higher for those who experienced discrimination and passively responded to unfair treatment.\n\n【79】Discussion\n==========\n\n【80】This study of asymptomatic U.S. adults of different racial/ethnic identity is the first to our knowledge to support the association between experiencing racial discrimination and an increased risk of coronary artery calcification, a marker for atherosclerosis. Our results contradict two other studies that have investigated the influence of racial discrimination or unfair treatment and subclinical atherosclerosis\\[,\\]. Both previous studies were restricted to women and both found that \\\"everyday\\\" discrimination was associated with subclinical coronary artery disease, measured by coronary calcium \\[\\] and intima-media thickness,\\[\\] although one reported the association only among African American females and the relationship was not statistically significant\\[\\]. However, when both studies restricted this association to racial discrimination, the association was no longer apparent. The authors concluded that it is not the attribution of discrimination but the experience of chronic discrimination that influences CAC. Neither study assessed how response to unfair treatment modified the association between self-reported discrimination and sub-clinical atherosclerosis. Our findings parallel studies that have found discrimination to be associated with hypertension among those who passively respond, or internalize their response, to unfair treatment\\[,\\]. Hence, it appears that coping mechanisms, such as speaking out in response to racist events, mitigates the impact of racial discrimination on CAC. These results remained significant after adjusting for smoking status and BMI and suggest future interventional studies are needed that empower individuals and communities to address and respond to everyday inequalities.\n\n【81】Several potential mechanisms linking psychosocial stressors such as self-reported discrimination to the development of coronary artery calcified plaque have been proposed\\[\\]. Inflammatory induction is a pathophysiologic process that may be mediated by psychosocial stressors. Emerging evidence indicates that CVD development may involve the release of cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α in an inflammatory response to epithelial damage stimulated by acute stressors\\[\\]. Other possible mechanisms involve adverse health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or poor diet in response to stress, which may contribute to risk,\\[\\] although our results found several of these factors (i.e. smoking, and BMI) did not account for all of the adverse effect from racial discrimination.\n\n【82】The strengths of this study include the use of a validated instrument to measure discrimination and response to unfair treatment, the inclusion of multiracial/ethnic asymptomatic adults, and the use of the MSCT scan to detect coronary calcification. However, our results are subject to a number of limitations. We attempted to measure cumulative discrimination by determining whether participants everexperienced racial discrimination, although it is possible that recall may not be complete. In addition, we did not measure discrimination attributable to other characteristics, such as gender. The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes any statements about causal associations.\n\n【83】Previous research has confirmed that the experience of discrimination or unfair treatment may act as a stressor and that the appraisal of stress may also be important to measure\\[,\\]. Future investigations should include measures of discrimination attributed to multiple characteristics, whether psychosocial factors are intermediate factors in this association, and the moderating effects of coping resources. Potential variation by gender, race, and level of educational attainment should also be incorporated. Finally, the measure of discrimination investigated should reflect a lifecourse perspective and account for cumulative experiences of unfair treatment that may influence the disease process since atherosclerosis develops over an extended period. Moreover, factors that may impact how self-reported and perceived racism is reported should be examined. Variations on how one interprets discrimination, whether due to social status, geographic variation, or personal history, may affect how discrimination is measured\\[\\]. For example, one study was able to extract thoughts or reports of past racist events among its participants only when they went into in-depth discussions\\[\\]. Also, types of racist experiences in society have changed over time from more overt events to more subtle ones \\[\\], such as suppression in social status and its impact on home ownership or higher educational opportunities.\n\n【84】Conclusions\n===========\n\n【85】The persistence of racial disparities of CVD warrants investigations regarding the contribution of subjective experiences of discrimination and unfair treatment. Stress-related health literature has the potential to provide future direction. Focused efforts to elucidate whether racial and ethnic minorities differ in response to stressful situations, or types of stressful situations, may provide valuable insight for prevention and amelioration of CVD burden. Finally, because of the temporal lag between subclinical atherosclerosis and clinical coronary heart disease, the use of CAC as an endpoint should be emphasized in future epidemiologic studies of racial disparities in CVD.\n\n【86】Abbreviations\n=============\n\n【87】BMI: Body mass index; CAC: Coronary artery calcification; CES-D: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; CHD: Coronary heart disease; CI: Confidence interval; CT: Computed tomography; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; EOD: Experiences of Discrimination instrument; mmHg: Millimeters of mercury; MSCT: Muli-slice computed tomography; NorTex: North Texas Primary Care Practice Based Research Network; NTHH: North Texas Healthy Heart study; ORs: Odds ratio\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests\n===================</u>\n\n【89】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors\\' contributions\n=======================</u>\n\n【91】通用结尾删除-1:<u>RC conceived of the study, design and analyzed the data, and was the primary writer of the manuscript.

{"seq_id": "95fdb063-58cf-427e-9ca1-1c8baf2ca878", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background\n==========\n\n【1】Artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be caused by the MR scanner hardware itself or by the interaction of the patient with the hardware \\[\\]. Artifacts and foreign bodies within the patient's body may be confused with a pathology or just reduce the quality of examinations. The knowledge of the artifacts and their sources is extremely important in order to avoid false diagnoses and to learn how to eliminate them \\[\\]. Radiologists are frequently not informed about the medical history of patients. When performing the examinations, they face postoperative images (without knowing the patient's history) or other images they are not familiar with -- caused by foreign bodies.\n\n【2】Almost every MRI exam includes some kind of artifacts. Depending on their origin, one can classify them into the following groups:\n\n【3】1.  Truncation artifacts which occur near sharp high-contrast boundaries and are also known as the Gibbs phenomenon. They appear as multiple, alternating bright and dark lines -- \"ringing\". They can be misinterpreted as a syrinx in the spinal cord (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) \\[\\] or a meniscal tear in the knee.\n\n【4】2.  Motion artifacts caused by breathing, cardiac movement, CSF pulsation/blood flow, patient's movement, which create ghost artifacts (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figures 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>--删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). They can be reduced by patient immobilization, cardiac/respiratory gating, saturation bands, or drugs that slow down the intestinal peristalsis. One can also reduce motion artifacts by using echo-planar imaging (EPI), a very fast MR imaging technique \\[\\].\n\n【5】3.  Aliasing artifacts occur when the anatomical structures located outside the field of view are mapped at the opposite end of the image. One can eliminate them by increasing the field of view (FOV) \\[\\] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7A, 7B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【6】4.  Chemical shift artifacts appear as dark or bright bands at the lipid-water interface and are seen especially in case of fluid-filled structures surrounded by fat (e.g. eye balls in the orbits, bladder). They tend to by less prominent on T1-weighted images than on T2-weighted images. Interestingly, these artifacts have been used as a diagnostic aid \\[\\], to confirm the presence of fat within lesions, e.g. in adrenal adenomas (Dual echo sequences/out-of-phase images -- 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) or to accentuate the fat-water interfaces at visceral margins 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8B]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), thus helping in the evaluation of peripheral tumors for possible extravisceral extension \\[\\].\n\n【7】5.  Others -- technical literature uses many different names for artifacts, e.g. banding artifact, pile-up artifact, peripheral signal artifact, spike noise artifact, blurring artifact, suppression artifact etc. \\[\\].\n\n【8】Examples\n========\n\n【9】An abnormally hyperintense signal on FLAIR images can result from CSF/vascular pulsation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), magnetic susceptibility artifact (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), motion, but also in patients undergoing MRI examinations while receiving supplemental oxygen \\[\\].\n\n【10】Metallic objects, not only within the patient's body but also on the patient, e.g. in the clothes, may result in FLAIR-hyperintensity due to a magnetic susceptibility artifact. In brain MRI such artificial FLAIR-hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space may lead to a false diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Sometimes it is not necessarily a visible metallic element like in the case presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. We had a case of a patient who wore only a white singlet during the examination which seemed to be made of cotton (!) and the artifact disappeared after she had taken it off.\n\n【11】Spike noise artifacts, resembling checkered pattern on the clothes, are caused by static electricity from clothing or blankets and are not necessarily related to metal -- they may be caused by acrylic materials \\[\\].\n\n【12】The aim of this article was to present different types of artifacts and appearances of various foreign bodies within the patient's body in magnetic resonance imaging in order not to confuse them with pathological conditions. The authors presented a gallery of such images. All examinations were performed with use of GE Signa HDxt scanners with a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T.\n\n【13】The Gallery of Images of Foreign Bodies with and without Artifacts\n==================================================================\n\n【14】As stated in the introduction, artifacts are frequently caused by metallic and other foreign bodies which may be found on and in patients' bodies and these are the focus of this paper.\n\n【15】One can divide them into the following groups:\n\n【16】1.  -- group A -- foreign bodies we know and can eliminate: the most popular and easy to recognize and eliminate, usually connected with outfit or ornament of the body, make-up, hair accessories -- hair ties, clothes, labels on clothes, but also with medical equipment, e.g. hearing aid;\n\n【17】2.  -- group B -- foreign bodies that are known but impossible to eliminate, e.g. surgical/neurosurgical clip or staplers, endoprostheses;\n\n【18】3.  -- group C -- foreign bodies that are not known to the MRI unit personnel because the patients forget about them, do not know about them or do not report them in the questionnaire they fill in before the examination.\n\n【19】Different sequences are sensitive to these objects to various degrees (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【20】The best way to reduce the severity of susceptibility artifacts caused by metallic foreign bodies is to use spin echo sequences (SE) with a short echo time (TE) \\[\\]. The artifacts are less prominent in fast SE (FSE) than in conventional SE sequences \\[\\]. However, it is not always possible and not always improves the image quality in a significant way. Iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and the least-squares estimation (IDEAL) is a recently developed sequence which separates fat and water with a very high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), is insensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity and reduces metallic artifacts, e.g. in postoperative patients with metallic hardware \\[\\]. It also improves fat suppression \\[\\]. Gradient echo (GRE) and echo-planar sequences should be avoided because they accentuate susceptibility artifacts \\[,\\]. However this is also not always possible and in such cases reducing TE in GRE sequence is helpful \\[\\].\n\n【21】Group A\n-------\n\n【22】The newborns, especially before the era of MR-compatible incubators, were usually examined dressed up from toes to head to keep them warm during their stay in the scanner room. Probably, the metallic thread in the labels in the newborns' caps was the reason why the brain images were completely illegible when the cap had remained on the baby's head. Similarly, an elastic left in the patient's hair or a hearing aid forgotten in the ear (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 11]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) can produce the same effect of signal loss and \"black hole\" in the head.\n\n【23】Cosmetics can produce severe distortion of the magnetic field and make the contents of the orbits difficult to assess. The distortion results from the presence of iron oxide in the pigments used to produce dark shades of the make-up \\[\\] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 12]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Tattoo pigments contain metallic elements which also distort the magnetic field and sometimes make MR imaging impossible (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 13]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), not to mention possible heating up and burning the patient during the study, or the carcinogenic ingredients.\n\n【24】Group B\n-------\n\n【25】The type and size of an artifact produced by dental materials correlates with their shape, size, number of objects and most significantly -- type of metal \\[,\\]. The same applies to other metallic implants, not only to dental ones \\[\\]. Orthodontic appliances (ferromagnetic material) generally cause large magnetic field distortion and signal loss in frontal and/or temporal lobes and upper and lower jaw regions. Dental implants usually are made of titanium (non-ferromagnetic material) which should not have an influence on MR images. However, due to traces of ferromagnetic iron, they may decrease the quality of MR images \\[\\].\n\n【26】Excessive artifacts make it very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to recognize an important intracerebral pathology (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 14]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Such excessive artifacts are caused by orthodontic braces, more and more frequently encountered not only in children and adolescents. Dental materials interfere not only with brain MRI but also with orofacial and neck imaging \\[\\].\n\n【27】The knowledge of the influence of dental implants on various sequences and of different kinds of signal alterations they cause is extremely important in order not to mistake them for brain lesions (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 15]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【28】Neurosurgical clips produce similar artifacts (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 16]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【29】Ventricular shunt valves can also generate considerable artifacts due to distortion of the MR image, especially in GRE sequences \\[\\]. However, nowadays they are most often visible as low signal intensity lines only and do not disturb MR images (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 17]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【30】Disc prostheses and other elements used for spinal surgery (e.g. interspinous process spacers) also induce significant artifacts in MRI which may complicate radiological follow-up after surgery \\[\\]. Stainless steel is known to produce large amounts of artifacts, whereas titanium is known to produce significantly less of them \\[\\]. These artifacts make interpretation of the spinal cord difficult and visualization of the root canals impossible at the operated levels (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 18]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Magnesium and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers produce fewer artifacts than titanium \\[\\].\n\n【31】Image-guided application of cement for kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty results in the presence of low signal intensity material in the treated vertebral body in all sequences and does not produce artifacts (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 19]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【32】Intracranial aneurysms treated by coiling may be difficult to assess after the procedure because of MR imaging artifacts. On the other hand, intracranial aneurysms occluded with the liquid polymer Onyx are hypointense, probably because of its tantalum content, and do not create artifacts \\[\\] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 20]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【33】Medical implants can make it impossible to examine the abdomen and pelvis - like a stent graft in the aorta and both common iliac arteries in our patient who forgot to mention in the questionnaire that he had undergone stent graft implantation in the past. A pilot sequence clearly showed that pelvic MRI cannot be performed due to a large \"black hole\" mentioned above. The joint that was operated on with the use of screws can pose a similar problem due to signal loss in some sequences and to the artifacts caused by screws (the so called pile-up artifacts and imperfect fat suppression) which may be so extensive that the interpretation of the images may turn out to be impossible \\[\\] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 21]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). On the other hand, like in case of materials used in spine surgery, orthopedic materials may produce no artifacts if they are made of polymers blend, e.g. biodegradable interference screws which are not visible on plain films and degrade completely after 2--4 years and only the bone tunnel is visible on MRI (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 22]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【34】Sternal wires after thoracic procedures are of less concern as they distort the magnetic field but usually allow to image the thorax. Their MR appearance is similar to that produced by neurosurgical clips presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 16]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【35】Metallic surgical clips can be almost harmless for imaging in some sequences and projections (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 23A]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) but can distort the examination severely making it impossible to read the most affected slices in the same patient depending on the kind of sequence (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 23B, 23C]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【36】Pelvic MRI can also be disturbed by hip prostheses (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 24]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【37】Group C\n-------\n\n【38】The radiologist is not always informed about the therapies that the examined patients underwent in the past and some of these therapies have an impact on MR imaging with a possibility of revealing unusual findings. The sustained-release intra-vaginal estradiol ring is one of them. It is a contraceptive method as well as a useful therapeutic option in the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women and it appears as a low signal intensity round element in the vagina.\n\n【39】Sometimes the patient does not know what exactly is placed in his orbit after enucleation like in one of our cases in which the patient removed the removable eye ball prosthesis before MRI but there was still some part of it in the orbit (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 25]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【40】Others\n------\n\n【41】Apart from these three groups of artifacts mentioned above, we may also be forced to deal with artifacts, the occurrence of which indicates a failure of the MRI system \\[\\], e.g. many a time we dealt with artifacts that indicated the failure of coils or the ones that occurred during GRE/T2\\ sequence and informed us about the failure of the magnet cooling system.\n\n【42】And finally, radiologists should be aware of normal conditions which sometimes may be misleading, mistaken for artifacts, and interfere with establishing diagnosis, like menstrual bleeding in female patients or uterine contractions that occur in everyday life and not only during labor.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n===========\n\n【44】Knowledge of different types of artifacts, of their origin and of possible foreign bodies is necessary to eliminate them or to reduce their negative influence on MR images by adjusting acquisition parameters. It is also necessary to take them into consideration when interpreting the images. Some proposals of reducing artifacts were mentioned but describing in detail the procedures to avoid or limit artifacts would go beyond the scope of this paper. However, technical ways to reduce them can be found in the cited literature \\[,\\].\n\n【45】![Typical syrinx-like manifestation of truncation artifact in the spinal cord.](poljradiol-80-93-g001)删除19:<u>{#f1-poljradiol-80-93}</u>\n\n【46】![CSF pulsation imitates intradural spinal hemangioma.](poljradiol-80-93-g002)删除19:<u>{#f2-poljradiol-80-93}</u>\n\n【47】![Multiple images of the aorta -- ghosting artifact caused by aortal pulsation.](poljradiol-80-93-g003)删除19:<u>{#f3-poljradiol-80-93}</u>\n\n【48】![SE/T1-weighted images after intravenous administration of the contrast material -- hyperintense signal caused by arterial pulsation imitates a cerebellar, contrast-enhanced lesion (A -- axial plane, B -- sagittal plane, C -- coronal plane).](poljradiol-80-93-g004)删除19:<u>{#f4-poljradiol-80-93}</u>\n\n【49】![Motion artifacts caused by breathing (A).

Nonsustained VT has been linked to an increased risk for sudden death in coronary patients. It is unknown whether this parameter can be used for selection of high-risk patients to receive an implantable defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death in patients shortly after AMI. In 325 consecutive infarct survivors, 24-h Holter monitoring was performed 10+/-6 days after AMI. All patients underwent coronary angiography, determination of left ventricular function and assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). Mean follow-up was 30+/-22 months. There was a low prevalence (9%) of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Nonsustained VT together with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in only 2.4% of patients. During follow-up, 25 patients reached one of the prospectively defined end points (primary composite end point of cardiac death, sustained VT or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation; secondary end point: arrhythmic events). Kaplan Meier event probability analyses revealed that only HRV, LVEF and status of the infarct-related artery were univariate predictors of death or arrhythmic events. The presence of nonsustained VT carried a relative risk of 2.6 for the primary study end point but was not a significant predictor if only arrhythmic events were considered. On multivariate analysis, only HRV, LVEF and the status of the infarct artery were found to be independently related to the primary study end point. There is a low prevalence of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Only 2% to 3% of all infarct survivors treated according to contemporary guidelines demonstrate both depressed LVEF and nonsustained VT.

This is an acute respiratory disease of economic significance in poultry and leads to a decrease in egg production and failure or retardation of egg laying \\[\\]. Serological classification of A. paragallinarum is based on the presence of specific hemagglutinins (HAs). A. paragallinarum strains/isolates are traditionally serotyped by means of 2 schemes: the Page scheme, which recognizes 3 serovars, A, B and C \\[, \\], and the Kume scheme, which recognizes serogroups A, B and C and 4 serovars within Kume serogroup A, 1 serovar within Kume serogroup B, and 4 serovars within Kume serogroup C \\[, \\]. Recently, a multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP method for serotyping of A. paragallinarum was proposed \\[\\]. Recent studies have shown that these molecular methods have poor sensitivity and specificity and are therefore not suitable for serotyping A. paragallinarum \\[, \\].\n\n【1】Prevention of infectious coryza has been primarily implemented by immunizing animals with inactivated whole-cell vaccines of A. paragallinarum prepared from relevant serovars. Whole-cell vaccines of A. paragallinarum protect only from the HA serovars present in them. If chickens are challenged with a serovar not included in the vaccine that was used, then this vaccine will not provide adequate protection \\[\\]. Additionally, such vaccines occasionally have side effects such as local necrotic lesions and swelling at the injection site \\[\\].\n\n【2】Gene hmtp210 of A. paragallinarum encodes a 210-kDa outer-membrane protein that functions as an HA \\[\\] and has been identified as an important protective antigen \\[\\]. It has also been proposed that the HA antigen plays a key role in the pathogenicity of A. paragallinarum \\[\\]. Wang et al. \\[\\] showed that HA is a trimeric autotransporter adhesin that besides conferring hemagglutination, enables cell adherence and biofilm formation activities.\n\n【3】Wu et al. \\[\\] reported the presence of a hypervariable region in the HA proteins in isolates of Page serovars A and C. This hypervariable region is located approximately at amino acid positions 1,100--1,600 of the HA protein. Hypervariable regions of serovars A and C (also known as region 2) are said to be the most antigenic region of the HA protein \\[, \\]. Consequently, this protein has been reported as a candidate for serotyping and recombinant-vaccine production \\[, \\]. Sakamoto et al. \\[\\] published the development of recombinant vaccines from hmtp210 based on the variability of region 2. Using Sakamoto's PCR methods \\[\\], Wang et al. \\[\\] performed sequence analysis of the multiplex PCR products and demonstrated that this region 2 is not Page serovar specific.\n\n【4】In spite of the importance of this hypervariable region in terms of pathogenicity and protective properties, little is known about its genetic diversity, variability and complexity. This is in part because only a small number of hmtp210 variants have been sequenced and uploaded to public databases, especially from Latin America.\n\n【5】To resolve this issue, we performed sequencing analysis of the hypervariable region of hmtp210 in 16 clinical isolates from the largest poultry production area of Costa Rica and compared them with the data from 4 vaccine strains and all hmtp210 sequences available in public databases.\n\n【6】Animals with clinical signs of infectious coryza were subjected to necropsy in the Avian Pathology Department at the Veterinary Medicine School, Universidad Nacional, and samples were collected from infraorbital sinuses. Bacterial strains/isolates were cultured in Chocolate Agar supplemented with Vitox (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) and biochemically identified according to protocols described elsewhere \\[\\]. A total of 16 field isolates (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>) and 4 vaccine strains---0083 (Kume serovar A-1), Spross (Page serovar B), 48 (serotype variant type B) and H18 (Kume serovar C-1)---were subjected to further genetic analysis.\n\n【7】For genomic-DNA extraction, a loopful of bacteria was resuspended in 50 µl of buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5). The suspension was heated at 98°C for 15 min and placed on ice for additional 15 min. The samples were stored at −20°C until used. A species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. paragallinarum was carried out by means of primers and amplification steps previously described \\[\\]. PCRs were conducted in a total volume of 25 µl containing Taq DNA Polymerase, MgCl~2~ buffer, and dNTPs according to the PCR Master Mix Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.), 0.2 µM of each specific primer and 3 µl of extracted DNA (50 ng/ml). Genetic protocols (Multiplex PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism \\[RFLP\\] PCR) and reaction conditions were previously described \\[\\]. RFLP PCR products (including the entire length of the HA hypervariable region) were digested with the Bgl II restriction enzyme (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD, U.S.A.). RFLP PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.), and Sanger sequencing was performed at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) with the following primers: 5--1 forward, 5′-GAT GGC ACA ATT ACA TTT ACA-3′, and 5--1 reverse, 5′-ACC TTG AGT GCT AGA TGC TGT AGG TGC-3′ \\[\\]. The obtained sequences were edited using Sequencher® version 5.3 sequence analysis software.\n\n【8】To construct a multiple sequence alignment for phylogenetic reconstruction, sequence data from 76 A. paragallinarum strains/isolates (16 Costa Rican field strains, 4 vaccine reference strains, and full-length hmtp210 sequences from 56 strains/isolates available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information \\[NCBI\\] GenBank) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>) were visualized, similarly edited, aligned, and analyzed in MEGA version 7 \\[\\]. The resulting alignment of 1,068 positions was used to build a phylogenetic tree by the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model \\[\\]. The tree with the highest log likelihood was selected. All the positions containing gaps or missing data were eliminated. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the maximum composite likelihood (MCL) approach and then by selecting the topology with a superior log likelihood value.\n\n【9】In addition, representative isolates that clustered together or closely (in the phylogenetic tree) to reference strains 0083, Spross, and H18, were aligned for comparison. The variable sites in the final alignment from each group were extracted by means of SAMtools \\[\\]. The generated vcf/bcf files were used to produce a visual representation of the variants in the alignment. The variants were colored following the standard color scheme used in Artemis software \\[\\].\n\n【10】After biochemical and PCR testing, 16 A. paragallinarum field isolates were identified (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). According to Sakamoto's typing methods \\[\\], most of the Costa Rican isolates corresponded to Page serovar C (14 strains). Only 1 isolate corresponded to Page serovar A and 1 to Page serovar B (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). In contradiction to Wang's report \\[\\], our H18 reference strain (KY819140) was correctly identified by Sakamoto's typing methods as Page serovar C (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>).\n\n【11】Subsequently, full-length sequencing of the hypervariable region of hmtp210 in the 16 field strains and 4 reference vaccine strains was conducted. These 20 sequences were aligned with 56 sequences available in GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>Fig. 1.A phylogenetic tree reconstructed from partial sequences of hmtp210.

The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. There were 1,068 characters in the final dataset. Black text represents serovars A. Green text represents serovars B. Blue text represents serovars C. The sequences reported in this study are red. The names of the strains/isolates are italic. several clusters formed. Strains/isolates that belonged to the same Page serovar, did not necessarily gather in the same cluster. This result is consistent with the observations made by Wang et al. \\[\\], who proposed that this sequence is not completely Page serovar specific. With the exception of 4 strains/isolates, serovar C strains and isolates (including 14 isolates from Costa Rica and 2 H18 strains) remained in the same cluster, were highly conserved, and showed short distances when compared to the H18 strain we used. Moreover, all Costa Rican isolates from this cluster had clonal relations and shared 99.8% identity with our H18 strain. This finding is remarkable because these samples were collected at different time points, and most of them came from different farms. It is also worth noting that one of the most divergent serovar C strains was also an H18 strain (KU143741). This result casts doubt on the accuracy of this sequence or the validity of this reference strain.\n\n【12】Several Page serovar A strains/isolates (including our 0083 strain and ApCR16 isolate) formed a cluster distant from the rest of the strains, indicating substantial divergence within this hmtp210 gene. In the center of the phylogenetic tree, many clusters with short distances among them were formed. These clusters included all Page serovars B (including our Spross and 48 strains and ApCR12 isolate) but also some strains/isolates of serovars A and C.\n\n【13】To take a closer look at the isolates that showed high identity with reference strains 0083, Spross, 48 or H18, the selected sequences were aligned and compared with the references. When selected serovar A isolates were compared with strain 0083, isolate VRDC/Avpg/SZ/H10 showed 4 SNPs (C-T at position 168, A-G at position 303, A-C at position 664 and A-C at position 666) and a 13-bp deletion. Isolate Gd2 showed 3 SNPs (G-A at position 251, C-A at position 255 and A-G at position 303). The sequence of our ApCR16 isolate was identical to strain 0083 sequence (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>Fig. 2.Graphic representation of the alignment variants in representative sequences. Each group of selected sequences was aligned against reference strains 0083 (Kume serovar A-1), Spross (Page serovar B), and H18 (Kume serovar C-1). The upper line indicates approximate coordinates of the alignment in base pairs. The color scheme is as follows: variant A=green, variant G=blue, variant T=black, variant C=red, heterozygous variant=orange, insertion=magenta, deletion=dark grey, nonvariant=light grey. The reference sequences show no polymorphism. The sequences reported in this study are in red.).\n\n【14】In the case of selected serovar B isolates, significant variations were observed when compared against reference strain Spross. Isolate ApCR12 and isolate TW07 were similar among them, but showed up to 60 SNPs, 2 deletions, and 2 insertions in comparison with strain Spross. The other 3 sequences (48, Dal, and VRDC/Avpg/H40) were found to be highly similar to strain Spross, showing 10 or fewer SNPs (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). When selected serovar C isolates and 1 strain were compared with reference strain H18, we detected a 3-bp insertion (AGA) in the sequence at positions 40--42 in strain US 6919080, 1 SNP (C-T at position 1086) in isolate TS, and 3 SNPs in isolate ApCR1 (A-C at position 575, T-G at position 669 and C-G at position 709); these data represent identity of 99.8% with strain H18 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). With the exception of the ApCR12 isolate, all the Costa Rican isolates had a high percentage of identity with reference vaccine strains 0083 and H18.\n\n【15】When nucleotide regions were translated into amino acid sequences for comparison with the reference strains, the same tendency was observed. Costa Rican A (ApCR16) and C (ApCR1) isolates had only 1 and 2 substitutions as compared to strains 0083 and H18, respectively (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). The ApCR12 isolate carried 3 insertions, 1 deletion, and 28 substitutions when compared to reference strain 48.\n\n【16】Due to a lack of sequence data on A. paragallinarum strains from different parts of the world, this current study may serve as a preliminary approach to understanding the genetic variability and diversity of the hypervariable region of hmtp210. Better genetic characterization of the hypervariable region in hmtp210 is necessary to develop better immunogenic strategies and eventually improved molecular typing methods.\n\n【17】Supplementary\n=============\n\n【18】###### Supplementary Files\n\n【19】We wish to thank the staff of the Bacteriology Laboratory for their technical assistance, Aristóteles Malo for providing the reference vaccine strains and for bacterial typing techniques, and Rodolfo Umaña and Marcia Ramírez for their professional support and discussions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

CLS models the aging process of post-mitotic cells and measures the capacity of postdiauxic stationary cultures to maintain viability over time \\[,\\]. For CLS studies, yeast cells are usually aged in media containing 2% glucose. Under these conditions, cells divide exponentially producing energy preferentially by fermentation and respiration is repressed in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. As glucose is being consumed, growth slows down and the diauxic shift occurs which involves a shift from fermentation to respiration, the activation of stress resistance mechanisms and the accumulation of nutrient stores (glycogen and trehalose) to be used later in the stationary phase where the metabolic rate is significantly reduced. Mitochondrial respiration during growth is known to be essential for a strain to achieve a standard wild-type CLS \\[,\\]. However, our recent data shows that yeast cells have a large reserve respiratory capacity to sustain CLS, as respiration only limits CLS when depleted below a \\~40% of wild-type threshold \\[\\]. Strains that respire above the threshold during growth adjust their metabolic rate after the diauxic shift in a manner similar to that of wild-type strains. In contrast, strains that respire below the threshold during growth have extremely poor respiratory capacity in the stationary phase and very short CLS. Further, respiratory defects are less detrimental when produced only in the stationary phase, once yeast have accumulated nutrient stores during growth and undergone their metabolic remodeling during the diauxic shift.\n\n【2】An essential question is why strains respiring below the threshold have a short CLS. First, aerobic energy production is required for the efficient function of anti stress systems, most needed during the diauxic shift and stationary phase. Furthermore, cells respiring below the threshold have altered metabolism of stored nutrients. Respiratory-deficient cells accumulate normal amounts of glycogen during growth, but they synthesize trehalose inefficiently. Both of these reserve carbohydrates are quickly consumed when the cells reach the stationary phase because, in the absence of respiration, yeast must rely on fermentation, which generates a 14-fold lower energetic yield. Glycogen and trehalose are virtually exhausted in respiratory-deficient cells by the end of their CLS, thus suggesting that starvation is an important factor limiting their survival. In support of this conclusion, trehalose supplementation of the growth media enhances the stress-resistance capacity of respiratory null strains and significantly extends their CLS.\n\n【3】Another way in which mitochondrial respiration controls aging and longevity is through generation of ROS. Although mitochondrial ROS are known to limit the long-term survival of yeast cells during CLS and can have a detrimental effect during aging in higher eukaryotes, they can also act as signaling molecules with hormetic effects on longevity \\[-\\]. For example, tor1Δ strains deficient in the nutrient-responsive TORC1 signaling have increased coupled respiration, and also enhanced ROS production during exponential growth that provides an adaptive signal that contributes to increase cell protection systems and extend CLS \\[\\]. A comparison of yeast strains with different genetic backgrounds has suggested a correlation between respiratory capacity, mitochondrial ROS generation and CLS \\[\\]. Strains with high respiration and ROS production have longer CLS which is curtailed by increased mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 levels while strains with low respiration and ROS production have shorter CLS and can significantly benefit from additional exogenous ROS or tor1Δ-induced endogenous ROS to significantly extend their CLS \\[,\\]. Also caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan in yeast through a mechanism that involves, in part, inhibition of nutrient-responsive kinases such as TOR and RAS2 \\[\\], general enhancement of stress-resistance mechanisms, increased respiration during growth and metabolic remodeling involving a dramatic reduction in their metabolic rate in the stationary phase that allow the cells to consume their stored nutrients at a slow rate. However, cells must respire during growth at least above a \\~40% threshold to benefit from either CR- or tor1Δ-induced CLS extension. Also important, increased respiration during growth (i.e. by hyperactivating mitochondrial biogenesis) is not sufficient to extend CLS in strains that have maximized the CLS extension achievable by ROS signaling if it is not accompanied by an enhancement of cell protection systems that promote survival in the stationary phase as for tor1Δ and CR-treated cells.\n\n【4】In conclusion, we have proposed a model 删除21:<u>(Figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u> in which ROS signaling and respiratory thresholds contribute to achieve increased stress resistance, efficient use of energy stores, and likely other beneficial effects in stationary phase, which extends CLS. In multicellular organisms, respiratory thresholds to support cellular life probably vary for every tissue, which in turn likely changes the importance of ROS signaling in a tissue-specific manner. Further studies on the dynamic changes of these mitochondrial parameters in response to environmental cues are expected to provide important information concerning cellular, tissular and organismal aging.\n\n【5】![Complementary roles of mitochondrial energy production though respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial ROS signaling in promoting cell survival and regulating aging and longevity.](aging-04-578-g001)删除19:<u>{#F1}</u>\n\n【6】删除26:<u>The author is grateful for support from the Florida Department of Health / James & Esther King Biomedical Research Program and NIH-RO1 GM071775.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

AD is characterized by progressive cognition dysfunction and neuronal cell loss and is associated with brain deposition of senile plaques and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles \\[\\]. Although multiple symptoms are associated with AD, accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) is hypothesized to trigger a pathogenic cascade that eventually results in AD \\[\\]. It is well documented that fibrillary forms of Aβ may serve as an inflammatory stimulus for neuroinflammatory responses and the underlying mechanisms have been explored in a variety of studies \\[,\\]. Increasing evidence suggests that components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can be highly responsive to inflammation caused by different forms of Aβ \\[,\\], which could either potentially contribute to events leading to subsequent neurodegeneration, or act as inflammatory mediators to potentiate the deleterious neuroinflammatory cycle. Therefore, a better understanding of the processes and mechanisms that result in Aβ-related inflammation of the BBB may lead to novel therapeutics to combat AD.\n\n【2】The BBB is a unique anatomical structure that is essential for maintaining homeostasis of the brain parenchymal microenvironment \\[\\]. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and astrocytes (As) as the main cells of the BBB are among the key players in the brain inflammatory response that is initiated by various inflammatory events in the brain's environment. In both rodents and humans, any Aβ form has been shown to have an effect on the BBB, which can lead to a cascade of events including alteration of the BBB permeability, oxidative stress, release of inflammatory components and disruption of the integrity \\[,\\]. Fibrillary Aβ (fAβ), a toxic Aβ peptide, has been shown to induce inflammatory effects on astrocytes, cerebral endothelial cells in Alzheimer brain as well as in a co-culture of these two cell types \\[,\\]. In this context, it is believed that inflammation results from Aβ toxicity, which causes the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 β (IL-1β). This may result in adverse events of the systemic and central nervous systems leading to aggravating Aβ-mediated neurodegeneration \\[\\]. The expression of inflammation-related genes is controlled at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level by intracellular signaling pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) \\[,\\].\n\n【3】Luteolin (3′,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) is a naturally occurring flavonoid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties. It is present in a glycosylated form in various fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs such as Lonicera japonica and Dracocephalum moldavica. Luteolin has been shown to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of TNF-α and nitric oxide (NO) in an activated macrophage-like cell line \\[\\]. In addition, it has shown robust anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells, mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells \\[\\], rat fibroblasts \\[\\], and human gingival fibroblasts \\[\\]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that luteolin exerted anti-amnesic effects against Aβ-induced toxicity \\[,\\]. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the improvement in cognition and neuroprotective effects of luteolin included regulating microvascular function and protecting to BBB ultrastructure \\[,\\]. Although some studies suggested that, in neurodegenerative disorders, the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin may be due to suppressing the NF-κB, MAPK, and protein kinase B (PKB) pathways in activated microglial cells \\[,\\], little is known about the role of luteolin in barrier protection and the possible mechanism of action during inflammatory processes at the BBB.\n\n【4】In the present study, we established an in vitro BBB model by co-culturing human BMECs (hBMECs) and human astrocytes (hAs) under fibrillar Aβ 1--40 (fAβ~1--40~)-induced conditions. We investigated the effect of luteolin on barrier function, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses at the BBB caused by fAβ~1--40~ and explored the potential mechanism of action in the prevention of AD progression.\n\n【5】2. Results 删除19:<u>{#sec2-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n==========\n\n【6】2.1. Luteolin Protects hBMECs, hAs, and Co-Culture against fAβ~1--40~-Induced Toxicity 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot1-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Previous studies have shown that in the BBB, high concentrations of fAβ are toxic to microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes \\[,\\]. In the present study, changes in cell viability of hBMECs and hAs were evaluated using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. We found that, after exposure to 20 µM fAβ~1--40~ for 72 h, cell viability of hBMECs and hAs was reduced by 27.3% and 35.6%, respectively (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A,B, both p \\< 0.001). Administration of luteolin at doses of 3.0 µM, 10.0 µM and 30.0 µM significantly protected against fAβ~1--40~-induced cytotoxicity in both hBMECs and hAs in a concentration-dependent manner (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A,B, all p \\< 0.001). In addition, the effects of luteolin on hBMECs and hAs without fAβ~1--40~ treatment after 72 h were not significant at any of the concentrations evaluated.\n\n【8】To evaluate the protective effect of the BBB in the presence of luteolin, we established an in vitro co-culture model of hBMECs and hAs by applying fAβ~1--40~ to the basolateral side and luteolin to the apical side of the model. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>D shows that when fAβ~1--40~ was applied to the basolateral side, there was a noticeable decrease in astrocyte viability as determined by Alamar blue assay (p \\< 0.001). Moreover, addition of luteolin at doses of 3.0 µM, 10.0 µM and 30.0 µM to the apical side of the co-culture increased cell viability compared with fAβ~1--40~-injured cells (all p \\< 0.001). A mild reduction in hBMEC viability was observed in the basolateral side of the model (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C). In addition, luteolin caused an increase in hBMEC viability; however, this effect was not significant. Luteolin did not show any significant effect on viability of hBMECs and hAs in co-culture at the tested doses after 72 h (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C,D).\n\n【9】2.2. Luteolin Improves BBB Function But Does Not Scavenge Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species against fAβ~1--40~-Induced Toxicity 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】To determine the effects of luteolin on barrier function injured by fAβ~1--40~, we measured transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the flux of fluorescein sodium (NaF) and fluorescein isothioyanate labeled albumin (FITC-albumin), which respectively indicate the barrier integrity of the BBB and paracellular permeability. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--C, loss of barrier integrity and increase in permeability were induced after fAβ~1--40~ was added to the basolateral side of the co-culture (all p \\< 0.001). When luteolin was applied to the apical side of the co-culture in combination with simultaneous addition of fAβ~1--40~ to the basolateral side, protective effects of barrier integrity were observed in a concentration-dependent manner in the increase of TEER at 10.0 µM and 30.0 µM (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A, both p \\< 0.05). Similarly, treatment with luteolin at a dose of 30.0 µM ameliorated BBB permeability by preserving the reduction in values of the endothelial permeability coefficient (Pe) of NaF and FITC-albumin (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B,C, p \\< 0.05 and p \\< 0.01, respectively).\n\n【11】Aβ exerts toxicity against cells of the BBB via enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and redox imbalance \\[\\]. In this study, fAβ~1--40~ increased endogenous ROS production in hBMECs and hAs by a 2.91-fold and 3.83-fold increase, respectively (p \\< 0.001, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>D). However, we found that, in the present model, luteolin could not significantly scavenge the ROS production at each concentration, which indicated that luteolin did not provide sufficient effect on ameliorating the antioxidative ability in cells of the BBB subjected to fAβ~1--40~-induced toxicity.\n\n【12】2.3. Luteolin Inhibits the Release of Inflammatory Cytokines and the Expression of COX-2 Against fAβ~1--40~-Induced Toxicity 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot3-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】To determine whether fAβ~1--40~ treatment has inflammatory effects in a co-culture model of human BBB, we investigated alterations in cytokine secretion and COX-2 expression at both the apical and basolateral sides of the co-culture following treatment with fAβ~1--40~. We found that in the apical and basolateral supernatant, BBB cells secreted very low levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. Administration of fAβ~1--40~ to the basolateral side of the co-culture caused a significant increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, in the supernatant collected at 48 h and 72 h of both the apical and basolateral sides of the co-culture (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--H, p \\< 0.01 or p \\< 0.001).\n\n【14】When luteolin was added for 72 h to the apical side of the co-culture, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulated by fAβ~1--40~ was significantly inhibited over the 48 to 72 h time period (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--H, p \\< 0.05--p \\< 0.001). The presence of luteolin caused a reduction of fAβ~1--40~-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the apical side that was similar as the reduction seen in the basolateral side. After 72 h of fAβ~1--40~ stimulation, the expression of COX-2 in cell extracts of both hBMECs and hAs was significantly increased (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>I--K, both p \\< 0.001). In response to fAβ~1--40~-induced up-regulation of COX-2 in the BBB, luteolin was found to reduce the expression of COX-2 by hBMECs in a concentration-dependent manner from 3.0 µM to 30.0 µM (all p \\< 0.001). In addition, the expression of COX-2 by hAs was also inhibited when administered at doses of 10.0 and 30.0 µM (both p \\< 0.001).\n\n【15】2.4. Luteolin Inhibits NF-κB and MAPK Signal Pathways against fAβ~1--40~-Induced Toxicity 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot4-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in the pathological effects of Aβ \\[,\\]. To determine if luteolin anti-inflammatory effects were mediated through inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in the BBB, western blot analysis was performed. In the MAPK pathway, increased ratios of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated forms of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were observed in the hBMECs and hAs after fAβ~1--40~ administration to the co-culture (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--D, all p \\< 0.001). In co-cultured hBMECs and hAs, luteolin inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at doses of 3.0 µM, 10.0 µM and 30.0 µM (p \\< 0.01--0.001), but did not affect phosphorylation levels of JNK and ERK1/2 that were induced by fAβ~1--40~ in hBMECs and hAs. For NF-κB-related signaling proteins, fAβ~1--40~ treatment resulted in upregulation of phosphorylation levels of inhibitory κB kinase α /β (IKKα/β) and nuclear distribution of p65 subunit in hBMECs and hAs. Levels of inhibitory κB α (IκBα) in both hBMECs and hAs of the co-culture were reduced (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--D, all p \\< 0.001). Luteolin treatment showed a beneficial effect on inhibiting IKKα/β phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and subsequent p65 phosphorylation at defined concentrations in hBMECs and hAs (all p \\< 0.001), suggesting that luteolin is effective in suppressing the activation of NF-κB signaling in response to fAβ~1--40~.\n\n【17】2.5. Involvement of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB Pathway in the Protective Effect of Luteolin on fAβ~1--40~-Induced Barrier Function and Inflammation 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot5-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】To further examine the mechanisms involved in regulating fAβ~1--40~-induced inflammation in the treatment of luteolin, we added the pharmacological inhibitors of p38 MAPK and NF-κB to the co-culture when exposed to fAβ~1--40~, and investigated the participation of the p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway in BBB function and inflammatory cytokine production. Although luteolin treatment at 30 µM increased the value of TEER and inhibited cytokine release, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, in both sides in the co-culture, after subjection to fAβ~1--40~ for 72 h (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, all p \\< 0.001), these effects were significantly changed by the addition of the pharmacological p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, p \\< 0.05---p \\< 0.01), and the NF-κB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, p \\< 0.05--p \\< 0.01).\n\n【19】These findings indicate that inhibition of p38 MAPK by luteolin treatment may inhibit inflammatory responses induced by fAβ~1--40~. Therefore, the p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway might be involved in the protective effects of luteolin on the BBB.\n\n【20】3. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec3-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n=============\n\n【21】The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of luteolin on fAβ~1--40~-induced changes in an in vitro BBB model by analyzing cell toxicity, barrier function, ROS, and cytokine production and inflammation-related intracellular signaling pathways. The results showed that luteolin increased cell viability of hBMECs and hAs that were injured by fAβ~1--40~ treatment. In the human BBB model, luteolin also protected barrier function by preserving the TEER value and by reducing aggravated permeability after exposure to fAβ~1--40~. Luteolin did not show significant effects on scavenging intracellular ROS in hBMECs and hAs of the co-culture. However, luteolin reduced fAβ~1--40~-induced inflammatory mediator and cytokine production in both the apical and basolateral sides of the co-culture. The mechanism of this opposite effect by fAβ~1--40~ may be related to the regulation of inflammatory signaling transduction at the BBB, involving suppression of p38 MAPK activation, downregulation of phosphor-IKK levels, relief of IκBα degradation, inhibition of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and reduction of the release of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, employment of p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibitors reversed luteolin-mediated barrier function and cytokine release. Therefore, luteolin may be a potential therapeutic agent for BBB protection by inhibiting inflammation against fAβ~1--40~-induced injury.\n\n【22】It is known that the BBB is formed by the continuous brain microvascular endothelium, which depends on the underlying basement membrane, pericytes that ensheathe the endothelial wall, and astrocytes in the surrounding tissue space that extend their cell processes towards the endothelium \\[\\]. Together, endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes are all required for the maintenance of normal physiology of the neurovasculature and maintenance of BBB integrity \\[,\\]. It has been generally known that signaling and interaction between pericytes and endothelial cells is critical for BBB structure and function \\[\\]. In addition, pericytes have been shown to control key neurovascular functions that are necessary for proper neuronal function. Therefore, dysfunction of pericytes results in a progressive age-dependent vascular-mediated neurodegeneration \\[\\]. Importantly, the present study is part of our ongoing screening program to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of natural compounds on endothelial cells and astrocytes to the response of the BBB \\[,\\]. Based on our previous findings, we used the static BBB model with human BMECs and astrocytes cultured in Transwell plates that would permit analysis of the independent contributions of luteolin on hBMECs and hAs to the response of the BBB to inflammation induced by Aβ.\n\n【23】In AD, a number of different forms of Aβ peptides are present. Monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillary Aβ toxicity to endothelial cells of cerebrovascular origin has been claimed \\[,\\]. Previous reports have shown that, in both animal models and in cell culture models, fAβ caused cell death in BBB endothelial cells \\[,\\]. In the present study, we illustrated that fAβ~1--40~ at a higher concentration (20 μM) induced significant cell toxicity on the BBB by reducing viability not only in the hBMEC or hAs as a monolayer, but also in the endothelial cells of the co-culture model, which is in line with other studies in which was shown that fAβ induced death and dysfunction of BBB-related cells \\[\\]. Abnormally, the reduction of viability was not apparent in hBMECs under a co-culture system. The major cause of this phenomenon is attributable to the application fAβ to the basolateral side of this system; therefore, the passive crossings of brain and systemic Aβ via a leaky BBB induced by structure failure or permeability probably fall behind the Aβ transport via BBB receptors or transporters. Furthermore, several studies in human brain endothelial cell lines have demonstrated that treatment of cells in combination of monomeric and oligomeric Aβ~1--42~ resulted in toxicity, however viability remained unaffected \\[\\]. In terms of these supports, we deduce that accompanied by a mild viability reduction of endothelial cells in the co-culture, functional and molecular changes from endothelial toxicity must be induced following basolateral application of fAβ.\n\n【24】In response to fAβ~1--40~-induced toxicity, the effective administration conditions for luteolin were determined using both control and fAβ~1--40~-injured hBMECs and hAs. Luteolin administration was evaluated at doses of 3.0 µM, 10.0 µM and 30.0 µM, and was found to significantly increase the viability of both cell types injured with fAβ~1--40~. Moreover, no significant differences were found among luteolin treatment in control cells, indicating that, under basal conditions, luteolin has no toxic effects within the evaluated concentrations. In addition, an integrative co-culture of both the vascular and glial compartment was employed to assess the protective effect of luteolin on pathological changes in the BBB. At the concentrations tested, luteolin treatment protected hBMECs and hAs in a similar fashion, which is consistent with the effects seen on hBMECs or hAs monolayers against fAβ~1--40~-induced toxicity. Therefore, these data confirmed that luteolin protects the cells that form the human BBB model from fAβ~1--40~-induced toxicity.\n\n【25】Under physiological conditions, the BBB controls the entry of plasma-derived Aβ into the central nervous system (CNS) by the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-mediated re-entry transport \\[,\\]. In addition, brain-derived Aβ in the plasma are cleared by low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP-1)-mediated scavenging signal transduction \\[\\]. Given that in plasma, increased levels of free Aβ were identified in AD patients as well as in AD mouse models \\[,\\], the accumulation of Aβ peptides is believed to be a causative event in cerebrovascular alterations \\[\\]. In the co-culture model of the human BBB established in this study, fAβ~1--40~ was added to the basolateral side of the co-culture model. This stemmed from our consideration that an initial increase of Aβ in brain parenchyma can trigger a vicious cycle of BBB damage and induce an efflux of abluminal Aβ to blood vessels in AD pathology. Our data indicated that treatment with a concentration of 20 μM fAβ~1--40~ for 72 h induced changes on the BBB, impairing barrier integrity and increasing the paracellular permeability. These findings are in line with other studies showing Aβ-induced cell death and dysfunction of BBB-associated components \\[,\\].\n\n【26】Luteolin possesses multiple beneficial properties throughout the entire CNS. To mimic the route from capillary to brain parenchyma, in our study, luteolin was applied to the apical side of the co-culture, and simulates the capability of passing through the BBB \\[\\]. Considering these results, luteolin not only protected against fAβ~1--40~-induced cell death but also inhibited BBB dysfunction. Collectively, this would contribute towards the direct protection of the BBB from the fAβ~1--40~-induced compromised barrier. TEER is an important indicator of barrier tightness of inter-endothelial tight junctions. Reduction of the TEER value was found to be remarkably attenuated by treatment with high concentrations of luteolin, indicating that the preservation of barrier integrity may contribute to brain protection against fAβ~1--40~-induced damage. In addition, at the highest concentration, luteolin treatment decreased apical-to-basolateral diffusion of NaF and FITC-albumin. Given that luteolin partly alleviated the paracellular permeability after exposure to fAβ~1--40~, we assumed that a suitable loss of \"tightness\" may help therapeutic agents cross the BBB. Previous studies have reported the preservation of TEER value and transendothelial permeability of luteolin on BBB function when vascular endothelial cells were subjected to other forms of Aβ \\[,\\]. In our previous studies, we showed that luteolin preserved cerebral microvascular endothelial cells in the presence of Aβ~25--35~, involving the relief of TEER reduction, the increase of characteristic enzymatic activity and the regulation of secretion of inflammatory mediators \\[\\]. Moreover, luteolin was reported to maintain microvascular function in Aβ~25--35~ intra-cerebroventricular-injected mice, in response to the decrease of regional cerebral blood flow values and the disruption of microvascular ultrastructures \\[\\]. In our ongoing evaluation of Aβ, we provide evidence that luteolin is effective in protecting the human BBB by maintaining barrier integrity, and by regulating BBB permeability.\n\n【27】In AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is often complicated and is caused by the deposition of Aβ along the walls of the cerebral vasculature, which includes arteries, arterioles, veins and less often capillaries \\[,\\]. This leads to disruption of blood vessels, disturbed cerebral blood flow and inflammatory infiltration at the BBB \\[\\]. At the BBB, astrocytes that have a distinctive anatomical location by covering the endothelial cells of the BBB form a network of fine lamellae closely opposed to the outer surface of the endothelium \\[\\], and can act as buffers in the brain, protecting neurons from harmful chemicals, ROS, COX-2 and cytokines \\[\\]. As the BBB is comprised of specialized brain endothelial cells that contribute to CNS homeostasis by restricting entry of circulating leukocytes and blood-borne molecules into the CNS, BBB constitutive endothelial cells are liable to respond to inflammation associated with brain-specific injuries and disorders, such as AD, ischemia and hypoxia, or Parkinson's disease \\[\\]. In our study, fAβ~1--40~ was found to be the causative factor from the basolateral side. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2, were increased in response to fAβ~1--40~ induction, suggesting that the presence of fAβ~1--40~ at the basal membrane (brain-side) may have an inflammatory effect in the absence of endothelial cell death or loss of endothelial barrier integrity. Furthermore, the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and the up-regulation of COX-2 expression from the apical surface of the endothelial cells was similar to those of primary cerebral endothelial cell lines in response to various forms of Aβ \\[,\\], indicating that cytokine release and mediator expression are a direct effect of fAβ~1--40~ induction on endothelial cells rather than a merely downstream effect of its action on astrocytes. The clinical observations of this inflammation are likely to result in immune cell infiltration that will result in neuroinflammation in the brain and lead to greater damage. Clinical results have shown that in the vessel walls of AD patients, an increased number of monocytes/macrophages is present \\[\\], which can be partly explained by the increased levels of cytokines and mediators from the endothelial cells in the co-culture. Moreover, microvascular endothelial cells are a rich source of inflammatory factors involving cytokines and chemokines in response to a wide variety of stimuli \\[\\]. This is especially true in the AD brain, where on the surface of endothelial cells high levels of inflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 are expressed \\[,\\], indicating an auto-amplified inflammatory molecular cascade at the BBB.\n\n【28】Luteolin has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory diseases \\[\\]. The beneficial benefits of luteolin in the CNS include the decrease of inflammation and axonal damage by preventing monocyte migration across the BBB \\[\\]. Inhibition of the neuroinflammatory effect of luteolin was found to reduce the secretion of several pro-inflammatory enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated microglia \\[\\]. Subsequent studies have shown that luteolin can abolish AD-like pathological features by reducing levels of glial-derived inflammatory cytokines \\[,\\]. In our co-culture model, luteolin protected against fAβ~1--40~-induced cytokine release and COX-2 expression both from hAs and hBMECs and inhibited BBB compromise; taken together, this would contribute towards the protection of the BBB from fAβ~1--40~-induced barrier compromise. Regarding the effects on reducing fAβ~1--40~-stimulated apical secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hBMECs, luteolin would inhibit the negative effects of cytokines and mediators on barrier integrity and immune cell infiltration as described above. Moreover, we deduce that the decrease of cytokine secretion suggests that luteolin may be able to protect endothelial cells from inflammatory insults by down-regulating the cells' ability to initiate an inflammatory response. Luteolin also showed a cytoprotective effect on astrocytes, which was seen when this compound was applied on either the apical side of the co-culture or on the single-cultured monolayer. Due to the lipophilicity, luteolin can cross the BBB \\[\\], and possibly have a direct protective effect on the astrocytes on the brain-side. Here, luteolin showed an anti-inflammatory effect on the astrocytes through reductions in basolateral cytokine levels and COX-2 expression. As it maintains the integrity of the BBB in the above experiments, luteolin may down-regulate the levels of cytokines and mediators from astrocytes and have a protective effect against pro-inflammatory insults induced by fAβ~1--40~.\n\n【29】Numerous studies have revealed that in AD brains, the preferential accumulation of Aβ in endothelial cells, reduced cerebral blood flow, transmigration of leukocytes, and secretion of multiple inflammatory factors due to injury to the BBB collectively contribute to BBB dysfunction \\[\\]. Moreover, the induction of cytokines and increase in inflammatory signaling are early events caused by the overproduction of ROS that is triggered by various forms of Aβ \\[,\\]. One of the key regulators of the inflammatory processes are members of the MAPK family, involving ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. As a downstream signaling molecule of MAPK family members, NF-κB activation is regulated by MAPKs through IκB kinase activation, which induces IκB degradation \\[\\]. In addition, NF-κB is activated by the presence of fAβ and ROS, and can upregulate pro-oxidant genes, increase cytokine release and other inflammatory and immune signaling pathways \\[\\]. The cellular signaling events mediating Aβ-induced upregulation of inflammatory mediators has been correlated in multiple CNS cell lines using NF-κB signaling proteins, such as human endothelial cells \\[\\], glia \\[\\] and neurons \\[\\]. In these resting cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by the inhibitory IκB proteins. In response to proinflammatory mediators, an inhibitory molecule, IκBα, is phosphorylated and the NF-κB p65 component translocates to the nucleus, binds to the promoter of target genes and activates transcription of several pro-inflammatory genes \\[\\]. Thus, suppressing NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways directly or indirectly are proactive to anti-inflammation.\n\n【30】Previous studies have shown that luteolin regulates different targets through inhibition of MAPK family members in response to various stimuli \\[,\\]. In our study, we found that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was downregulated by luteolin treatment. In response to fAβ~1--40~ induction, luteolin treatment did not result in a phosphorylated decrease of ERK1/2 and JNK in the BBB. p38 MAPK and ERK are the most extensively investigated members of the MAPK family mediating intracellular signaling cascades that are directly involved in NF-κB activation. In SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells and human bronchial muscle cells, expression of inflammatory mediators induced by IL-1β alone or in combination with other cytokines was reduced through p38 MAPK inhibition \\[,\\]. In neuronal cells, pharmacologic inhibitors of both p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 decreased DNA binding as well as transcriptional activity of NF-κB and abolished subsequent COX-2 expression induced by Aβ \\[\\]. Increasing evidence indicated that blocking NF-κB activation and cytokine expression can be inactivated by a dominant-negative mutation of p38 MAPK \\[\\]. Similarly, in the p38 MAPK signaling blockade assay to ascertain luteolin-mediated protection on the BBB via the p38 MAPK pathway, we found that SB203580 significantly blocked luteolin-induced protective effects on the barrier function accompanied by the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in fAβ~1--40~-stimulated co-culture. Therefore, we assume that inhibiting p38 MAPK activity at the BBB may contribute to luteolin's inhibitory effect on cytokine production in response to fAβ~1--40~.\n\n【31】In this study, our data showed that luteolin inhibited NF-κB signaling pathways, including upregulation of phosphor-IKK and downregulation of IκBα in both cell types of the BBB co-culture. These findings are consistent with the inhibitory effects of luteolin on p38 MAPK. In addition, luteolin decreased the expression of phosphor-p65, suggesting that luteolin can block the translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus. Increasing evidence indicated that blocking NF-κB activation and cytokine expression can be inactivated by dominant-negative mutations of p38 MAPK \\[\\], therefore, we assumed that NF-κB along with MAPKs may participate in amplifying the loop of inflammatory responses after BBB cells were subjected to fAβ~1--40~-induction. This provided experimental proof for using an NF-κB inhibitor. We further found that NF-κB inhibition by the inhibitor PDTC reversed the effects of luteolin on fAβ~1--40~-induced BBB dysfunction and cytokine release. That is, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or NF-κB PDTC achieved almost the same results. Therefore, we may conclude that luteolin exhibits its protective effects against fAβ~1--40~-induced injury by p38 MAPK-mediated NF-κB signaling pathways under fAβ~1--40~ condition in the human BBB co-culture.\n\n【32】A redox homeostasis balance plays a key pathological role in the process of early inflammatory cellular signaling of AD. Aβ-mediated ROS generation is closely associated with the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling cascades \\[\\]. Our previous studies have revealed that luteolin is beneficial in protecting microvascular endothelial cells and in maintaining the integrity of the BBB via scavenging ROS and repairing redox imbalance in conditions that are rich in Aβ \\[,\\]. However, in this study, we found that luteolin merely produced a slight decrease in the effectiveness of ROS generation in endothelial and astrocytic cultures in combination with fAβ. In general, the protective capacity of flavonoids against different insults has been attributed to their antioxidant potency \\[,\\]. Nonetheless, cytoprotection of flavonoids was no more defined to be correlated with the antioxidation potency \\[\\]. Many flavonoids show an important pharmacological effect on modulating the activities of protein kinases, lipid kinases and enzymes of mitochondrial respiratory chain independent of their antioxidant capacity \\[,\\]. Although anti-oxidation is not involved in the critical mechanisms that prevent fAβ-mediated toxicity at the BBB, the results obtained in this study demonstrate that p38 MAPK and NF-κB are key inhibitory signaling components that are regulated by the treatment of luteolin. Our future studies will focus on unraveling the mechanisms of luteolin acting on MAPK and NF-κB signaling cascades (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【33】4.

For lysis of the cells, RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was used, containing protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After determination of the protein concentration, proteins were separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using a semidry transfer system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-ERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-JNK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-JNK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p38 MAPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-p38 MAPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-IKKα (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-IKKβ (polyclonal antibody, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-IKKα/β (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-IκBα (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-NFκB-p65 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p-NFκB-p65 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-COX-2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed with TBST prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, ZSGB-Bio, Beijing, China) at room temperature. After subsequent washes in TBST, final detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The density of each band was quantified using an image densitometer. As a loading control, the membranes were blotted against β-actin (1:2000, Cell Signaling). The expression COX-2 and IκBα were normalized by β-actin intensity and phosphorylation levels were normalized by the non-phosphorylated form of MAPKs and NF-κB.\n\n【53】4.10.

Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec5-molecules-22-00334}</u>\n==============\n\n【58】In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that fAβ~1--40~-induced cytotoxicity and barrier dysfunction at the BBB can be rescued by luteolin treatment. The protective effects on the BBB against fAβ~1--40~ exhibited by luteolin are mediated through anti-inflammatory effects. The mechanisms involved may include inhibition of p38 MAPK activation, reduction of phosphor-IKK activation, suppression of IκBα degradation, blockage of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, reduction of proinflammatory cytokine release, and COX-2 expression. Furthermore, the employment of p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibitors reversed luteolin-mediated barrier function and cytokine release. Taken together, the suppression of p38 MAPK-mediated NF-κB pathway may play a significant role in endothelial cell and astrocyte protection of luteolin at the BBB. Given its effects on barrier protection and crossing of the BBB, luteolin may serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the prevention and/or treatment of AD.\n\n【59】This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 81473374, 81673411, 81670474)</u>, Beijing New-star Plan of Science and Technology (xx2013065), Key Laboratory of Uighur Medicine Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2015KL005), and Natural Science Foundation of Beijing 通用删除7(英):<u>(7152043)</u>.\n\n【60】Sample Availability: Samples of the compounds are available from the authors.\n\n【61】Shui-Long Guo and Rui Liu conceived and designed the experiments.

The scanner used in the present study (Hamamatsu NanoZoomer) enables a resolution of 0.23 µm per pixel, corresponding to a 400X magnification. Furthermore, whole slide imaging (WSI) is achieved in only a few minutes, which enables image rendering of large-scale studies involving multiple immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers --. While current scanners, such as the NanoZoomer, perform generally very well, whole slide images, usually denoted as virtual slides (VSs), can present blurred regions due to locally poor focusing. These artifacts should be avoided as much as possible because they can affect the quality of subsequent analysis, making a VS review process mandatory.\n\n【2】Most WSSs, such as the one used in this study, perform a focusing step at a set of locations (focusing points) prior to WSI. The number and position of these focusing points, which are either chosen by a human operator or automatically selected by the WSS, can strongly affect the resulting image quality because the 3D landscape of the slide is extrapolated from the chosen focusing points. While too few focusing points may result in a partially blurred VS, too many focusing points significantly increase the scanning time. We estimated that the scanner used in this study requires 2.8 s per focusing point. Therefore, a reasonable number of focusing points should be selected to ensure image quality for a majority of VSs. Typically, in our laboratory (DIAPath, CMMI), we used 9 focusing points for each 100-mm^2^ region. With this practical rule, approximately 75% of the slides are properly scanned (out of more than 2500 4- or 5-µm thick slides); these slides are obtained from various normal or pathological paraffin-embedded tissue samples stained with different standard techniques for brightfield microscopy, i.e. IHC and HE (hematoxylin-eosin), excluding fluorescence labeling, for which our scanner is not equipped. Under these conditions, the total scanning time is approximately 6 minutes for a large slide (of approximately 443 mm^2^) at 20X magnification. These data represent a good trade-off between scanning efficiency and time.\n\n【3】The complete scanning workflow process employed in our laboratory is presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and is detailed in the figure caption. During the VS review process, the scanner operator has the following responsibilities: (i) assess the VS and (ii) either accept the slide if properly scanned or identify blurred regions for which new focus points must be added. This time-consuming task requires the scanner operator to carefully assess the entire slide image to identify poorly focused regions. Automated methods for VS quality assessment that identify blurred regions are therefore strongly needed.\n\n【4】![Complete scanning workflow and sequence of processes.\\\nA. Illustration of the complete scanning workflow. The first step is the \\\"Prescan\\\": the scanner starts by taking a low-resolution grayscale picture of all of the slides loaded by the operator. This grayscale image is used during the second step by the automatic \\\"Setup\\\" process: a predefined set of rules (known as the \\\"profile\\\") is applied to detect the tissue and to split large tissue regions in several regions with a maximum area of 100 mm^2^. Nine focusing points are then distributed across each piece of tissue to compute a median focusing plane for each small tissue piece. The automatic setup can fail if the tissue is very faint (tissue detection error) or if focusing points are placed on tissue folds or defects (focusing error). The operator is therefore asked to control the result of the profile and to correct it if necessary (by moving or adding focusing points). The slide is then ready to be scanned and is placed in the scanning queue (step 3). Steps 1 to 3 can occur concurrently, until all of the slides in the batch are queued. During step 4, the scanner scans the regions of the slides defined by the profile and produces the VS, which is saved on disk. The operator can then review the VS immediately while the scanner scans the next slide in the queue  or can let the scanner work until more VSs are ready for review . The manual review process (path I) consists of a thorough slide quality assessment. The method presented in this work (path II) consists of an automatic creation of a \\\"blur map\\\" showing the improperly focused regions. This method reduces the reviewing time of the operator and helps him (her) decide whether the VS is of acceptable quality. B. Sequence of operations for a hypothetical batch of five slides, with the time increasing from left to right along the horizontal axis. Without the assistance of an automated image quality assessment method (corresponding to path I in frame A), different review sequences are possible, ranging from continuous reviewing (I.a: the operator reviews each slide immediately after its acquisition) to batch reviewing (I.b: the operator waits until the entire batch is scanned before reviewing all of the slides). Continuous reviewing requires the operator to be continuously present during the scanning session (denoted by the dotted rectangle), while batch reviewing allows the operator to perform other tasks during imaging. The automated sharpness evaluation method presented in this work (corresponding to path II in frame A) results in the creation of blur maps during the scanning session, reducing the time needed for the manual review process (timeline II). In A-B, shaded boxes indicate the tasks carried out by the operator. C. Sequence of states of a slide on which the complete workflow (path II) is applied. The \\\"Prescan\\\" step defined six focusing planes, with nine focusing points each, and queued the slide for scanning. As soon as the VS is saved on disk, the automated sharpness evaluation method is applied and produces a \\\"blur map\\\", showing potential improperly scanned regions (red arrow on second image). The operator manually adds new focusing planes, and nine new focusing points are automatically distributed on each plane (the red rectangle targets the blurred region identified by the arrow on the blur map). The slide is scanned again, and when the new VS is available, the sharpness assessment method verifies the new file and shows that the blurred region disappeared (red arrow in the fourth image).]删除18:<u>(pone.0082710.g001)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone-0082710-g001}</u>\n\n【5】Image quality assessment (IQA) and, more particularly, sharpness evaluation are well-studied fields of research --. Some of the proposed methods use a reference image to which the current image is compared --. However, this approach is unsuitable for VS quality assessment because such reference images are not available. Alternatively, most methods estimate image sharpness by characterizing the edges, contrast, or information content of the image , However, these methods relate to autofocusing; these approaches evaluate the sharpness for each z-position of the microscope stage during image acquisition and choose the position maximizing the sharpness measure as the correct focus plane , In contrast, our application concerns sharpness assessment of a VS after (and not during) imaging (cf. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【6】Studies related to VS sharpness assessment quantify sharpness in high-resolution subregions, i.e. tiles. This methodology identifies poorly focused subregions in the VS. The overall sharpness quality of the VS depends on the quality of each individual subregion. Zerbe et al. developed a distributed and scalable image analysis framework and evaluated the gain in processing time by applying it to a simple automatic quality assessment of VSs, i.e. by classifying each tile of an image into four sharpness categories: excellent quality, acceptable quality, to be reviewed and defective quality . For this task, the authors used the well-known Tenengrad function to characterize the image sharpness . Haralick features (e.g. contrast and entropy computed in a gray-level co-occurrence matrix) have also been used as VS quality factors . Recently, Hashimoto et al. developed an image quality evaluation method based on a linear combination of image sharpness and noise measurements . This method evaluated a quality index based on either an objective evaluation score, determined by comparing a perfect reference image to its artificially degraded version, or a subjective score given by human observers. These objective or subjective scores were then used as targets to train a regression model. The method efficiency was evaluated only on small regions sampled from a single hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained mouse embryo slide that was imaged by two different WSSs.\n\n【7】Similar features were also used in  for cytological VS sharpness assessment. The authors proposed a complete automatic workflow that resolves the challenging problem of imaging single-layered cytological glass slides of sufficient quality. In-focus, single-layered imaging is achieved through an iterative process involving three steps: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> semantic focusing, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> imaging and automated quality assessment, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> saving the image or returning to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> if the resulting VS is of poor quality. Semantic focusing (step 1) ensures that the focus points target cells and thus avoid the common artifacts encountered in a cytological glass slide. The quality assessment procedure (step 2) relies on cell segmentation and the computation of sharpness features on a sample of 200 isolated (or small clusters of) cells. Each cell or cluster of cells is then classified as sharp or blurred by a support vector machine (SVM). In step 3, the percentage of sharp cells is used to determine whether the slide should be rescanned. The general problem of correctly imaging a single-layered slide is more complex for cytological samples than for histological samples because of the higher variations in the 3D landscapes of cytological slides. However, estimating the local sharpness of a histological tile can involve particular problems due to the possible absence of tissue borders or histological structure edges in the evaluated region (see D - F, J - L in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). In contrast, the tiles from a cytological VS have a high probability of displaying borders of isolated cells or cell clusters in which the sharpness features are more sensitive. This is particularly true for the semantic focusing technique introduced in .\n\n【8】![Examples of training samples.\\\nA - F. Examples of blurred samples. G - L. Examples of sharp samples.

These illustrations show typical tiles included in the training set.]删除18:<u>(pone.0082710.g002)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone-0082710-g002}</u>\n\n【9】In addition to image sharpness or noise measurements, other IQA methods have been proposed such as visual codebook-based IQA and local dependency-based IQA . These sophisticated methods aim to solve a general and complex problem known as non-distortion-specific IQA. This problem concerns images that can be altered by multiple distortions, such as JPEG compression artifacts, motion blur, focus blur, or the presence of white noise. However, focusing blur remains an important distortion that can affect VSs because other distortions are minimized by the technology used in modern WSSs. Therefore, the present study concentrates on the specific problem of sharpness evaluation for large images in which the sole distortion considered is a blur due to an incorrect (or suboptimal) focus during acquisition.\n\n【10】In the present study, we present various morphological and staining patterns that are regularly encountered in research activities applied to tissue-based biomarker evaluation , 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> illustrates such a panel of tiles extracted from VSs, with some presenting blurred regions. To significantly reduce the operator time devoted to the VS review process, we developed a supervised classification approach using multiple sharpness features 删除18:<u>(which include or are similar to those used in , )</u> that identifies the blurred regions of a VS on a map. The map thus efficiently informs the scanner operator regarding where additional focus points are required (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【11】In addition to tissue or slide defects (such as bubbles or tissue folds), local focusing during WSI can be altered by other characteristics. Indeed, local sharpness evaluation (conducted by the scanner in small regions centered on the focusing points) is more difficult for areas in which the tissue aspect is almost uniform and presents very little texture (e.g. in the absence of tissue borders, histological structure edges, or staining variations). We thus applied and evaluated our methodology on large datasets in order to cover different tissue aspects (in particular, the presence or absence of histological structures) and staining patterns (excluding fluorescence labeling) that can be encountered in HE and simple IHC VSs. IHC VSs can present nuclear, cytoplasmic and/or membranous expression of the targeted biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze such a panel of cases. This approach allows us to investigate whether the detection of blurred regions is impacted by the presence of edges caused by histological structures in addition to contrast modifications caused by IHC staining, which affect the high spatial frequencies used to measure image sharpness.\n\n【12】Materials 删除19:<u>{#s2}</u>\n=========\n\n【13】1. Training samples 删除19:<u>{#s2a}</u>\n-------------------\n\n【14】For training in the classification methods, 27 histological slides of 4 or 5 µm thickness were digitized at 20X magnification (0.46 µm/pixel) using the NanoZoomer HT Scan System (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). This scanner uses the line-scanning method (i.e. the slide is scanned by lines of 4096 pixels) and time delay integration (i.e. each line is scanned 64 times and averaged) to improve the signal to noise ratio. As mentioned in the introduction, the image sharpness is evaluated on high-resolution subregions of the VS, also denoted as tiles. We thus collected a total of 48,000 tiles of 200×200 pixels sampled from the 27 VSs taken at 20X magnification, which represented typical histological samples. The tile size enabled us to target specific VS regions, which presented different tissue and staining patterns and displayed either sharp or blurred areas.\n\n【15】As detailed in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and illustrated in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, tiles were sampled from VSs to account for two morphologic patterns: structured morphologies (SM, i.e. presenting well-defined histological structures such as colonic glands) and unstructured morphologies (UM, i.e. lacking clear histological structures such as brain tissue). These morphologic characteristics were combined with three staining patterns: HE, nuclear IHC (NS) and cytoplasmic IHC (CS), presenting variable expression levels of the targeted markers. We also included membranous staining patterns in the CS category (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2H]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), considering that (trans)membranous antigens, such as receptors, are also often expressed in the cytoplasm (due to internalization and protein trafficking).\n\n【16】10.1371/journal.pone.0082710.t001\n\n【17】###### Tile origins.\n\n【18】删除20:<u>![]</u>删除18:<u>(pone.0082710.t001)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone-0082710-t001-1}</u>\n\n【19】             Tissue morphology       Hematoxylin and eosin (HE)           Nuclear IHC (NS)         Cytoplasmic IHC (CS)\n  --------- ------------------- ------------------------------------ --------------------------- -------------------------\n                                                                        (tissue; IHC marker)       (tissue; IHC marker)\n  Blurred           SM                    VS1: Endometrium            VS1: Salivary gland; Ki67   VS1: Colon; E-cadherin\n                                         VS2: Parotid gland           VS2: Salivary gland; Ki67     VS2: Bladder; CD34\n                                 VS3: Thyroid (Papillary carcinoma)     VS3: Lymph node; Ki67    \n                    UM                       VS1: Brain                   VS1: Brain; Ki67        VS1: Brain; Galectin-1\n                                      VS2: Brain (Meningioma)             VS2: Brain; Ki67        VS2: Pancreas; Glucagon\n                                                                         VS3\\: Brain; Ki67      \n  Sharp             SM                    VS1: Endometrium              VS1: Lymph node; Ki67     VS1: Colon; E-cadherin\n                                    VS2: Colon (Adenocarcinoma)         VS2: Lymph node; Ki67     VS2: Colon; E-cadherin\n                    UM                       VS1: Liver                    VS1: Brain; p53        VS1: Brain; Galectin-1\n                                       VS2: Joint (Synovitis)              VS2: Brain; p53          VS2: Brain; VEGFR-1\n                                                                         VS3\\: Brain; Ki67      \n\n【20】SM  =  structured morphology; UM  =  unstructured morphology; HE  =  hematoxylin-eosin; IHC  =  immunohistochemistry; NS  =  nuclear staining; CS  =  cytoplasmic and/or membranous staining. A set of 27 VSs was used with different tissue origins and different IHC biomarkers in the NS and CS categories. The VSs with an asterisk correspond to different tissue pieces of the same VS (one tissue piece was blurred while the other was sharp). The CS category includes biomarkers with membranous expression (e.g. CD34 and VEGFR-1). A total of 4,000 blurred and 4,000 sharp tiles were selected for each combination of morphology and staining pattern by targeting specific regions in the VSs (as illustrated in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【21】The combination of morphologic and staining patterns resulted in six categories (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). For each category, we selected 4000 blurred and 4000 sharp tiles from a panel of VSs showing the patterns of interest (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). These different tile categories were included in the supervised dataset to best represent the large diversity of patterns that are encountered in HE and IHC slides.\n\n【22】2. Validation samples 删除19:<u>{#s2b}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【23】To validate the method using independent slides, we selected another 97 VSs from our daily routine and imaged from 4- or 5-µm-thick tissue samples. For each slide, an expert randomly selected up to 20 blurred tiles and up to 20 sharp tiles. This new dataset of 3438 tiles (1462 from 39 HE slides and 1976 from 58 IHC slides) was then used as a validation set to estimate the performance of the classification algorithms . This validation set included tiles that covered at least the six pattern categories included in the training data. The tiles were sampled from various tissue origins (e.g. skin, bladder, colon, pancreas, brain tumor, liver, and thyroid) and various IHC markers (e.g. KI67, glucagon, insulin, IGF1R, E-cadherin, CD79A, FHL2, GFAP, EGFR, HER2, etc.), including samples different from those encountered in the training set (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【24】In addition to quantitative validation, we illustrate an application of this method to complete VSs (included in the independent set of 97 VSs), as detailed in section 3.3.\n\n【25】Methods 删除19:<u>{#s3}</u>\n=======\n\n【26】1. Tile blur characterization 删除19:<u>{#s3a}</u>\n-----------------------------\n\n【27】A set of 16 different blur features was determined per tile to locally evaluate the image sharpness of histological VSs.\n\n【28】In , the authors presented two image analysis metrics: sharpness (SH) and noise (NO). SH was computed for tiles that had been converted to grayscale (i.e. the Y component of the CIE XYZ color space). The gradient direction was determined for each pixel whose gradient was larger than a threshold value 删除18:<u>(determined by Otsu's method )</u>. The edge width 删除20:<u>()</u> was defined as the distance (in pixels) between the local minimum and local maximum of the gradient. As described in , the edge width is modified as follows:\n\n【29】with θ being the edge direction sampled at . The edge width was then averaged across the tile to yield SH:\n\n【30】where is the edge width of the i-th edge.\n\n【31】NO was computed by first subtracting a Gaussian-filtered (σ = 2) tile from the original tile. Using the resulting tile, NO was defined as the mean square of the minimum difference between each pixel and its eight nearest neighbors (in a 3×3 window). In contrast to SH, NO is the average of the NO value determined for the individual red, green and blue channels.\n\n【32】where I(i, j, c) and G~2~(i, j, c) are the intensity values of channel c at row i and column j of the original and Gaussian-filtered tile (with σ = 2), respectively. R and C are, respectively, the numbers of rows and columns in the tile (i.e. R  =  C  =  200 in our application).\n\n【33】We added three other features. The first two used the difference image, (I - G~2~), generated during NO computation and computed the mean value, or mean blur difference (MBD), and standard deviation, or standard blur difference (SDBD), across the difference image, respectively. The third feature is the mean value of the gradient, or the mean gradient magnitude (MGM), of a Gaussian-filtered tile (previously converted to gray-scale) with σ = 0.5 (G~0.5~).\n\n【34】Similar to SH and MGM, the following features were computed for tiles converted to gray-scale. As suggested by , we computed a set of Haralick features, namely, the correlation and entropy features, computed on five gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). For a given tile I of size n x m, the GLCM computed for the offset (Δx, Δy) is defined as follows:\n\n【35】The normalized GLCM, labeled P, is obtained by dividing each element of C by the sum of all the elements of C:\n\n【36】The contrast feature is then calculated as follows:\n\n【37】with L being the maximum possible gray value (for our images, L  =  255).\n\n【38】Similarly, the entropy is calculated as follows:\n\n【39】For each tile in our database, we computed the contrast and entropy values corresponding to the GLCMs for the set of offsets , resulting in ten Haralick features.\n\n【40】For thoroughness, we also used the Tenengrad function (TG~t~), as described in . TG~t~ sums the square of the gradient values above a threshold t . Because all of the tiles are the same size, the difference between TG~0~ (i.e. TG~t~ with t  =  0) and MGM is that the gradient is computed for the original and Gaussian-filtered tiles, respectively. To prevent a strong correlation between the TG~t~ and MGM values, we altered the threshold of each tile by applying Otsu's method to the squared norm of the gradient of the tile.\n\n【41】All of the features had larger values for sharp images compared to blurred images, with the exception of SH, which had larger values for blurred images . All image features were computed in Python using SciPy  and the scikit-image image processing toolkit . For performance purposes, we optimized the computation of the SH, NO, MBD, SDBD, MGM, HE~Δx,Δy~ and TG~t~ features by compiling the corresponding code to LLVM bytecode using the Numba library .\n\n【42】To compare the discriminatory abilities of the 16 features between sharp and blurred images, we used the θ measure, a non-parametric measure of effect size used to characterize the degree of separation of two distributions. This measure is easily estimated by U/mn, i.e. the Mann--Whitney U statistic divided by the product of the two sample sizes . This normalized statistic ranges between 0 and 1, with values near 0.5 indicating similar distributions and values near 0 and 1 indicating strong separation. To simplify the comparison, we ranked the features by means of their discriminatory ability (or separation degree) evaluated by max(U/mn, 1-U/mn), which ranges between 0.5 (complete distribution overlap) and 1 (no overlap).\n\n【43】2. Tile classification and model selection 删除19:<u>{#s3b}</u>\n------------------------------------------\n\n【44】We used two different approaches of supervised classification: the decision tree (DT) approach, for which we tested three different split criteria, and the SVM approach which has been shown to be very efficient in cell classification  and for which we tested different kernels and hyper-parameter values. As detailed below, the DT approach enabled us to include feature selection in the classification process. Another advantage of this approach is that it generates relatively simple classification rules as a series of if-then statements, which are easy to implement in a decision process and are especially fast to apply in production (a particularly beneficial property). We also tested the SVM, which is a powerful, state-of-the-art algorithm with strong theoretical foundations that is particularly well adapted for binary classification in a numerical space . This latter classifier enabled us to approximate the best results we could expect for our classification problems. As detailed below, for each classifier, we used a nested (5-fold x 5-fold) cross-validation to choose the hyper-parameters (inner 5-fold cross-validation) and to estimate the performance of the resulting model (outer 5-fold cross-validation), as is usually recommended to avoid overfitting .\n\n【45】The DT approach executes recursive partitioning of the feature space until it identifies subspaces in which the training cases predominantly belong to the same class (i.e. the majority class, which is allocated to the corresponding subspace). The DT was implemented using the classification tree module of the Statistica package (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK), except when the complete training set (i.e. grouping HE and IHC tiles) was considered. For this very large set (48,000 tiles), we used the QUEST Classification Tree software  . These software packages allowed for the testing of different split criteria (for recursive partitioning), including univariate and multivariate split options. The univariate options are based either on an exhaustive search evaluated by the Gini index of node impurity  or on discriminant-based split criteria 删除18:<u>(based on ANOVA and k-means in the case of quantitative predictors, see )</u>. The univariate split options resulted in a selection of the most discriminating features. The multivariate option determined a discriminant-based linear combination of all of the quantitative predictors provided for the model. In addition, minimal cost-complexity cross-validation pruning  was used to generate the \"right-sized\" tree for each split criterion. The complexity of a DT model is usually determined by its maximum depth, i.e. by the maximum number of splits required to determine the majority class in any region of the feature space. Finally, outer cross-validation (with inner cross-validation pruning performed on each training set) was used to evaluate the predictive performance of each algorithm.\n\n【46】The SVM approach aims to identify the boundary that represents the largest separation, or margin, between two classes. Initially developed for linear separation, the method was extended to solve non-linear problems by transforming the initial feature space (using kernels) into a new space in which the classes are (nearly) linearly separable . Training a SVM classifier requires the selection of a kernel type (and its parameters) and a soft-margin parameter C, i.e. a penalty parameter for allowing some classification errors inside the margin (for nearly linearly separable classes in the transformed space). It can be shown that the SVM classification rule is a function of a subset of the training data that lie on the margin, i.e. the support vectors that determine the complexity of the class boundary implemented by the model . The SVM was implemented using the SVC (Support Vector Classification) scikit-learn Python module . A grid search was performed to identify the optimal hyper-parameters set by cross-validation. The grid search space was defined as\n\n【47】\\- kernels: 删除19:<u>{ linear, rbf }</u>\n\n【48】\\- C: 删除19:<u>{1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1,000}</u>\n\n【49】\\- : 删除19:<u>{10^−5^, 10^−4^, 10^−3^, 10^−2^, 10^−1^}</u>,\n\n【50】where is the coefficient of the radial basis function (rbf) used as the kernel .\n\n【51】Outer cross-validation was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the optimal SVM classifier (defined by the set of hyper-parameter values that gave the best predictive performance in the inner cross-validation step).\n\n【52】As detailed in the results, the different classification algorithms were trained with different feature sets as inputs. We thus implemented a model selection process based on a trade-off between the predictive performance (evaluated by means of nested cross-validation, see above) and model complexity to favor both accurate and quick decision-making in the application phase. Candidate models were first selected on the basis of a tolerance of 0.5% applied to the best accuracy observed among all the generated models. Among these successful candidates, we kept the model(s) that required the lowest number of blur features for computation (which is the most time-consuming task during the application). If several models remained in the resulting selection, we then chose the model with the lowest complexity, evaluated by the maximum depth for the DT and by the number of support vectors for the SVM. This complexity criterion also prevented overfitting in the model selection .\n\n【53】3. Quality map production and VS annotation 删除19:<u>{#s3c}</u>\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【54】The map image was initialized by thresholding the image at 0.1X magnification of the entire slide. In the image, each pixel corresponds to a tile of 200×200 pixels at 20X magnification. To avoid computing the features and classifying tiles outside the tissue area, we first performed an Otsu thresholding procedure on the map image. Pixels corresponding to tiles outside versus within the tissue are were set to 0 versus 1. Tiles whose corresponding pixels were set to 1 were extracted at 20X magnification to compute the blur features and were then classified as being sharp or blurred. As illustrated in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, this classification resulted in a raw map showing black pixels (out-of-tissue area), grey pixels (sharp tiles) and white pixels (blurred tiles). This raw map may be difficult to interpret, especially in the case of scattered misclassification errors. Therefore, a post-processing tool, known as an alternate sequential filter  and consisting of a combination of a gray-scale morphological closing followed by a gray-scale morphological opening (with a 3×3 square as the structuring element), was applied to smooth the raw map and to ease the work of the operator. The contours of the blurred regions on the smoothed blur map were converted to an annotation compatible with NDP.View, the Hamamatsu annotation viewer. This conversion enables one to outline the blurred regions on the navigable VSs (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【55】![Application to complete HE and IHC VSs.\\\nThe first row shows the raw classification results obtained by classifying all of the tiles constituting an HE and an IHC VS, by means of the HE-specialized DT and the IHC-specialized DT , respectively.

The second row shows the final blur map obtained after grayscale morphological closing followed by an opening. In the third row, the borders of the blurred (gray) regions identified in the map are transferred as annotations on the VS view provided by our scanner viewer. Magnified details for the small rectangles  are provided in the last line. In these two magnified fields (scale bar  =  200 µm), the red lines indicate the boundary between a sharp and a blurred region.

Feature analysis and selection 删除19:<u>{#s4a}</u>\n---------------------------------\n\n【58】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> shows the ranking of the features (in decreasing order) based on the discriminatory ability between blurred and sharp tiles. The discriminatory indices were evaluated by max(U/mn, (1--U)/mn) and ranged between 0.5 and 1 . These indices and their rankings were computed for the complete training set as well as for the HE and IHC groups, taken separately. The results in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> demonstrate high discriminatory ability for the HC~Δx,Δy~ family, followed by the gradient-based features (MGM and TG), NO and the HE~Δx,Δy~ family. SDBD, SH and MBD exhibit the weakest discriminatory ability. Interestingly, the feature ranking carried out for the complete training set is equivalent to the ranking average for the HE and IHC groups. This group distinction highlights some slight variations. For example, TG is more discriminatory in the HE tile group, whereas MGM is slightly more discriminatory in the IHC group.\n\n【59】10.1371/journal.pone.0082710.t002\n\n【60】###### Discriminatory ability of the blur features.\n\n【61】删除20:<u>![]</u>删除18:<u>(pone.0082710.t002)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone-0082710-t002-2}</u>\n\n【62】  Feature     Max(U/mn, 1-U/mn)    Rank     Mean Rank                 \n  ---------- ----------------------- --------- ----------- ---- ---- ---- ------\n  HC~11~           0.99032          0.99441    0.99228    1    1    1     1\n  HC~02~           0.99027          0.99350    0.99134    2    3    2    2.5\n  HC~20~           0.98866          0.99423    0.99118    3    2    3    2.5\n  HC~01~           0.98777          0.99117    0.98821    4    4    5    4.5\n  HC~10~           0.98600          0.98941    0.99020    5    5    4    4.5\n  MGM              0.98186          0.98523    0.98386    6    7    6    6.5\n  TG               0.97710          0.98530    0.97831    7    6    8     7\n  NO               0.97123          0.97845    0.98025    8    8    7    7.5\n  HE~10~           0.94974          0.94504    0.95993    9    9    9     9\n  HE~01~           0.94926          0.94264    0.95882    10   10   10    10\n  HE~11~           0.94299          0.93918    0.95236    11   11   11    11\n  HE~02~           0.93177          0.92389    0.94154    12   14   12    13\n  HE~20~           0.93088          0.92497    0.94046    13   13   13    13\n  SDBD             0.81631          0.92933    0.88149    14   12   14    13\n  SH               0.78591          0.81661    0.77058    15   15   16   15.5\n  MBD              0.72515          0.74058    0.85791    16   16   15   15.5\n\n【63】U  =  Mann-Whitney statistic, m  =  n  =  blur and sharp sample sizes.\n\n【64】ALL  =  complete training set (m  =  n  =  24,000); HE  =  HE training set (m  =  n  =  8,000); IHC  =  IHC training set (m  =  n  =  16,000).\n\n【65】HC  =  Haralick contrast, MGM  =  mean gradient magnitude, TG  =  Tenengrad function, NO  =  noise, HE  =  Haralick entropy, SDBD  =  standard deviation of blur difference, SH  =  sharpness, MBD  =  mean blur difference.\n\n【66】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> details the data distributions of four discriminatory features across the six pattern categories constituting the training set.

Columns \\\"B -\\> S\\\" and \\\"S -\\> B\\\" show the number of false negative decisions (i.e. the blurred tiles classified as being sharp) and the number of false positive decisions (i.e. the sharp tiles classified as being blurred), respectively. Concerning DT training, the classification performances resulted from a nested cross-validation (5-fold x 5-fold) carried out either on the HE and IHC groups separately or on all of the training data . Columns \\\"DT algorithm\\\" and \\\"Features in DT model\\\" describe the choices resulting from the model selection method (i.e. DT split criterion and selected features, respectively). All of the results leading to the presented selections are detailed in the supplementary data (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). Concerning the quantitative validation step, the models selected during the training step  were applied to independent sets of tiles . The resulting classification performances are indicated as for training. The number of tiles in each set is specified in column \"N tiles\". Rows \"Pooled\" indicate the results obtained by pooling the two previous rows (HE and IHC) to allow for comparisons with the results in rows \"ALL\" below.\n\n【77】The accuracies (i.e. the percentage of correctly classified tiles) of the HE and IHC classifiers were 98.11% and 96.38%, respectively. Training only one classifier on all the data resulted in a global drop of approximately 1% in accuracy and sensitivity (i.e. the percentage of blurred tiles correctly classified as blurred by the classifier) (see lines \"ALL\" and \"HE + IHC Pooled\" in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). All of these classifiers (selected for providing a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity) were trained with the Gini (univariate) split criterion. The difference between the HE and IHC classifier accuracies can be explained by the higher heterogeneity encountered in IHC slides. In addition, HE staining helps to introduce contrast in VSs because hematoxylin colors all cell nuclei in blue, whereas eosin stains most of the cell cytoplasm (and other extracellular eosinophilic structures) in various shades of pink (or even red). In contrast, IHC VSs mix IHC staining (with variable locations) with hematoxylin counterstaining, making the cell cytoplasm nearly invisible in areas in which the IHC biomarker is not expressed (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). This difference may explain the increased difficulty for distinguishing between blurred and sharp tiles in the IHC group.\n\n【78】We also tested the impact of training more specialized classifiers for IHC VSs, one for nuclear staining and another for cytoplasmic and/or membranous staining (denoted NS and CS categories in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, respectively). The accuracies of the selected classifiers (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>) were 96.68% (NS) and 97.34% (CS). Their pooled performance (97.01%) was slightly higher than that of the IHC classifier (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). However, the specialized NS classifier required a computation of the eight blur features for the tiles (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>), instead of only three for the generic IHC classifier (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). In addition, this generic classifier requires no distinction between staining locations. This latter property is interesting for future applications because subcellular antigen locations may vary in a single VS 删除18:<u>(e.g. due to possible protein translocation between the cell cytoplasm and the cell nucleus, as we observed in a previous study )</u>.\n\n【79】The six pattern categories constituting the training set enabled us to identify which pattern(s) contributed the most to the classification errors. When using the HE-specialized DT to classify the HE tile group, the SM (structured morphology) pattern exhibited the largest (but acceptable) misclassification rate (slightly more than 2%, with a similar impact on the sensitivity), whereas the tiles presenting an UM (unstructured morphology) pattern were nearly always correctly classified (less than 1% of error) with a sensitivity near 100% for the blurred tiles. It should also be noted that the unspecialized DT strongly deteriorated the results for the SM-HE tiles (classification accuracy of approximately 93% and sensitivity of approximately 88%), whereas the results for the UM-HE tiles remained nearly similar (with a slight decrease in specificity). In the IHC group, the IHC-specialized classifier had the greatest difficulty in correctly classifying tiles presenting a combination of the UM pattern and the nuclear staining (NS) location (approximately 6% of errors relatively equidistributed between sharp and blurred tiles). In contrast, the UM-CS combination presented the best classification rate (near 99%). The two other categories (SM-NS and SM-CS) presented intermediate error contributions. In contrast to the HE group, the unspecialized classifier provided similar performances for all categories in the IHC group, without particular deterioration.\n\n【80】For completeness, we compared the DT approach to the SVM, a state-of-the-art classification approach. The SVM showed slightly improved performances compared to the DT approach, at the cost of a higher model complexity. Indeed, the best SVM classifiers, which were separately trained on the HE and IHC groups (with all of the features as input), exhibited classification accuracies of 99.06% and 97.23%, respectively. However, these two SVM models (kernel: rbf, C = 1000 and  = 0.0001) required the computation of dot products with 510 and 2216 support vectors, respectively, to classify a tile. Comparatively, the most accurate DT models, which were generated with all of the features as input, provided similar performances (i.e. 98.56% and 96.63% classification accuracy, respectively) but with maximal DT depths of only 6 and 8, respectively (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). These results imply that DT algorithms provide very simple classification rules, which allow for accurate and quick decision-making in tile classification.\n\n【81】In view of all these results, we therefore chose to use the DT approach for blur detection application and selected the two generic DT classifiers, one for each staining type (HE vs. IHC), as described in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. The resulting models were tested on an independent set of VSs, as described in section 4.3.\n\n【82】3. Validation on an independent tile set and application to entire VSs 删除19:<u>{#s4c}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【83】We first verified that the ability to discriminate blur features was conserved in the validation set of 3438 tiles. We obtained a ranking similar to that previously observed for the training set (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), with a decrease in the discriminatory indices, i.e. between 0.96109 for HC~11~ and 0.65573 for MBD (evaluated on a much smaller dataset than the training set).\n\n【84】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> (at the bottom) details the results obtained with the selected HE and IHC DTs on this completely independent dataset extracted from our daily routine in WSI and including samples vey different from those used for classifier training . These results show an accuracy of near 90% for the two DTs (with a better sensitivity in the case of the HE DT). As previously observed on the training set, these performances decreased when the unspecialized (ALL) DT was used (in particular, the sensitivity for the HE tiles decreased to 82.54%).\n\n【85】In the final application (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), all of the tiles constituting a VS should be classified. A post-processing step that considers the spatial consistency of the resulting tile labels (i.e. sharp or blurred) is then applied, withdrawing scattered classification errors. We found that this complete process takes approximately 15 minutes per image (averaged for the 97 slides of the validation dataset). After transferring blurry region borders as annotations in the VS view, the operator then only needs to verify consistently blurry regions to identify those that require additional focusing points to improve the VS quality (as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). This information may thus strongly reduce the manual reviewing time by focusing the operator's attention on regions identified as blurry and for which the addition of new focusing points could be beneficial for locally improving the VS sharpness. If the operator confirms that the regions outlined in the VS are blurry, he/she can redistribute the focusing planes and the focusing points around the blurry regions and can then queue the slide for a rescan (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1C]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【86】Discussion and Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#s5}</u>\n==========================\n\n【87】Compared to the previous studies mentioned in the introduction , the present study achieved the following objectives:\n\n【88】-   considered various morphological and staining patterns usually encountered in histological samples,\n\n【89】-   developed an extended set of descriptive features and evaluated their effective contribution, and\n\n【90】-   evaluated the systematic performance of various classification algorithms (i.e. DT and SVM approaches, various split criteria for DT and kernels for SVM) using different feature sets as inputs.\n\n【91】A statistical analysis of the blur features showed that the most discriminatory features were the Haralick contrasts, followed by the gradient-based features (MGM, TG), NO, and, finally, the Haralick entropies. These properties were observed when considering the entire dataset and persisted in each of the IHC and HE groups (in the training and validation sets). This feature ranking resulted from univariate analyses and was confirmed from a multivariate point of view by our classification results. Indeed, the less discriminatory features (such as SBD, SH and MBD) were systematically omitted in the best DT models. In addition, NO was also discarded for classifying IHC VSs. Consequently, a method that uses only the NO and SH features 删除18:<u>(such as in )</u> should be less effective in distinguishing blurred from sharp image regions, in particular in IHC VSs.\n\n【92】In the present study, we opted for a classification approach in contrast to Hashimoto et al. who developed a regression model . This latter model requires training data with a quantitative score to characterize tile sharpness. A thresholding step should thus be added to distinguish between blurred and sharp tiles. We preferred a more direct approach based on supervised tile classification (\\\"sharp\\\" vs. \\\"blurred\\\"). Our approach directly provides a binary result for each tile, which is easier and more rapid to interpret by the operator than the score provided by a regression model. As discussed below, our method includes an additional post-processing step that considers the spatial consistency of the resulting tile labels.\n\n【93】Concerning the classification algorithms, we observed no significant performance improvement when using the SVM, a powerful and state-of-the-art algorithm, when compared to the DT approach. For this reason, we deemed it unnecessary to test other state-of-the-art classification algorithms, such as the weak classifier assembly  or random forest . Indeed, these latter algorithms generate more complex classification rules than DT, whereas the expected performance improvement appeared to be low. An increase in rule complexity would require more computational resources and would slow the application phase (which requires the classification of thousands of tiles).\n\n【94】Our analysis identified two efficient DT classifiers, one for HE tiles and one for IHC tiles, based on a reduced number of features (four for HE and three for IHC). We also observed that some tissue patterns induced more difficulties in blurred tile detection. Hence, the IHC tiles were more difficult to classify than the HE tiles, with a particular contribution of UM-NS patterns (i.e. nuclear IHC staining in unstructured tissue regions) to classification errors. These data illustrate the effects of the combination of tissue morphology and staining patterns on the ability to detect blurred image regions. The DT results also indicate that different types of blur features (such as those related to the co-occurrence matrix and the image gradient) are required to accurately detect blurred regions in VSs.\n\n【95】The application to complete VSs consists of generating a raw classification map by using the appropriate (HE or IHC) DT. This raw map is then submitted to post-processing to generate a smoothed blur map that considers spatial consistency. Blurred regions are then outlined on the (navigable) VSs, strongly easing the VS review process. We designed the blur detection method to begin with a batch scanning process. Blur detection of one slide can be performed during the scanning of other slides. The WSS operator does not have to wait until the end of the scan (of dozens of slides) before reviewing each slide and rescanning if necessary. To further automate the workflow, we also plan to integrate our method with the scanner control routines through the use of the application programming interface (API), such as that described in . We could enhance the first focusing step by implementing semantic focusing that can detect tissue folds . Finally, we concentrated the present study on HE and simple IHC VSs. Extensions to special histological staining and double IHC are also included in future research plans.\n\n【96】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Characteristics of the DT models produced during the training phase.

The rate of wound closure was followed by photographing the wounds in a standardized way. The collagen hydroxyproline concentration in the scar tissue was determined on the 18th postoperative day. Helium-neon laser radiation had a statistically significant stimulating effect on collagen synthesis in the wound, with a maximum effect at an energy density of 4 joules/sq cm. The rate of wound closure was enhanced significantly between the third and 12th postoperative days. The argon laser exposure produced a significant increase in collagen concentration both in irradiated and nonirradiated contralateral wounds. However, an acceleration of the healing rate was not registered in this case. The wound contraction up to the fourth day of the experiment was inhibited under helium-neon and argon laser exposure to 20 joules/sq cm. The described effects were not specific for the laser light.

The final output of Hippo signalling is the inhibition of the transcriptional co-activators Yorkie and YAP (yes-associated protein) / TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) in flies and mammals, respectively \\[\\]. Essentially, the core Hippo signalling module is composed of members of the Ste20-like kinase, the MOB (mps one binder) co-activator and the AGC (protein kinase A(PKA)/PKG/PKC-like) kinase families \\[\\]. In Drosophila, the stimulated Ste20-like Hippo kinase phosphorylates and thereby activates a complex composed of Mats (mob as tumour suppressor) and the AGC Warts kinase. The Mats/Warts complex then phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie. In mammals, the counterparts of the Hippo/Mats/Warts/Yorkie cascade, namely MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinases 1/2), MOB1A/B, LATS1/2 (large tumour suppressor 1/2) and YAP/TAZ, function in a similar fashion. While all core Hippo components upstream of Yorkie have been defined as tumour suppressors in flies, Yorkie displays proto-oncogenic properties \\[\\]. In mammals, genetic studies provided the same picture, namely that loss of MST1/2 \\[\\], MOB1A/B \\[\\], or LATS1 \\[\\] results in tumour growth, while YAP overexpression is sufficient to induce tumours \\[\\]. Therefore, mammalian Hippo signalling has been defined as a tumour suppressor pathway that is essential for the control of the proto-oncoproteins YAP/TAZ \\[,\\]. Since the functions and regulation of YAP/TAZ have been reviewed recently \\[\\], we will focus in this review only on the LATS-mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, for a discussion of the crosstalk between Hippo and Wnt/TGFβ signalling we refer the reader to a recent overview provided by Varelas and Wrana \\[\\].\n\n【2】Drosophila Warts and mammalian LATS1/2 kinases are members of the serine/threonine AGC class of protein kinases \\[\\]. More specifically, LATS1/2 have been classified as a subgroup of AGC kinases together with NDR1/2 (nuclear Dbf2 related kinases 1/2; also known as STK38/STK38L), based on two unique characteristics, a conserved N-terminal regulatory domain (NTR) and an insert between subdomains VII and VIII of the catalytic kinase domain \\[\\]. Like other AGC kinases, LATS/NDR kinases are regulated by phosphorylation on the activation segment motif (AS; also referred to as T-loop) and a C-terminally located hydrophobic motif (HM), which will be discussed later in more detail. Initially, our understanding of LATS/NDR kinases was mainly based on genetic studies performed in yeast and flies \\[\\]. Therefore, before focusing entirely on our current understanding of mammalian LATS/NDR kinases, we feel that it is appropriate to give a brief historic overview of key discoveries with respect to core Hippo signalling.\n\n【3】In budding and fission yeast, the LATS/NDR kinases Dbf2p and Sid2p were described as central members of MEN/SIN signalling which is essential for proper mitotic exit \\[\\], while the LATS/NDR kinases Cbk1 and Orb6 were attributed functions in the regulation of morphogenesis \\[\\]. In Drosophila, Warts and Tricornered (the counterparts of mammalian LATS1/2 and NDR1/2, respectively) were discovered more than 10 years ago \\[-\\], and subsequent studies established Warts and Trc (Tricornered) as key players in Hippo signalling and dendritic tiling, respectively \\[,\\]. Significantly, human LATS1 and NDR1 were able to rescue the loss of Warts and Trc function, respectively \\[,\\], strongly suggesting that LATS/NDR functions are conserved between flies and mammals \\[\\]. In 2002, Tapon et al. reported the regulation of Warts by the scaffolding protein Salvador (also known as WW45 in mammals) \\[\\]. However, the breakthrough for Hippo signalling were five publications in 2003 \\[-\\], demonstrating that the Ste20-like kinase Hippo is functioning upstream of Warts in tissue growth control. Significantly, one study even showed that human MST2 can compensate for Hippo loss of function \\[\\]. Subsequently, Lai et al. described Mats (also known as dMOB1) as a key regulator of Warts downstream of Hippo \\[\\]. The same study also showed that hMOB1A can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in flies \\[\\]. Next, the Pan laboratory discovered first that proto-oncogenic Yorkie was functioning downstream of Hippo/Warts/Mats signalling \\[\\], and then also showed the phospho-regulation of Yorkie by Warts \\[\\]. These studies enabled then the Pan and Guan laboratories to establish how YAP (one of two human counterparts of Yorkie) was regulated by LATS1/2 phosphorylation in mammalian cells \\[,\\], which will be discussed in more detail later.\n\n【4】Since these discoveries were published nearly a decade ago, the Drosophila community has continued to discover positive and negative regulators of Hippo signalling, which has been reviewed in detail recently \\[\\]. Based on our personal interest in kinase signalling in the Hippo pathway, we will only briefly mention how additional kinases influence Hippo signalling, besides Hippo/MST and Warts/LATS kinases. Recently, the kinases Tao (thousand and one) and HIPKs (homeodomain-interacting protein kinases) were shown to regulate Hippo activity \\[,\\] and Yki function \\[,\\], respectively. Both regulatory mechanisms appear to be conserved from flies to humans, since human TAO1 can also activate MST2 \\[\\], and HIPK2 promotes YAP activity in human cells \\[\\]. In addition, Sik (salt-inducible kinase) has recently been shown to be required for Hippo signalling by phosphorylating Salvador in flies \\[\\]. However, while human SIK2 can also inhibit YAP activity in HEK293 cells, the molecular mechanism must be different between flies and mammals, since the phosphorylation site in Drosophila Salvador is not conserved in mammals \\[\\]. This molecular difference was not so surprising, since the transcriptional outputs of Hippo signalling are known to differ significantly between flies and mammalian cells \\[\\], and Bossuyt et al. recently reported fundamental differences in the upstream regulatory mechanisms of Hippo signalling between Drosophila and mammals \\[\\]. Nevertheless, in spite of this growing complexity upstream of Hippo, Drosophila genetics still supports a linear Mats/Warts/Yorkie cascade downstream of Hippo \\[\\]. In light of this canonical Hippo signalling (Hippo signals to Mats/Warts, which then regulates Yorkie), we review here the regulation and functions of mammalian LATS1/2 kinases.\n\n【5】Regulation of mammalian LATS/NDR kinases\n----------------------------------------\n\n【6】In spite of the fast progress with deciphering Warts and LATS1/2 functions in flies and mammals, the mechanism of NDR1/2 regulation by phosphorylation currently must serve as a model for LATS1/2 regulation \\[,\\]. Therefore, we will first describe how mammalian NDR1/2 kinases are regulated, before highlighting our limited understanding of the regulatory mechanism of mammalian LATS1/2 删除21:<u>(see Table  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. As already mentioned, NDR1/2 kinases are members of a subgroup of AGC kinases containing two key regulatory phosphorylation sites \\[\\], the Ser281/282 AS and Thr444/Thr442 HM, respectively \\[\\]. Binding of hMOB1A/B (the human counterparts of Mats) to the NTR domain of NDR1/2, which is highly conserved from yeast to humans and located N-terminally of the catalytic domain \\[,\\], increases the auto-phosphorylation activity of NDR1/2, thereby elevating Ser281/282 phosphorylation on NDR1/2 \\[\\]. In contrast, HM phosphorylation of NDR1/2 is performed independently of NDR1/2 kinase activity \\[\\]. MST1/2 (the human counterparts of Hippo) and MST3, another member of the MST kinase family \\[\\], can phosphorylate NDR1/2 on Thr444/442 \\[-\\]. These S281 and Thr444 phosphorylations occur independently of Insulin/IGF-1/PDK1 signalling \\[\\], but are counteracted by PP2A (protein phosphatase type 2A), since recombinant PP2A dephosphorylates NDR1 in vitro\\[\\] and treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA), a potent PP2A inhibitor, increases NDR1/2 phosphorylation levels \\[,\\]. NDR1/2 versions carrying S281/282A, S281D, S281E, T444/442A, T444D or T444E mutations have dramatically reduced kinase activities upon OA treatment \\[,\\], suggesting that both regulatory sites on NDR1/2 are essential for NDR1/2 kinase activity, but cannot be mimicked by standard phospho-mimetic alterations. Taken together, these biochemical studies conducted by the Hemmings laboratory defined the following regulatory mechanisms: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> binding of hMOB1A/B to the NTR of NDR1/2 triggers auto-phosphorylation of NDR1/2 on Ser281/282, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> MST1/2/3 kinases phosphorylate NDR1/2 on Thr444/442, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> PP2A can dephosphorylate both sites on NDR1/2 .\n\n【7】###### \n\n【8】Overview of the regulation of mammalian LATS/NDR kinases by phosphorylation\n\n【9】  Kinase(s)   Upstream kinase    Site(s)     Role of phosphorylation\n  --------------- ---------------------- --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------\n  NDR1/2          Auto-phosphorylation   Ser281/Ser282   Essential for kinase activity \\[,\\]\n  NDR1/2          MST1/2                 Thr444/Thr442   Crucial for kinase activity \\[,\\]\n  NDR1/2          MST3                   Thr442          Crucial for kinase activity \\[,\\]\n  LATS1           Unknown mechanism\\#    Ser909          Essential for kinase activity \\[,\\]\\#\n  LATS1           MST1/2\\#               Thr1079         Essential for kinase activity \\[,\\]\\#\n  LATS1           Cdk1/cyclin B          Thr490          Might play a role in mitosis \\[\\]\n                                         Ser613           \n  LATS1           NUAK1                  Ser464          Controls LATS1 protein stability \\[\\]\n  LATS2           Aurora A               Ser83/Ser380    plays a role in mitosis \\[-\\]\n  LATS2           CHK1/2                 Ser408          Plays a role in DNA damage signalling \\[\\]\n  LATS2           PKA                    Ser172          Regulate LATS2 activity towards YAP \\[\\]\n                                         Ser380           \n                                         Ser592           \n                                         Ser598           \n\n【10】\\#The potential auto- and trans-phosphorylation events on LATS1/2 (on Ser909/Ser872 and Thr1079/Thr1041) are not yet dissected. Therefore, we can only predict here that MST1/2 mainly phosphorylate Thr1079/Thr1041 on LATS1/2, based on the reported conserved regulatory mechanism between MST1/2 and NDR1/2 in human cells \\[,\\] and Hippo and Warts/Trc in fly cells \\[\\].\n\n【11】Importantly, these regulatory mechanisms are more complicated in mammalian cells. MST1/2 kinases also phosphorylate hMOB1A/B on Thr12 and Thr35, thereby increasing the affinity of hMOB1A/B towards NDR1/2 \\[\\]. Moreover, NDR1 deficient in hMOB1A/B binding cannot be phosphorylated by MST1 on Thr444 in S-phase arrested cells \\[\\], suggesting that hMOB1A/B binding to NDR1/2 is required for the phosphorylation of both regulatory sites in human cells \\[\\]. NDR1/2 are also regulated by binding to hMOB2, which is a level of regulation that does not exist with LATS1/2, since hMOB2 does not bind to LATS1/2 \\[\\]. hMOB2 competes with hMOB1A/B for binding to the NTR of NDR1/2, where hMOB2 binding appears to be inhibitory, while hMOB1A/B binding is activating \\[\\]. In addition, MICAL-1 (molecules interacting with CasL 1) competes with MST1 for binding to the HM of NDR1/2, thereby antagonizing MST1-induced NDR activation \\[\\]. The TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex 2) can also interact with NDR1 in HeLa cells \\[\\], however, whether this interaction influences NDR1/2 activity is yet to be determined. The subcellular localisation of NDR1/2 seems to provide a further level of regulation, since membrane targeting of NDR1/2 is sufficient to trigger NDR1/2 phosphorylation and activation \\[\\].\n\n【12】LATS1/2 also contain the two conserved key regulatory phosphorylation sites of AGC kinases, the Ser909/872 AS and Thr1079/Thr1041 HM, respectively \\[\\]. Both sites are phosphorylated in cells and are essential for LATS1 kinase activity, since LATS1 S909A or T1079A mutants are inactive \\[,\\]. Like with NDR1/2, LATS1 activity is counteracted by PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the AS and HM, since OA treatment of mammalian cells results in dramatically increased AS/HM phosphorylation and kinase activity of LATS1 \\[,\\]. hMOB1A/B also bind to the conserved NTR domain of LATS1/2 \\[,\\], but whether this affects the auto-phosphorylation activity of LATS1/2 is still undefined. Moreover, LATS1 deficient in hMOB1A/B binding is inactive and does not phosphorylate YAP \\[,\\], and in MOB1A/B double knock out (DKO) keratinocytes LATS1/2 phosphorylation on the HM is decreased, while MST1/2 appears unaffected \\[\\], indicating that LATS1/hMOB1 complex formation is required for LATS1 phosphorylation and kinase activity. Additionally, hMOB1A/B protein stability is regulated by the Praja2 E3 ligase, which can influence LATS1/2 functionality by decreasing hMOB1A/B levels \\[\\]. Phosphorylation of hMOB1A/B on Thr12 and Thr35 by MST1/2 further plays a role in regulating LATS1/hMOB1 complex formation, since T12A and T35A mutants of hMOB1A/B did not bind to LATS1 \\[\\]. MST1/2 also phosphorylate LATS1/2 \\[\\], but whether MST1/2 phosphorylate only the HM of LATS1/2 is currently unknown. However, in MST1/2-deficient liver cells, LATS1 S909 and T1079 phosphorylation was not impaired, although MOB1A/B phosphorylation on Thr12/35 was absent \\[\\]. In mouse thymocytes MST1/2 phosphorylation of MOB1A/B also functions independent of LATS1/2 \\[\\], strongly suggesting that LATS/MOB1 complex formation is not always essential for LATS phosphorylation/activation. The subcellular localisation of LATS1 is also likely to play a role in the regulation of LATS1 activity, since membrane targeting of LATS1 increased LATS1 activity \\[\\]. Significantly, membrane targeting of Warts together with Mats was sufficient to reduce tissue growth in Drosophila\\[\\], suggesting that the membrane bound pool of LATS1/2 might be physiologically relevant as well. In contrast, in mouse keratinocytes LATS1/2 seem to be activated by MST1/2 in the nucleus \\[\\]. In summary, current evidence suggests that LATS1/2 are likely to be regulated in a similar fashion as already reported for NDR1/2 \\[\\]. AS and HM phosphorylations of LATS1/2 are essential for kinase activation, but whether these specific phosphorylation events are regulated through hMOB1A/B-mediated auto-phosphorylation on Ser909/872 on one hand, and by MST1/2 phosphorylation of Thr1079/1041 on the other hand, is yet to be defined experimentally. Certainly, the subcellular localisation of LATS1/2 plays a role in their activation as well. Very likely, different subcellular pools of LATS1/2 are regulated differently dependent on the cell type specific context.\n\n【13】Besides these regulatory AS and HM phosphorylations, LATS1/2 kinases are controlled by additional phosphorylation events 删除21:<u>(Table  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. LATS1 is phosphorylated on Thr490/Ser613 by Cdk1/cyclin B, which could play a role in mitosis \\[\\]. LATS2 is phosphorylated on Ser83/380 and Ser408 by Aurora A and CHK1/2, respectively, which seems to play a role in mitotic progression and DNA damage signalling \\[-\\]. Phosphorylation of LATS2 by PKA on Ser172/380/592/598 further stimulates LATS2 activity towards YAP \\[\\]. Loss of PKA phosphorylation on LATS2 neither affects the LATS2/hMOB1 interaction, nor alters the AS and HM phosphorylations of LATS2, although the LATS2 kinase activity towards YAP is impaired \\[\\]. This suggests that other activating factors such as changes in subcellular localisation and structural conformation might be dependent on PKA phosphorylation of LATS1/2. Moreover, phosphorylation of LATS1 by NUAK-1 (novel (nua) kinase family 1) on Ser464 controls LATS1 protein stability \\[\\]. However, whether this phosphorylation event regulates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of LATS1 by the Itch and WWP1 E3 ligases \\[-\\] is currently unknown. Furthermore, LATS1/2 protein stability can be controlled by HSP90 \\[\\] and ROS-PKC delta signalling \\[\\]. Significantly, LATS2 expression levels are further regulated on the transcriptional level by the transcription factors FOXP3 and p53 \\[,\\]. LATS2 expression is also regulated by TTP (tristetraprolin), an ARE (AU-rich element) binding protein that promotes the degradation of ARE-containing transcripts \\[\\], and at least six different microRNAs have been shown to negatively regulate LATS2 expression \\[-\\].\n\n【14】Besides the regulatory protein-protein interaction (PPI) between hMOB1A/B and LATS1/2 kinases \\[\\], mammalian Hippo signalling is regulated by additional PPIs which directly or indirectly affect LATS/NDR activity \\[,\\]. Due to the emphasis of this review, we focus on discussing reported direct PPIs of LATS1/2 with scaffolding/adaptor proteins. Scribble has been shown to link MST/LATS/YAP/TAZ complexes, thereby facilitating LATS phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ \\[\\]. The Angiomotin proteins AMOT, AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 can bind to and activate LATS1/2 kinases \\[\\], in addition to forming AMOT/YAP and AMOT/TAZ complexes \\[-\\]. The mammalian Ajuba LIM proteins, Ajuba, LIMD1 and WTIP, can interact with LATS1/2, which seems to decrease LATS1/2 phosphorylation of YAP \\[,\\], suggesting that Ajuba LIM proteins are negative regulators of LATS1/2 activity. Kibra overexpression appears to stimulate Thr1079 phosphorylation by binding to LATS1 \\[\\], while depletion of Kibra caused a decrease of LATS1 phosphorylation on Ser909 \\[\\]. However, the involvement of endogenous MST1/2 and hMOB1A/B in these regulatory PPIs are yet unknown, therefore it is currently not possible to describe in more detail how these scaffolding/adaptor proteins regulate LATS1/2.\n\n【15】Substrates of mammalian LATS/NDR kinases\n----------------------------------------\n\n【16】As already mentioned, LATS1/2 phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ is a key event of the canonical Hippo pathway 删除21:<u>(Tables  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP on Ser61/109/127/164/381 \\[,\\] and TAZ on Ser66/89/117/311 \\[\\], which led to the definition of a HXRXXS/T consensus motif for LATS1/2 kinases. YAP phosphorylation on Ser127 increases 14-3-3 binding to YAP, which results in the cytoplasmic retention of inactive Ser127-phosphorylated YAP \\[,\\]. In contrast, phosphorylation of YAP on Ser381 regulates YAP protein stability \\[\\]. TAZ phosphorylation on Ser89 and Ser311 follows a very similar principle, with Ser89 phosphorylation facilitating 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic retention of TAZ \\[,\\] and Ser311 phosphorylation regulating TAZ protein stability \\[\\].

LATS1 phosphorylates MYPT1 (myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1) on Ser445, thereby promoting MYPT1 phosphatase activity \\[\\]. LATS2 also phosphorylates 14-3-3γ on Ser59 \\[\\] and Snail1 on Thr203 \\[\\], which influences P-body formation and Snail1 protein stability, respectively. The phosphorylation of 14-3-3 by LATS2 is particularly intriguing, since this might represent an additional regulatory level of the 14-3-3/YAP interaction that drives the cytoplasmic retention of inactive YAP. LATS2 can also phosphorylate DYRK1A (dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A), which enhances DYRK1A kinase activity and thereby possibly plays a role in RB-mediated senescence \\[\\]. Significantly, the phosphorylation motifs in MYPT1 and 14-3-3γ do not align with the postulated HXRXXS/T consensus motif for LATS1/2 kinases, but rather display the basic R/KXXS/T motif, which is very common amongst AGC kinases \\[\\].\n\n【29】NDR1/2 kinases have three documented substrates 删除21:<u>(Tables  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. NDR1/2 phosphorylate the cell cycle regulator p21/Cip1 on Ser146, thereby regulating p21 protein stability \\[\\]. NDR1/2 also phosphorylate murine AAK1 (AP-2 associated kinase-1) and Rabin8 (Rab8 guanine nucleotide exchange factor) on Ser635 and Ser240, respectively \\[\\]. NDR2 has further been shown to phosphorylate Rabin8 on Ser272 in human cells \\[\\], which is the same site as previously reported for mouse Rabin8 phosphorylation on Ser240 删除21:<u>(Tables  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. NDR1 can also phosphorylate YAP in vitro\\[\\], however, the in vivo phosphorylation of YAP by NDR1/2 has not been documented so far. Intriguingly, two of three NDR1/2 substrates are also phosphorylated on the HXRXXS/T motif 删除21:<u>(Table  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>, suggesting that the HXRXXS/T motif might be a common feature of LATS1/2 and NDR1/2 kinases. This speculation is further support by the notion that LATS1 and NDR1 display the same peptide substrate preferences in vitro, with the ideal substrate peptide containing the HXRXXS/T motif \\[\\].\n\n【30】Of course, the substrate phosphorylations by LATS/NDR are counteracted by protein phosphatases to enable cells to rapidly adapt their signalling outputs, hence it is not surprising that PP1A was reported to mediate the dephosphorylation of YAP/TAZ \\[,\\]. PTPN14 (non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase 14) has also been shown to regulate YAP function, but whether this regulation is dependent of PTPN14 tyrosine phosphatase activity is currently debatable \\[\\]. Possibly, PTPN14 influences the Tyr phosphorylation of YAP by c-Abl \\[\\] than playing a role in counter balancing LATS1/2 substrate phosphorylation. However, since PKL01, a LATS/NDR homologue in plants, has recently been shown to be a dual-specificity kinase that can phosphorylate Ser/Thr and Tyr residues \\[\\], it is tempting to speculate that it is just a question of time until the LATS/NDR substrate spectrum will be expanded to Tyr phosphorylations. Last, but not least, we would like to stress that current genetic evidence from Drosophila studies \\[\\] suggests Warts (the fly counterpart of LATS1/2) is very likely to have additional substrates besides Yorkie (the fly counterpart of YAP/TAZ). In this context, it is noteworthy that Thompson and colleagues recently reported that Warts phosphorylates and inhibits the actin regulator Enabled, thereby restricting F-actin polymerization to local migrating clusters \\[\\]. These findings suggest that the mammalian counterpart(s) of Enabled are very likely to also represent novel LATS1/2 substrates, besides pointing out that Drosophila genetics combined with biochemical approaches are likely to keep on pointing the way with regard to discovering novel LATS/NDR substrates.\n\n【31】Functions of mammalian LATS/NDR kinases\n---------------------------------------\n\n【32】In Drosophila, loss of the tumour suppressor Warts (the fly counterpart of mammalian LATS1/2) is larval lethal \\[,\\]. In contrast, LATS1 knock-out (KO) mice are viable \\[\\], while LATS2 knock-out mice die during embryonic development, most likely due to defective cytokinesis resulting in genomic instability \\[,\\]. However, LATS1 null animals develop tumours \\[\\], and immortalised LATS2 null MEFs display loss of contact inhibition \\[,\\], indicating that LATS1/2 might function as tumour suppressors in mammals \\[\\]. LATS1/2 whole body DKO animals have not been reported yet. Nevertheless, a study combining LATS2 KO with RNAi depletion of LATS1 has shown that LATS1/2 kinases are crucial for early embryonic development \\[\\]. More specifically, LATS1/2 are required to distinguish between trophectoderm and inner cell mass in preimplantation mouse embryos \\[\\]. LATS1/2 also play a role in heart development \\[,\\], since interference with LATS1/2 function by either overexpressing dominant-negative LATS2 \\[\\] or heart specific deletion of LATS1/2 \\[\\] resulted in heart abnormalities. Taken together, LATS1/2 play important roles in embryonic development and heart formation, besides functioning as tumour suppressors in mammals.\n\n【33】While studies of tissue specific ablation of LATS1/2 function in animals are still limited in number, the roles of LATS1/2 as major regulators of the YAP/TAZ proto-proteins are well established \\[,\\]. In canonical Hippo signalling MST1/2 activated LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on Ser127/89 and Ser381/311, respectively, thereby controlling YAP/TAZ on two levels: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Ser127/89-mediated spatial regulation (nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling) and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Ser381/311-mediated phospho-degron mediated temporal regulation (degradation) 删除21:<u>(see Tables  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. However, the spatial regulation of YAP by LATS1/2 appears to be more complicated, since in sparse human and murine cell lines Ser127/112-phosphorylated YAP can also be detected in nuclei \\[\\]. Moreover, the model of MST1/2-LATS1/2 mediated regulation of YAP has been challenged by studies of MST1/2 and YAP KO animals. First, liver specific deletion of MST1/2 in mice causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by YAP deregulation without any apparent involvement of LATS1/2 \\[\\]. Second, YAP is negatively regulated in keratinocytes without any apparent involvement of MST1/2 or LATS1/2 signalling \\[\\]. Third, in mouse thymocytes MST1/2 mainly signals through phosphorylation of MOB1A/B without any apparent involvement of LATS1/2 or YAP \\[\\]. Fourth, in the mouse intestine YAP displays a growth-suppressive function restricting Wnt signals during intestinal regeneration \\[\\]. These studies suggest that 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> MST1/2 does not always signal through LATS1/2 to YAP, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> MST/LATS signalling are dispensable for YAP regulation in specific cell types, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> MST1/2 signalling can function completely independent of the LATS/YAP signalling branch in specialised cell types, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> YAP does not always function as a proto-oncoprotein, but could also have context dependent tumour suppressive activity in the colon.\n\n【34】This last point is also supported by studies of breast cancer patients, which currently suggest that YAP might have oncogenic and tumour suppressive functions dependent on the breast cancer subtype \\[\\]. Now a similar picture appears to evolve with respect to the role of YAP in colon cancer, since Camargo and colleagues found that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas \\[\\], while other studies suggest that YAP functions as a proto-oncoprotein in the colon \\[\\]. The regulation of YAP in HCC is also not completely clear. In a significant fraction of human HCC samples Zhou et al. detected a correlation between decreased phospho-S127 YAP and decreased MST1 activity, arguing that MST1/2 activity is a key determinant upstream of YAP \\[\\]. In contrast, Li et al. reported that in their HCC samples phospho-Ser127 YAP is decreased together with phosphorylated LATS1/2, while MST1/2 activity, as judged by the phosphorylation status of MST1/2, was not affected \\[\\]. In summary, these findings illustrate that in human breast, colon and hepatic malignancies the role of the MST1/2-LATS1/2-YAP axis will most likely need to be defined based on cancer subtypes.\n\n【35】Significantly, LATS1/2 signalling could play a further role in mammalian stem cells \\[,\\]. YAP needs to be inactivated during the differentiation process of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and elevated during iPS (induced pluripotent stem cells) reprogramming, illustrating that YAP is a critical regulator of stem cell pluripotency \\[\\]. However, in these settings the regulation of YAP by LATS1/2 is yet to be defined. This point is important, since Zhou et al. showed that MST1/2 signalling plays a crucial role in YAP regulation in colon stem cells without apparent involvement of LATS1/2 signalling \\[\\], suggesting that the regulation of YAP in stem cells might not always depend on LATS1/2. Nevertheless, knockdown of LATS2 can increase the efficiency of the formation of human iPS, most likely by releasing the normal repressive function of LATS2 as TAZ antagonist \\[\\]. Therefore, LATS1/2 appear to be key players in mammalian stem cell biology, although much work is yet to be done to understand precisely how LATS1/2 function upstream of YAP/TAZ in this specific cell type.\n\n【36】Whatever the case might be in cancer and stem cells, in mostly normal human cell lines (in particular HEK293 and MCF10A cells) LATS1/2 function downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as central controllers of YAP/TAZ activities \\[\\]. The Guan and Wu laboratories discovered that LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) and S1P (Sphingosine-1-phosphate) are major serum components responsible for YAP/TAZ activation \\[,\\]. More specifically, Yu et al. showed that LPA and S1P act through G12/13-coupled receptors to inhibit LATS1 S909/T1079 phosphorylation and activity, thereby allowing the dephosphorylation and consequent activation of YAP/TAZ \\[\\]. Stimulation of protease-activated receptors (PARs; another group of GPCRs) also results in the inhibition of LATS1 activity due to decreased Ser909 and Thr1079 phosphorylation, which results in decreased YAP1 S127 phosphorylation, consequently allowing nuclear accumulation of active YAP \\[\\]. Moreover, Guan and colleagues found that glucagon and epinephrine act through Gs-coupled receptors to stimulate LATS1 S909/T1079 phosphorylation, followed by phosphorylation and inhibition of YAP by activated LATS1/2 \\[\\]. Significantly, these studies further suggest that GPCR signalling acts through Rho GTPases to trigger changes in LATS1/2 phosphorylation completely independent of MST1/2 signalling \\[,\\]. This raises the question how Ser909 and Thr1079 phosphorylation of LATS1/2 is regulated in this setting 删除21:<u>(see also Table  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Potentially, changes in actin dynamics modulate these phosphorylation events \\[\\], but the molecular mechanisms are currently not understood.\n\n【37】EGF (epidermal growth factor) signalling seems also to be able to regulate Hippo signalling in MCF10A cells \\[\\], which is supported by a recent genetic study in Drosophila\\[\\]. However, the role of EGF/EGFR signalling upstream of the Hippo pathway is currently debatable, since data from the Guan laboratory suggest that EGF has no significant effect on YAP phosphorylation \\[,\\]. In spite of these conflicting results, it is currently undisputed that LATS1/2 also function outside of the canonical Hippo pathway \\[\\]. The Kolch and O'Neill laboratories have shown that K-ras signalling can function upstream of MST2-LATS1 in non-canonical Hippo signalling \\[,\\]. MST2 and LATS1/2 further play a role in Raf-1 activation by regulating the levels of the catalytic phosphatase subunit PP2A-C \\[\\]. Moreover, LATS2 can regulate the levels of the p53 tumour suppressor by binding to Mdm2, the E3 ligase of p53 \\[\\]. LATS1/2 have also been reported as regulators of different G1/S, G2/M, and mitotic cell cycle checkpoints, which have already been summarised elsewhere \\[,\\]. Taken together, LATS1/2 are central players in the regulation of YAP/TAZ functions in cancer and stem cell biology, although LATS1/2 also play significant roles in non-canonical Hippo signalling and even Hippo independent pathways.\n\n【38】While the activation mechanism of NDR1/2 is much better understood than the one of LATS1/2, much less is known about the biological functions of NDR1/2. NDR1 KO mice are viable, but develop T-cell lymphoma, most likely due to defective pro-apoptotic signalling \\[\\]. NDR2 KO mice or NDR1/2 DKO animals have not been reported yet, however, dogs carrying a mutation in NDR2 display retinal degeneration \\[\\]. Furthermore, it has been reported that human NDR1/2 play a role in centrosome duplication in S-phase \\[,\\], contribute to mitotic progression \\[,\\], and regulate the G1/S cell cycle transition by phosphorylating p21 \\[\\]. Moreover, NDR1 regulates the protein stability of the proto-oncoprotein c-myc \\[,-\\]. However, the mechanism of c-myc regulation by NDR1 is currently debatable, since Califano and colleagues reported that it is kinase activity dependent \\[\\], while the Hemmings laboratory argues it is independent of NDR1 activity \\[,\\]. Taken together, these reports suggest that NDR1/2 are important cell cycle regulators. The regulation of the G1/S cell cycle transition by NDR1/2 can be explained by the negative regulation of the p21 cell cycle inhibitor combined with the positive regulation of c-myc levels \\[\\]. However, the substrates functioning downstream of NDR1/2 in S-phase and mitosis are yet to be defined.\n\n【39】NDR1 functions additionally in apoptotic signalling \\[,\\], and has also been reported to play some role in oxidative stress MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling \\[,\\]. Furthermore, NDR2 has recently been described as regulator of ciliogenesis via phosphorylating Rabin 8 \\[\\]. Last, but not least, Jan and colleagues reported recently \\[\\] the identification of the first NDR1/2 substrates in neurons 删除21:<u>(see Tables  删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. The authors functionally validated two substrates, showing that AAK1 and Rabin 8 function downstream of NDR1/2 in neuronal dendrite and synapse formation \\[\\]. In summary, NDR1/2 function in the regulation of cell cycle progression, centrosome biology, stress/apoptotic signalling, and neuronal dendrite/synapse formation.\n\n【40】Mammalian LATS/NDR kinases, centrosomes and the actin cytoskeleton\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】As already mentioned NDR1/2 kinases play a part in centrosome biology, most likely by associating with centrosomes \\[,\\]. LATS1/2 have also been detected on centrosomes \\[\\], but the centrosomal function of LATS1/2 is currently not well understood. Nevertheless, two factors involved in centrosome-based ciliogenesis, NPHP4 and 9 (nephrocystin proteins 4 and 9), have been shown to regulate YAP/TAZ function \\[,\\]. NPHP4 interacts with LATS1 and inhibits LATS1 mediated phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ \\[,\\], while NPHP9 targets TAZ to the nucleus in a TAZ/NPHP9 complex \\[\\]. Whether these regulatory processes involve cytoskeletal changes is currently unclear, although YAP/TAZ are downstream effectors of changes in the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cell shape and the cytoskeleton \\[\\].\n\n【42】In particular, the actin cytoskeleton has recently gained more attention in the Hippo community. In Drosophila and human cells F-actin remodelling alters Hippo signalling \\[\\]. Piccolo and colleagues found that YAP/TAZ are downstream of mechanical signals that are influenced by extracellular matrix rigidity and cell shape \\[\\]. Significantly, this process is dependent on Rho GTPase activity and F-actin dynamics, but appears to be independent of LATS1/2 signalling \\[\\]. The Sasaki laboratory also reported a regulation of YAP by cell morphology in an F-actin dependent manner, although their data suggest that LATS1/2 are involved in this process \\[\\]. In support of the model which places F-actin dynamics upstream of LATS1/2 to regulate YAP, Zhao et al. showed that cell attachment and cytoskeleton remodelling regulates LATS1/2 activity and consequently YAP activity \\[\\]. Moreover, in human cells GPCR signalling acts through F-actin remodelling to trigger changes in LATS1/2 activity towards YAP/TAZ \\[,\\]. Based on these findings the role of LATS1/2 in these settings is debatable, however, all these studies fully agree that YAP/TAZ function as sensors and mediators of mechanical inputs which are influenced by the cellular architecture and microenvironment.\n\n【43】Intriguingly, it has been reported that LATS1 can bind to actin and inhibit actin polymerisation \\[\\]. Moreover, LATS1 interacts with Zyxin \\[\\] and LIMK1 \\[\\], two regulators of actin filament assembly. These findings suggest that LATS1 might also function in mechanosensing, maybe even independent of YAP/TAZ. Whatever the case, in Drosophila, mutation of Warts results in altered F-actin levels \\[\\], suggesting that Warts is required for normal actin dynamics. Not surprisingly, the same study also showed that Trc mutants have altered levels of F-actin \\[\\], because it has already been speculated since the year 2000 that the actin cytoskeleton might be a Trc target \\[\\]. However, it is currently not established whether NDR1/2 kinases can also regulate F-actin remodelling, although a NDR2/actin complex has been reported nearly a decade ago \\[\\]. In summary, actinomyosin dynamics play an important role in the control of the Hippo pathway.\n\n【44】Conclusions\n===========\n\n【45】While the involvement of LATS/NDR in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is yet to be elucidated in more detail, it is undisputed that YAP/TAZ function as sensors and mediators of mechanical inputs coming from the cellular architecture and microenvironment. Besides F-actin remodelling, changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton should also to be considered in future studies, since the Guan laboratory could already show that LATS1/2 activity is modulated by anti-microtubule drugs \\[\\]. It is noteworthy that hMOB1A/B, a key regulator of LATS/NDR kinases \\[\\], has recently been shown to control microtubule dynamics \\[\\], suggesting that LATS/NDR might also function as regulators of the microtubule cytoskeleton. The role of MST1/2 in cytoskeletal signalling is also not fully understood. Importantly, in this context, cell type dependent roles must be considered, since MST1/2 is dispensable for LATS1/2 signalling in MEFs, but not in HeLa cells \\[\\].\n\n【46】Future research is further needed to decipher how LATS1/2 are regulated by hMOB1A/B and MST1/2, since currently the mechanism of NDR1/2 regulation by phosphorylation must serve as the model for LATS1/2 regulation. NDR1/2 are mainly controlled 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> by binding of hMOB1A/B to the NTR of NDR1/2 triggering auto-phosphorylation of NDR1/2 on the AS, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> by phosphorylation of NDR1/2 by MST1/2/3 on the HM. Phosphorylation of LATS1/2 on the conserved AS and HM regulatory sites is also essential for LATS1/2 kinase activity, but the molecular regulatory mechanisms of these phosphorylation events are currently not understood. The regulation of LATS/NDR activities is even more complex in cells, since MST1/2-mediated phosphorylation of hMOB1A/B influences hMOB1/LATS and hMOB1/NDR complex formation. In addition, changes in subcellular localisation, additional phosphorylation events, and competition between activating and inhibitory factors for kinase binding influence LATS/NDR activities. Furthermore, MST1/2 signalling is dispensable for LATS/NDR phosphorylation in selected cell types and biological functions, indicating that additional upstream kinases of LATS/NDR need to be studied in the future. In this context, it is worth mentioning that McCollum and colleagues recently reported that the activities of the yeast LATS/NDR kinases Sid2 and Orb6 are cross-regulated by Sid2 phosphorylating Nak1, the upstream Hippo kinase of Orb6 in yeast \\[\\]. This raises the interesting possibility that human LATS1/2 and/or NDR1/2 might function upstream of each other in specific settings. However, this form of cross-regulation has yet to be reported in mammals.\n\n【47】To date, the best characterised LATS1/2 function is the regulation of YAP/TAZ by phosphorylation, thereby playing a crucial role in mammalian cancer and stem cell biology. In canonical Hippo signalling LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP/TAZ on Ser127/89 and Ser381/311, respectively, thereby controlling YAP/TAZ on two levels, namely Ser127/89-mediated spatial regulation and Ser381/311-mediated temporal regulation. However, LATS1/2 also function in non-canonical Hippo signalling and even in Hippo independent pathways, thereby playing roles in Ras/Raf-1 signalling, the regulation of p53, and cell cycle progression. In contrast to LATS1/2, NDR1/2 functions have only recently been reported, proposing that NDR1/2 function in the regulation of cell cycle progression, centrosome biology, stress/apoptotic signalling, and neuronal dendrite/synapse formation. The recently reported mitochondrial role of Trc \\[\\] will potentially provide a further platform to discover more roles of NDR1/2 in mammals. Taken together, given the recent research progress on LATS/NDR functions, we believe that more key functions of LATS/NDR are yet to be discovered, in particular with respect to NDR1/2. More specifically, the putative roles of LATS/NDR as sensors and mediators of internal and external mechanical forces, upstream of YAP/TAZ, are exciting avenues to be explored in the future.\n\n【48】Abbreviations\n=============\n\n【49】YAP: Yes-associated protein; TAZ: Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; MST: Mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase; MOB: mps one binder; Mats: mob as tumour suppressor; AGC: Protein kinase A (PKA)/PKG/PKC-like; LATS: Large tumour suppressor; NDR: Nuclear dbf2 related; STK38/STK38L: serine/threonine kinase 38/38L; Trc: Tricornered; NTR: N-terminal regulatory domain; AS: Activation segment motif; HM: Hydrophobic motif; MEN: Mitotic exit network; SIN: Septation initiation network; OA: Okadaic acid; PP2A: Protein phosphatase type 2A; KO: Knock-out; DKO: Double knock-out; PPI: Protein-protein interaction; MYPT1: Myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1; Rab8: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rabin 8); AP-2: Associated kinase-1 (AAK1).\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests\n===================</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author declares that he has no competing interests.</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgements\n================</u></u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>通用结尾删除-1:<u>We thank all members of our laboratory for helpful discussions.

The CORE Diabetes Model (a published and validated computer simulation model) was used to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes in DM2. Transition probabilities and risk adjustments were derived from published sources. Treatment effects and baseline cohort characteristics were based on a meta-analysis. Direct costs were retrieved from published sources and projected over patient lifetimes from the perspective of the Spanish National Health Service. Costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% per year. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Acarbose treatment was associated with improved life expectancy (0.23 years) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (0.21 years). Direct costs were on average euro 468 per patient more expensive with acarbose than with placebo. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were euro 2,002 per life year gained and euro 2,199 per QALY gained. An acceptability curve showed that with a willingness to pay euro 20,000, which is generally accepted to represent very good value for money, acarbose treatment was associated with a 93.5% probability of being cost-effective.

Our recent mutagenesis screening of the medaka identified headfish (hdf), a null mutant for fgf receptor 1 (fgfr1), which fails to develop structures in the trunk and tail. Despite its crucial role in early development, the functions of Fgfr1-mediated signaling have not yet been well characterized due to the complexity of the underlying ligand-receptor interactions. In our present study, we further elucidate the roles of this pathway in the medaka using the hdf (fgfr1) mutant. Because Fgfr1 is maternally supplied in fish, we first generated maternal-zygotic (MZ) mutants by transplanting homozygous hdf germ cells into sterile interspecific hybrids. Interestingly, the host hybrid fish recovered their fertility and produced donor-derived mutant progeny. The resulting MZ mutants also exhibited severe defects in their anterior head structures that are never observed in the corresponding zygotic mutants. A series of detailed analyses subsequently revealed that Fgfr1 is required for the anterior migration of the axial mesoderm, particularly the prechordal plate, in a cell-autonomous manner, but is not required for convergence movement of the lateral mesoderm. Furthermore, fgfr1 was found to be dispensable for initial mesoderm induction. The MZ hdf medaka mutant was thus found to be a valuable model system to analyze the precise role of fgfr1-mediated signaling in vertebrate early development.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The ability of HbpR and XylR, which share 35% amino acid sequence identity, to cross-activate the PhbpC and Pu promoters was investigated by determining HbpR- or XylR-mediated luciferase expression and by DNA binding assays. XylR measurably activated the PhbpC promoter in the presence of the effector m-xylene, both in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. HbpR weakly stimulated the Pu promoter in E. coli but not in P. azelaica. Poor HbpR-dependent activation from Pu was caused by a weak binding to the operator region. To create promoters efficiently activated by both regulators, the HbpR binding sites on PhbpC were gradually changed into the XylR binding sites of Pu by site-directed mutagenesis. Inducible luciferase expression from mutated promoters was tested in E. coli on a two plasmid system, and from mono copy gene fusions in P. azelaica and P. putida. Some mutants were efficiently activated by both HbpR and XylR, showing that promoters can be created which are permissive for both regulators.

He was also administered a triple antibiotic regiment of meropemen, gentamycin and teicoplanin. A tracheotomy was performed for a safer weaning and to better control the pharyngeal oedema.\n\n【4】On the 4^th^day the patient presented rhabdomyolysis with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels \\> 7000 iu/lt. He was initially managed with hydration and IV bicarbonate administration. Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) was suspected, although it was first described in children and without the rest signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis and heart failure that accompany it.

It is mainly observed in male patients (98%) that are administered propofol in very high dosages. In the literature is stated that the propofol administration threshold above which the syndrome may appear is 83 mcg/kg/min (4.98 mg/kg/h) for a period of more than 24 hours, or by others 5 mg/kg/h for more than 48 hours \\[\\].\n\n【11】The threshold was exceeded in our patient (5.71 mg/kg/h) but for a period of less than 24 hours (exactly 18 hours) before the symptoms appeared. The syndrome is characterized by lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, liver enlargement, renal failure, heart failure and could lead to death \\[\\].\n\n【12】An odds ratio of 1.93 for every 1 mg/kg/h increase over 5 mg/kg/h has been reported \\[\\].\n\n【13】The underlying mechanism leading to the syndrome is not yet understood but recent studies have focused on injury of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with a subsequent failure of the lipid beta acidosis \\[,\\].\n\n【14】In our case, we only observed rhabdomyolysis and renal failure without any lactic acidosis or circulatory symptoms, probably because of the high rate of suspicion that led to the immediate interruption of the propofol infusion \\[\\].\n\n【15】Another cause for rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure in our patient could be the EBV infection by itself. In the English literature there have been a number of cases reported of renal failure in EBV infection primary or secondary due to rhabdomyolysis and the subsequent acute tubular necrosis because of the released myoglobin \\[\\].\n\n【16】The virus has been implicated in intratubular renal disease since his genome has been detected in kidney biopsies. It has also been documented that after the initial infection of the kidneys by the virus, follows a phase of fibration that could lead to chronic renal failure \\[\\].\n\n【17】A kidney biopsy was not deemed of any therapeutic use under the circumstances and was not performed.\n\n【18】If the patient\\'s renal failure was secondary and a direct result of the rhabdomyolysis in our opinion should have responded in the treatment aiming at preventing the renal failure taking also into account his less than extreme CPK levels.\n\n【19】Patients treated in the ICU with much higher levels of CPK have responded much better to the same preventive treatment in accordance with international literature.\n\n【20】Renal failure due to EBV is extremely rare (less than 1:14,000,000) and usually presents as an IgA renal disease, glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome \\[,\\].\n\n【21】In conclusions, PRIS is a very rare and potentially lethal syndrome that should be dealt with immediately while EBV infection can extremely rarely be the cause of acute renal failure non responsive to corticosteroid therapy.\n\n【22】In our opinion the renal failure was a manifestation of this syndrome and not a direct complication of the underlying infection, although renal biopsy was not performed in our patient.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests\n===================</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors\\' contributions\n=======================</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PS and KO analyzed and interpreted the patient data.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Crystal (Cry) toxins produced during sporulation by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are highly potent against insects and for many years have been successfully used as biopesticides in agriculture. The main advantage of Cry toxins relies on their narrow spectrum compared to more traditional broad-spectrum chemical insecticides such as organochlorines, synthetic pyrethroids, and organophosphates. Indeed, different Cry toxins are highly specific to certain insect orders such as Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera \\[\\]. The exponential increase in planting insect-resistant crop plants transformed to express Bt-derived insecticidal Cry proteins has enabled a substantial reduction in the use of chemical insecticides \\[\\]. However, it has also increased the selection pressure for target insects to develop resistance to these Bt crops. For example, the western corn rootworm has recently developed resistance in the field to several transgenic maize lines expressing different Bt Cry toxins \\[,\\]. Therefore, efforts directed to understand the mode of action of Bt Cry toxins in insects and the associated resistance mechanisms are crucial to develop efficient crop pest management strategies.\n\n【2】The leaf beetle, Chrysomela tremula Fabricius (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is an important model for understanding the mode of action of Bt toxins and Bt resistance in Coleoptera because a Cry3Aa-resistant C. tremula strain was selected on Bt-transformed poplar trees expressing the Cry3Aa toxin \\[\\]. This strain was derived from an isofemale line established from field-caught insects that generated F2 offspring that survived on this Bt poplar clone \\[\\]. This was unexpected because the original field-caught insects used to generate the Cry3Aa-resistant strain did not experience any human-induced selection pressure; indeed, these Bt poplars have not been disseminated in France and the Cry3Aa toxin has never been used in French pest management \\[\\]. The resistance ratio of this isofemale line was estimated to be more than 6400 compared to a susceptible C. tremula strain (LC~50~ = 31.1 ng purified Cry3Aa/cm^2^ leaf surface), allowing Cry3Aa-resistant insects to complete their life cycle on Bt poplars \\[\\]. Resistance to Cry3Aa in C. tremula is under control of a single, almost completely recessive, autosomal trait \\[\\], suggesting that changes in a single receptor, or other gene product, may be involved in resistance.\n\n【3】Here we report on the identification of the gene responsible for Cry3Aa resistance in C. tremula combining a candidate gene approach, genetic linkage analyses and heterologous protein expression in insect cells. This gene encodes an ABC transporter in the B subfamily, homologous to P-glycoprotein, which we named CtABCB1. We demonstrate that the resistance to Cry3Aa in C. tremula is linked to the occurrence of a four-base-pair deletion in the open reading frame of CtABCB1 in resistant insects, and that insects homozygous for the presence of this deletion are resistant to Cry3Aa. We also provide evidence that CtABCB1 may act as a receptor to Cry3Aa in C. tremula. This work represents a crucial step in understanding the detailed mode of action of the Cry3Aa toxin in Coleoptera and is of considerable significance for the management of Bt resistance globally.\n\n【4】2.

A Four-Base-Pair Deletion in CtABCB1 Is Genetically Linked to Cry3Aa Resistance 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot1-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】We used a larval midgut transcriptome for C. tremula \\[\\] to identify candidate genes for resistance to Cry3Aa. Based on the mode of action of Bt Cry toxins in Lepidoptera, we examined gene families encoding ABC proteins, cadherin-like proteins, aminopeptidases N (APNs) and alkaline phosphatases as potential candidates \\[,\\]. A previous report indicated that, in C. tremula, there was no difference in sequence and in expression of three APNs between insects of the susceptible and the resistant strains \\[\\]. We turned to ABC proteins because of their association with resistance to Cry1A and Cry2A toxins in Lepidoptera \\[,\\]. We used a recent analysis of the tissue-specific expression of genes encoding ABC proteins in C. populi, a sister species of C. tremula, to identify ABC proteins expressed in the larval midgut. The CpABC12 gene of C. populi had the highest expression and encoded a full transporter of the B subfamily \\[\\]. We obtained the full-length cDNA sequence of the C. tremula homolog which we named CtABCB1 (GenBank Accession GU462154), which shared more than 90% amino acid identity with CpABC12.\n\n【7】The open reading frame (ORF) of CtABCB1 is 3780 bp long (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>) and encodes a protein of 1259 amino acids possessing all general features of full-transporter ABC proteins (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>), such as two transmembrane domains each composed of six transmembrane helices, and two nucleotide binding folds (NBF1 and 2) each composed of an ATP binding domain (ATP) and a transporter motif (TpM1 and 2). We then PCR-amplified the ORF of CtABCB1 from larval midgut cDNAs prepared from Cry3Aa-resistant insects. These showed a four-base-pair deletion at position 1561 (GenBank Accession KX686490, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>), introducing a frame shift with a premature stop codon leading to loss of the TpM1 transporter motif as well as the complete second transmembrane domain (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). A homolog of CtABCB1 in the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, was shown to be genetically linked to resistance to the Bt Cry3Bb1 toxin; however, the resistance-conferring mutation was not reported \\[\\] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>). The existence of cross-resistance between Cry3Bb1 and mCry3A 通用删除1(英):<u>(a modified version of Cry3Aa)</u> in the western corn rootworm \\[\\] suggested that CtABCB1 could be involved in resistance to Cry3Aa in C. tremula, and we investigated it further.\n\n【8】We set up two sets of single-pair crosses between the susceptible and resistant strains, the first in Orléans in early 2011 and the second in Jena in late 2015. The F1 progeny were backcrossed to the resistant strain in single-pair crosses. Backcross progeny were selected for four days on leaves of Bt poplar. Individuals found dead were considered susceptible to Cry3Aa (phenotype S) and the ones that survived and actively fed were considered resistant to Cry3Aa (phenotype R). DNA was isolated from all R as well as S progeny, and examined for segregation of the four-base-pair deletion in CtABCB1. Progeny were either rr (with two copies of the four-base-pair deletion) or rs (heterozygous, with one copy of the four-base-pair deletion and one copy of the wild-type allele). Overall, 44% of the progeny were rr and 56% were rs (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, [Dataset S1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>), and this ratio was not significantly different from the 50:50 ratio expected according to Mendelian inheritance (G = 2.78, df = 1, p \\> 0.1) and not significantly different across the three families (G~H~ = 0.45, df = 2, p \\> 0.7).

Altogether, these results provide strong evidence that the four-base-pair deletion in CtABCB1 is genetically linked to Cry3Aa resistance in C. tremula, although minor genetic or environmental factors may also affect survivorship on Bt poplar.\n\n【9】2.2. Lepidopteran Insect Cells Expressing CtABCB1 Are Susceptible to Cry3Aa 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Sf9 cells derived from Spodoptera frugiperda have previously been used to study the role of the ABCC2 proteins from Bombyx mori and Heliothis virescens as receptors for Cry1A toxins \\[,\\]. Sf9 cells do not express ABCC2 itself, the cadherin-like protein, aminopeptidases N or alkaline phosphatases \\[\\]; moreover, expressing a coleopteran-derived protein in this lepidopteran cell system should reduce the risk of interference from other putative Cry toxin receptors even more.\n\n【11】We succeeded in isolating and expanding a clonal Sf9 cell line expressing CtABCB1 which originated from a single transformed cell. To confirm that CtABCB1 was properly expressed and translocated to the plasma membrane, we isolated both a crude membrane extract and a cytosolic fraction from these cells, and checked the expression of CtABCB1 by Western blot using an antibody directed against a V5 epitope cloned in frame at the carboxyl terminus of CtABCB1 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A). A signal corresponding to CtABCB1 of approx. 130 kDa was only detected in the crude membrane fraction of the transformed clonal cell line and not untransfected Sf9 cells, close to the estimated size of this ABC protein (138.9 kDa).\n\n【12】Treatment with trypsin-activated Cry3Aa revealed a concentration-dependent decrease of viability of cells expressing CtABCB1 after 24 h of incubation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B). In contrast, no decrease of viability could be detected for untransfected Sf9 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B). However, Cry3Aa did not kill 100% of the CtABCB1-expressing cells, as viability could only be reduced to approximately 30%. A similar effect was obtained on Sf9 cells co-expressing the H. virescens cadherin-like protein and ABCC2 after treatment with either Cry1Aa or Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac, whereby the viability could only be reduced to 20% to 30% according to the toxin used \\[\\].\n\n【13】Microscopic observation of CtABCB1-expressing cells treated with 30 nM of trypsin-activated Cry3Aa toxin showed dramatic morphological changes such as swelling, granule formation and lysis, but not for untransfected Sf9 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C). These changes occurred relatively slowly, only after several hours. This is in contrast to previous studies on ABCC2 in Lepidoptera \\[,\\], with morphological changes evident after less than an hour of toxin treatment on ABCC2-expressing cells. We see three possible explanations to these observations. First, the expression of CtABCB1 that was achieved in our stable clonal cell line may be lower than the expression of lepidopteran ABCC2 in Sf9 cells. Second, other proteins in C. tremula besides ABCB1 may enhance the toxicity of Cry3Aa, but these were not expressed in the Sf9 cells. For example, cadherin-like proteins have been reported as potential functional receptors of Cry3Aa and Cry3Bb toxins in the beetles Tenebrio molitor and Alphitobius diaperinus \\[,\\]. Third, the activation of proCry3Aa to Cry3Aa using trypsin may not be optimal compared to the use of other proteases, beetle gut juice or beetle brush border membrane vesicle preparations, possibly reducing its toxicity \\[,\\]. Nonetheless, our results indicate that CtABCB1 is capable of mediating pore formation and cell swelling caused by Cry3Aa, major features of the mode of action of Bt toxins.\n\n【14】3. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec3-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n=============\n\n【15】We have described a major mechanism of resistance to Bt toxins in Coleoptera. In contrast to Lepidoptera, reports on Bt resistance in Coleoptera are relatively rare. A strain of the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata was selected with Cry3A, attaining 59-fold resistance \\[\\], and higher survivorship of second instar larvae and adults on transgenic Cry3A-expressing potato plants \\[\\]. A Cry3Aa-selected strain of the cottonwood leaf beetle Chrysomela scripta was \\>9000-fold resistant to Cry3Aa, 400-fold cross-resistant to Cry1Ba, but susceptible to Cyt1Aa \\[\\]. As previously mentioned, an F2 screen of C. tremula from Vatan, France produced three resistant lines and an estimate of 0.0036 for the frequency of the resistant allele \\[\\]. A later study using one of these resistant lines  in an F1 screen of samples from Bar-de-Luc, 400 km away, yielded an even higher estimate of 0.011 \\[\\]. Although these studies illustrated the potential for resistance to Bt poplar, there had not been any prior selection pressure in the field by these transgenic plants, although the amount of selection by Bt in the natural environment is unknown. The first report of field-evolved resistance in a coleopteran pest was in the western corn rootworm. D. virgifera virgifera, which caused feeding damage on Cry3Bb1-expressing maize fields in Iowa in 2009 \\[\\]. Some of these fields had been planted with Cry3Bb1 or Cry34/35Ab1-expressing maize since 2004. The latest reports indicate extensive resistance and cross-resistance patterns among Cry3Bb1, mCry3A and eCry3.1Ab, but not to Cry34/35Ab1-expressing maize so far \\[,\\]. Although developing later than in Lepidoptera, Bt resistance in Coleoptera threatens to be just as significant a problem for agriculture \\[\\].\n\n【16】The few studies on the mode of action of pore-forming Bt toxins and resistance mechanisms in Coleoptera are in general agreement with the more extensive studies in Lepidoptera. Pore formation by the toxin is enhanced upon activation by native brush border membrane vesicles of Leptinotarsa \\[\\], likely due to a membrane-associated ADAM metalloprotease \\[\\]. Other changes in protease composition are correlated with Cry3Aa resistance in the same species \\[\\]. A cadherin protein similar to the Cry1A-binding cadherin of Lepidoptera has been identified in Diabrotica \\[\\]. Similar to previous results with Lepidoptera \\[\\], fragments of this cadherin synergize Cry3Aa and Cry3Bb activity against Diabrotica and Leptinotarsa \\[\\] and the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus \\[\\], and a similar result was found for the cadherin from the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor \\[\\]. The demonstration of genetic linkage between an ABC protein and Cry3Bb1 resistance in D. virgifera \\[\\] was the first confirmation from Coleoptera of similar results in Lepidoptera \\[,\\]. In addition to a linkage analysis, our results add the molecular identity of the mutation in C. tremula, and a demonstration of the role of the CtABCB1 protein in cell killing by the Cry3Aa toxin. These studies suggest important similarities in the mode of action of Bt toxin among different species of Coleoptera.\n\n【17】The ABC proteins identified in Diabrotica and C. tremula are homologs of mammalian P-glycoprotein (MDR1 or ABCB1) \\[\\], which has been intensively studied in toxicology and cancer biology because of its ability to confer resistance to chemotherapy by exporting a huge variety of compounds out of the cell \\[\\]. These are full-transporters belonging to the B subfamily of ABC proteins and are expressed in the plasma membrane at the cell surface. Other members of the B subfamily are half-transporters internally localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria or lysosome. The model coleopteran, Tribolium castaneum, has only two of these full-length B subfamily transporters in its genome, named TcABCB-3A and TcABCB-3B \\[\\]. These occur on different chromosomes, and ABC-B proteins from other Coleoptera are similar to one or the other (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figures S4 and S5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>). The ABC-B protein linked to Cry3Bb1 resistance in Diabrotica as well as CtABCB1 is more similar to TcABCB-3B (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>). The function of these ABC transporters in beetles is unknown, although by analogy to P-glycoprotein function in mammals, they are likely to export xenobiotics as well as endogenous compounds from cells. Interest in the role of P-glycoproteins in protecting organisms against chemical pesticides is increasing \\[\\]. In a comprehensive RNA inhibition screen of all of the ABC proteins in Tribolium, no obvious phenotypic effects were seen by RNAi of TcABCB-3A or TcABCB-3B, in contrast to severe developmental defects and lethality seen by RNAi of the half-transporter TcABCB-5A \\[\\]. Therefore, similar to the situation in Lepidoptera, certain full-length ABC proteins may be useful but not essential for survival of coleopteran pests in the field.\n\n【18】Results on fitness costs of Bt resistance in Coleoptera are mixed. Studies with Cry3Bb1-resistant laboratory strains of D. virgifera feeding on non-transgenic maize showed either a fitness benefit \\[\\] or costs and benefits in different fitness components \\[\\]. In experiments with the Bar-le-Duc-resistant strain of C. tremula studied by Wenes et al. \\[\\], the frequency of the recessive resistant allele declined from 0.5 to 0.179 over five generations of rearing on non-Bt poplar, indicating a fitness cost of resistance. This strain must also have been carrying mutations in the same CtABCB1 gene that we studied, because it was isolated using the F1 screen with the same resistant isofemale line  from Vatan. Thus, incapacitating mutations in coleopteran ABCB genes may have a fitness cost that could be exploited to combat Bt resistance.\n\n【19】In Lepidoptera, an ABC protein facilitates the entry of the pore into the plasma membrane \\[,\\], after binding to a cadherin which promotes pre-pore formation \\[\\]. When the ABCC2 protein is heterologously expressed in otherwise toxin-insensitive cell lines, toxin-mediated pore formation, swelling and lysis occurs \\[,\\]. Expression of other Bt-toxin binding proteins such as aminopeptidase \\[,\\] or cadherin \\[,\\] has a much weaker effect. Recently, several mutations in ABCA2, a member of the A subfamily of ABC proteins, were found to confer high resistance against Cry2Ab1 in two Lepidoptera, Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera \\[\\]. Our study adds a third subfamily of ABC proteins and a different toxin, active against Coleoptera but not Lepidoptera, to this interaction. These similarities suggest a common mechanism of pore insertion in lepidopteran and coleopteran-active toxins, involving ABC proteins.\n\n【20】We propose that this common mechanism could support the rational design of alternatives to combat the growing problem of Bt resistance by coleopteran pests. Maize expressing beetle-active Cry toxins is widely planted in the USA, and the inadequacy of current preventive resistance management strategies has been pointed out \\[,\\]. Bt-expressing poplars have been commercialized in China, and are expected to be widely adopted there \\[\\]. In both systems, an unexpectedly high frequency of pre-existing resistance alleles would make resistance prevention very difficult. Proactive strategies that target the common resistance mechanism by increasing its fitness cost would become more attractive. One such strategy has been suggested by Xiao et al. \\[\\], who found that Bt-resistance-causing mutations in the ABCC2 protein of H. armigera made the insects more susceptible to certain chemical insecticides. If mutations in ABC proteins are a common Bt-resistance mechanism in Coleoptera, a similar strategy may be useful in prolonging the utility of beetle-active toxins for control of this important group of pests.\n\n【21】4. Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec4-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n========================\n\n【22】4.1. Insect Rearing and Genetic Crosses 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot1-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n---------------------------------------\n\n【23】Cry3Aa-susceptible and Cry3Aa-resistant Chrysomela tremula larvae and beetles were obtained from field collections from Vatan, France \\[\\]. (Earlier publications on these strains used tremulae as the species name instead of tremula). The susceptible strain originated from the offspring of an isofemale line that lacked alleles conferring resistance to the Cry3Aa toxin \\[\\]. The resistant strain was established from an isofemale line  selected on the foliage of hybrid poplars (Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides) and then genetically engineered to express a synthetic Cry3Aa gene derived from the native Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis \\[\\]. This strain was fixed for an autosomal recessive allele conferring resistance to the Cry3Aa toxin \\[\\]. Beetles were maintained in standard rearing conditions, in a growth chamber at 20 °C with a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D). Larvae and adults were reared on fresh leaves detached from greenhouse-grown poplar hybrid clones that did not express Cry3Aa. Three-day-old third-instar larvae were used for dissection and further RNA isolation.\n\n【24】Grandparents---for example, a male from the susceptible strain and a female from the resistant strain---were mated, and their offspring (F1) reared to adulthood on detached leaves from control poplar hybrid clones. An F1 female was mated to a second male from the resistant strain (parents) and the resulting backcross offspring were reared for seven days on foliage from control poplar hybrid clones. Early third-instar larvae from the backcross offspring were then put individually on leaf discs from Cry3Aa-expressing hybrid poplars in 12-well plates for four consecutive days. Survival on Cry3Aa-expressing poplar was recorded every day. As soon as a larva was found dead, it was immediately collected and frozen at −80 °C. At the end of the four-day period, surviving larvae were also collected and frozen at −80 °C and considered as being resistant to Cry3Aa. Grandparents and parents of these crosses were also collected and frozen at −80 °C for further analyses. Note that these crosses were performed in both directions for grandparents and parents.\n\n【25】4.2. Genotyping of the Crosses 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot2-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n------------------------------\n\n【26】PCR primers were designed to flank the region of CtABCB1 where the four-base-pair deletion found in resistant individuals was located (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>). These primers were designed to possess either a M13_F or M13_R \"tail\" at their 5′-end for further Sanger sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from each individual from the backcross offspring as well as from the grandparents and parents using a \"salting out\" method as described by Martinez-Torres et al. \\[\\]. Standard PCR reactions were performed in a thermocycler Mastercycler ep gradient S (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) using the following parameters: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s; final extension step was at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were inspected on 1.5% agarose gels before being cleaned up using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research Europe, Freiburg, Germany). Sanger sequencing was carried out on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting sequencing chromatographs were inspected individually and genotypes were assessed as described in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>. Results of the phenotyping and genotyping of the backcrosses as well as data analysis are summarized in [Dataset S1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>.

Expression of CtABCB1 in Sf9 Cells 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot3-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Spodoptera frugiperda-derived Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900II serum-free medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 50 µg/mL Gentamicin (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 27 °C.\n\n【29】Total RNA extraction from larval midgut of C. tremula was performed using the innuPrep RNA Mini kit (Analytik, Jena, Germany). RNA was treated with Turbo DNAse (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cleaned up with the RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). For first-strand cDNA synthesis 900 ng RNA were used and processed using the Verso cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher). The full-length CtABCB1 (NCBI: GU462154) cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR (primers: see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"app\"}</u>) before being ligated in pIB/V5-His TOPO TA and used for stable transfection of Sf9 cells.\n\n【30】Sf9 cells were plated in 60 mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Corning, NY, USA) at approx. 70% confluency and transfected using FUGENE (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Selection of cells was started 48 h post-transfection. Cloning cylinders (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) as well as limiting dilution series were applied to obtain cell clones expressing CtABCB1. Conditioned medium (the supernatant of exponentially growing three- to four-day-old Sf9 cells) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) was used to support cell colony growth. For selection of clonal cell lines, culture medium was supplemented with 50 µg/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen).\n\n【31】4.4. Western Blotting 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot4-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【32】Cells were plated in T75 flasks. At 100% confluency, cells were washed and harvested in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The total cellular membrane proteins were extracted (Plasma Membrane Protein Extraction Kit, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and the concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Three micrograms of each sample were used. Samples were heated at 55 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE (Criterion Precast gels, BioRad, Munich, Germany) and transferred to Immuno-Blot PVDF membrane (BioRad). Membranes were blocked in 1× Tris buffered saline (TBS, BioRad) supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich) and 5% w/v milk powder (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated with an anti-V5-HRP antibody overnight at 4 °C (Invitrogen). Bound antibodies were detected using an in-house detection solution (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 90 mM coumaric acid, 250 mM luminol, 0.04% H~2~O~2~).\n\n【33】4.5. Toxin Preparation, Viability Assays and Morphological Changes 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot5-toxins-08-00362}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis carrying the gene-encoding Cry3Aa was obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (Ohio State University). Cry3Aa protoxin was prepared according to Carroll et al. \\[\\], and was activated with trypsin at a trypsin/protoxin ratio of 1/100 (w/w) at 37 °C for 2 h before further purification by anion exchange chromatography using a 1 mL RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany).\n\n【35】Sf9 cells were plated in 96-well cell culture plates (flat bottom, Greiner bio-one cellstar) at approx. 60% confluency. Cry3Aa (10^−12^ M--3.10^−7^ M) solubilized in 50 mM Na~2~CO~3~ pH 9.5 was added directly to the culture medium and cells were incubated for 24 h at 27 °C. The reaction volume was 100 µL. As control (0 nM Cry3Aa), we added a maximum of 3% of the buffer in the culture medium corresponding to the highest amount of buffer used for the dilution series of the toxin. The culture medium was removed and replaced with culture medium containing 0.5 mg/mL thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue bromide (Sigma Aldrich) to perform an MTT assay. After 2 h of incubation at 27 °C, the medium was removed and replaced by 50 µL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma Aldrich). Subsequently, the 96-well plates were briefly vortexed to dissolve the formazan crystals, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm (Infinite m200, Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland). All values were calculated in relation to untreated cells (defined as 100%). Six replicates were performed per treatment on each cell line (Sf9 untransfected and CtABCB1-expressing Sf9 cells). For the observation of morphological changes, cells were plated in 60 mm petri dishes. Cells were incubated with 30 nM of Cry3Aa and were observed for 8 h on a Zeiss Axiovert200 microscope.

The survey was posted on the NASPGHAN website, and the NASPGHAN membership was notified of the survey by electronic mail via its electronic mail distribution list. This was followed by a three-part postal mail survey to all non-respondents. After the Internet and postal mail requests, all non-respondent physicians were telephoned a minimum of three times. If unsuccessful in contacting the physicians directly, office personnel were queried to facilitate survey completion regarding the provision of pediatric gastroenterology, nutrition or hepatology services in either clinical care or research. The response rate based on the potential contact list for Part I of the survey was 69%. The final phone call or electronic mail contact of an office staff member with questions regarding gender and delivery of pediatric gastroenterology services yielded a total contact rate of 88%.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (v1-v4) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Lab investigations revealed a rising trend of initial troponin-T level (first sample:148, after 8 h: 23821, 16 h:19209 - normal range 3−15 ng/L). A repeated chest x-ray did not show any new changes. An echocardiogram revealed low ejection fraction (EF) (28 %) with the dilated left ventricle and regional wall motion abnormalities. The basal anterior segment of the left ventricle was hypokinetic. The mid anterior, mid anteroseptal, mid-infero-septal, apical anterior, apical septal, apical inferior, apical lateral, and apex wall segments were akinetic.Fig. 1ECG ST elevation in the anterior leads (v1-v4.).Fig. 1\n\n【4】With a diagnosis of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the patient was shifted to the nearest PPCI capable hospital within an hour. PPCI was performed as per the latest ACC guidelines for the management of STEMI in COVID-19 \\[\\]. PPCI showed a thrombus in ostial-proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery causing a 100 % stenosis and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 0 flow (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Thrombus aspiration was performed, using a 6 F Export AP aspiration catheter. Pre-dilation was performed, using a Trek 2.5 × 15 mm compliant balloon. The inflation pressure was 8 ATM for 11.0 s. Drug-eluting stenting (DES) was performed, using a DES Xience Sierra 4.0 × 23 mm. The inflation pressure was 12 ATM for 15.0 s. Following the intervention, there was a 0 % residual stenosis, and TIMI 3 flow was achieved. Other coronary arteries were healthy.Fig. 2Coronary angiogram (2a. patent Right coronary artery (RCA), 2b. red arrow: thrombosed LAD, 2c. blue arrow: LAD post stenting).Fig. 2\n\n【5】Post-procedure, the patient received eptifibatide infusion for 18 h and heparin infusion for twenty-four hours. The patient received aspirin, clopidogrel, high-intensity atorvastatin, and metoprolol tartrate as per ACC guidelines. Cardiovascular risk factor screening for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and prothrombotic state (protein C, protein S, anticardiolipin antibody, and Factor V Leiden) were negative. The patient was started on beta-blockers and was planned to start angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) later due to blood pressure on the lower side during hospitalization. Follow up in the cardiology clinic was arranged.\n\n【6】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec0010}</u>\n==========\n\n【7】COVID-19 predominantly presents with respiratory symptoms such as fever, dry cough, myalgia, anorexia, and dyspnea. Gastrointestinal, neurological, and other atypical manifestations are also reported \\[,\\]. Cardiovascular manifestations are relatively rare; however, the acute coronary syndrome is reported \\[, \\]. Our patient had no risk factors for coronary artery disease but developed an acute STEMI, and PPCI revealed complete thrombosis of LAD. An extensive workup for thromboembolism was negative. We believe that COVID-19 associated increased risk of thromboembolism was the most likely cause of LAD thrombus in this patient. The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (ACE) with high affinity. ACE receptors are present on several tissues in the body, including the endothelium.\n\n【8】The exact mechanism of coronary thrombus formation in COVID-19 is not known. Elevated inflammatory cytokines are present in patients with COVID-19 \\[\\]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the coagulation cascade and inhibit fibrinolysis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) predominantly cause a procoagulant state in COVID-19. This procoagulant state can lead to leukocyte migration and adhesion, platelet activation and adhesion, and endothelial dysfunction resulting in thrombus formation. A proposed cascade of events leading to thrombosis in COVID-19 is shown in the flowchart (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) \\[\\].Fig. 3Proposed cytokine cascade in SARS-CoV-2 leading to thrombus formation.Fig. 3\n\n【9】In general, the management of STEMI in patients with COVID-19 is the same as in the pre-COVID era. It includes prompt recognition of symptoms, rapid laboratory analysis, including ECG, cardiac troponins, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention \\[\\]. The main difference is related to a possible transfer delay secondary to COVID-19 for patients presenting to a non-PCI capable hospital. Patients presenting with STEMI and suspected COVID-19 in a PCI capable hospital should undergo PPCI. However, fibrinolysis is an alternative option for STEMI patients with suspected COVID presenting to non-PCI capable hospitals. In our case, prompt diagnosis and swift transfer to PPCI capable facility were made, and the patient had PPCI performed within 90 min of the onset of symptoms.\n\n【10】COVID-19 patients can present with acute coronary syndrome in patients with well-established risk factors \\[\\].\n\n【11】There are reports of coronary thrombus in a young patient with risk factors for CAD and stent thrombosis in established CAD \\[,\\]. However, our patient was different as he was young with no conventional cardiovascular risk factors other than being a male. We believe this completes the clinical spectrum of several acute coronary syndrome presentations in patients with COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

We performed, from 2002 to 2008, seven termino-lateral sutures with epineural window opening for digital nerve lesions. Functional outcome was analysed using the two-point discrimination test and the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. The results showed a sensory recovery of S3+ in six cases and S3 in one case. The mean distance found in the two-point discrimination test was 12.7 mm (range 8-18 mm). After a review of the literature, we were able to obtain homogeneous data from 17 additional patients operated by termino-lateral coaptation. The overall number of cases included in our review was 24. A sensory recovery was observed in 23 out of 24 patients. The functional results were S0 in one case, S3 in one case, S3+ in twenty cases and S4 in two cases. Excluding the one unfavourable case, the mean distance in the two-point discrimination test was 9.7 mm (range 3-18 mm). It can thus be concluded that the treatment of digital nerve lesions with termino-lateral suture showed encouraging results.

Though natural transmission by insect vectors has been controlled, there is significant risk of T. cruzi transmission by blood transfusion in non-endemic regions, generally due to immigration processes from endemic areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-T. cruzi seroprevalence in blood donors from the western part of São Paulo State, Brazil, by serologic and immunofluorescence confirmation tests for the period between 2012 and 2014. Currently, this region is regarded as a non-endemic area for Chagas disease. The confirmed overall T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors was 0.10%, which can be considered low compared to other Brazilian regions. Nevertheless, the distribution of the anti-T. cruzi antibodies within the examined region was uneven, and some areas of significantly higher prevalence were observed. We could consider two tendencies in the prevalence of T. cruzi: (i) residual older undiagnosed cases from São Paulo State, and (ii) immigration from endemic Brazilian or South American regions.

Information about first admission and/or previous psychiatric history (PPH) is usually only mentioned briefly. The only prior study conducting subgroup analyses based on psychiatric history reported that patients with no previous psychiatric history (NPH) were more likely than elderly patients with PPH to have concurrent medical and cognitive problems and less likely to have bipolar or psychotic disorders.^^ However, this study was set in a general hospital emergency room, employed an age cut-off of 60 and the sample size was small.\n\n【4】Study objectives 删除19:<u>{#sec1-2}</u>\n================\n\n【5】In Norway, despite national guidelines recommending psychogeriatric treatment for patients with mental illness presenting at ≥65 years,^^ older adults in need of acute hospital admission are initially admitted to general adult psychiatric acute units (PAUs) -- however, knowledge about these patients is scarce. As research suggests that psychogeriatric units are superior to general adult psychiatric units at providing a comprehensive assessment and treatment to complex geriatric patients^,^ it may be assumed that central guideline criteria would allocate the patients most in need to this service. Thus, patients with NPH should be more likely than elderly patients with PPH to present with more physical frailty, somatic comorbidity and impaired everyday functioning, also in the general adult acute psychiatric setting. However, evidence to support this hypothesis is scarce. In order to provide a stronger empirical basis for how to organise mental health services for elderly people, further investigation of psychiatric admissions of older adults, especially those with mental illness presenting at ≥65 years, is needed. The main objective of our study was, in a cohort of older adults admitted to a PAU, to examine differences between patients with NPH and patients with PPH.\n\n【6】Method 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n======\n\n【7】Setting and study population 删除19:<u>{#sec2-1}</u>\n----------------------------\n\n【8】All data was retrieved from the cohort study Suicidality in Psychiatric Emergency Admissions (SIPEA), which includes all admissions to the PAU at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, from May 2005 to July 2014.^,^ The Norwegian state provides free universal healthcare with virtually no competition from the private sector, and the PAU received 95% of all acute psychiatric admissions from a catchment area of approximately 350 000 people aged ≥18 years. A total of 7000 patients were admitted to the PAU during the study period. The present study included a subsample consisting of all patients aged ≥65 years at the time of admission (n = 918; 13.1% of the total patient population) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Based on the patient records, we separated patients into two groups: patients with either psychiatric admissions or follow-up from a psychiatrist, psychologist or a psychiatric out-patient clinic before the age of 65 were defined as having PPH (the PPH group, n = 391), whereas those whose psychiatric specialist follow-up started after the age of 65 or who had no known psychiatric history before their admission(s) at the PAU were defined as having NPH (the NPH group, n = 526). One patient was excluded from the analyses as information regarding previous psychiatric follow-up was unavailable.

Length of stay at the PAU and total psychiatric hospital stay was calculated as well as information about discharge/transfer to other units (general adult psychiatry, psychogeriatric or somatic) and to nursing homes.\n\n【11】Information on the legal formality of the admission included: (a) involuntary referral/admission to psychiatric assessment at the PAU under the Norwegian Mental Health Act and (b) the decision about involuntary commitment (or not) by a specialist in psychiatry or clinical psychology within 24 h of admission to the PAU.\n\n【12】Patients were assessed at the time of admission by the psychiatric resident on-call as to whether suicidality was the reason for admission or not (yes/no). Details on suicidality were coded as (a) no known suicide ideation, (b) suicide ideation, (c) non-suicidal self-harm, (d) suicide attempt, and (e) unknown.\n\n【13】Alcohol and drug use was recorded using the Clinician\\'s Alcohol/Drug Use Scales^^ and results dichotomised to 'no abuse' (scores 1--2) and 'abuse' (scores 3--5). Data regarding aggressive behaviour, symptoms and functioning in the 2 weeks preceding admission was collected using the data from Health of the Nation Outcome scales (HoNOS),^^ which was scored at admission. HoNOS is a rating tool developed to measure the health and social functioning of people with severe mental illness and comprises 12 items (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) that are all scored from zero (no problem) to four (severe to very severe problem).\n\n【14】At admission, functioning in daily life was assessed by the General Assessment of Functioning (GAF) -- split version: GAF is a numeric scale ranging from zero through 100 that is used to subjectively rate the social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults.^,^ The split version assesses the patient\\'s level of symptoms (GAF-S) and functioning (GAF-F), respectively.\n\n【15】Clinical diagnoses assigned by clinicians in the PAU according to the ICD-10^^ were grouped into categories based on ICD-10 subchapters: organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (F00--F09), schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20--F29), affective disorders (F30--F39) and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40--F49). The remaining diagnostic categories from the F-chapter were subgrouped as 'other psychiatric diagnoses', and diagnoses from the somatic chapters of ICD-10 were clustered into 'somatic diagnoses'. Up to three diagnoses were registered at discharge. The diagnoses were scored as 1 (present) when given as the main diagnosis or one of the secondary diagnoses, otherwise as 0 (not present).\n\n【16】Drugs acting on the nervous system, i.e. drugs from the N-chapter of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system were registered at admission for each patient.\n\n【17】Statistical analyses 删除19:<u>{#sec2-3}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【18】IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 24 was used for the statistical analyses.

Statistical significance level was set at P = 0.05. In order to adjust for the age difference between the groups, sensitivity analyses were conducted analysing statistically significant results sequentially using logistic regression for dichotomous variables and linear regression for continuous variables. These analyses were then repeated after patients with organic mental disorders were excluded, since organic disorders were disproportionately frequent in the NPH group. For patients with multiple admissions, data from the first admission after turning 65 years was used. Multiple imputation was used to impute values when information for HoNOS variables were missing.^^ This method draws plausible values from a conditional distribution based on the mean and covariance structure between all variables.

Not least, the NPH group were more likely to have made a suicide attempt before admission.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Despite most guidelines recommending that older adults with recent presentation of mental illness should receive specialised psychogeriatric treatment,^--^ there are few studies that specifically investigate the characteristics of older adults with no previous psychiatric treatment history of any kind before their first psychiatric admission. In line with our aim to strengthen the empirical basis for how to organise old-age mental health services, our findings add important information about this severely ill group and highlight the multifactorial nature of the problems with which they present in a clinical setting.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Suicidality 删除19:<u>{#sec4-2}</u>\n-----------</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no statistically significant differences between the NPH and PPH groups with regard to admission because of suicide risk. However, in the NPH and PPH groups combined, the proportion of patients with suicide-risk-related admissions (31.6%) was much lower than that of the total patient cohort regardless of age from the same study (55%).^^ This might seem like a paradox considering the high suicide rates found in older age groups^^ and might indicate that psychiatric services are currently not sufficiently reaching these patients. This hypothesis is further supported by the studies showing that although older adults who end their life have often been in contact with a primary physician shortly before death, somatic problems are usually the topic of the consultation and mental issues such as depression remain undetected.^^ Moreover, relatively few have had recent contact with specialised psychiatric services.^^ In other studies reporting on admissions of older adults because of suicide risk, the rates vary from 13.3%^^ to 48.1%.^^ However, these studies were set in specialised psychogeriatric units with differing intake criteria, making comparison with our findings difficult. Further, we found that although the patients in the PPH group were more likely to report suicidal ideation at the time of admission, the patients in the NPH group were more likely to have made a suicide attempt, the latter finding being robust for sensitivity analyses controlling for differences in age and organic disorders. This finding might indicate a difference in the expression of suicidality between these two groups, with the PPH group possibly being more likely to verbalise their suicidal ideation and the NPH group being more likely to act on it, which may be important for clinical practice. Cognitive impairment, significantly more common in the NPH group, may complicate suicide risk assessment further.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Diagnostic and pharmacological differences 删除19:<u>{#sec4-3}</u>\n------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Organic disorders were diagnosed almost six times more often in the NPH group than in the PPH group. Two previous studies found an association between first admissions in psychiatry and organic psychiatric disorders (ICD-10)^^ or organic brain syndrome (DSM-III-R).^^ The latter also found that patients admitted to hospital with NPH were more likely to have a concurrent medical problem, corresponding with the HoNOS scores and diagnostic findings in the present study. While affective disorders was the most frequently diagnosed category in the PPH group, nearly a third of the NPH group were diagnosed with an affective episode, corresponding with previous studies showing that late-life depression is commonly encountered in first admissions of older adults in psychiatry.^,^ Depression is strongly associated with increased suicide risk in elders,^^ further underlining the importance of detecting and treating the disorder in this age group. Focusing on the important subject of addiction, one tenth of the patients in the study had issues with substance misuse (mainly alcohol), highlighting the clinical importance of these issues in the elderly population, which has been emphasised by previous studies.^,^</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The PPH group were prescribed a higher number of psychotropic drugs than the NPH group. However, the numbers in both groups point to a tendency to polypharmacy that is unfortunate given the high risk of adverse effects and interactions from these drugs especially in this age group.^^ Of the NPH group, a substantially higher proportion were given antipsychotic drugs than were diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. This may illustrate some of the challenges when treating older adults with cognitive impairment experiencing psychotic symptoms and behavioural difficulties in whom non-pharmacological interventions have failed. While antipsychotics such as risperidone can have an alleviating effect on aggression and agitation in dementia,^^ caution should be taken in this patient group because of the potentially life-threatening adverse effects^^ and limited evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit.^^</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Clinical and sociodemographic differences 删除19:<u>{#sec4-4}</u>\n-----------------------------------------</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Although in the total cohort of older adults both gender distribution and mean age were similar to the findings in previous studies,^,--^ the NPH group were significantly older than the PPH group and a higher proportion were men, the former being a novel finding. One of the very few previous studies that included a subsample of elderly patients with no prior contact with the mental healthcare system reported a similar gender distribution.^^ Both age and gender differences may be relevant when reviewing the HoNOS and GAF scores. These indicate that the patients in the NPH group present with a more complex, severe and multifaceted symptomatology and more impaired functioning than the patients in the PPH group, including problems with aggressive or disruptive behaviour, physical illness and disability, cognition and with activities of daily living.</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The NPH group being older is probably associated with the high degree of somatic comorbidity, dementia and other organic psychiatric disorders we identified in this group, which was in part confirmed by the analyses adjusting for age. The preponderance of organic and somatic disorders may again be associated with more behavioural difficulties, cognitive problems and a reduced level of functioning, as previously also shown in psychogeriatric populations assessed with HoNOS.^^ Regarding gender, prior studies have found that men with advanced dementia are more assaultive than women,^,^ potentially causing them to be particularly difficult for caregivers to manage and increasing the likelihood of psychiatric admission.^^ This could in part explain the disproportionate amount of male patients in the NPH group. However, the male preponderance in the NPH group was robust for the age and organic disorder sensitivity analyses. More aggressive behaviour may also in part explain the high rate of involuntary admissions in the NPH group. Furthermore, the decreased cognitive functioning in the NPH group may impair the capacity to consent to voluntary measures. The sensitivity analyses excluding organic disorders and controlling for age indicate that behavioural difficulties, cognitive problems and involuntary referral was in fact associated with age and a diagnosis of organic disorders.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Although the rates of patients in the NPH group who were married or widowed were comparable with that of the average elderly population in Norway,^^ patients in the PPH group were more likely to be divorced or single and living alone at the time of admission. This could be a reflection of the social consequences experienced by many in the PPH group chronically struggling with serious mental illness, possibly decreasing the chance of a stable marriage or partner.^^ These findings were strengthened by the fact that single and married status was robust for sensitivity analyses, indicating that the NPH group are more similar to the general elderly population irrespective of age. For patients with functional impairment, the lack of a supportive living partner might be relevant regarding the level of follow-up needed after the admission.</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Psychogeriatric transfer and guideline adherence 删除19:<u>{#sec4-5}</u>\n------------------------------------------------</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Despite being the most common destination of transfer in the NPH group, psychogeriatric units actually received less than half of patients in the NPH group. This number might seem low, and could point to psychogeriatric capacity issues and/or indicate that current guidelines are not sufficiently adhered to. As demonstrated by the other findings of our study, it is highly likely that many of these patients have complicating assessment and treatment needs relating to somatic comorbidity, cognitive and functional impairment, which have a higher risk of going unmet at a general adult unit than at an old age psychiatric unit.^^ The question needs to be raised whether general PAUs without any specific geriatric competence or facilitation are adequately suited to meet the needs of this frail patient group. Although most patients with a PPH were transferred from the PAU to general adult psychiatric units, one out of five were transferred to psychogeriatric units. We do not know the reason(s) for psychogeriatric transfer for these particular patients, however, it may be assumed that they were transferred to psychogeriatric units after individual assessment of need, even though their mental illness started before the age of 65. This highlights the fact that while complex assessment and treatment needs were most frequently found in the NPH group, clearly many patients with a PPH also presented with such needs. Although a detailed evaluation of patient transfer practice and comparison of different psychogeriatric intake criteria was not the focus of this article, our findings call for further research into this area.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Strengths and limitations 删除19:<u>{#sec4-6}</u>\n-------------------------</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Strengths of this study are the large number of patients and the complete, prospective recruitment of patients in a defined geographical area.

The clinical ratings were administered by on-call psychiatric residents and reliability scoring was not conducted. There was some missing data for some of the variables, especially the HoNOS.

Still, the main aim was to investigate if a crude division of elderly patients with and without former psychiatric treatment captures a distinct clinically relevant subcohort, which we conclude that it did. As psychogeriatric units are superior to general adult psychiatric units at providing elderly patients with comprehensive medical and psychiatric work-up,^^ as well as meeting the multi-faceted needs^^ undoubtedly present in this patient group, our findings support the current recommendation of several psychogeriatric guidelines of assigning elderly patients to either geriatric or general psychiatry based on the age at onset of mental illness.</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Subdividing patients to treatment in psychogeriatric services based on the age of mental illness presentation is a practical and unequivocal approach and may be especially clinically useful in a busy acute unit when triaging the needs of elderly psychiatric patients.

In any case, our findings highlight the multifactorial problems of this severely ill patient group and call attention to the importance of any admitting facility being adequately suited to manage them. Future research in this field should focus on longitudinal data such as causes of death, suicide, re-admissions to hospital as well as somatic comorbidity and complications, further evaluating the current system treating the most ill elderly psychiatric patients.

The evolution of cooperation between non-relatives can then be driven by a positive feedback between increasing levels of cooperativeness and choosiness. Here we use evolutionary simulations to show that, in a situation where individuals have the opportunity to engage in repeated pairwise interactions, the equilibrium degree of cooperativeness depends critically on the amount of behavioural variation that is being maintained in the population by processes such as mutation.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Many studies have shown that high-intensity repetitive movements play an important role in the effectiveness of robot-assisted therapy \\[\\]. Some ankle rehabilitation robots for treating ankle injuries have been developed. For example, Roy et al. \\[\\] developed a three-DOF wearable ankle robot, back-drivable with low intrinsic mechanical impedance actuated by two actuators. Saglia et al. \\[\\] designed a redundantly actuated parallel mechanism for ankle rehabilitation. Yoon and Ryu \\[\\] presented a reconfigurable ankle rehabilitation robot to cover various rehabilitation exercise modes. Jamwal et al. \\[\\] designed a rehabilitation robot with three-DOF rotation. The robot has four actuators. Girone et al. \\[\\] used a Stewart platform-based system as an ankle robot with six DOFs. Veneva \\[\\] introduced an ankle-foot orthosis with one DOF for the foot segment and another one for the shank segment. Agrawal et al. \\[\\] designed a two-DOF orthosis with pronation-supination and flexion-extension movements. Bi \\[\\] proposed a spherical parallel kinematic machine as an ankle rehabilitation robot, which can improve the adaptability to meet the patient\\'s needs during rehabilitation. Lu et al. \\[\\] proposed a three-DOF ankle robot combining passive-active training. Aggogeri et al. \\[\\] proposed a new device based on a single-DOF parallel mechanism able to perform trajectories similar to the patient\\'s ankle. Erdogan et al. \\[\\] presented a configurable, powered exoskeleton for ankle rehabilitation. Liao et al. \\[\\] proposed a novel hybrid ankle rehabilitation robot, which is composed of a serial and a parallel part. The parallel part of the robot was simplified as a constrained 3-PSP parallel mechanism. The kinematic analyses showed that the proposed hybrid rehabilitation robot can not only realize three kinds of ankle rehabilitation motions but also eliminate singularity with enhanced workspace.\n\n【2】Nowadays, research on ankle joint robots involves several aspects, including control, torque, motion planning, and optimization. For example, Rosado et al. \\[\\] implemented PID controllers in the development of passive rehabilitation exercises. Meng et al. \\[\\] presented a robust iterative feedback tuning technique for repetitive training control of a compliant parallel ankle rehabilitation robot. Zhang et al. \\[\\] proposed a computational ankle model for use in robot-assisted therapy estimating the passive ankle torque. Ayas et al. \\[\\] designed a fractional-order controller for a developed 2-DOF parallel ankle rehabilitation robot subject to external disturbance to improve the trajectory tracking performance.\n\n【3】At present, a number of rehabilitation robots are under investigation. However, only very few rehabilitation robots have been commercialised \\[, \\]. Rehabilitation robotics is penetrating the market very slowly. The significant limitations are the high cost and the difficulty to meet some specific needs from patients. For low-income and middle-income classes, only 5-15% of people who need assistive devices and technologies have access to these technologies \\[\\]. There is a shortage of personnel trained to manage the provision of such devices and technologies. However, the research and development on rehabilitation robots is emerging due to the fact that the cost of excluding people with disabilities from taking an active part in community life is high and the improvement has to be borne by society, particularly for those who take on the burden of care. The following conclusions have been drawn from the literature reviews \\[\\]: The existing rehabilitation robots have unacceptably high price. Even though limited rehabilitation robots are commercially available, most of them are still placed at research institutes due to the lack of market attractionMost of the existing ankle rehabilitation robots have coupled motions other than ankle rehabilitation needs. On the one hand, it increases the development cost since unnecessary redundant motions are used. Most importantly, due to the coupled translations, additional support will be required to endure the patient\\'s weight. For example, a few ankle rehabilitation robots have coupled motions of the legs. It becomes very inconvenient for a patient to sit down and concentrate on the ankle rehabilitationMost of the existing rehabilitation robots are designed for hospital environments\n\n【4】There is no indication that patients can operate and tailor the rehabilitation routines to their own needs. A completely new control mode is in demand which will allow a patient to operate the device by themselves and in the home environment.\n\n【5】Therefore, the following three points have been considered in our designed rehabilitation robot to further improve their performance and reduce the manufacturing and use costs simultaneously: Among the three allowed motions of the human ankle, only dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and varus/valgus are considered, as they are more important for ankle rehabilitation \\[\\]. The basic idea is thus to develop a rehabilitation robot primarily intended for the above two motions to meet some special patients\\' need and further reduce the cost of production and useThe objective is to design a robot in which the motion is fully decoupled into motion segments, to avoid the associated motion of multidrive motorsFor existing robots, the motion law of rehabilitation needs to be further researched. In fact, by applying inappropriate rules while rehabilitating the patient, the exercise would be less effective and may lead to secondary damage to the patient\n\n【6】Based on these considerations, a bionic ankle joint auxiliary rehabilitation robot based on a 2-S′PS′ mechanism was designed.\n\n【7】The main innovation points include The robot is designed with a special structure configuration. Between the upper platform and the lower platform, the centre sphere-pin pair and the two drive branch chains used for support are designed into a right triangle. Among them, the centre sphere-pin pair is a right-angle vertex, and the two drive branch chains are the vertexes of the two right-angle edges of the right triangle. For each drive branch chain, the spherical pin shafts of the two sphere-pin pairs are arranged along the direction of the right-angle side of the triangle. The spherical pin shaft of the centre sphere-pin pair is also arranged along the direction of another right-angle side of the triangle. Using this innovative structure configuration, the upper platform realizes dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and varus/valgus motions through rotation around two right-angle sides of the triangleTo make the robot motion be completely decoupled during dorsiflexion/plantar flexion or varus/valgus motions, dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and varus/valgus driving systems of the robot adopt the rigid-flexible hybrid structure. The two drive branch chains have the same structure. Each branched chain consists of a motor, slider block, spring, and others. When Motor I rotates to change Branch Chain 1 which results in motion of the upper platform, Branch Chain 2 will change its length to fit the upper platform motion. The compression of springs on Branch Chain 2 is large enough to compensate for this kind of change; therefore, Motor II on Branch Chain 2 keeps stationary. The same circumstance occurs for Motor II rotating to change Branch Chain 2The robot uses a centre ball pin pair as the main support to simulate the motion of the ankle joint; a structure consisting of the upper platform and the centre ball pin pair is a mirror image of a patient\\'s foot and ankle joint, which satisfies the human body physiological characteristicsThe speed, acceleration, and energy consumption of a typical rehabilitation exercise are considered to select different motion laws for the upper platform of the robot, for applying appropriate rules while rehabilitating the patient and avoiding secondary damage to the patient\n\n【8】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> shows actuation, range of motion (RoM), and motion decoupled characteristics about our designed robot and some stationary ankle rehabilitation robots. From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, only our robot is completely decoupled in dorsiflexion/plantar flexion or varus/valgus motions.\n\n【9】The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In [Section 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>, the structure of the robot is presented.

Structure and Working Principle of the Robot 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n===============================================\n\n【11】According to the anatomical structure of the human ankle, the ankle involves a total of three kinds of motions, i.e. dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, varus/valgus, and adduction/abduction. Among them, dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and varus/valgus are the two most important \\[\\].\n\n【12】Therefore, an ankle joint auxiliary rehabilitation robot is designed according to the schematic shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The robot with two drives and two DOFs is capable of three kinds of motions, namely, the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion, varus/valgus motion, and compound motion. The robot can be used by patients to exercise all these three motions. For patients with foot droop and lower limb muscle atrophy, the rehabilitation train can recover the ankle activity to normal, improve the muscle strength of lower limb muscle atrophy, and make the patient stand and walk during the rehabilitation period \\[\\].\n\n【13】A schematic of the robot is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, where 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> is the lower platform, 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> is the upper platform, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u> is the ball pin structure supporting the two platforms. The two drive branch chains (namely, Branch Chain 1, A~1~B~1~ and Branch Chain 2, A~2~B~2~) are identical; each branched chain consists of a motor 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>, U-shaped connector 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>, screw rod 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>, guide frame 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, slider block 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>, and spring 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>. The screw rod is connected to the motor, which is in turn fixed on the U-shaped connector. A screw pair is formed by the screw rod and slider block, while the slider block 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> and guide frame 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> form a sliding pair. Springs are installed between the slider block and guide frame forming the flexible transmission structure.\n\n【14】The guide frame 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> and the upper platform 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> and the lower platform 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> and the U-shaped connector 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> are connected by ball pin pairs, respectively. Points A~1~, B~1~, A~2~, B~2~, and O are centre points of the ball pin pairs, and lines B~1~B~3~ and A~1~A~3~ are perpendicular to lines B~3~B~2~ and A~3~A~2~, respectively. It is required that the spherical pin shafts of the ball pin pair A~1~ and B~1~ lie on the A~1~B~1~B~3~A~3~ plane. The spherical pin shafts of ball pin pair A~2~ and B~2~ lie on the A~2~B~2~B~3~A~3~ plane, and the spherical pin shaft of ball pin O lies on the A~1~B~1~B~3~A~3~ plane.\n\n【15】The structural model of the robot is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The foot joint of the patient is buckled on the upper platform 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u> using the foot buckle 通用删除7(英):<u>(10)</u>. A structure consisting of the upper platform and the centric ball pin pair is a mirror image of a patient\\'s foot and ankle joint. When an ankle joint needs to perform the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion rehabilitation motions, Motor I starts rotating the screw rod 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> and drives the slider block 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>. Then, the motion of the slider block 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> constricts the spring 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>. Under the action of the spring force, the upper platform rotates by a certain angle along the direction of the dorsiflexion and plantar flexion rehabilitation motions.\n\n【16】For the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion, only Motor I on branch chain A~1~B~1~ is needed to drive the robot (when Motor I rotates to change branch chain A~1~B~1~ for making the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion, the branch chain A~2~B~2~ will change its length to fit the upper platform motion. The compression of springs on branch chain A~2~B~2~ is enough to compensate for this kind of change). For the varus/valgus rehabilitation motion, the robot operates in the same way but only Motor II on branch chain A~2~B~2~ drives the robot. For the compound rehabilitation motion, both motors drive the device.\n\n【17】Suppose the patient uses the robot to carry out a rehabilitation motion, the movement time of the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, varus/valgus rehabilitation, and compound rehabilitation is the same, while the motor power expense for the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion and varus/valgus rehabilitation is the same. Compared with the undecoupled robot motion system, in normal conditions, the robot can reduce energy consumption of the motor by 30%.\n\n【18】Each of the above cases can be divided into three modes: A transition mode (i.e. the motor rotates and compresses the spring but cannot drive the motion of the upper platform)A rigid-flexible combination driving mode (i.e. the motor rotates and compresses the spring, which drives the upper platform)A rigid driving mode (i.e. the motor rotates and the spring is compressed to a rigid body, which drives the upper platform)\n\n【19】The transition mode is not considered, and the rigid driving mode cannot occur in a normal working state. Case 1 is used as an example to analyze the motion of the robot.\n\n【20】From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, B~1~, B~2~, and B~3~ are the initial positions of the upper platform, while B~1~′, B~2~′, and B~3~′ are the corresponding final positions.\n\nIn the initial state, let \\|A~1~B~1~\\| = l~1~, \\|A~2~B~2~\\| = l~2~, \\|OB~3~\\| = l~3~, \\|A~1~A~3~\\| = \\|B~1~B~3~\\| = n, and \\|A~2~A~3~\\| = \\|B~2~B~3~\\| = b.

The coordinates of the points on the lower platform are ^0^A~1~(0, n, −l~4~), ^0^A~2~(b, 0, −l~4~), and ^0^A~3~(0, 0, −l~4~).

The coordinates of the points on the upper platform are ^1^B~1~(0, n, l~3~), ^1^B~2~(b, 0, l~3~), and ^1^B~3~(0, 0, l~3~). Due to the symmetrical structure of the upper platform, it is considered approximately that the mass centre point of the upper platform is point P in the middle of line B~1~B~3~ and its coordinates are ^1^P(0, n/2, l~3~). In the initial state, the two coordinate systems X~0~Y~0~Z~0~ and X~1~Y~1~Z~1~ are coincident.\n\n【22】According to 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, when the upper platform rotates by an angle α° around the shaft X~0~, the homogeneous transformation matrix is given by $$$$\n\n【23】We have ^0^B′~1~ = ~1~^0^T · ^1^B~1~, ^0^B′~2~ = ~1~^0^T · ^1^B~2~, ^0^B′~3~ = ~1~^0^T · ^1^B~3~, and ^0^P′ = ~1~^0^T · ^1^P.\n\n【24】In order to calculate relationship between the motor drive angle and the motion angle of the upper platform, the calculation steps are as follows. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>Calculating Initial Compression Displacements of the Four Springs.

Taking Motor I as an example, with the upper platform rotating by an angle α°, calculate the lengths l~1~(α) and l~2~(α) of Branch Chains 1 and 2, respectively, at a given angle and evaluate whether or not l~1~(α) and l~2~(α) are between the shortest and longest ranges of allowed branch chains. If they are within an attainable range, Branch Chains 1 and 2 with lengths l~1~(α) and l~2~(α), respectively, may form a position of the upper platform. By continuously changing the angle α° and evaluating the results, diverse positions for the upper platform can be obtained, corresponding to the workspace of the upper platform when Motor I runs. Similarly, the workspace for Motor II can be obtained. For solving the workspace when Motors I and II work jointly, first, the working space for each motor running solely must be obtained.

Motion Simulation for the Upper Platform Driven by Different Motion Laws 删除19:<u>{#sec5}</u>\n===========================================================================\n\n【42】The performance of the robot is studied using the following three motion laws of the upper platform: modified trapezoid, modified constant velocity, and modified sine motion law \\[\\].\n\n【43】Motion parameters are treated by dimensionless processing. The terms t, s, v, and a are the time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the motion laws.

To simplify the problem, when calculating the driving function of the motor, the elastic coefficients of the upper spring and the lower spring are selected with an identical value.\n\n【49】ADAMS software was used to simulate the motion of the upper platform. The parameters are as follows: n = 150 mm, b = 150 mm, l~1~ = 704.1 mm, l~3~ = 12.7 mm, and l~4~ = 691.4 mm; load on the upper platform is 2 kg; rotational inertia circling around X-axis is J~X~ = 43.175 kg·mm^2^; elasticity coefficient of the upper springs is K = 5.5125 N/mm; elasticity coefficient of the lower springs is K = 7.4059 N/mm; screw pitch of the screw rod is s~n~ = 5 mm; and weights of the upper platform and guide frame are m = 6.537 kg and m~1~ = 1.269 kg, respectively. Here, only the simulation analysis of the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion is given.\n\n【50】The three-dimensional model of the robot is imported into ADAMS software (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 14]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Revolving joint motion around the Z-axis is added to the motor to simulate the motor\\'s rotation.\n\n【51】When only Motor І rotates, the upper platform is loading and the simulation is given here. In the work process, the upper platform adopts the modified trapezoid, the modified constant velocity, and the modified sinusoidal motion laws.\n\n【52】A cuboid whose outline size is 220 × 60 × 40 mm (L × H × W) is added to the upper platform, and a 2 kg mass is set to simulate the patient\\'s foot. The simulation time of the upward motion (i.e. α changes from 0° to 30°) or downward motion (α changes from 0° to -30°) of the upper platform is 5 s in steps of 0.1 s.\n\n【53】The upper platform is driven by motion laws previously established, and the motor torque changes are shown in Figures 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> when the upper platform moves from the equilibrium position upward to the top position and downward to the lowest position, respectively.\n\n【54】When the motion is driven by the modified trapezoidal function or the modified constant velocity function, the torque values of the motor fluctuate at the beginning, middle, and end of the motion. The use of the modified sine function enjoys better results than the other two kinds of driving function.\n\n【55】When the spring is set to the elastic state and the rigid state, simulation analysis is carried out. Some of the simulated parameters are summarized in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【56】For the spring in the elastic state, the maximum angular velocity is 0.234 rad/s and the maximum angular acceleration is -1.290 rad/s^2^, whereas for the spring in the rigid state, the maximum angular velocity is 0.229 rad/s and the maximum angular acceleration is -0.593 rad/s^2^. The maximum angular velocity value of the upper platform moving with the same motion law is larger for the spring in the case of the elastic state than that for the spring in the case of the rigid state. Moreover, the maximum angular acceleration value of the upper platform is significantly higher for the spring in the case of the elastic state. However, the maximum value of the torque does not significantly differ for the elastic state and the rigid state. Therefore, in the rehabilitation exercise, the patient can choose the different laws of motion based on the specific rehabilitation needs.\n\n【57】6. Control System and Prototype Experiment 删除19:<u>{#sec6}</u>\n==========================================\n\n【58】6.1. Control System Scheme 删除19:<u>{#sec6.1}</u>\n--------------------------\n\n【59】The control system shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 17]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> is composed of a PC, a multiaxis motion control card, and servo drive control systems. The PC provides the user with a graphical interface to complete different tasks such as the motion parameter setting. The multiaxis motion control card obtains the instructions and then converts them into the corresponding signals. The servo driver receives the corresponding signals and drives the servomotor.\n\n【60】6.2. Prototype Test 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2}</u>\n-------------------\n\n【61】We design a pose measurement system. The measurement system uses a gyro accelerometer MPU6050 to measure the motion angle of the upper platform and a power analyzer HIOKI PW6001 to measure the currents and power of the motor. Measurement data is shown through the PC. The measurement system can display the upper platform movement in three-dimensional angle changes. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> summarizes the main technical parameters of the servomotor used.

Single Motor Drives 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2.1}</u>\n\n【64】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 19]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the angle changes of the upper platform when the robot is driven by Motor I (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) to realize the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion movement. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> shows the angle changes of the upper platform.\n\n【65】From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 19]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, the upper platform only conducts angle changes needed for the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion movement. Experiments for the varus/valgus movement have the same result. Those experiments show that the experimental prototype of the robot can realize drive motion decoupling.\n\n【66】### 6.2.2. The Compound Motion 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2.2}</u>\n\n【67】Realizing the compound motion is tested by using two motor drives. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 20]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the angle changes of the upper platform when the robot is driven using two motors. From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 20]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, the upper platform can conduct the angle changes needed for the compound motion.\n\n【68】### 6.2.3. The Maximum Working Angles for the Upper Platform 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2.3}</u>\n\n【69】According to the design parameters, the maximum working angles for the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion or the varus/valgus motion change from -30° to +30°. Actual maximum working angles for the upper platform are tested. The experiment shows that the maximum working angles meet the design requirements.\n\n【70】The maximum working angles for the varus/valgus rehabilitation motion according to the modified sine motion law are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 21]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【71】### 6.2.4. The Real-Time Process of Rehabilitation Motion 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2.4}</u>\n\n【72】The varus/valgus motion, the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion, and the compound motion are tested. Here, only the varus/valgus motions are used as an example. The rehabilitation motion of the upper platform is driven by the modified sine motion law, and the cycle time is 20 s. The experiment results for three working angles (changing from -10° to +10°, -15° to +15°, and -20° to +20°) are shown in Figures 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, and 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【73】The theoretical values in Figures 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, and 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> are simulated using ADAMS software. From the test results, we found that the overall trends of the actual value were consistent with the simulation results.\n\n【74】The actual working angles deviate from the ideal value between -1.7° and +1.6°, when the working angles change from -10° to +10° as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 22]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The actual working angles deviate from the ideal value by -1.2° to+1.0°, when the working angles change from -15° to +15° as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 23]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The actual working angles deviate from the ideal value by -1.1° to+0.6°, when the working angles change from -20° to +20° as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 24]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【75】The experiment result for the three working velocities corresponding to the angles changing in Figures 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, and 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 25]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The characteristic value of the working velocities is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. The actual velocity values are obtained by differential calculation from the actual working angle change values. While from 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 25]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> the varus/valgus rehabilitation motion is not smooth, there are some velocity fluctuations. From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, theoretical values of the velocity are obtained by calculating from the modified sine motion law used by the upper platform motion; the actual testing maximum value and minimum value of the velocity are larger than the ones of the theoretical velocity. The test results show that the speed fluctuates greatly when the upper platform moves to the extreme position and horizontal position. This result is caused by the rigid-flexible hybrid structure of the robot. The spring is subjected to the pressing force which causes it to fluctuate in the abovementioned stage, causing deformation fluctuations.\n\n【76】A power analyzer Hioki PW6001 is used to measure the working currents of the motor. A working interface of the power analyzer is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 26]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The working currents of the motor for the varus/valgus rehabilitation motion (from -20° to +20°) are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 27]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The maximum value of the currents is 2.62 A. The working currents of the motor for the varus/valgus rehabilitation motion (from -10° to +10°) are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 28]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, and the maximum value of the currents is 2.21 A. From 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, the rated line current of the servomotor is 2.8 A, which indicates that the motor works in the normal range. The current changes periodically, and its period is basically the same with the speed period. The test results show that the current is relatively stable at 8.6-10 s. This is due to the fact that the upper platform moves close to the horizontal position and the upper platform moves at a lower speed. The load of the platform is mainly carried by the ball pin pair, and the load component of the varus/valgus branch chain is small and the change is not obvious.\n\n【77】According to the on-the-spot observation and test, the error between the actual values and the theoretical values may be caused by manufacturing and assembling precision for the structure, especially the manufacturing precision of the spring, the screw, etc. The performance of the spring is a critical factor.\n\n【78】### 6.2.5. Rehabilitation Motion on a Human Ankle Joint 删除19:<u>{#sec6.2.5}</u>\n\n【79】We tested the robot on a human ankle joint in the lab; the test scenario is as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 29]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【80】We have tested the varus/valgus motion, the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion motion, and the compound motion, separately. The rehabilitation motion of the upper platform is driven by the modified sine motion law, and the cycle time is 20 s.\n\n【81】Here, only the varus/valgus motion (working angles changing from -15° to +15°) is used as an example. The experiment results are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 30]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.

Load on the upper platform for the human ankle joint is 7.2 kg. Comparing this result with the result tested on adopting the cuboid load (cuboid load is 2 kg, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 18]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), there are small differences.\n\n【83】A further in-depth study about clinical data is our future work target.\n\n【84】7. Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec7}</u>\n=============\n\n【85】This paper presents an ankle joint rehabilitation robot with a rigid-flexible hybrid driving structure based on a 2-S′PS′ mechanism. The robot has two DOFs but can realize the three kinds of motion for the ankle joint rehabilitation.\n\n【86】The robot uses a centre ball pin pair as the main support to reduce the load of the drive system.

In the dorsiflexion/plantar flexion or varus/valgus driving system, the robot adopts the rigid-flexible hybrid structure and the robot motion is completely decoupled.\n\n【87】The presented robot has low manufacturing and usage costs. The theoretical analysis and experimental prototype show that the robot can meet some rehabilitation needs of different patients.\n\n【88】This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51705473); Key Science and Technology Research Project of Henan Province 通用删除7(英):<u>(182102210159)</u>, China; Doctoral Research Funded Projects of Zhengzhou University of Light Industry (2016BSJJ009); and Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (Grant no. 162300410316).\n\nl~70~:|删除段之间换行|:   The length between the centre of the slider block and the lower edge of the guide frame at the initial position\n\n【90】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![Schematic of the robot.

In this study, we examined effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen, on the cytokine production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated THP-1 macrophagic cells. A wide range of doses of P. gingivalis increased the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production. However, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production was substantially suppressed by high doses of P. gingivalis and this effect was demonstrated at the mRNA level. Challenges with a congenic protease mutant strain did not significantly attenuate the MCP-1 mRNA expression and addition of leupeptin, a protease inhibitor, to the cultures largely prevented the inhibition of MCP-1 expression by P. gingivalis. Transwell experiments showed that direct contact of P. gingivalis with THP-1 cells was not required for the MCP-1 inhibition. Furthermore, blockade of internalization of P. gingivalis into THP-1 cells had no effect on the MCP-1 inhibition by P. gingivalis. Finally, degradation of MCP-1 mRNA in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells was accelerated in the presence of P. gingivalis. These results suggest that the proteolytic activity of P. gingivalis attenuate MCP-1 mRNA expression by promoting the decay of MCP-1 mRNA in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Information on the occurrence of BTs in road dust (RD) and on human exposure to these compounds is very limited. BT and its six derivates in tire wear particles (TWPs) and RD were determined in this study. Samples were extracted using solid-liquid extraction, purified by a HLB SPE column, and determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). All seven BTs were found in 17 TWPs samples from different tire brands. The mass fractions of all seven BTs (∑BTs) in TWPs ranged from 46.93 to 215 μg/g with an average concentration of 99.32 μg/g. Benzothiazole and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (2-OH-BT) were the two major compounds, accounting for 56%-89% of the total. The seven BTs were also found in all 36 sets of RD samples (each set included one sample of TSP (particles < 75 μm in diameter), PM10 (particles < 10 μm in diameter) and PM2.5 (particles < 2.5 μm in diameter)) fractions of RD. The median ∑BTs concentration was highest in PM2.5 (26.62 μg/g), followed by PM10 (22.03 μg/g), and TSP (0.68 μg/g). Of the seven BTs, BT, 2-aminobenzothiazole (2-NH2-BT), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), and 2-(methylthio)benzothiazole (MTBT) were distributed in PM2.5 and 2-OH-BT was distributed in PM2.5-10 of RD. Based on the mass fractions of BTs in the TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 fractions of RD, human exposure via ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption were evaluated. Ingestion was found to be the main exposure pathway in humans, and daily intake of BTs in PM2.5 was highest, followed by PM10 and TSP, respectively. Children may suffer more health risks than adults when exposed to RD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A physico-chemical study.\nThe formation of inclusion complexes (ICs) composed of cyclodextrins (CDs) and poly(ethylene oxides)-poly(propylene oxides)-poly(ethylene oxides) (PEO-PPO-PEO) was studied. To this purpose, native and hydroxypropyl cyclodextrins with different cavity size were chosen. The PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers were selected to study the role of the molecular weight, keeping constant the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, and the hydrophilicity. The volumetric studies at 25 degrees C allowed to determine the equilibrium constant and the volume change for the IC formation in water as well as the IC stoichiometry. Surface tension experiments evidenced that the copolymer and the CD interfacial behavior is controlled by the formation of ICs taking place in the bulk phase. It was proved that the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a valid method to describe quantitatively the IC in the solid state.

{"seq_id": "1f5aaa19-06ab-4a0f-ba9b-04c6d787ccde", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1_1}</u>\n============\n\n【1】Several deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets have been described for the alleviation of resistant central neuropathic pain syndromes, including the periaqueductal grey (PAG) \\[\\], centromedian-parafascicular (CmPf) nucleus \\[\\], sensory thalamus \\[\\], subthalamic nucleus \\[\\], nucleus accumbens \\[\\], and anterior cingulate cortex \\[\\]. These activate different neuronal pathways and are likely to alter pain perception by distinct mechanisms. There have been no studies to date comparing the acute analgesic effects of stimulation at the PAG and CmPf targets or the consequences of combined site stimulation.\n\n【2】PAG stimulation is thought (in part) to exert its actions by a release of endogenous opioid \\[,\\] via a descending modulatory pathway. Low-frequency stimulation of PAG results in a sensation of warmth, pleasure, satiety, and inebriation \\[\\]. Another target, CmPf, was found serendipitously (after the post-mortem determined the exact site of depth electrodes) after successful treatment of a patient with terminal cancer \\[\\]. Despite the close proximity of CmPf to the PAG, anatomical and physiological studies suggest a separate mechanism of analgesia \\[\\]. It is thought to reduce the affective component of pain via ascending connections to the anterior cingulate nucleus \\[\\].\n\n【3】By studying patients with electrodes implanted into these two targets for the successful treatment of trigeminal anaesthesia dolorosa, we attempt to characterise the analgesic effect of each target and assess whether a greater analgesic effect can be achieved through combined stimulation. A meta-analysis of DBS for analgesia found a greater mean reduction in pain where electrodes targeted more than one anatomical site \\[\\]. This group only confirmed that multiple targets increased the likelihood of successful stimulation-induced analgesia, but the effect of each target alone and in combination was not assessed. We hypothesised that PAG and CmPf stimulation would each exhibit distinct characteristics and that simultaneous stimulation may be beneficial. Improved understanding of timing and response to stimulation in these two sites may better inform patient and target selection and assist optimisation of treatment. We report a small case series with characterisation of the analgesic effects of two stimulation sites both individually and in combination.\n\n【4】Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec1_2}</u>\n=======\n\n【5】Full approval from the NHS ethics committee (Ref. 12/SW/0255) and the North Bristol NHS Trust research and development (Ref. 2875) was obtained for the testing performed. The study was registered with the National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Clinical Research Network (Ref. 13580).\n\n【6】Operative Method 删除19:<u>{#sec2_1}</u>\n----------------\n\n【7】Patients were required to have symptoms and a confirmed mechanism of trigeminal nerve damage to be considered for DBS 删除21:<u>(see table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Patients with no response to optimal conventional treatment under a secondary pain service for 2 years were offered DBS as per criteria of the NHS exceptional clinical need panel.\n\n【8】Planning MRI scans were obtained under general anaesthesia using a Leksell frame and localiser unit. Trajectory and co-ordinates for the ventral PAG and CmPf contralateral to the pain were derived from individual subject MRIs using NeuroInspire™ software (Renishaw, Wotton-under-Edge, UK). Guide tubes were placed using stereotaxy, and the position was confirmed with CT angiogram. The position of the electrodes (Medtronic 3387) could then be modified based on the position of the guide tube. Electrode tips protrude 10 mm beyond the guide tube in the same trajectory, so contact positions could be confirmed using image software \\[\\]. Each electrode was connected to its own impulse generator (IPG) as the targets required different stimulation frequencies. Medtronic Itrel 3 single-channel IPGs were implanted below the clavicle bilaterally (with the right-sided IPG always connected to the PAG electrode to avoid confusion when programming). Programming of IPG was performed 3-5 days after electrode insertion. Repeat programing was carried out at routine outpatient follow-up by the neurosurgical research fellow.\n\n【9】Method for Characterising Stimulation Effects 删除19:<u>{#sec2_2}</u>\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【10】All subjects operated on between 2010 and 2012 for anaesthesia dolorosa were included in the study. No subjects were excluded. All subjects during this period had dual target stimulation. The mean follow-up period between DBS insertion and this study was 19 ± 8 months. Testing for acute analgesic effect, onset/offset of effect, and character of analgesic effect using quantitative sensory testing (QST) were all carried out over a single day using the protocol shown in figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【11】Each patient had both pulse generators switched off prior to commencing the testing protocol. This was for 60 min or longer until the pain score stabilised (three static readings). Mean timings for each part of the protocol are provided in figure 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Each section of the testing protocol was continued until the subject\\'s pain score had stabilised, thus the durations on and off stimulation varied between subjects and target used. This was to ensure the minimum period of discomfort experienced by the patient when stimulation was switched off and to reduce the length of the testing protocol where no further analgesic benefit was noted in the 'stimulation on' phase.\n\n【12】Numeric rating scores (Numeric Rating Scale) for pain were assessed at 2.5-min intervals during each section of the protocol. A baseline pain score was established prior to the next target being stimulated. Open questions about the pain character, severity, and effect of fan-blown air on the face were asked during each stage.\n\n【13】QST was performed at the end of each section. The subject clicked a button when they could sense a change in temperature or discomfort from the thermode placed on their affected cheek (surface area of 9 cm^2^). The subjects were asked to close their eyes during all testing. A thermal sensory analyser (TSA 2001-II; MEDOC, Israel) was used to determine the cold detection threshold, warm detection threshold, cold pain threshold, and hot pain threshold. The thermode temperature was increased or decreased from 32°C at 1°C per second for temperature detection and 1.5°C per second for temperature pain threshold using the 'limits method' \\[\\]. The threshold was determined from the mean of four trials for cold and warm sensory detection \\[\\] and three trials for hot and cold pain thresholds. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed using von Frey hairs, and dynamic allodynia was determined by brushing the skin with a cotton wool bud.\n\n【14】Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM software (V6 Graphpad, La Jolla, Calif. USA). A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA test was used to assess the significance of pain scores over time and between different stimulation combinations. Sidak\\'s post hoc multiple comparison test was used with correction for multiple comparisons. Changes in sensory and pain temperature thresholds from PAG stimulation were assessed using paired t tests.\n\n【15】Results 删除19:<u>{#sec1_3}</u>\n=======\n\n【16】Patient Characteristics 删除19:<u>{#sec2_3}</u>\n-----------------------\n\n【17】The mean age of the cohort was 44.3 ± 6.7 years. Surgery was deemed highly successful in all subjects whose mean pain reduction was 67.3 ± 6.7% at the time of recruitment for this study. This was after a mean duration of 18.7 ± 8.0 months of DBS. The range of stimulation frequencies producing optimal analgesia was 5-10 Hz for the PAG electrode and 70-150 Hz for the CmPf electrode (table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). A comparison of analgesic medication prior to implantation with that being used at the time of this study has been provided (table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【18】Quantifying Stimulation-Derived Analgesia 删除19:<u>{#sec2_4}</u>\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【19】The pain score changed significantly with each stimulation combination (p \\< 0.05, F score 8.97, 5 d.f.). The mean pain score of the cohort (Numeric Rating Scale) was acutely reduced from 5.5 ± 1.3 to 2.4 ± 0.9 (56% reduction, p \\< 0.05) for PAG stimulation and from 6.7 ± 0.7 to 2.2 ± 0.7 (67% reduction, p \\< 0.01) for CmPf stimulation 删除21:<u>(fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. Dual target stimulation produced a mean reduction in pain score from 6.2 ± 0.2 to 1.7 ± 0.7 (73% reduction, p \\< 0.01). There was no significant difference between the degrees of analgesia seen with individual or combined stimulation targets in our small sample. The change in pain score was recorded over a testing period of 38 ± 14, 16 ± 4, and 27 ± 17 min for PAG alone, CmPf alone, and both PAG and CmPf stimulation, respectively 删除21:<u>(fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>.\n\n【20】Onset Time. The time taken to generate a significant analgesic response to stimulation was found at 12.5 min (p \\< 0.01) for PAG and 2.5 min for CmPf (p \\< 0.001; fig. [3a, b]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【21】Washout. When stimulation was withdrawn (after having been on for a minimum of 40 min), a significant reversal of the analgesic effect was apparent at 2.5 min (p \\< 0.01) for PAG stimulation and at 12.5 min (p \\< 0.01) for CmPf stimulation.\n\n【22】Characterising Analgesic Effect through QST. All 3 subjects demonstrated improvements in their cold pain threshold with PAG stimulation from 27.7 ± 0.4 to 23.3 ± 2.0°C, but the change was not significant (two-tailed paired t test, p = 0.2; fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). No trend was seen in cold pain threshold with CmPf stimulation. Stimulation resulted in no change to other QST temperature thresholds (warm detection threshold, hot pain threshold, cold detection threshold), nor was there a change in mechanical hypersensitivity as assayed with von Frey hairs. However, dynamic allodynia, as tested with a brush from a cotton bud, was attenuated by both PAG and CmPf stimulation. This approached significance (p = 0.058, F = 4.4, d.f. = 3). The post hoc test revealed that when PAG and CmPf stimulation were used in combination there was a significant change in allodynia score (p = 0.04, d.f. = 6; fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【23】Qualitative Characterisation of Analgesic Effect. Qualitative changes in pain were recorded in response to stimulation at both targets (table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). PAG stimulation attenuated spasm frequency and provided a sensation of warmth bilaterally. CmPf appeared to reduce the unpleasantness of pain while providing a distracting paraesthesia over the painful area. A summary of all observations is provided (table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【24】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec1_4}</u>\n==========\n\n【25】DBS Target Choice 删除19:<u>{#sec2_5}</u>\n-----------------\n\n【26】DBS has been employed for chronic pain with varying degrees of success \\[\\]. This may reflect the challenge of target selection in a complex patient population. However, those who do benefit report substantial relief of previously intractable pain \\[\\]. It has been postulated that PAG stimulation is better suited to nociceptive pain, whereas sensory thalamic and potentially CmPf targets are more effective in neuropathic pain \\[,\\]. Our data also point to different mechanisms for the analgesia produced by PAG and CmPf stimulation. Historically, only subjects responding to a trial of systemic morphine followed by naloxone reversal were offered PAG stimulation \\[\\], but this selection process has not been widely adopted. We propose that characterisation of patients\\' pain experience may help to direct anti-nociceptive target selection, improving patient outcomes.\n\n【27】Timing 删除19:<u>{#sec2_6}</u>\n------\n\n【28】The onset and offset times and analgesic characteristics for stimulation-derived analgesia have not been examined in the follow-up setting in humans before. Intra-operatively 'a pleasant warmth' has been described after 15-20 min of PAG stimulation \\[\\]. PAG stimulation offset times are as short as 5 min in rodents \\[\\] and may be as long as 24 h in man \\[\\]. Even less has been documented concerning CmPf stimulation onset and offset times in humans. We found a reliable time frame for the onset and offset of acute effects in our cohort of 3 anaesthesia dolorosa subjects (which was replicated in our phantom limb pain patients; unpubl. data). Our results should inform clinicians performing intra-operative trials of micro-stimulation and those involved in DBS programming.\n\n【29】Quantitative Sensory Testing 删除19:<u>{#sec2_7}</u>\n----------------------------\n\n【30】Several studies suggest that temperature-related or burning pain \\[,\\] responds well to PAG stimulation. In support of this we have demonstrated that PAG stimulation objectively alters the cold pain threshold using QST. Considering the large changes in the overall pain score it is surprising that changes to thermal and mechanical static pain are so small. This does not support a principal mechanism of anti-nociception via a descending action on nociceptive pathways in general, and other mechanisms of action for analgesia must be inferred.\n\n【31】Allodynia Attenuation 删除19:<u>{#sec2_8}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【32】Attenuated sensitivity to a cotton bud brush, as a measure of tactile allodynia, was demonstrated with both PAG and CmPf stimulation. This reduction in hyperalgesia in the presence of normal static mechanical sensation has been described previously in response to PAG stimulation for post-stroke pain \\[\\].\n\n【33】Qualitative Aspects of Pain Character 删除19:<u>{#sec2_9}</u>\n-------------------------------------\n\n【34】CmPf stimulation appears to modify the affective and motivational components of pain \\[\\]. This was noted by all of our subjects who reported the pain to be less unpleasant. The CmPf is connected directly to the anterior cingulate cortex \\[\\] and indirectly to the amygdala via the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which may explain its ability to influence these emotional aspects of pain.\n\n【35】Different Mechanisms 删除19:<u>{#sec2_10}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【36】The different frequencies, analgesic qualities, and connectivity seen in PAG and CmPf stimulation strengthen our hypothesis of differing mechanisms and support the use of these targets in combination. Our results suggest that the analgesic effects of PAG and CmPf stimulation may be useful in combination, but we were unable to demonstrate any synergy in their effects on the overall pain score. However, all patients preferred using both pulse generators in combination as each target provided useful qualitatively distinct aspects of relief to their pain. Bittar et al. \\[\\] have described increased success of surgery where two or more targets were implanted. This was thought to be due to the complexity of selecting the correct target for the specific pain type. Our results take this one step further: by using targets which act through different mechanisms we may be able to offer patients a more comprehensive analgesic response to their pain syndrome with no loss of efficacy at either target.\n\n【37】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec1_5}</u>\n==========\n\n【38】The mechanisms by which the stimulation targets PAG and CmPf achieve analgesia are likely to be different. Certain pain qualities may favour specific targets. PAG stimulation may be effective against cold pain, whereas CmPf stimulation may alter the affective and motivational components of pain, while providing a distractive paraesthesia. Improved understanding of timing and response to stimulation in these two anatomical locations may better inform patient selection and promote optimal treatment and programming. Pain characteristics in this population are multi-faceted. The effect of using PAG and CmPf targets simultaneously does not result in antagonism and may offer a broader analgesic response to complex pain symptomatology. The use of more than one stimulation target should be considered for patients with trigeminal anaesthesia dolorosa undergoing DBS.\n\n【39】H.P.S.-W. was supported by an Elizabeth Blackwell Institute Clinician Science Primer award from the University of Bristol.

GSH is ubiquitous and one of the most abundant metabolites with millimolar (mM) intra-cellular concentration. It is the major low-molecular weight thiol compound in animal cells. Presence of thiol group in GSH makes it susceptible to oxidation \\[\\] as well as possible source of conformational changes due to changes in its surrounding microenvironment. Published reports of molecular dynamics (MD) studies \\[\\] as well as studies utilizing state-of-the-art Raman spectroscopy \\[\\] and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) \\[\\] techniques on GSH in various experimental conditions (solvent, pH, temperature, etc.), provide a clear insight into possible GSH conformations (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【2】![Glutathione and its structural conformations.

MD simulations over 20 ns using Gromacs all-atom force field, coupled with cluster analyses of the trajectories, have been applied to examine the distribution proportion of GSH conformations in aqueous solutions as a function of pH \\[\\]. The results derived from MD simulations show that GSH is very flexible and does not adopt a strongly preferred conformation at any pH \\[\\]. Calculations in another MD study with GSH \\[\\] were carried out using a modified TINKER 4.2 molecular modeling package at T = 298 K and 1atmospheric pressure. This study also indicated that GSH is highly flexible in an aqueous solution with transitions occurring between the extended and folded conformations \\[\\]. In contrast to classical MD with the motion of interactive atoms, recent advancements in conformal studies are adopting quantum molecular dynamics (QMD). QMD is based on the existence of chemical bonds as a result of electron interactions and can describe the formation and breaking of chemical bonds, which cannot be accomplished using classical molecular dynamics. QMD includes elemental interactions between atoms as well as electrons. QMD simulation methods work on \"first principle\" based only on the laws of quantum mechanics and thus do not require any prior knowledge on inter-atomic interactions. Behavioral modeling of molecules in QMD is described in terms of density functional theory (DFT), which is presently the most successful approach to compute the electronic structure of matter \\[\\]. The DFT approach predicts a great variety of molecular properties that include molecular structures, vibrational frequencies, atomization energies, ionization energies, electric and magnetic properties, and reaction paths. A recent report on DFT investigation of GSH has also confirmed the extended and folded conformers of GSH reported in an MD study \\[\\].\n\n【4】Conformations of GSH in aqueous solutions have been investigated using Raman spectroscopic methods that rely on vibrational and/or rotational frequency differences. Raman spectroscopy provides detailed information on vibrational frequencies specific to chemical bonds as well as on molecular symmetry, thereby giving a unique fingerprint of the molecule of interest. Since Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique, it is useful for the analysis of chemical structures and their molecular conformations \\[\\]. The amide III band components, between 1308 cm^--1^ and 1288 cm^--1^, show three distinct distribution of conformations of GSH (P~II~, α~R~ and β at 0.5 M GSH in H~2~O, pH 7 \\[\\], and these conformations have been used by numerous experimental and theoretical studies. The Raman spectroscopic bands at 1305 cm^--1,^ 1298 cm^--1^ and 1288 cm^--1^ correspond to the P~II~, α~R~, and β conformations, respectively, of GSH in aqueous medium \\[\\]. The relative population of β, P~II~, and α~R~ conformations of GSH is reported as 60%, 25%, and 15%, respectively, based on calculations of the amide III regions in Raman spectra of GSH \\[\\].\n\n【5】NMR spectroscopy provides information on the conformational changes of peptides and proteins through measurement of chemical shifts of molecular groups and coupling constants of the chemical bonds in them. Conformational analysis of a compound at a given experimental condition (e.g. pH, temperature and solvent) is accomplished using NMR spectroscopy to determine the relative populations of conformers in solution. Proton NMR chemical shift values of the molecular groups of GSH were determined without ambiguity using one dimensional and/or two-dimensional NMR studies performed at high magnetic fields (400--700 MHz) \\[\\] in various physiological conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, and solvent).\n\n【6】The (two) published NMR reports of GSH indicate that there are major differences in the way the samples were prepared \\[\\]. One report \\[\\] used a degassed aqueous GSH solution in order to reduce the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution, thereby minimizing the oxidation of GSH, while another report \\[\\] used a non-degassed GSH aqueous solution in the NMR studies. GSH is susceptible to oxidation due to the presence of a thiol group, and thus it is highly sensitive to external environment. Therefore, the sample preparation method plays a key role in deciding the conformational state of GSH. The two NMR studies \\[\\] that have used a degassed or a non-degassed aqueous GSH solution report distinct conformational states of GSH. NMR studies of a non-degassed aqueous GSH solution show the chemical shift of GSH cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ at 4.56 and 2.95 ppm \\[\\]. In contrast, the studies that have used degassed samples report GSH cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ at 4.40 and 2.80 ppm \\[\\]. One of the studies reported the chemical shifts of GSH cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ at 4.37 and 2.77 ppm in aqueous solution using DMSO as an internal reference \\[\\]. The chemical shift values \\[\\] of the cysteine H~α~/H~β~ are close to the values reported in studies that used degassed GSH aqueous solutions \\[\\]. A combined MD and NMR study reveals that GSH in DMSO solution remains in the stable folded conformation, whereas in aqueous solution it is highly flexible with transitions between extended and folded conformations \\[\\].The stability of the folded GSH form has been confirmed by a recent advanced DFT calculations report \\[\\].\n\n【7】Based on these combined studies \\[\\], it can be inferred that chemical shifts of cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ of GSH at 4.40 and 2.80 ppm, respectively, in degassed aqueous solution is similar to the one obtained in DMSO solution, are indicative of the stable folded GSH conformation. We hypothesize that reduced glutathione in aqueous solution has two conformations as indicated by MD studies: the extended conformation is characterized by the chemical shifts of cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ at 4.56 and 2.95 ppm, respectively, and the folded conformation is characterized by the chemical shifts of H~α~ and H~β~ at 4.40 and 2.80 ppm, respectively. However, there is need to perform a thorough and well-controlled experimental study to understand the reasons behind the changes observed in the chemical shifts of cysteine hydrogens of GSH and to ascertain if this is to do with the change in its conformations or other factors.\n\n【8】Glutathione is a free radical scavenger, which plays a key role in maintaining the oxidative and redox balance in human cells and exists in both the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms. GSH can be converted to GSSG by the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, and this can be reconverted to GSH by glutathione reductase \\[\\]. Measurements of GSH, GSSG and their enzyme catalyzed reactions are thus important for evaluating the redox and antioxidant status \\[\\]. GSH serves as a marker of oxidative stress that is an important factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) \\[\\]. GSH in the brain is reported to be 1.18±0.09 mM from the parietal cortex of autopsy brain \\[\\], which decreases with age and age-associated disorders \\[\\]. A clinical study indicated the link between oxidative damage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using the plasma levels of GSH and GSH/GSSG ratio of 34 subjects with MCI, 45 subjects with AD, and 28 age-matched control subjects \\[\\]. The results showed a significant decrease in GSH levels and GSH/GSSG ratios in AD and MCI patients compared to age matched control subjects \\[\\]. The depletion of GSH was specific to AD patients compared to patients with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy body disease \\[\\]. This clinical study reported that the mean GSH levels in the cingulate cortex brain region of AD patients were decreased (49%) compared to age matched control subjects \\[\\]. These disease specific studies \\[\\] stress the importance of quantitation of GSH in the brain regions patients with different pathological conditions (e.g. AD and MCI), which may serve as an early surrogate marker of diseases.\n\n【9】DISCUSSION 删除19:<u>{#sec0010}</u>\n==========\n\n【10】It has been established that the tripeptide structure of GSH is quite sensitive to its surrounding environment (e.g. pH, temperature, and solvent). Molecular dynamics studies have shown that the conformation of GSH is very flexible in aqueous solution by converting it from the extended form to the folded form \\[\\]. Furthermore, NMR and Raman spectroscopic studies of GSH clearly support the existence of various conformers of it. The results of these studies allude to the presence or absence of anaerobic or aerobic environment indeed influence the antioxidant potential of GSH by modulating the conformational changes of GSH. At present, it is not known which of the two GSH conformations (i.e. extended or folded) is present in the human brain. It is pertinent to know the proportion of the two GSH conformations in healthy brain and in pathological conditions. Answers to these questions will have major implications in the way GSH levels are detected and quantitated using in vivo MRS methods.\n\n【11】It is prudent to report that the accuracy of the NMR spectral parameters (chemical shifts and coupling constants) of glutathione can be limited for its molecular groups with complex and overlapping spectral patterns. Furthermore, the values for these parameters may be altered in in vivo conditions as a result of local physiological and cellular environment \\[\\]. Detection of GSH in human brain in vivo is commonly accomplished by ^1^H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) using spectrally-selective editing schemes that employ J-couplings of cysteinal hydrogens. We hypothesize that the proton NMR spectral peak positions of cysteine H~α~ and H~β~ are highly associated with the conformational states of GSH. The QMD study of GSH \\[\\] has not got sufficient attention, and further studies with in vivo physiological conditions are necessary to understand possible conformations of GSH in the brain. A clear understanding for the conformations of GSH in the brain will help us to come up with optimal experimental data acquisition parameters for MRS studies performed in vivo for selectively detecting GSH. An important first step is to do thorough in vitro NMR experiments of GSH in different physiological conditions that will clarify some of the unanswered questions. Towards this, we plan to acquire proton MRS data at high magnetic fields (e.g. \\>11 T) using phantoms containing GSH and/or GSSG at physiological and non-physiological (or pathological) conditions as well as ex vivo intact animal or human brain tissue samples. The high magnetic field MRS data will allow us to measure the chemical shifts and coupling constants of the hydrogens in the extended and folded GSH conformations at much higher accuracy than at 3T clinical MRI scanner.\n\n【12】Previous task force reported eight neurochemical (not GSH) with their specific chemicl shifts and in vivo concentration range. Subsequently, a multi-center in vivo research project with a common data acquisition protocol will help us to unravel the associations between the conformations of GSH in vivo and the observed spectral patterns in healthy controls and pathological conditions.\n\n【13】Dr. Pravat K.

Male C57BL/6J fed high-fat diet (HFD) and HepG2 cells stimulated with free fatty acid were treated with baicalein and various pharmacological reagents to explore the effect of signaling pathways involved in lysosomal acidification. Baicalein intake declined ALT and AST activities by 25.1% and 18.7%, respectively, compared with the HFD group. Moreover, baicalein markedly ameliorated the HFD-trigged lysosomal membrane permeabilization evidenced by declined cathepsin B release. Subsequent disorders, including cathepsin D maturation and mitochondrion membrane potential were also partially normalized by baicalein administration to HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, an increase in V-ATPase V1 subunits expression in lysosomes, V-ATPase activity and the colocalization of cytosol V-ATPase V1 subunits and lysosomes was observed in baicalein-supplement mice. Bafilomycin A1 stimulation resulting in elevated lysosomal pH and triacylglycerol accumulation partially abolished the effect of baicalein. Furthermore, incubation with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin restored lysosomal pH and decreased cellular triacylglycerol content.

However, with increasing safety and efficacy concerns over currently available drugs and a dearth of options available for atypical depot formulations, there is a considerable need for the development of new formulations and agents. This review examines the profile of seven antipsychotic drugs currently in the premarketing stage of development and summarizes their mechanism of action, clinical potential and safety.Asenapine is an antipsychotic with activity for multiple receptors and has potential to improve negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Bifeprunox is a partial dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist showing a less than convincing efficacy profile, but which may offer safety advantages over available agents by means of a reduced risk of metabolic complications. Iloperidone is a D2 and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist requiring further studies to establish its effectiveness. It has a high affinity for alpha通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>-adrenoceptors, which can lead to associated haemodynamic adverse effects. Nemonapride is essentially a typical antipsychotic drug, similar in structure to sulpiride, which has been available for some time in Japan. It has efficacy against positive symptoms and has shown some antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, although efficacy data for it are somewhat limited. Norclozapine (N-desmethylclozapine) is a major metabolite of clozapine formed by its demethylation. Its partial agonist activity at D2 receptors has raised interest in it as an antipsychotic in its own right. In addition, it appears to have muscarinic agonist activity, which is believed to be responsible for the observed positive effects it has on cognition. It was envisaged to be effective as an adjunct to other agents or at high doses in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia, although a recent randomized, controlled study showed that it was no more effective than placebo in patients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic episode. Olanzapine pamoate depot injection has shown comparable efficacy to oral olanzapine in several studies. However, it has provoked considerable safety concerns by its association with inadvertent intravascular injection events in numerous patients. This accidental intravascular administration of olanzapine pamoate leads to excessive sedation, confusion, dizziness and altered speech. Post-injection observation periods and postmarketing surveillance are planned following the introduction of the depot. Paliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester of paliperidone, the major metabolite of risperidone, and is formulated as a long-acting injection for intramuscular use. Its pharmacology is comparable to risperidone, having D2 and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist activity. Efficacy studies have shown positive results, and because paliperidone has no antagonistic activity at cholinergic receptors, it has low potential for anticholinergic adverse effects, including cognitive dysfunction. However, with higher doses, the frequency of extrapyramidal side effects and orthostatic hypotension have been shown to be greater than with placebo.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Recently, visit-to-visit variability in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) has been shown to be an independent predictor of adverse long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease on statin treatment \\[, \\]. We have recently shown a direct association between visit-to-visit HbA1c variability and kidney function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes \\[\\]. Whether visit-to-visit variability in LDLC affects subclinical atherosclerosis remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the cross-sectional relationship between visit-to-visit variability in LDLC and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, in type 2 diabetic patients.\n\n【2】Patients and Methods 删除19:<u>{#s2}</u>\n====================\n\n【3】We here show results of 162 patients, in whom carotid IMT was measured during the first 12 months after enrollment, out of 168 patients with type 2 diabetes whose details have been reported elsewhere \\[\\]. Patients with hepatitis B surface antigen or antibodies against hepatitis C virus were excluded. Those who had aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase of 100 U/L or greater and serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL were excluded as well. Study protocol was consistent with the Japanese Government's Ethical Guidelines Regarding Epidemiological Studies in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【4】For each subject on each monthly visit, waist circumference, weight and blood pressure (BP) were measured by registered nurses. As previously reported in details \\[\\], blood was withdrawn on two occasions: at 2 h after breakfast taken at home and after an overnight fasting. This was done every other month in the majority of patients (94%). Plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), creatinine and other blood tests were measured by standard methods using an autoanalyzer. LDLC was calculated using Friedewald's formula \\[\\] using serum cholesterol, TG and HDLC measured in samples taken after an overnight fasting. Complete blood cell count was analyzed using an automated blood cell counter. HbA1c values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n【5】Of 162 patients, 153 patients (94%) had 12 measurements of anthropometric variables, systolic BP and HbA1c, and six measurements of LDLC, fasting and post-breakfast concentrations of plasma glucose (PG) and serum TG. Intrapersonal mean and SD of these variables taken during the first 12 months after enrollment were calculated.\n\n【6】Urinary albumin was measured in random urine samples using a turbidimetric immunoassay and expressed as albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). Normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were defined as an ACR \\< 30 mg/g, ACR between 30 and 299 mg/g and ACR ≥ 300 mg/g, respectively \\[\\]. Serum and urinary creatinine were measured enzymatically and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the equation recommended by the Japanese Society for Nephrology \\[\\]. Chronic kidney disease was defined as eGFR \\< 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ and/or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g \\[\\].\n\n【7】IMT was measured by a well-trained medical technologist of Sadamitsu Hospital using ultrasonic diagnosis equipment (Shimadzu SDU-2200, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) that was programmed with IMT software (Intimascope; Media Cross Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described \\[\\]. Carotid artery ultrasonography was performed using a 10-MHz scanning frequency in B mode with the participant in the supine position. Computer-based IMT was evaluated by two methods: maximum and average evaluations. Maximum evaluation was obtained by the IMT value at a maximal point of the region. Mean IMT is the average value of 250 computer-based points in the region. Mean values of the right and left maximum IMT and mean IMT were used for statistical analysis. The intra-observer coefficient of variation (CV) for IMT measurements was 5.6±0.8% and inter-observer CV ranged from 2.5% to 10.9% with an average of 5.9% \\[\\].\n\n【8】Statistical analysis 删除19:<u>{#s2a}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【9】Data were presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise stated. Differences between two groups were analyzed by t-test and frequencies of conditions by Chi-square tests. Correlations of carotid IMT and SD-LDLC were evaluated by Pearson correlation analyses. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were performed to further identify the most significant variables contributing to carotid IMT and SD-LDLC. Potential confounders were forced into the model and standardized β coefficients were calculated. The explanatory power of the model was expressed as adjusted R^2^ values. A two-tailed P \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All calculations were performed with SPSS system 15.0 (SPSS Inc.

It showed positive associations with chronic kidney disease and log ACR, although there was no significant association with albuminuria (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and reduced kidney function (eGFR \\< 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2^). Further, maximum IMT was associated positively with SD-systolic BP and red blood cell count. Although HDLC showed inverse association with maximum IMT, there was no significant association with other lipid and glycemic variables studied. After controlling for sex and age (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), associations with uses of lipid-lowering drugs, log ACR and red blood cell count remained significant. Associations with LDLC and SD-LDLC, which were not significant in simple regression analyses, became significant after adjustment for sex and age. However, associations with SD-systolic BP and HDLC turned to be non-significant.\n\n【16】Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) revealed that age (standardized β, 0.355, P \\< 0.001), male sex (standardized β, 0.234, P = 0.002) and SD-LDLC (standardized β, 0.201, P = 0.009) emerged as independent determinants of maximum IMT. These three variables explained 15% of variability of maximum IMT. The associations were independently of mean LDLC levels, BMI, waist circumference, duration and treatment of diabetes, means and SDs of systolic BP, and glycemic and other lipid variables, and uses of hypolipidemic and anti-hypertensive medications. Results did not change when mean IMT was used as a dependent variable instead of maximum IMT .\n\n【17】###### Multiple Stepwise Linear Regression Analysis for Maximum Carotid Intima-Media Thickness as a Dependent Variable\n\n【18】  Independent variables   Standardized β   Cumulative R^2^   P values\n  ----------------------- ---------------- ----------------- ----------\n  Sex                     0.355            0.083             \\< 0.001\n  Age                     0.234            0.117             0.002\n  SD-LDLC                 0.201            0.151             0.009\n\n【19】Other independent variables included mean LDLC, BMI, waist circumference, duration and treatment of diabetes, means and SDs of systolic blood pressure, glycemic and other lipid variables, and uses of hypolipidemic and anti-hypertensive medications.\n\n【20】In order to confirm association between maximum IMT and SD-LDLC, patients were grouped according to quartiles of SD-LDLC (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The association between the two was not linear. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, maximum carotid IMT was greater in patients with the top quartile compared to the other three quartiles combined after adjustment for age and sex. Patients with the top SD-LDLC quartile were characterized by higher prevalence of lipid-lowering medications and higher CV-HbA1c, although mean HbA1c did not differ (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). They also had higher fasting and post-meal TG, whereas there was no difference in HDLC. Urinary ACR was elevated and leukocyte count tended to be elevated in patients with the top as compared to the other three quartile groups combined.\n\n【21】###### Characteristics of Type 2 Diabetic Patients With the Highest Compared to Other Three Quartiles of SD-LDLC Combined\n\n【22】                                        Quartiles of SD-LDLC   P values             \n  ------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------------------- -------\n  Male sex (n, %)                       69 通用删除7(英):<u>(57)</u>                20 通用删除7(英):<u>(50)</u>              0.47\n  Age (years)                           63 ± 10                60 ± 11              0.15\n  Smokers (n, %)                        39 通用删除7(英):<u>(32)</u>                14 通用删除7(英):<u>(35)</u>              0.75\n  BMI (kg/m^2^)                         24.1 ± 3.7             24.6 ± 3.8           0.49\n  Waist circumference (cm)              86.2 ± 8.4             89.4 ± 13.6          0.08\n  Duration of diabetes (years)          9.4 ± 7.1              10.5 ± 7.8           0.40\n  Treatment of diabetes                                                             \n    Diet/OHA/insulin (n, %)             41/58/23 (34/48/19)    12/23/5 (30/58/13)   0.49\n  Users of CCB/RASi/diuretics (n, %)    46/53/6 (38/43/5)      10/15/1 (25/38/3)    0.32\n  Users of hypolipidemic drugs (n, %)   38 通用删除7(英):<u>(31)</u>                23 通用删除7(英):<u>(58)</u>              0.003\n  HbA1c (%)                             7.0 ± 0.9              7.0 ± 0.8            0.94\n  Fasting PG (mg/dL)                    125 ± 22               126 ± 24             0.79\n  Post-breakfast PG (mg/dL)             157 ± 49               142 ± 46             0.11\n  CV-HbA1c (%)                          5.9 ± 5.2              9.1 ± 6.7            0.002\n  Total cholesterol (mg/dL)             185 ± 21               197 ± 20             0.003\n  LDLC (mg/dL)                          109 ± 22               121 ± 21             0.002\n  SD-LDLC (mg/dL)                       11 ± 4                 30 ± 8               0.000\n  HDLC (mg/dL)                          56 ± 16                54 ± 14              0.47\n  Fasting TG (mg/dL)                    109 ± 49               132 ± 52             0.01\n  Post-breakfast TG (mg/dL)             140 ± 61               164 ± 65             0.05\n  Serum creatinine (mg/dL)              0.8 ± 0.2              0.7 ± 0.2            0.34\n  eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2^)               75 ± 16                79 ± 18              0.10\n  Uric acid (mg/dL)                     5.2 ± 1.4              5.2 ± 1.0            0.85\n  Systolic BP (mm Hg)                   128 ± 12               129 ± 11             0.50\n  SD-systolic BP (mm Hg)                10.3 ± 3.0             10.2 ± 3.0           0.78\n  Diastolic BP (mm Hg)                  72 ± 7                 74 ± 6               0.15\n  Urinary ACR (mg/g)                    47 ± 128               203 ± 608            0.01\n  Log ACR                               1.3 ± 0.5              1.4 ± 0.7            0.10\n  Leucocyte count (10^3^/μL)            5.7 ± 1.4              6.2 ± 1.6            0.06\n  Maximum IMT (mm)                      1.03 ± 0.27            1.10 ± 0.39          0.17\n  Mean IMT (mm)                         0.83 ± 0.18            0.85 ± 0.19          0.49\n  ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (n, %)                  37 通用删除7(英):<u>(30)</u>                16 通用删除7(英):<u>(40)</u>              0.26\n\n【23】Mean ± SD or n, %.

SD-LDLC: standard deviation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; OHA: oral hypoglycemic agents; CCB: calcium channel blockers; RASi: renin-angiotensin system inhibitors; PG: plasma glucose; CV: coefficient of variation; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; BP: blood pressure; ACR: albumin/creatinine ratio; IMT: intima-media thickness.\n\n【29】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#s4}</u>\n==========\n\n【30】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a relationship between visit-to-visit LDLC variability and a marker of early atherosclerosis, carotid IMT. The results of this study indicate that visit-to-visit LDLC variability is a predictor of early atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes patients who had relatively good glycemic, lipid and BP control. It was independent of mean HDLC and LDLC levels, BMI, waist circumference, duration and treatment of diabetes, means and SDs of systolic BP, glycemic and other lipid variables, and uses of statin and anti-hypertensive medications. The present study confirms independent roles of age and male sex on carotid IMT \\[\\].\n\n【31】Variability in glycemia and systolic BP has been recognized as independent risk factors for macrovascular and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus \\[\\]. We have shown a direct association between CV-HbA1c variability and kidney function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus \\[\\]. Recently, visit-to-visit variability in LDLC has been shown to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease on statin treatment \\[, \\]. In the present study, we measured carotid IMT, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, and variability in HbA1c, systolic BP and LDLC levels in type 2 diabetes patients, 43% of whom were on hypolipidemic drugs. The results of the present study indicate an independent effect of visit-to-visit variability in LDLC on subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes, population at high risk for cardiovascular disease. This was independent of variability in HbA1c and systolic BP, and achieved LDLC levels, which suggests that a more uniform and less variable visit-to-visit LDLC may be important.\n\n【32】As with most biological systems, serum lipoprotein levels are dynamic, reflecting a complex homeostatic integration of cholesterol synthesis, intestinal absorption, hepatic clearance, and fecal excretion \\[\\]. The dose of statin and statin therapy itself may be associated with visit-to-visit LDLC variability in patients on statin \\[, \\]. In our analyses in type 2 diabetes patients, 57% of whom were not on hypolipidemic drugs, use of hypolipidemic drugs was an independent predictor of LDLC variability. Non-adherence to hypolipidemic drugs seems to be related to variability in LDLC \\[\\], although we did not examine adherence to drugs. We speculated that patients with higher variability in LDLC are those in whom the rest of their diabetes management might be suboptimal \\[\\]. This may be supported by independent association between visit-to-visit variations of HbA1c and LDLC in the present study.\n\n【33】Genetic polymorphisms in alleles that regulate the functions of LDL receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein E also may account for variability in LDLC \\[\\]. Very recently, Gordts et al \\[\\] have shown fasting TG levels to be affected through a mechanism that is dependent on LDLR and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) in mice. They showed that turnover of TG-rich lipoproteins was inhibited by apolipoprotein C-III not by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase activity but by primarily through a hepatic clearance mechanism mediated by the LDLR/LRP1 axis. These findings may support independent association between fasting TG and SD-LDLC in the present study. We have no explanation for associations of SD-LDLC with eGFR.\n\n【34】The mechanism linking increased LDLC variability to an early subclinical atherosclerosis, carotid IMT, is unknown. As suggested by Bangalore et al \\[\\], LDLC variability may be an epiphenomenon of other systemic conditions that increase cardiovascular risk. It is possible that patients with systemic conditions leading to generalized frailty might have higher variability of multiple biological parameters and increased risk caused by several pathologic mechanisms. In the present study, despite higher prevalence of lipid-lowering medications type 2 diabetes patients with the top SD-LDLC quartile had higher levels of LDLC, fasting and post-meal TG and visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, traditional, non-traditional and emerging cardiovascular disease risk factors, respectively. We speculate that suboptimal diabetes management might be a link between SD-LDLC and increased carotid IMT in the present study.\n\n【35】The strength of the current study is that we used a 1-year period when mean and SD of LDLC were calculated from six measurements in more than 90% of participants. In addition, BP control and variability and postprandial TG also have been taken into account. LDLC levels were measured in a fasting state and their variability was measured in real-world patients, not in patients from randomized trials \\[, \\]. Major limitations are that study participants were small in number and from a single clinic in Japan. However, the characteristics of our study participants are similar to those reported in a previous large-scale study in Japan \\[\\]. Another is that LDLC was calculated using fasting TG and HDLC. As in general fasting TG levels are elevated and HDLC levels are decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia may impact calculated LDLC levels. In our type 2 diabetes patients, however, effects of dyslipidemia were minimum because management of dyslipidemia was good: fasting TG and HDLC averaged 114 and 55 mg/dL, respectively.\n\n【36】Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#s4a}</u>\n-----------\n\n【37】Visit-to-visit LDLC variability was a predictor of early atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes patients who had relatively good glycemic, lipid and BP control. It was independent of mean HDLC and LDLC levels and known cardiovascular risk factors. Although yet to be confirmed in future studies, our results are important, given the increased variability in LDLC in recent clinical trials that used monoclonal antibodies to PCSK-9 with every 4 weeks dosing versus every 2 weeks dosing \\[\\] and with intermittent statin dosing strategies \\[\\], as suggested by Bangalore et al \\[\\].\n\n【38】The authors are indebted to all the participants for their dedicated and conscientious collaboration.

The stress is regarded as the sum of an elastic stress (sigma el) which is a function of r, and a viscous stress (sigma vis) which is a function of dr/dt. Thus sigma el = sigma - sigma vis.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Entering spaces delimited by walls, bars, doors, and finally people is not an easy task, which perhaps justifies the scarcity of studies addressing the oral health of the prison population in Brazil. However, given the increasingly pronounced inclusion of women in the prison environment, there is an increasing need for attention towards the oral health of this group since, neglecting the details of law, the penalties for drug trafficking and crimes against property, key drivers of female prison, vary from 1 to 15 years in prison, which is sufficient to rehabilitate or neglect the oral health of those resigned to the penalty of freedom deprivation \\[\\].\n\n【2】According to the latest data provided by the National Penitentiary Department, Brazil has approximately 31,500 women under the custody of the prison system, representing approximately 6.2% of the total Brazilian prison population \\[\\]. Although the scarcity of studies limits the knowledge about the oral health conditions of prisoners, international findings \\[--\\] have shown that prisoners, in general, exhibit unsatisfactory oral conditions, especially with regard to the large number of missing teeth and with untreated caries, justified by social exclusion and unemployment experienced prior to prison \\[\\], associated with irregular use of dental services and use of drugs \\[\\].\n\n【3】Studies aimed at caries experience in the general population have shown that females with low education and low income have greater propensity to dental loss \\[\\]. This scenario is consistent with the profile shown by Brazilian prisoners since the female prison population in the five regions of the country is predominantly composed of women with low educational level, poor, unemployed or underemployed before prison, under 30 years of age, and whose arrest was motivated by illicit trafficking of narcotics followed by crimes against property \\[\\].\n\n【4】Tooth loss, considered a mark of social and health inequities, results from the crippling dental practice, which due to the lower cost and greater \"efficiency\" remains among people of low socioeconomic level \\[\\] and consequently those collected in prison environments. Considered as a public health problem \\[\\], tooth loss can cause many problems, ranging from functional disorders such as difficulty in chewing and speaking to psychosocial problems, among which socialization difficulty stands out \\[\\].\n\n【5】Considering that data on the subject are still scarce in the Brazilian literature, this study aimed to evaluate tooth loss, use of and need for prosthetic rehabilitation, and use of dental services among inmates of the Regional Women\\'s Prison of Campina Grande, Brazil.\n\n【6】2. Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n========================\n\n【7】2.1. Study Population 删除19:<u>{#sec2.1}</u>\n---------------------\n\n【8】This study was conducted in the city of Campina Grande, inner state of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. The female prison population of the state is approximately 450 inmates, distributed into three prisons, designed for the imprisonment of women, located in the state capital, Joao Pessoa, and in the municipalities of Campina Grande and Patos.\n\n【9】This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Regional Women\\'s Prison of Campina Grande. All women who were incarcerated in June 2012 were selected, totaling 67 women. The sample, however, was composed of 65 women, since two of them refused to participate.\n\n【10】Mediated by a prisoner who for good behavior renders services in the prison, the other inmates were invited to participate in the study. Thus, at every shift, five inmates were escorted by prison officers to the room dedicated to the survey. The data collection instrument was adapted for the study population based on the 2010 National Oral Health Survey (SB Brazil) using criteria recommended by WHO to asses tooth decay experience \\[\\].\n\n【11】2.2. Training and Calibration Process 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2}</u>\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】Intraoral clinical examination was performed by a single examiner, properly calibrated (Kappa 0.92), aided by an annotator properly trained for this function, both wearing apron to meet general biosecurity standards. For the examination of tooth surfaces, disposable wooden spatulas, gauzes, mouth mirrors, and properly sterilized millimeter probes (Community Periodontal Index CPI) were used.\n\n【13】2.3. Nonclinical Data Collection and Dental Examinations 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Data were collected by interview and clinical examination. In the first part of the instrument, data regarding sociodemographic and sentencing profile of prisoners were collected, including variables age, educational level, labor activity prior to arrest, and jail time, as well as use of dental services, oral morbidity, and self-perceived and oral health impacts in the past six months. In the second part, aspects related to dental clinical examination were addressed, in which tooth decay experience and use of and need for prosthesis were assessed.\n\n【15】Although tooth loss assessment is very broad, this review sought to evaluate dental loss compared to DMFT and its other components, decayed and filled teeth in the four age groups, obtained by age quartile of female prisoners. For the bivariate analysis, tooth loss was dichotomized by the medians (≤8, \\>8), which were considered dependent variables: toothache for the last six months, oral health satisfaction, self-perceived need for dental treatment, and dental prosthesis and oral health impact in the last six months, whose variables are uncomfortable teeth brushing, difficulty and embarrassment while talking and smiling, difficulty performing routine activities, and difficulty in sleeping.\n\n【16】Use of dental prosthesis was considered as any prosthetic piece installed for prosthetic rehabilitation of existing spaces. The need for prosthesis was based on the presence of prosthetic spaces without rehabilitation or possibly left after performing teeth extractions and in the case of existing prostheses unsuitable for use. Prostheses presenting no aesthetics, retention, stability, and adequate fixation were deemed unsuitable for use \\[\\].\n\n【17】2.4. Data Analysis 删除19:<u>{#sec2.4}</u>\n------------------\n\n【18】Data were organized and analyzed with the aid of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), version 17, using descriptive statistics to obtain absolute and percentage distributions and analytical statistics for statistical calculations. To evaluate association between categorical variables, significance level of 5% (P \\< 0.05) and CI 95% were adopted. Pearson chi-square statistical tests or Fisher\\'s exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests with comparisons were used.\n\n【19】2.5. Ethical Aspects 删除19:<u>{#sec2.5}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【20】This study followed ethical guidelines recommended by the Brazilian legislation and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Paraiba. All participants/guardians signed the informed consent form.\n\n【21】3. Results 删除19:<u>{#sec3}</u>\n==========\n\n【22】Analyzing the sociodemographic and sentencing profile, it was observed that the average age of inmates was 32.2 (±11.56) years, with a greater number of inmates within the age group of 19--24 years. As for schooling, most inmates (73.8%) failed to complete basic education. When asked about the performance of any labor activity prior to arrest, more than half (56.9%) answered affirmatively. The mean imprisonment period was 13.51 (±13.65) months, and most of inmates (52.4%) had been prisoners for a period equal to or less than 8 months (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【23】Regarding the use of dental services, only one prisoner reported that she had never been to an oral surgeon in her life. Of those who had, 71.9% had the last dental consultation less than one year ago, with half of the consultations being held in the prison service and with tooth extraction being the reason for the last visit for 40.6% of inmates (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【24】Tooth loss analysis revealed that only four inmates (6.1%) had no missing teeth. The majority of the sample (55.4%) had between one and ten missing teeth, 15.4% had 11--20 teeth lost, 12.4% had between 21 and 31 missing teeth, and seven prisoners (10.7%) were totally edentulous. The mean tooth loss was 11.26 (±10.38) teeth.\n\n【25】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> shows that tooth loss increased according to age, with the highest averages in the age groups from 31 to 38 years (13.00 ± 8.94) and greater than 39 years (22.63 ± 10.18), respectively. After tooth caries, tooth loss was the component that contributed most to the DMFT values in the age groups from 19 to 24 years and from 25 to 30 years. In the age group from 31 to 38 years and greater than 39 years, tooth loss was the component that contributed most to the DMFT values, followed by decayed and filled teeth, respectively. In the total group, tooth loss showed the highest average (11.26 ± 10.38), followed by decayed components (7.83 ± 5.01) and filled teeth (1.28 ± 2.58).\n\n【26】The results in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> showed significant association (P \\< 0.005) between tooth loss and oral health satisfaction, self-perceived need for dental prosthesis, pain when drinking hot and/or cold liquids, uncomfortable teeth brushing, difficulty in speaking, and difficulty in performing routine tasks.\n\n【27】Regarding the use of dental prosthesis, it was observed that 29.2% of inmates were using some type of prosthesis, all considered unsuitable for use. Of prostheses in use, 52.6% were partially removable, installed in the upper arch. Regarding the need for prostheses, 78.5% of inmates needed prosthetic rehabilitation. Many of them needed partial rehabilitation of upper and lower teeth (62.7%), followed by complete rehabilitation of upper and lower teeth (13.7%) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【28】4. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec4}</u>\n=============\n\n【29】Until the moment, this is the first study in Brazil that described the tooth loss, use of and need for prosthetic rehabilitation, and use of dental services among female inmates. Due to the growth of the female prison population found in virtually all states of Brazil \\[\\] and the poor oral health of prisoners \\[\\], there is need to understand what are the main dental needs of this group to serve as base to the reflection on the topic and to encourage the development of new studies aiming to contribute to the formulation and improvement of dental care policies in the prison environment, thus collaborating with a higher quality of life and health and consequently with the social reintegration of women coming from the penitentiary system.\n\n【30】It is interesting to observe how the relationship between tooth loss and prison environment ends up, in most cases, by referring to the same group of individuals, that is, those from the social groups marked by lack of opportunity and social protection. In this perspective and analyzing the profile of prisoners under study, it is observed that as in all states of Brazil \\[\\], young women with low educational level, who prior to prison were unemployed or badly paid, are those who agglomerate in women\\'s prisons.\n\n【31】Individuals with lower income and educational level show a trend of irregular use of dental services, which consequently express an unfavorable reality of their oral condition resulting from the difficult access to information and to effectively resolve dental services \\[\\]. In this sense, it was observed that low education interferes with many aspects since, in addition to preventing activities that provide higher incomes and consequently the access to private services, this predisposes individuals to lower health conditions, leading to attitudes and behaviors that result in poorer oral health.\n\n【32】Evaluating the average jail time, it was concluded that possibly tooth loss cases in this group of prisoners are a result of lack of oral health care prior to arrest, since such a large amount of tooth loss in a short jail time period is not justified without previous neglect. However, there is a limit on the certification of this understanding: first, because it is a cross-sectional study; second, due to the absence of dental records of treatments performed during the jail time, which prevents the comparison between the oral health condition upon entry into prison and the period of data collection.\n\n【33】Regarding the aspect use of dental services, it was observed that most of the inmates visited the dentist in the last year; however, a considerable number of consultations were to perform tooth extraction. However, although extracted dental elements showed no pain symptoms on the day of the last visit, many of the inmates reported history of pain at an earlier time, which motivated extractions precisely to avoid recurrence of pain, since emergency dental visits in this prison unit are not always readily resolved, notably due to the lack of dental office installed in the penitentiary.\n\n【34】According to the National Health Plan in the Prison System in Brazil, prison units with less than 100 inmates should refer their prisoners to prisons provided with health units in their facilities \\[\\]. It is the case of the Women\\'s Prison of Campina Grande, whose inmates receive dental care in male penitentiaries located in the same prison complex. Thus, some limitations can be found in the provision of dental services to these women, because this service requires correctional officers to perform escort and transportation, which availability sometimes is limited.\n\n【35】In this regard, it is understood that the limited access to preventive and treatment measures resulting from the lack of dental care planning ends up by resulting in mutilating treatments because it is the only technically possible procedure regarding the disease severity, relief of pain, and lack of access to other types of treatment \\[\\]. However, one should consider that the decision to rehabilitate or not a tooth element is also related to other aspects such as the self-perceived importance of maintaining tooth elements, which is closely linked to cultural factors and access to information, as well as to past experiences with ineffective rehabilitation treatments \\[\\]. Therefore, health promotion activities inside prisons should be encouraged, seeking to clarify and encourage the preservation of teeth as well as the effective access and referral to specialized centers for cases previously requiring more complex assistance.\n\n【36】Evaluating tooth loss as a result of a treatment option, that is, tooth extraction, it appears that the average number of missing teeth among prisoners of Campina Grande was well above the average number of filled teeth in all age groups. Study with 500 prisoners from a prison in the United States found higher average number of missing teeth in relation to filled teeth only in the age group over 30 years \\[\\], although this difference does not seem to be higher than that found in this study. In this sense, there is questioning about the actual effectiveness of measures proposed by the National Health Plan in the Prison System, which is to provide dental service based on primary care and focused on measures to promote and protect the health of prisoners.\n\n【37】Also in this respect, it is noteworthy that tooth loss is a nationwide concern because although there has been a drop in the number of missing teeth and an increase in the number of filled teeth, tooth loss still remains the most responsible for the high DMFT values in the age groups from 35 to 44 and from 65 to 74 years, as can be seen in the results of nationwide oral health survey conducted in 2010 \\[\\]. Although an immediate comparison of findings obtained in this study with data from the Brazilian population is not possible due to the incompatibility of age groups, it should be noted that this reality extends the inmates of the Women\\'s Prison of Campina Grande, since, among the DMFT components, tooth loss showed the highest average in the age group over 30 years.\n\n【38】Regarding tooth loss, it was observed that the number of present teeth directly affects the quality of life of individuals, which can be observed among women in this study, in which those with more than eight missing teeth were less satisfied with their oral health and showed more difficulty in speaking, uncomfortable teeth brushing, and difficulty in performing routine activities. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the problems arising from the lack of teeth can include not only functional limitation but also the aesthetic appearance, showing a poorer socioeconomic condition, which may have an important influence on employment, social and cultural relationships, and the self-esteem of people \\[\\].\n\n【39】However, this reality needs to be changed, since according to the contemporary definitions of health, oral health presents other perspectives, which are understood as a comfortable and functional dentition, with an appearance that allows individuals to fulfill their social function and daily activities without physical, psychological, or social disorders. Therefore, it should be understood that the oral health rehabilitation of individuals deprived of freedom can play a key role in social reintegration.\n\n【40】Regarding tooth loss rehabilitation, it was found that although a large number of prisoners perceived and needed prosthetic rehabilitation, only a small portion of this group made use of prostheses, all unsuitable for use. However, this is a very common reality among economically disadvantaged individuals that, given the impossibility of restoring tooth loss by the use of prostheses mainly due to lack of financial resources and access to dental services, ends up by not using them or by using them for a time that extends far beyond the recommended period for due replacement \\[\\].\n\n【41】Although the implementation of the Oral Health Policy in Brazil has considerably improved the access to dental care services, there is still a large portion of the population marked by mutilating procedures and without access to prosthetic rehabilitation. However, although public health services still remain to be desired, it is necessary to emphasize that, for the prison population, dental care service should be guaranteed and focused on truly effective preventive and rehabilitative measures, due to both the existence of a Penitentiary Health Insurance, which includes dental care, and the limiting access to health services outside prison, as individuals in custody are resigned to the power of the state and prison authorities.\n\n【42】5. Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec5}</u>\n=============\n\n【43】The oral health status of the population studied was found to be poor and inmates showed considerable amounts of tooth loss and need for dentures, in which tooth extraction was the most important reason for seeking dental care. Given this context, there is need for better organization of the prison system in order to improve dental services and allow greater resolution and efficiency of the dental assistance aimed at this population. Therefore, there is need for the implementation of actions intended to inform and promote oral health and prevent further tooth loss and prosthetic rehabilitation in order to restore the oral health of these women and thus to contribute to their social reintegration.\n\n【44】The authors would like to thank all the women who participated in the study and local authorities.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of esophageal acid control on the symptoms of reflux disease, healing of erosive esophagitis, change in length of Barrett's epithelium, and the appearance of squamous islands. Thirteen of 27 patients on 60 mg lansoprazole underwent ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring while on therapy. Symptoms were recorded, and the length of Barrett's epithelium was measured, photographed, and biopsied every 6 months over an average of 5.7 yr. Eight of 13 patients had a normal 24 h pH (group I, mean pH < 4, 0.8%), five patients had abnormal results (group II, mean pH < 4, 10.6%). Symptoms improved in all patients, and there was complete healing of erosive esophagitis in all patients. An increase in the number of squamous islands was noted in 62.5% of patients in group I and in 80% of patients in group II. The mean length of Barrett's epithelium at baseline and study completion in group I was 5.6 and 5.0 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0.6 cm), and for group II was 4.2 and 4.2 cm, respectively (mean decrease, 0 cm). There was no significant difference in the change in length between the two groups (p = 0.494). Although symptoms improved, erosive esophagitis healed, and squamous islands increased, there was no significant decrease in the length of Barrett's esophagus.

Because of its almost invariable lethal prognosis, termination of pregnancy is commonplace when this condition is diagnosed before viability. In this report we describe eight cases of iniencephaly prenatally diagnosed by ultrasound between 18 and 28 weeks of gestation and discuss the subsequent obstetric management in a country where elective abortion is illegal. Prenatal karyotyping was performed in seven cases, revealing a normal complement in all fetuses. One pregnancy miscarried at 24 weeks. Uneventful vaginal delivery was accomplished in six of the remaining seven cases, one delivered spontaneously at 29 weeks and five were induced between 28-32 weeks due to increasing polyhydramnios. In the remaining case the pregnancy progressed to 35 weeks, at which time spontaneous labour began and an emergency Caesarean section was performed because of malpresentation. There were no survivors in this series. We conclude that, in countries were elective abortion is not allowed, women carrying an iniencephalic fetus may benefit from preterm induction of labour in order to avoid labour dystocia, maternal trauma during delivery and the risks of a Caesarean section.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In persons with type 2 diabetes, protein ingestion results in little or no increase in plasma glucose concentrations but a stimulation of insulin and glucagon secretion. Furthermore, when protein is ingested with glucose, a synergistic effect on insulin secretion is observed. The most potent protein is gelatin, which consists of 30% glycine residues. The objective of the present study was to determine whether glycine per se stimulates insulin secretion or reduces the glucose response when ingested with glucose. Nine healthy subjects were tested on 4 separate occasions. Plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, and glycine concentrations were measured at various times during a 2-h period after the ingestion of 1 mmol glycine/kg lean body mass, 25 g glucose, 1 mmol glycine/kg lean body mass + 25 g glucose, or water only, given in random order. Plasma concentrations of glycine and glucagon were elevated after the ingestion of glycine, as expected. The serum insulin concentration also was slightly elevated after the ingestion of glycine alone. When glycine was ingested with glucose, the plasma glucose area response was attenuated by > 50% compared with the response after the ingestion of glucose alone. The dynamics of the insulin response after the ingestion of glycine plus glucose were modestly different from those after the ingestion of glucose alone, but the area response was not significantly different. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that oral glycine stimulates the secretion of a gut hormone that potentiates the effect of insulin on glucose removal from the circulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The objective of this review was to assess the merits or adverse effects of the use of manual fetal manipulation in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2013). All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials assessing the use of fetal manipulation versus mock stimulation, no stimulation or other types of stimulation, used in conjunction with cardiotocography or other tests of fetal wellbeing. Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We contacted authors of published and unpublished trials for further information. We included four trials with a total of 1280 women with 2670 episodes of participation.

A severe model of mesenteric ischemia and reperfusion was produced by subjecting mice to 45 min occlusion followed by reperfusion of the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk. In this experimental protocol, wild-type mice treated with GW274150 (5 mg/kg i.p.), a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of iNOS activity, and mice lacking of the gene for iNOS (iNOS 'knock-out', iNOS-KO) exhibited no difference in the rate of mortality in comparison with wild-type control mice.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Drought and soil erosion are two environmental problems on loess hillslopes. Runoff, which forms when the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil, is the direct cause of slope erosion by detaching and transporting displaced soil particles while flowing across the soil surface. Crust formation at the surface of cultivated soils exposed to the impact of raindrops is a common phenomenon, which is formed by the combined effect of physical disintegration of soil aggregates on the surface by the impact energy of raindrops and physicochemical dispersion of soil clays. It can disperse cultivated soils aggregates into micro-aggregates, reduce infiltration rate and increase runoff and erosion \\[,\\], which causes negative effects on the survival and growth of plants in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, improving soil physical characteristics and reducing runoff by increasing rainfall infiltration can be considered a vital measurement for controlling water and soil loss.\n\n【2】Some studies indicate that soil amendments such as gypsum and polymers can improve the stability of soil structure by electrostatic absorption of polymer molecules on the clay particles \\[\\], thereby preventing crust formation, increasing infiltration and reducing surface runoff as well as soil erosion \\[\\]. The application of various synthetic polymers and surfactants has been reported in the technical literatures. Botha et al. \\[\\] investigated the influence of polymer PVA on the liquid--solid contact angles of a fine sandy soil. Pini and Vigna \\[\\] found the formation of soil micro-aggregates by using two uncharged polymers, PVA and detrans, to study the interaction of water soluble stabilizing agents with soil particles. Floyd \\[\\] studied PVAc emulsion as a soil conditioner. Three types of polyurethane were used in soil stabilization to improve the erosion resistance \\[\\], and the result indicated that the polyurethanes improved both strength and erosion resistance significantly.\n\n【3】Among these soil conditioners, polyacrylamide (PAM) was widely used and was a particularly effective polymer in improving soil aggregation, increasing water infiltration and preventing erosion \\[\\]. About 400,000 ha of agricultural land has been treated each year with PAM in the USA \\[\\]. Many researchers have indicated that the application of anionic polymer could significantly improve soil physical properties, namely increasing water-stable aggregates, reducing tensile strength, bulk density, surface compaction and clay dispersion, and delaying runoff formation and decreasing erosion and runoff \\[,\\]. However, Yu et al. \\[\\] found that spreading granular PAM alone was only beneficial for reducing erosion but not for maintaining high infiltration rate (IR), and only the addition of gypsum with granular PAM was effective for increasing infiltration rate through simulated rain. Other researches also showed lower rates of PAM application decreased runoff while the higher rates increased runoff \\[\\]. The effect of PAM was influenced by the clay content of soil. Increasing the clay content of soil improved the effect of PAM treatments, and negative impact on some coarser texture soils may exist \\[\\]. Vacher et al. \\[\\] found that application of PAM on the soil surface on steep slopes did not reduce runoff significantly, but application of polyacrylamide with gypsum was effective for runoff reduction.\n\n【4】Previous studies indicate that soil amendments are a promising way to improve soil physical properties and reduce soil erosion. However, the effect of soil amendments depends on its physiochemical properties, the mode of application and its quantity which also varies from time and soils. Tang et al. \\[\\] showed that the negative effects of soil amendments were observed on barren or salty soils, and the application rate, either low or high contents of soil amendments, hardly improved soil properties and reduced soil erosion. Other researchers also treated the soil with different integrated chemicals to obtain better results. For example, in order to find better polymers, Wu et al. \\[\\] applied polypropylene acid (PPA), polythene alcoholic (PTA) and urea-formaldehyde poly-condensate (UR) to China's loess areas through indoor laboratory experiments and outdoor artificial rainfall simulations. The results indicated that the amendment applications could decrease the erosive forces of raindrops, increase the water-stable soil aggregates contents, reduce surface crusting and improve rainfall infiltration. Additionally, in order to pursue better polymers, Liu et al. \\[\\] studied the effect of new polymer NPD on sheet erosion of experimental loess slopes through simulated rainfall. The results indicated that NPD effectively delayed the onset, reduced volume and sediment content of the runoff by significantly increasing the shear strength and the content of large aggregates from soil surface. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and effective macromolecular polymers to regulate rainfall infiltration in order to reduce surface runoff and soil loss. Jag S and Jag C162 are two new natural polymer derivatives in our research, as SOLVAY polymers that are extracted from bean embryos. These are green chemicals showing no irritation and no known adverse effects on aquatic species on which they were tested.\n\n【5】The objectives of this research were to: (i) determine the effects of Jag S and Jag C162, two new natural polymer derivatives, at different rates on soil loss and rainfall infiltration; (ii) reveal the mechanisms responsible for their effects by analyzing the proportions of water-stable soil aggregates of different sizes and shear strength after Jag S and Jag C162 were spread under simulated rainfall on experimental loess hillslope.\n\n【6】2. Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec2-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n========================\n\n【7】2.1. Soil and Polymers 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot1-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n----------------------\n\n【8】The soil samples for testing were collected from Ansai County of the Loess Plateau (a typical region with hills and gullies). Ansai (109°19' E, 36°51' N) located in northern Shaanxi Province has a mean annual temperature of 8.8 °C and an annual precipitation of 500 mm. The soil was a silt loam (USDA) collected from the farming layer with a depth about 25 cm. The contents of organic matter, clay, silt and sand were 0.5%, 8.7%, 54.7% and 36.6% respectively. The d~50~ was 0.037 mm. The soil was air dried, crushed, well mixed and then passed through a 10-mm sieve to remove weeds and stones. The polymeric compounds tested were natural polymer derivatives, neutral polysaccharide (Jag S) and cationic hydroxypropyl polysaccharide (Jag C162), as SOLVAY polymers that are extracted from bean embryos, and both are easy to dissolve in water. Jag S and Jag C162 are both polysaccharide; however, Jag S is neutral, and Jag C162 consists of cationic hydroxypropyl and polysaccharide, respectively. In addition, lab studies showed that they were green chemicals that have shown no irritating or adverse effects on aquatic species, and were harmless to humans and can be used for preparations of personal care formulations.\n\n【9】2.2. Experiments 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n----------------\n\n【10】Experiments were conducted in the Simulated Rainfall Hall of the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau at the Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (Chinese Academy of Science and Ministry of Water Resources in China). A rainfall simulator system with a side-sprinkler was used to apply simulated rainfall. This rainfall simulator can be set to rainfall intensity ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 mm/min, by adjusting water pressure and nozzle sizes. The fall height of raindrop from the top to soil slope surface is 16 m. The uniformity of simulated rainfall is higher than 80%. The kinetic energy of raindrop to strike soil slope surface at rainfall intensities from 1 to 2 mm/min is about from 365 to 847 J/h·m^2^, and the diameters of raindrops range from about 0.25 to 0.375 mm.\n\n【11】Experimental plots were constructed with metal frames of 1.2 m (length) × 0.4 m (width) × 0.25 m (depth), with adjustable slope gradients by a movable base. A metal outlet at the lower end allowed the collection of runoff samples. In the bottom of the plots, natural sand to a depth of 5 cm and overlaid with permeable gauze was used to drain the infiltration water. The soil was packed to a depth of 20 cm in four 5-cm layers at a bulk density of 1.2 g/cm^3^ (measured by a cutting ring in a compacted state). Before packing, the water content of the soil was adjusted to 14%, the typical level during the flood season on the Loess Plateau when most erosion occurs. After the soil was packed, Jag S and Jag C162 solutions of 1, 3 and 5 g/m^2^ were prepared in 2 L of water to produce final rates of 0.024%, 0.072% and 0.12%, respectively. These solutions were uniformly sprayed on the surfaces of the plots and the control plot was sprayed with equal water (2 L). The simulated rainfall experiments began approximately 15 h later. Four rates (0, 1, 3, and 5 g/m^2^), three rainfall intensities (1, 1.5, and 2 mm/min), and a slope gradient of 15°, which was setup based on the middle slope of cultivated land ranging mainly from 5° to 25° in the Loess Plateau, were tested with two replicates. The duration of all simulated rainfall events was 40 min.\n\n【12】2.3. Measurements 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot3-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n-----------------\n\n【13】For each treatment, runoff samples were collected 1 and 3 min after the onset of runoff and then every 3 min until the end of the experiment. The runoff volumes were measured with a graduated cylinder \\[\\], and the sediments were dried at 105 °C for 10 h and weighed to estimate the soil erosion rate by calculating the sediment weight per unit area per unit time and amount of rainfall infiltration by the principle of water balance, while the rainfall infiltration rate was defined as infiltration amount per unit time. The cumulative infiltration (mm) was defined as the sum of the infiltration rate (mm/min) multiplied by time in all the time during rainfall process, and the cumulative erosion modulus (kg/m^2^) was defined as the sum of the erosion rate (kg/m^2^·min) multiplied by time in all the time during rainfall process. Aggregate size distribution on the surface (0--1 cm) were measured by wet sieving \\[\\] after rainfall in the classes of \\>5, 2--5, 1--2, 0.5--1, 0.25--0.5 and \\<0.25 mm. Each class of aggregates was dried and weighed. Three samples were measured for each treatment and averaged. After each simulated rainfall, six measurements of the shear strength of the soil surface were also taken using a 14.10 Pocket Vane Tester (Eijkelkamp, Giesbeek, The Netherlands). Because shear strength is closely related to water content, we measured the water content continuously after each simulated rainfall. Soil water content was measured by alcohol burning method \\[\\], and three samples were taken from surface 1 cm soil. The final shear strength was measured when the water content dropped to 22--25% after air drying. All data were analyzed using SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) by one-way ANOVA and least significant difference (LSD) tests. The significant level was 0.05.\n\n【14】3. Results 删除19:<u>{#sec3-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n==========\n\n【15】3.1. Effects of Jag S and Jag C162 on Soil Physical Properties 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot1-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】### 3.1.1. Effects on \\>0.25 mm Water-Stable Aggregates 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot1dot1-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n\n【17】Coote et al. \\[\\] suggested soil shear strength and aggregate stability as erosion indicators. Soil aggregates and shear strength of the topsoil are two important factors in soil erosion, so we used shear strength and the contents of water-stable aggregates \\>0.25 mm as the main evaluation criteria and indicators of soil structure. Soil characteristics play a dominant role in erosion as erodibility indexes. In addition to erosion forces (e.g. rainfall and wind), topography (e.g. slope, slope length, slope shape, and slope section), and surface conditions (roughness and covering), the ability of soil to resist the dispersion of rainwater and runoff is closely associated with soil erosion.\n\n【18】The effect of application rates of Jag S and Jag C162 (0, 1, 3 and 5 g/m^2^) on \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregate content is presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. After applying Jag S and Jag C162 to the soil surface, the amended soil had a significantly higher content of \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregates than the control sample. The percent mass of \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregates of the untreated soil was only 9%, while the percentage increased to 50.85%, 60.19% and 70.41% in the three treatments of Jag S and 51.82%, 62.52% and 73.23% for Jag C162, respectively. Additionally, under the same application rates, the content of \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregates after spraying Jag C162 was higher than that of spraying Jag S by 0.97%, 2.33%, 2.82%, respectively. This indicates that Jag S and Jag C162 both effectively promoted the aggregation of small particles into larger particles, and the positive effects of Jag C162 on the \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregates are better.\n\n【19】In addition to the total content of \\>0.25 mm soil water-stable aggregates, the improvement of soil water-stable aggregates in different sizes was similar (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), which increased by 0.26--24.9% significantly with the application of Jag S and Jag C162 compared with the control. The percentage mass of \\>5 mm, 2--5 mm, 1--2 mm soil water-stable aggregates with the application of Jag S and Jag C162 at three rates was higher than those of Jag S. The improvement of the soil water-stable aggregates in the 0.25--0.5 mm, 0.5--1 mm and 1--2 mm classes was significant, especially at rates of 3 and 5 g/m^2^, and the effect of Jag C162 treatments on the \\>1 mm soil water-stable aggregates was better than that of the Jag S treatments under the three rates. The results indicated that the new natural polymer derivatives Jag S and Jag C162 significantly promoted aggregate formations, and effectively facilitated the aggregation of small particles into larger particles because of the binding capacity of the polymers, which prevented the rainfall impacts and runoff from detaching the soil particles, in the same way as polyacrylamide \\[\\].\n\n【20】### 3.1.2. Effects on Shear Strength 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot1dot2-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n\n【21】Soil shear strength refers to the ability or capability of a particular soil in a particular condition to resist or endure an applied force \\[\\], which is another important factor for comprehensive abilities of controlling water erosion. The effects of Jag S and Jag C162 on soil shear strength are presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【22】Obviously, the application of Jag S and Jag C162 was effective in producing higher soil shear strength compared with the control at the three rates, and higher rates produced better improvement in soil shear strength. However, the effect of Jag S application was lower in improving the soil shear strength than that of Jag C162 application under the same conditions. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> indicated that after 40 min of rain, the average soil shear strength at 1 g/m^2^ Jag S and Jag C162 increased by 92.9% and 173.3%; by 171.5% and 232.9% at 3 g/m^2^ and reached up to 241.7% and 305.4% at 5 g/m^2^, respectively. It is evident that the shear strength of soil treated with Jag C162 was 61.4--80.4% higher than that of Jag S treatments. This shows that Jag S and Jag C162 had an obvious effect of enhancing the stability of soil particles and resisting the damage from rainfall and runoff to reduce soil erosion effectively.\n\n【23】3.2. Effects on Soil Erosion Process 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot2-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n------------------------------------\n\n【24】### 3.2.1. Effects on Rainfall Infiltration 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot2dot1-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n\n【25】Changes in cumulative infiltration on an experimental loess hillslope with rainfall time for Jag S and Jag C162 applications at 1, 3 and 5 g/m^2^ under rainfall intensities of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm/min are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, respectively.\n\n【26】The cumulative infiltration increased linearly with the increase of rainfall time and intensity for all experiments, and compared with the control, the application of Jag S and Jag C162 improved the rainfall infiltration effectively, but the most effective rate of application varied with kinds and rates of the polymers. The infiltration rate decreased with increasing Jag S rate under the same rainfall intensity. After 40 min of rain, the cumulative infiltration remained relatively high when Jag S was applied, except that at the treatment rate of 5 g/m^2^ under 1.0 mm/min. Jag C162 also significantly improved rainfall infiltration, and higher rates of Jag C162 correlated with better cumulative infiltration under the same conditions. It is suggested that a moderate rate (1--3 g/m^2^) of Jag S treatment was more effective to prevent crust formation and promote aggregation on the surface to facilitate infiltration. This shows that it is very important to identify the effective threshold of the rates and choose the appropriate polymer to improve soil properties.\n\n【27】The final IR in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> highlighted a quantitative comparison among the effects of the different treatments on soil susceptibility to crust formation. Applying either of the two polymers (Jag S and Jag C162) to the soil had a significant effect on the final IR at different rainfall intensities (1, 1.5 and 2 mm/min) on experimental loess hillslope. In the control treatment, the soil generated the lowest final IR (0.65, 0.73, and 0.59 mm/min) and the largest runoff amounts because of crust formation. However, spraying Jag S and Jag C162 on the soil surface increased the final IR by as much as one to two times, with values ranging from 0.70 to 1.51 mm/min compared with untreated samples. Under the Jag S treatment, the final IR decreased with increasing Jag S application rates, whereas the final IR increased as the amount of Jag C162 increased, because compared with Jag C162, Jag S is not as soluble, and a higher rate caused a more viscous solution resulted in blocking the soil porosity and reducing the final IR after spraying Jag S into the soil. Besides, spraying Jag C162 resulted, in most cases, in significantly larger final IR values (0.85--1.51 mm/min) than those obtained when spraying Jag S, which indicated improvement of final IR by applying Jag C162 was better than an application of Jag S.\n\n【28】### 3.2.2. Effects on Sediment 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot2dot2-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n\n【29】Jag S and Jag C162 increased the stability of soil particles and resisted the damage from rainwater and runoff, so they could effectively reduce sediment yield. The erosion rates and reductions of erosion modulus are presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, respectively. Spraying Jag S and Jag C162 on the soil surface was effective in significantly reducing soil loss compared with the control. The erosion rates decreased with the increasing rates of both Jag S and Jag C162. The average reduction of cumulative erosion modulus at 1 g/m^2^ Jag S and Jag C162 was 23% and 34%, 49% and 43% at 3 g/m^2^ and reached up to 60% and 59% at 5 g/m^2^ under different rainfall intensities, respectively. Similar observations were reported in previous studies that also explored the effects of spraying granular PAM with gypsiferous material on loess soil \\[,\\]. However, the differences between the effects of Jag S and Jag C162 on erosion modulus were as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the reductions of erosion modulus decreased as the amount of Jag S increased, while conversely, the higher Jag C162 application rate was more effective in increasing the reduction of erosion modulus; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the effect of Jag C162 was significantly higher than that of Jag S under the same conditions. Thus, the results indicated that both Jag S and Jag C162 were able to reduce erosion modulus, and the polymer Jag C162 was more effective.\n\n【30】4. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec4-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n=============\n\n【31】Many researchers have shown that polymers significantly improve soil physical properties. The viscosity of polymers can improve soil structure and increase the stability of aggregates \\[\\]. Aggregates and their stability determine the sizes and stability of soil pores. Water-stable aggregates \\>0.25 mm can increase soil permeability and are an important indicator of anti-erosion \\[\\], but also indicate soil quality. High aggregate stability can maintain more appropriate pore spaces for permeability and can resist erosion better. Aly and Letey \\[\\] found that the effect of a polymer often depended on its capacity to facilitate flocculation, which prompted the polymer molecules to adhere on the surface of soil particles and act as a bonding agent, keeping soil particles together against the destructive impacts of water drops, and to diminish the destruction of the aggregates on the soil surface \\[\\].\n\n【32】Our data showed that Jag S and Jag C162 could improve soil physical properties with their applications. The polymer molecule serves as a bridge between two soil particles in an aggregate by bonding with particles \\[\\], so they can strengthen the interactions between soil particles and enhance the stability of aggregates. Thus, the aggregate size classes increased, more for large aggregates than for small aggregates, and the aggregation of small particles into larger particles was promoted, consistently with the findings by Xu et al. \\[\\]. They reported that both synthetic and natural polymers had highly significant effects on aggregate size classes, especially for aggregates \\>2.0 mm, and could increase the mass of macro-aggregates and decrease the mass of micro-aggregates. The properties of polymers and their application rates both influenced their efficacy in soil \\[\\]. Higher Jag S and Jag C162 rates increased more aggregates \\>0.25 mm and higher shear strength due to stronger adhesions. The soil shear strength can also serve as an indicator of soil resistance capacity during erosion \\[\\].\n\n【33】Infiltration and erosion are closely associated with soil properties. Increases in aggregate sizes can lead to the maintenance of appropriate spaces for infiltration, thereby decreasing surface runoff. Changes in aggregate size distribution and shear strength can lead to the stabilization of the soil surface against shear-induced detachment \\[\\], thereby decreasing erosion \\[\\]. The applications of Jag S and Jag C162 changed the aggregate size distribution and shear strength which can effectively reduce soil crust formation, limiting surface runoff and runoff-induced erosion, similarly to polyacrylamide \\[\\]. In this experiment, Jag S and Jag C162 were effective in improving soil shear strength and aggregates, thereby increasing rainfall infiltration and reducing soil loss on experimental loess hillslope. The effects were better as the rates increased.\n\n【34】Applying the two polymers (Jag S and Jag C162) to the soil had a significant effect on the infiltration and the final IR at different rainfall intensities (1, 1.5 and 2 mm/min) on an experimental loess hillslope. In the control treatment, the soils generated the smallest final IR (0.65, 0.73, and 0.59 mm/min) and the largest runoff amounts because of crust formation. However, spraying Jag S and Jag C162 on the soil surface increased the final IR by as much as one to two times, with values ranging from 0.70 to 1.51 mm/min compared with untreated soils.\n\n【35】However, the results also showed that the effects of Jag S on the soil physical properties and soil erosion were lower than those of Jag C162. One possible explanation was that the effect of the polymer in stabilizing soil aggregates could be related to the capability of the polymer to move into aggregates. High rates of Jag S micro-molecules were hard to diffuse into the soil because of low viscosity, which limited the movement of Jag S molecules into soil aggregates, and too high rates of Jag S could jam the soil porosity so that the interaction between soil particles and Jag S was not sufficient, resulting in delaying the formation of more soil aggregates. In addition, a crust would form easily to decrease rainfall infiltration when the aggregates on the surface were broken by raindrops. Thus, the effect of Jag S on the soil physical properties and soil erosion was lower.\n\n【36】Similar observations of improving rainfall infiltration and aggregates with the application of PAM were reported by Mamedov et al. \\[\\], who found that the application of PAM resulted in increasing rainfall infiltration and aggregate stability compared with the control. Macromolecular polymers such as PAM can improve soil physical conditions. The polymers bind the soil particles and prevent dispersion due to their cohesiveness, thereby forming aggregates. These aggregates resist the effects of raindrops and soil crusting or sealing, which results in greater rainfall infiltration. Schamp et al. \\[\\] explained that polymers could enhance the stability of aggregates via adhesion and adsorption. Shainberg and Levy \\[\\] revealed that increasing aggregates' stability could prevent soil crusting, and that polymer treatments could effectively decrease the formation of soil crusts by increasing aggregates' size distribution and improving aggregates stability \\[\\]. Compared with the control, the application of Jag S and Jag C162 significantly increased the mass proportions of different sizes of soil aggregates, especially for the \\>0.25 mm aggregates. In addition, Jag S and Jag C162 acted as binding agents that stabilized the soil aggregates, resisted soil crusting and increased infiltration; the result was consistent with previous studies (just like PAM) \\[\\].\n\n【37】5. Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec5-ijerph-15-00009}</u>\n==============\n\n【38】In conclusion, the above results indicated that polymers Jag S and Jag C 162 can effectively change the structure of the soil surface, maintain a high infiltration rate to limit runoff, reduce the detachment and transportation of soil particles and ultimately reduce erosion. Simultaneously, the resistance to erosion can be enhanced by increasing binding capacity between particles and by the higher mass percentage of water-stable aggregates. These results indicated that Jag S and Jag C 162 have broad potential applications for increasing rainfall infiltration and decreasing soil erosion by improving soil physical properties on loess slopes, and that the effect will be more effective when this technique is applied with traditional methods of soil and water conservation. However, we examined only a simple slope and three limited rates at three rainfall intensities, so the effects under more complicated conditions remain unknown. The improvement of rainfall infiltration thus requires more comprehensive studies and discussions. Further researches should be performed under different conditions, polymeric rates, soils and application modes. The effective thresholds and optimal doses of these macromolecular polymers should also be identified and quantified.\n\n【39】Financial support for this research was provided by National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2017YFC0504702);

In some cancer tissues, aberrant expression of various BMP signal components has been detected. Here, we describe the divergent roles of BMPs during the progression of cancer. BMPs exhibit various effects on both cancer cells and on tumor microenvironments. BMPs inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, with some exceptions. BMPs also induce the differentiation of certain cancer stem cells, and attenuate their aggressiveness. In parallel, BMPs play a critical role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and the metastasis of cancer cells. Some mouse xenograft models have revealed that cancer metastases are prevented by the inhibition of BMP signaling. Together, these findings imply that BMPs function as both suppressors and promoters of tumors in a context dependent manner.

Recently, three members of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (DEG/ENaC) family of sodium channel subunits, Ppk25, Ppk23, and Ppk29 (also known as Nope), have been shown to function in gustatory perception of courtship-modulating contact pheromones. All three proteins are required for the activation of male courtship by female pheromones. Specific interactions between two of them have been demonstrated in cultured cells, suggesting that, in a subset of cells where they are coexpressed, these three subunits function within a common heterotrimeric DEG/ENaC channel. Such a DEG/ENaC channel may be gated by pheromones, either directly or indirectly, or alternatively may control the excitability of pheromone-sensing cells. In addition, these studies identify taste neurons that respond specifically to courtship-modulating pheromones and mediate their effects on male behavior. Two types of pheromone-sensing taste neurons, F and M cells, have been defined on the basis of their specific response to either female or male pheromones.

In this study, a simple approach to fabricate electrospun poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) mats decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by combining electrospinning and calcination was presented. AuNPs were decorated on the fiber mat surface through electrostatic interactions between positively charged aminosilane groups and negatively charged AuNPs. The size and coverage density of AuNPs on the fiber mats could be tuned by varying the calcination temperature. Calcination of AuNPs-decorated PVP fibers at 500 °C-700 °C resulted in the uniform decoration of high density AuNPs with very narrow gaps on every single fiber, which in turn contribute to strong electromagnetic SERS enhancement.

{"seq_id": "16f4c1e1-c16e-4d57-9915-2c3ab1b45b2e", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】The Korean Society of Nephrology has maintained an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) registry since 1986. However, serum mineral data have only been collected since 2012. In 2013, there were 59,918 dialysis patients registered by the Korean Society of Nephrology (hemodialysis, 52,378; peritoneal dialysis, 7,540). Mean serum phosphorus levels were 4.94±1.63 and 5.05±1.56mg/dL in patients with hemodialysis (n=15,457) and peritoneal dialysis (n=880), respectively. Serum calcium concentrations were 8.87±0.89 and 8.74±0.91mg/dL in hemodialysis (n=15,450) and peritoneal dialysis (n=880), respectively. The mean values of calcium and phosphorus appear acceptable in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, but the standard deviations, especially of phosphorus, were quite large (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【2】The term \\'chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders\\' (CKD-MBD) is a new term that, in contrast to the old term \\'renal osteodystrophy\\', implies a systemic syndrome associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown that elevated serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as well as all-cause mortality. In order to improve outcomes in patients with CKD-MBD, many countries have developed clinical practice guidelines. Globally, the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines are the most commonly used, However, whether those global guidelines can be successfully implemented at the local level remains to be examined. As a regional guide, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) recently updated its clinical practice guidelines for the management of CKD-MBD.\n\n【3】Serum mineral targets in KDOQI and KDIGO guidelines\n===================================================\n\n【4】In CKD stages 5 and 5D, the KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommend that serum phosphorus be maintained at 3.5-5.5mg/dL. This target corresponds to a level slightly higher than the normal reference limit. The KDIGO通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> guidelines suggest lowering phosphorus levels toward the reference range in CKD stage 5D. Notably, both guidelines had low levels of evidence supporting this guideline.\n\n【5】According to Western textbooks, normal serum phosphorus ranges from 2.5 to 4.5mg/dL. In this study we sought to determine if these guidelines could be applied to Korean patients. Excluding those who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\<60mL/min/1.73m^2^ calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, we analyzed serum phosphorus concentrations from 6,131 adults (male 3,163; female 2,968) participating in a health check-up at our hospital in 2011. The mean age and eGFR were 45±11 years and 92±14 mL/min/1.73m^2^, respectively. The serum phosphorus distribution is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Based on the mean and standard deviation data, the normal serum phosphorus concentration in this patient population ranged from 2.4 to 4.5 mg/dL. This data indicates there are no differences in the normal levels of serum phosphorus between Korean and Western patients. In the United States, a high serum phosphorus concentration was associated with a low socioeconomic status irrespective of race.\n\n【6】The KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommend that serum corrected calcium be maintained at 8.4-9.5mg/dL in CKD stages 5 and 5D. This range corresponds to the lower end of the reference range. The KDIGO通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> guidelines suggested maintaining serum calcium levels in the reference range in CKD stages 3 - 5D. The Ca×P product was previously considered an important biomarker, and the KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommended Ca×P be \\<55mg^2^/dL^2^. However, individual serum calcium and phosphorus values are currently used as the primary determinants for target serum ranges.\n\n【7】Hemodialysis quality monitoring by HIRAS in Korea\n=================================================\n\n【8】In Korea, the national government or Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRAS) assesses hemodialysis quality on an annual basis. Every hemodialysis facility should test serum phosphorus and calcium monthly in all patients. From this data, the Ca×P product is calculated and evaluated as an outcome variable, and HIRAS requires the product to be below 55mg^2^/dL^2^, consistent with the KDOQI guidelines. The value of Ca×P product is currently an important criterion for the assessment of national health insurance coverage in Korea when calcium-free phosphate binders are prescribed.\n\n【9】Gaps between global guidelines and local practices for management of CKD-MBD\n============================================================================\n\n【10】A few years ago, serum mineral data were collected from 1,018 maintenance hemodialysis patients at 17 centers in Korea. When classified by the ranges recommended by the KDOQI guidelines, only about half of the patients were considered within the guideline range for serum Ca and P. Uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia and a Ca×P product greater than or equal to 55mg^2^/dL^2^ were noted in about 40% and 30% of patients, respectively. Approximately 30% of patients were within the guideline range for PTH, with a greater proportion of patients falling in the lower PTH range, revealing a gap between guidelines and practice.\n\n【11】Our data were similar to those from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS). Although there were some differences between countries, approximately half of the patients had uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia \\>5.5mg/dL. It is notable that almost every country showed that phosphorus tended to decrease slowly over the study period. On the other hand, PTH levels were steady throughout the 3 phases of DOPPS. About half of the patients appeared to have PTH levels within the target range .\n\n【12】A regional, but not global, guide from Japan\n============================================\n\n【13】Patients in different countries are affected by different medical and social circumstances. The Japanese CKD-MBD guidelines were updated last year and had an impact on the care of Korean dialysis patients. They proposed a simplified diagram illustrating what medications can be adjusted according to serum phosphorus and corrected calcium levels, in which the serum phosphorus target was 3.5 to 6.0mg/dL.\n\n【14】In the Japanese epidemiological data from hemodialysis patients, those with serum phosphorus near 5mg/dL, calcium near 9mg/dL, and PTH near 180 pg/mL showed the best survival rate. Based on these results, the Japanese guidelines suggest higher target levels of serum phosphorus (6mg/dL) and calcium(10mg/dL), respectively.\n\n【15】Gaps between guidelines\n=======================\n\n【16】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> summarizes the recommended serum phosphorus, corrected calcium, and PTH levels in patients undergoing dialysis according to different professional organizations. As shown in the table, differences exist among the international guidelines. Although KDIGO is updating CKD-MBD guidelines through Controversies Conferences , the serum mineral targets will not be changed until data from randomized controlled clinical trials supports such changes.\n\n【17】Many nephrologists around the world use these guidelines when they manage patients with CKD-MBD. Accordingly, more hemodialysis facilities in the United States adopted a high PTH target after the KDIGO guidelines were introduced, and the serum calcium target subsequently increased. The serum phosphorus target did not change, and most facilities currently adhere to a target level of 5.5mg/dL. In contrast to the upward trend of PTH target in the United States, many Korean dialysis patients have low PTH levels, and approximately 20% of the patients were medicated with vitamin D receptor agonists or cinacalcet (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【18】In our study population, the utility of the Japanese PTH target range is appreciated. PTH levels were proposed to range from 60 to 240 pg/mL based upon the odds ratios for achieving the Japanese calcium and phosphorus targets. The underlying idea was that appropriate PTH regulation could be maintained by optimal control of serum phosphorus and calcium levels.\n\n【19】Relative importance of hyperphosphatemia control\n================================================\n\n【20】The Japanese hemodialysis cohort study evaluated the relative importance of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH control. Patient survival was higher when phosphorus was well controlled as compared with calcium and PTH. PTH had a weak influence upon mortality compared with phosphorus and calcium.\n\n【21】We found that, in our hemodialysis population, PTH levels were significantly associated with phosphorus and calcium levels. In patients with a high PTH level, both phosphorus and calcium were poorly controlled.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【23】There are gaps between global guidelines and local practices. Many dialysis patients are not within the recommended range of serum phosphorus, calcium, and PTH. Among the 3 mineral values, serum phosphorus may be most influential on mortality outcomes. However, global or international CKD-MBD practice guidelines suggest different target levels for serum phosphorus. The serum phosphorus target associated with the best outcomes should be determined for each local area, and further study on Korean populations is needed to support dialysis management guidelines.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author has served on an advisory panel for AbbVie and received a speaker\\'s fee from Sanofi.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>!通用删除8(英):<u>[Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations from the Korean ESRD Registry 2013.

General procedure for personal exposure monitoring\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】### 1-1 Overall framework of personal exposure monitoring\n\n【3】The term personal exposure monitoring used in this guideline shall not be taken to mean merely measurement in the narrow sense of the word. More generally it is to be understood as an integrated process (or overall framework) by which the assessment and management of exposure is performed. Measurement, in the narrow sense of the word, is only one part of personal exposure monitoring.\n\n【4】The general process for personal exposure monitoring is shown in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. This figure illustrates a typical procedure for personal exposure monitoring. Expressed another way, the overall process is seen to be the assessment and management of exposure, or the assessment and management of risk. This process is divided into nine steps (known as unit procedures). The first step is the basic characterization of the workplace, and proceed through to the conclusion of the follow-up (the implementation of control measures and re-assessment and measurement after a certain period of time). These steps can be broadly classified into three groupings or stages: basic characterization (step 1), measurement (in the narrow sense) (steps 2 to 6), and risk reduction measures (steps 7 to 9).\n\n【5】![Entire process of personal exposure monitoring](1348-9585-59-471-g001)删除19:<u>{#F01}</u>\n\n【6】In performing personal exposure monitoring, 删除21:<u>(Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> Flow A)</u> the procedure to be followed moves from basic characterization through measurement (in the narrow sense) and concludes with risk reduction measures.\n\n【7】The goal of this procedure is to adequately control risks. This is seen in the risk reduction measures (stage 3). The measurement (in the narrow sense) is not an object in itself. In other words, the measurement stage can be omitted if risk management can be adequately ensured without measurement. This is seen in the alternative 删除21:<u>(Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> Flow B)</u>. This flow moves from the basic characterization directly through to the risk reduction measures. In this manner, depending on the result of basic characterization, personal exposure monitoring can be completed without performing measurements (in the narrow sense). As mentioned above, this is the reason why measurement (in the narrow sense) is only one part of the personal exposure monitoring.\n\n【8】However, in accordance with the Working Environment Measurement regulation, measurement must be conducted. In a broader sense, Working Environment Measurement (area monitoring) is a means of risk assessment and management as in the case of personal exposure monitoring. Therefore, depending on the characterization result of the workplace, there should be two options; either measurement should be conducted (seen in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> Flow A) or measurement should not be (seen in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> Flow B). However, due to the necessity to comply with legal requirements, measurement must in principle be performed without fail. As a consequence, even after a series of the first control class in succession, situations may indeed occur in which a specified measurement will need to be periodically repeated. (Note: As is described in a later chapter, if especially good control is maintained, this guideline allows for a part of the re-monitoring to be omitted, but only on the condition that an expert re-examines the workplace after an appropriate interval). In the case of Working Environment Measurement, there may exist the need to perform measurement due to the degree of fixed thinking. In consideration of the above background however, it is seen that personal exposure monitoring requires flexible thinking.\n\n【9】In the exposure assessment methods used in Europe and the USA, the necessity of conducting measurements is determined in a similar way. As described in Appendix 1, the exposure assessment method in the NIOSH, AIHA, and European Standards stipulates that a basic characterization be performed first; on the basis of the result of this measurement shall be conducted as needed. This is further organized in the supplementary document (please refer to Appendix 4).\n\n【10】### 1-2 Personnel performing personal exposure monitoring\n\n【11】In order to proceed with the entire process of personal exposure monitoring (steps 1 to 9 in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) personnel are required to comprehensively supervise the process. These personnel are defined as risk assessment supervisors. Since one responsible member of the personnel generally carries out all the steps in the case of personal exposure monitoring, it is normally considered possible for the risk assessment supervisor to perform the entire process. That is, the risk assessment supervisor is called upon to perform a basic characterization, to plan measurements on the basis of the characterization result, to evaluate the result of the measurement, and to recommend the necessary risk reduction measures to the workplace itself. Consequently, the risk assessment supervisor is required to be an expert and to be able to analyze potential outcomes.\n\n【12】Assistants who are under the instruction and supervision of the risk assessment supervisor may also be engaged in measurement (steps 3 to 6 in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). For this purpose, these assistants are known as monitoring staff and they are also required to possess expertise concerning the measurement (in the narrow sense), analysis, and assessment of the result.\n\n【13】It is not a requirement that either the risk assessment supervisor or the monitoring staff be employed by the workplace in question.\n\n【14】2. Purpose and method of basic characterization\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】### 2-1 Overview and importance of basic characterization\n\n【16】Basic characterization, as the first step of personal exposure monitoring, is very important both in the determination of which of the flow\\'s, either A or B (seen in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), should be chosen, and in the planning of the measurement should flow A be selected.\n\n【17】The major purposes of basic characterization (important items to be determined) are summarized in Table [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. First, on the basis of a survey of hazards in workplaces (chemical substances), those chemical substances requiring assessment (if any) shall be identified. Second, a similar exposure group (SEG), as a target of assessment and management, shall be set. Section 3-1 provides a detailed description of an SEG. Then, for each SEG and targeted chemical substance, the presence or absence of exposure and the degree of exposure for eight hours (one shift) shall be estimated. A similar estimation shall also be made, as needed, for short duration tasks, and, on the basis of this result, the necessity for monitoring is to be determined. Furthermore, if the risk assessment supervisor has identified potential overexposure, it is recommended that he consider about candidate proposal for necessary risk reduction measures.\n\n【18】###### \n\n【19】Purpose of workplace basic characterization (important items to be determined)\n\n【20】  Order   Important items to be determined                                                                                                 General timing\n  ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------\n  1       Chemical substances to be assessed                                                                                               Before and during workplace visit\n  2       Similar exposure group (SEG)                                                                                                     During workplace visit\n  3       Presence or absence of exposure and its degree (estimated exposure) (for each SEG and each chemical substance, 8 h/short term)   ditto\n  4       Necessity for measurement                                                                                                        During or after workplace visit\n  5       Candidate proposal for necessary risk reduction measures                                                                         ditto\n\n【21】Basic characterization shall be performed on an actual workplace.

format for workplace survey (for example: eight-hour exposure)](1348-9585-59-471-g002)删除19:<u>{#F02}</u>\n\n【31】While it is true that Working Environment Measurement experts may be familiar with the examples of the contents of the characterization shown in Table [2.2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, some parts of the contents and viewpoints of the basic characterization for personal exposure monitoring vary greatly from those of Working Environment Measurement. It is very important to note the important items to be determined (the five items seen in Table [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). This viewpoint is characteristic and is explained in detail in the following sections.\n\n【32】In the case of Working Environment Measurement, target substances are specified by the regulations. In contrast, chemical substances as assessment targets are required to be selected for personal exposure monitoring. Surprisingly, a large number of chemical substances are present in workplaces. For instance, a workplace consisting of about ten workers often contains more than several tens of kinds of chemical substances. Based on the information obtained in basic characterization, substances as assessment targets shall be selected from among these substances in terms of hazard and potential exposure.\n\n【33】At this stage, chemical substances that are evidently unlikely to produce exposure or are less toxic may be excluded from such targets. Such examples may include the following: less toxic aqueous solutions, high boiling point oils, solid substances that do not emit particles, trace amounts of certain substances, and substances that are to be handled only in a closed system. For this sort of rough classification (screening), in the initial stages a simplified risk assessment technique (control banding) may be arbitrarily employed depending on the situation. For those substances that can be excluded, a record taken of them including a simple reason for its rejection shall be maintained as a part of the record of the basic characterization itself.\n\n【34】For the chemical substances remaining (substances with exposure potential), basic characterization (items 2 onward in the order column of Table [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) needs to be performed.\n\n【35】Anything noted in the basic characterization of workplaces is summarized separately (please refer to Appendix 5).\n\n【36】### 2-2 Estimation of exposure\n\n【37】Estimation of exposure is vitally important from the standpoint of performing a survey where the alternative no measurement (Flow B in Fig. [2.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) is used.\n\n【38】Let us take as an example the estimation of exposure for eight hours (one shift). We would estimate the presence or absence of and the degree of exposure for each chemical substance to be assessed for a certain SEG (i.e. for each substance individually if three kinds of chemical substances are to be handled). That is, we make this estimation for each combination of SEG-chemical substance (please refer to Fig. [2.2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). When protective respiratory equipment is used, the exposure estimation is based on the assumption of not using it. The result of this assessment also informs the later selection of the respiratory protective equipment.\n\n【39】If, as a result of the survey, exposure assessment for a short duration task is found to be necessary, we assume the exposure for the task in question is similar to the above. That is, for short term exposure, an assumption is made for each combination of SEGchemical substance-short duration task.\n\n【40】If the exposure class (control class) is set before exposure estimation, it would be easier to determine which control class a specific substance shall belong. Table [2.3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> shows the control class recommended in this guideline. The details of this class are described in Sections 2-3 and 5-6 of Chapter 2.\n\n【41】###### \n\n【42】Control class and interpretation\n\n【43】  Control class                                                                                                          Definition                 Interpretation (judgment)                       \n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  1A                                                                                                                     X~95~\\<OEL And         X~95~\\<(OEL×10%)                            Excellent\n  1B                                                                                                                     AM\\<(OEL×10%)          Sufficiently good                               \n  1C                                                                                                                     (OEL×10%) ≤ AM         Good                                            \n  2A                                                                                                                     AM ≤ OEL×X~95~ And   AM ≤ (OEL×50%)                              Close investigation of the effectiveness of current control measures and efforts for further reduction of exposure are needed\n  2B                                                                                                                     (OEL×50%)\\<AM          Perform risk reduction measures                 \n  3                                                                                                                      OEL\\<AM                Perform risk reduction measures without delay   \n  (OEL: Occupational Exposure Limit.

If past data of an SEG to be surveyed or of a similar workplace are available, the reliability of judgment is relatively high in general. As a matter of course, a close examination of the correlation between these data and the current situation of the SEG should be performed prior to utilizing them.\n\n【45】###### \n\n【46】Basis of exposure estimation and examples\n\n【47】  Basis                                                Examples\n  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Past assessment and measurement result               Past results obtained in the target SEG\n  Alternative data                                     Past results obtained in similar workplaces or SEG Results obtained from other chemical substances of target SEG Results obtained in area monitoring (such as Working Environment Measurement)\n  Result of instantaneous measurement                  Detector tube Direct reading instrument, real-time monitoring device\n  Exposure modeling                                    Exposure simulation\n  Situation of workplace (experience-based judgment)   Equipment (exhaust and ventilation equipment) Workplace environment (source of generation, distance, work contents, etc.)\n  Common sense judgment                                Amount of substance to be handled is very small. To be handled in a closed system or nearly closed system\n\n【48】Instantaneous measurement methods are often an effective means for exposure estimation in basic characterization and are thus recommended for active utilization. Details of these instantaneous measurement methods are given in Section 4-2 of Chapter 2. Depending on the situation, the result of exposure modeling (simulation) may be applied. A common sense decision as to how substances are handled in a closed system may also be used.\n\n【49】When a decision is made on the basis of exposure estimation, a safety margin (allowance) shall be secured according to the degree of reliability. For instance, consideration shall be given so that judgment of measurement conditions to be simplified or no measurement may be conducted only when the result of the exposure estimation is lower than the occupational exposure limit by a certain degree.\n\n【50】For estimation of exposure, a brief record describing the basis for the estimation should be made (please refer to Fig. [2.2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Since exposure assessment is an important matter that directly affects the necessity of monitoring and risk reduction measures, assessors are responsible for the faithful execution of the assessment within their capability. Documentation of their assessment clarifies this responsibility and will, if required, also be helpful in clearly explaining the situation at a later stage.\n\n【51】Estimation of exposure may appear to be a difficult task at the beginning. If a risk assessment supervisor is less experienced in measurement, or is not confident in the decision, it is recommended that the supervisor simply perform measurement. In such a case, it is often effective to first conduct an instantaneous measurement. As the risk assessment supervisor accumulates experience in exposure estimation and measurement at workplaces, it will soon become easier to estimate concerning similar workplaces or work tasks, with improved accuracy.\n\n【52】### 2-3 Exposure class (control class)\n\n【53】In this guideline, the control class is divided into six subclasses as shown in Table [2.3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【54】Then the control class is roughly divided into three classes; 1, 2, 3. The classes are identical with the control classes 1, 2, 3 in the case of Working Environment Measurement; indeed they have a fairly similar statistical significance. Control class 3 corresponds to an inadequate situation, which requires the immediate implementation of risk reduction measures. Control class 2 is divided into two classes. The subclass (2B) that is closest to the control class 3 essentially needs risk reduction measures. Control class 1 is divided into three classes. This is in order to distinguish between their goodness so as to allow reasonable selection to be made, such as re-assessment and measurement frequency. Details such as the calculation of control class, the significance of each class, and the response method for each control class are described later in Section 5-6.\n\n【55】Appropriate assignment of six control classes at the stage of exposure estimation may at first appear difficult, especially if a risk assessment supervisor has not had adequate experience. In such a case, only the three control classes (classes 1, 2, 3) may be employed, or, further, terms such as high, intermediate, low, and minimum may be useful.\n\n【56】If estimation could not be made because the degree of exposure is not well identified (a situation that in many cases corresponds to a gray zone in which exposure is neither too large nor too small), estimation unable to be made shall be recorded.

Various cancers are closely related to genetic alteration; therefore, we investigated the effect of PCBs on genetic stability, through p53, a guardian of genome, in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Among several congeners examined, 2,2',4,6,6'-pentachlorobiphenyl (PeCB) specifically activated p53-dependent transcription. It also induced p53 nuclear accumulation, but did not cause DNA strand breakage. On the other hand, cell cycle progression that is closely connected to p53 was affected by 2,2',4,6,6'-PeCB, resulting in mitotic arrest. In the arrested cells, mitotic spindle damage was detected. Moreover, in the absence of functional p53, polyploidy was caused by 2,2',4,6,6'-PeCB. These results imply that 2,2',4,6,6'-PeCB induces mitotic arrest by interfering with mitotic spindle assembly, followed by genetic instability which triggers p53-activating signals to prevent further polyploidization. Taking these findings together, we suggest that 2,2',4,6,6'-PeCB could be involved in cancer development by causing genetic instability through mitotic spindle damage, which brings about aneuploidy in p53-deficient tumor cells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The prevailing practice seems to favor KA-LD over SPK, presumably due to the superior long-term renal graft survival in KA-LD and the elimination of the lengthy waiting time on the cadaver transplant list. In this study, two treatment options, KA-LD followed by pancreas-after-kidney (PAK) and SPK transplant, are compared using a cost-utility decision analysis model. The decision tree consisted of a choice between KA-LD + PAK and SPK. The analysis was based on a 5-yr model and the measures of outcome used in the model were cost, utility and cost-utility. The expected 5-yr cost was $277,638 for KA-LD + PAK and $288,466 for SPK. When adjusted for utilities, KA-LD + PAK at a cost of $153,911 was less cost-effective than SPK at a cost of $110,828 per quality-adjusted year. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient and graft survival probabilities, utilities and cost. SPK remained the optimal strategy over KA-LD + PAK across all variations. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that in order for KA-LD + PAK to be at least as cost-effective as SPK, 5-yr pancreas and patient survival rates following PAK would need to surpass 86 and 80%. In conclusion, according to the 5-yr cost-utility model presented in this study, KA-LD followed by PAK is less cost-effective than SPK as a treatment strategy for a type I diabetic with end-stage renal disease. For patients interested in the benefits of a pancreas transplant, it would be reasonable to offer SPK as the optimal treatment, even if a living kidney donor is available.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A rat model of deep venous thrombosis was established by directly clamping femoral vein. Based on the different biological situations of femoral vein thrombosis and observation phases, 150 SD rats were divided into 7 groups. Inflammatory cells in vein wall of each group were counted. The fold change and cluster analysis were applied to study the change of gene expression during the development of venous thrombosis. Especially, the genes related to inflammation, fibrinolysis, coagulation of endothelium were analyzed in detail. The inflammation cells in femoral vein wall were mostly neutrophilic granulocytes in Groups B, C and D, while they were lymphocytes in Groups E, F and G. Compared with Groups A, B, E and G, the inflammation cell counts in Groups C, D and F were much higher (P less than 0.05). The results of fold-change analysis showed that 2 504 genes (Log 2 ratio > or = 1 or < or = 1) presented different expressions in the process of TDVT. Most of these genes'functions were not clarified so far and the genes with known functions were involved in inflammation, DNA-dependent transcription regulation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, etc. Among them, 23 genes related to inflammation had different expressions during TDVT. The cluster analysis showed that the expression changes of several genes, such as IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, Cinc2, corresponded with the development of femoral vein thrombosis.

In the present study, the effects of exogenous IGF-I on bone cell differentiation and mineralized bone nodule formation induced by OP-1 were examined. Exogenous IGF-I synergistically and dose dependently enhanced OP-1 action in stimulating [3H]thymidine incorporation, alkaline phosphatase activity, PTH-dependent cAMP level, and bone nodule formation. Maximal synergism between OP-1 and IGF-I was observed when both factors were added simultaneously. Synergism was not observed when FRC cells were pretreated with IGF-I for 24 h, followed by OP-1 treatment. These findings suggest that IGF-I acted on OP-1-sensitized FRC cells. To examine the mechanism(s) by which this sensitization may occur, levels of mRNA encoding OP-1 receptor, IGF-I receptor, and IGFBPs were measured. The mRNA levels of both type I and II OP-1 receptors were elevated by OP-1, but were not changed further by combined OP-1 and IGF-I treatment. IGF-I receptor gene expression was not changed by OP-1, IGF-I, or a combination of both factors. OP-1 alone or together with IGF-I increased the steady state IGFBP-3 mRNA level and reduced the steady state mRNA levels of IGFBP-4, -5, and -6.

Within the structural or metabolic classification, PEM secondary to ruminal lactic acidosis or PEM of undetermined cause was the most common disease condition diagnosed. The relatively higher proportion of diagnosis of PEM of undetermined cause or secondary to ruminal lactic acidosis in our study might be due to overrepresentation of meat or dairy breeds. Meat or dairy breeds are more likely to be raised for increased average daily weight gain or milk production and thus are exposed to risk factors for PEM, such as high‐carbohydrate diets. The term PEM has been used in reference to softening of the gray matter of the brain, attributed to altered thiamine metabolism, hypernatremia, lead poisoning or high sulfur intake.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> The term polioencephalomalacia also might be used in reference to any neurologic disease syndrome associated with an altered thiamine status.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Ruminal lactic acidosis results in decreased ruminal thiamine synthesis, increased thiaminase‐producing bacteria (Clostridium sporogenes and Bacillus spp),删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> and decreased activity of the thiamine diphosphate‐dependent enzyme transketolase.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Transketolase is the rate‐limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is required for energy metabolism in nervous tissue.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> The relationship between PEM and thiamine is uncertain.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Although earlier studies reported sheep and cattle to be in a state of thiamine deficiency,删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> other studies reported no alterations in blood thiamine concentrations between cattle with PEM and those with other neurologic diseases.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Additionally, increased concentrations of rumen hydrogen sulfide, with no alterations in thiamine concentrations, were observed during peak PEM occurrence in steers.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> In our study, diagnosis of PEM secondary to ruminal lactic acidosis was based on history, physical examination findings, serum biochemical analysis, rumen fluid analysis, and necropsy. Previous reports indicate that response to therapeutic doses of thiamine in cattle or sheep with sulfur‐induced PEM were variable.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>, 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Hence, non‐responsiveness to thiamine treatment does not rule out an antemortem diagnosis of PEM. Consequently, cases of PEM in our study might have been misdiagnosed if they did not respond to thiamine administration.\n\n【41】Copper toxicosis causes intravascular hemolysis leading to tissue hypoxia (including the brain), and spongy degeneration of the pons and brainstem leading to seizure activity.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Severe bronchopneumonia can cause tissue hypoxia, which can lead to seizures. Hereditary central nervous system spongiform myelinopathy was reported in 1 pygmy goat in our study. Spongiform myelinopathy has been reported in African dwarf goats and results in spongy changes in the white and gray matter of the cerebral cortex, leading to seizure activity.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Meningoepithelial hyperplasia reported in 1 goat in our study could have caused seizure activity due to the pressure exerted on the cerebral cortex. Sarcocystis sp was identified in the brain, lungs, kidneys, rumen, and heart in 1 case (4‐month‐old Boer) in our study. The prevalence of intramuscular Sarcocystis in goats and sheep has been estimated at 52--79 and 18--100%, respectively.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> However, reports of systemic sarcosporidiosis in small ruminants are unavailable in the literature. The mechanism by which coccidiosis causes neurological signs, including seizures, is not clearly understood.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u> Bacteria isolated from the brain abscesses in goats in our study were Gram‐positive anaerobes, consistent with previous studies in cattle.删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"ref\"}</u>\n\n【42】Complete blood cell count and serum biochemical analysis were the 2 most commonly performed antemortem diagnostic tests. This finding is most likely as a result of easy of collection of blood samples, fast turnaround of results, and generation of information useful as guidance for choice of supportive treatment, such as IV fluids. Interestingly, CSF collection and analysis was only performed in a small proportion of goats and sheep, despite presentation of patients for seizures. Rumen fluid analysis was only performed in 2 cases despite 22% (13/59) of goats diagnosed with PEM secondary to ruminal lactic acidosis. This is most likely because the history and physical examinations were sufficient to make a diagnosis of PEM secondary to ruminal lactic acidosis.\n\n【43】Intravenous fluids, thiamine, diazepam, and antibiotics were the most commonly administered medications in this study. The higher frequency of administration of thiamine while awaiting diagnostic test results in this study might be a result of the higher frequency of differential diagnoses that cause seizures by interfering with thiamine metabolism in sheep and goats.

Tumor metastasis is one of the causes of BC mortality and has important functions in the diagnosis and treatment of BC. The invasiveness of tumors and the microenvironment surrounding tumors are important influencing factors for the occurrence of tumor metastasis \\[\\]. LGMN is a cysteine endopeptidase that is localized in lysosomes. It is highly expressed not only in a variety of solid tumor cells but also in tumor neovascular endothelial cells and tumor-associated macrophages \\[\\]. However, it is not expressed or has low expression status in normal tissues \\[\\]. Studies have shown that LGMN not only participates in tumor migration and invasion but also plays important roles in the occurrence and development of tumors; furthermore, it is associated with a poor prognosis in tumor patients \\[--\\]. Therefore, the targeted silencing of LGMN expression in tumor cells is a valuable treatment method.\n\n【3】RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to specifically bind cellular mRNA to homologous sequences via double-stranded RNA and to degrade the mRNA of target genes, thus achieving specific inhibition of target gene expression, which plays an important role in gene therapy for tumors. Currently, commonly used small interfering RNA (siRNA) can only generate transient gene inhibition effects and short-term interference effects; therefore, its clinical application is limited. Promoters used in shRNA interference plasmids mainly consist of Pol III promoters, which do not have tissue specificity and can be persistently expressed in almost all cells. Therefore, in addition to killing tumor cells during treatment, these promoters can also damage normal tissues \\[, \\], thus restricting their clinical application. In recent years, plasmids with shRNA embedded in microRNA (miRNA) backbone driven by Pol II promoters were used in RNAi \\[--\\], such \"shRNAmir\" structures serve as natural substrates in miRNA biogenesis pathways and can strongly increases mature shRNA levels and knockdown efficacy \\[, \\]. Using this method, in addition to optimizing the interference effects and reducing off-target effects, the tissue specificity of this group of plasmids can be developed, and RNAi can be regulated using the temporal and spatial specificity method, therefore improving the targeting and safety of gene therapy \\[, \\].\n\n【4】The expression level of the Egr-1 gene is increased in cells due to stress after radiation. Six CC(A+T)~6~GG regulatory elements (CArG elements) are present upstream of its 5' end. The element can sense radiation stimulation to drive transcription and is the direct site of action of oxygen free radicals \\[\\]. Studies including our research group and other labs have confirmed that the chimeric promoter constructed by tandem series of CArG regulatory elements coupled with the Pol II basic promoter could significantly enhance the expression level of downstream genes\\[--\\]. This chimeric promoter could control the downstream genes expressing within a limited time during the radiation period, also strictly limited to the range of the radiation field.\n\n【5】In this study, we used nine tandem CArG elements coupling with CMV basic promoter to construct the chimeric promoter C~9~BC, and then constructed shRNAmir-based lentiviral plasmids targeting LGMN, which is driven by the C~9~BC Pol II promoter. After lentiviral packaging, viruses were used to infect SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells to establish stably transfected cells. The results showed that the C~9~BC promoter exhibited a significant radiation-inducible ability after radiation treatment. Furthermore, radiation plus knocking-down of LGMN could effectively inhibit the growth and invasiveness of BC cells.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec002}</u>\n=====================\n\n【7】Cell lines 删除19:<u>{#sec003}</u>\n----------\n\n【8】293FT cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, USA). The SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Both cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a 5% CO~2~ incubator.\n\n【9】Confocal microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec004}</u>\n-------------------\n\n【10】Cells were plated onto MatTek glass-bottomed culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight.

Reverse transcription was performed according to the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit protocol (TaKaRa). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). The internal control was GADPH. The primers used were shown in Table A in [S1 File]删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>. The quantitative PCR reaction used the two-step method (Bio-Rad Q5). For quantitative analysis, all samples were analyzed using the ΔΔCT value method.\n\n【13】Western blotting 删除19:<u>{#sec006}</u>\n----------------\n\n【14】The cells were dissociated, centrifuged, and collected. Cell lysis buffer (Beyotime company, Jiangsu, China) was added, and the cells were incubated in an ice bath for 15--20 min. The cells were centrifuged at 4°C at 20000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for future use. Proteins were quantified using the BCA method (Beyotime), and the concentrations of samples in all groups were adjusted to the same level. Loading buffer was added to the samples; after boiling in water for 5 min, the samples were stored at -20°C for subsequent use. A 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was prepared, and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis. The samples were then transferred onto a 0.2 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane using the wet transfer method at 90 V. After membrane transfer was complete, the PVDF membrane was removed and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added and incubated at 4°C overnight. After the membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline/tween (PBST), a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was added, and the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the membrane was washed with PBST, the proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Byotime). β-actin was used as a control and obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology. All of the primary antibodies and dilutions contained the following: goat anti-LGMN antibody (1:500; R&D, Shanghai, China), mouse anti-MMP2 antibody (1:1000; ZSGN-BIO, Beijing, China), and mouse anti-MMP9 antibody (1:1000; ZSGN-BIO). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Beyotime.\n\n【15】Plate colony formation experiments 删除19:<u>{#sec007}</u>\n----------------------------------\n\n【16】Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were dissociated and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 1×10^5^/mL. Cell suspensions of 100 μL were inoculated onto 6-cm plates; after culture medium was added, the cells were placed in an incubator for conventional culturing for 2--3 weeks. When visible colonies appeared, the culture was terminated. The cells were washed with PBS twice, fixed in methanol for 15 min, stained with crystal violet for 20 min, washed with tap water, and air dried. The number of visible colonies was counted using a transparent film with grids. Colony formation rate = (number of colonies/number of inoculated cells) ×100%.\n\n【17】Invasion experiments 删除19:<u>{#sec008}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【18】Matrigel (Invitrogen) was transferred from -20°C to 4°C for 12 h to obtain a liquid state for subsequent use. The upper chamber surface of the basement membrane of the transwell (Corning, NY, USA) was coated with a 50 mg/L matrigel 1:8 diluted solution and air dried at room temperature. Then, 50 μL of serum-free culture medium containing 10 g/L BSA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) was added to each well. The basement membrane was hydrolyzed at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were starved by serum withdrawal for 12--24 h. The cells were collected using routine dissociation, centrifuged, and resuspended in serum-free medium. The cell density was adjusted to 1×10^5^/ml, and 200 μL was added to the transwell. The bottom chamber was filled with 500 μL of culture medium containing 20% BSA. After conventional culturing for 24 h, the transwell was removed, and the cells were eluted with PBS. Cells on the inner membrane were wiped using a cotton swap, fixed in 95% ethanol for 5 min, stained with crystal violet, and counted.\n\n【19】Scratch Wound Healing Assay 删除19:<u>{#sec009}</u>\n---------------------------\n\n【20】The cells were inoculated onto six-well plates and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO~2~ cell incubator. After the cells reached 70%-80% confluence, cross lines were made using a 200-μL sterile pipette tip. The cells were washed three times with sterile PBS to remove the scratched cells. The cells were continuously cultured in serum-free culture medium. After 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h, the cells were photographed.

Because LGMN is closely associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and the microenvironment variations, using LGMN as a target for gene therapy could have an important value for clinical application. So far, there is no study that reported the knockdown of LGMN combined with radiation treatment. In this study, we used LGMN as a therapeutic target to observe the anti-tumor effects of radiation-induced LGMN knockdown in BC cells. We showed that the shRNAmir structure targeting LGMN plus radiation treatment could significantly reduce the expression of LGMN in mRNA and protein levels, decrease the proliferation ability, and inhibit the migration and invasiveness of BC cells.\n\n【42】RNAi is a biological process of inhibiting gene expression by RNA molecules through the degradation of specific mRNA molecules. siRNA is a commonly used and effective method of RNAi. It acts rapidly but can only exert transient gene inhibition effects; in addition, it cannot be amplified. Therefore, its systemic application at the in vivo level is limited. Commonly used shRNA interference plasmids can maintain long-term target gene inhibition effects, however, the promoters in shRNA plasmids mainly belong to the Pol III promoters, which lacks targeting features and expresses in almost all cells. Therefore, their application for treatment at the in vivo level is limited. Studies have shown that adding miRNA arms at both ends of shRNA and coupling this cassette with Pol II promoters to simulate endogenous knockdown of mRNA by miRNA produces the advantages of high knockdown efficiency and low off-target effects \\[, \\]. To address above questions, we constructed a chimeric radiation-inducible Pol II promoters which coupling with shRNAmir structure to limit the targeted gene knockdown strictly in cancer cells.\n\n【43】Utilization of radiation induction to control gene therapy should not only allows real-time regulation of expression levels of target genes but also achieves tumor-targeting treatment effects and a synergistic effect between radiotherapy and gene therapy at the same time. The CArG elements in the Egr-1 gene can effectively activate downstream gene transcription under radiation induction and temporally and spatially perform targeted regulation of gene expression\\[, \\]. Our previous studies have shown that promoters containing tandem CArG elements could be induced by radiation treatment and drive the expression of the downstream therapeutic genes \\[, \\]. Therefore, this chimeric element can be used as a radiation-sensitive regulatory element to control the expression of therapeutic genes. Our studies have shown that the C~9~BC chimeric promoter produces better radiation induction characteristics and lower background expression levels than the Egr-1 promoter. This chimeric promoter belongs to the Pol II promoters, therefore, the shRNAmir structure can be linked to its downstream so as to control gene knockdown by radiation treatment. Our study showed that the C~9~BC chimeric promoter could effectively activate downstream gene expression after exposure to 6 Gy of radiation and produce an RNAi effect for targeting LGMN to achieve an effective anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, we found radiotherapy and targeted LGMN knockdown had synergistic effects in BC cells, so, knockdown of LGMN plus radiation treatment could enhance the therapeutic effects so as to gain more positive anti-tumor effects.\n\n【44】It has been reported that cancer cells overexpressing LGMN possessed increased migratory and invasive activity in vitro\\[, \\]. DNA vaccine targeting LGMN could suppress angiogenesis, cell growth, and metastasis in murine tumor models\\[\\]. Consistent with previous findings, we found that LGMN play an important role in cell migration and invasion in BC cells. To elucidate the mechanism involved in BC cell invasion and metastasis, we further evaluated the metalloendopeptidases MMP2 and 9 expressions in different cell samples. We found that knockdown of LGMN could downregulate the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which could break down extracellular matrix and promote tumor metastasis. Therefore, knockdown of LGMN should alleviates the aggressive phenotype through downregulate MMPs in BC cells.\n\n【45】In summary, for the first time, we utilized C~9~BC as a radiation-inducible promoter to drive the expression of shRNA-miR-155 cassette targeting LGMN in the study of BC cells. The combination of radiation treatment and LGMN gene knockdown could effectively suppress cell growth and invasiveness of BC cells. Furthermore, the effective temporal and spatial control of RNAi should increase the accuracy and safety of anti-tumor treatment.\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Primers used in this study .

From these structures, residue W147 was implicated as a key component of the allosteric response, but in many members of the LacI/GalR family, position 147 is occupied by an arginine. To understand the role of this tryptophan at position 147, three proteins, substituted by phenylalanine (W147F), alanine (W147A), or arginine (W147R), were constructed and characterized in vivo and in vitro, and their structures were determined. W147F displays a decreased affinity for corepressor and is a poor repressor in vivo. W147A and W147R, on the other hand, are super repressors and bind corepressor 13.6 and 7.9 times more tightly, respectively, than wild-type. Each mutant PurR-hypoxanthine-purF operator holo complex crystallizes isomorphously to wild-type. Whereas the apo corepressor binding domain (CBD) of W147F crystallizes under those conditions used for the wild-type protein, neither the apo CBD of W147R nor W147A crystallizes, although screened extensively for new crystal forms. Structures of the holo repressor mutants have been solved to resolutions between 2.5 and 2.9 A, and the structure of the apo CBD of W147F has been solved to 2.4 A resolution.

Aberrant activation of several kinases due to overexpression, amplification or activating mutations are the underlying causes of many human pathologies like inflammation and cancer \\[\\]. Conversely, loss of the negative regulation exerted by phosphatases may lead to a similar outcome \\[\\]. To date, many kinase inhibitors have been developed and several small molecule inhibitors and function blocking antibodies against receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are already in clinical use to treat different cancers.\n\n【2】TCPTP is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that is expressed in all tissues throughout development \\[\\]. There are two splice variants of TCPTP that vary in their C-terminal sequence. The longer 48 kDa form (TC48) is localized to the ER whereas the 45 kDa form (TC45) is predominantly present in the nucleus, but it is capable of translocating to the cytoplasm in response to mitogenic stimuli or α1β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen \\[-\\]. Mice and humans express the 45 kDa form while the 48 kDa form has been identified only in humans \\[,\\]. TCPTP has been implicated in the negative regulation of several signalling pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR \\[\\], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 VEGFR2 \\[\\], platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta PDGFRβ \\[\\], signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 STAT1 \\[\\], STAT3 \\[\\], STAT6 \\[\\], the insulin receptor \\[\\], colony stimulating factor 1 signalling \\[\\] and hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met \\[\\]. In addition, two members of the Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAKs), JAK1 and JAK3, function as TCPTP substrates \\[\\]. TCPTP has recently been established as a negative regulator of SFK, JAK1 and STAT3 signalling during the cell cycle \\[\\].\n\n【3】Recent data has suggested that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is permissive for signalling by RTKs in response to stimuli \\[\\]. Apart from this general mechanism for inhibition of PTPs, in vivo little is known about PTP activation in cells. In the case of Src homology 2-domain containing tyrosine phosphatases 1 and 2 (SHP-1 and SHP-2), binding of the two SH2-domains to phosphotyrosine motifs results in a conformational change and significant activation of the phosphatase \\[,\\]. In TC45 the positively charged C-terminus was shown to negatively regulate enzyme activity and a truncation mutant (TC37) lacking this region is constitutively active \\[\\]. We have previously shown that TC45 is activated by a collagen-binding integrin α1β1. The positively charged short cytoplasmic tail of α1 integrin (α1-cyt) selectively interacts with the N-terminal part of TC45 and activates it in response to adhesion to collagen via alleviating the autoinhibition by competing with the TC45 C-terminus for binding to the N-terminal half of the protein \\[\\].\n\n【4】Compared to kinases, much less progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics targeting PTPs. Since PTP-1B has an important role in regulating insulin signalling, PTP-1B inhibitors targeting the active site are being developed for treatment of diabetes and obesity \\[,\\]. Since many PTPs function as negative regulators in cancer \\[,\\], their agonists could be effective drug targets in oncology. However, this might be challenging since PTP activation may involve disruption of protein-protein interactions which are difficult to break by low molecular weight compounds \\[\\]. In the case of α1-TCPTP interaction a limited number of amino acids in the α1-tail are critical for the interaction \\[\\] making the situation more feasible for targeting with low molecular weight compounds. In the case of p53-MDM2 interaction the development of small-molecule inhibitors has been a success and these compounds induce apoptosis of cancer cells in vivo \\[\\].\n\n【5】Here we have performed a high-throughput screen (HTS) with recombinant TCPTP (TC45) to identify novel activators of the enzyme. We demonstrate that six structurally distinct compounds are capable of activating TC45 in vitro and that one of these, spermidine, functions in cells to inhibit proliferation, PDGFRβ phosphorylation and VEGF-induced angiogenic sprouting in a TC45-dependent manner. We also show that spermidine and mitoxantrone compete with α1-cyt in activating TC45, suggesting that they function by disrupting the inhibitory intra-molecular bond in TCPTP. These lead compounds could be used for rational design of TC45 agonist with improved properties.\n\n【6】Methods\n=======\n\n【7】Antibodies, siRNAs and reagents\n-------------------------------\n\n【8】Antibodies against TCPTP (mAb CF4, Calbiochem; 3E2 from M. Tremblay, McGill University, Canada), EGFR phosphotyrosine 1068 (Cell Signaling Technology), PDGFRβ phosphotyrosine 1021 (Santa Cruz), and α-tubulin (Hybridoma Bank) were used. HRP-conjugated second-stage reagents were used, as appropriate. siRNA against TCPTP has previously been shown to be specific to TCPTP and to have identical effects to another TCPTP-targeting oligo \\[\\]. TCPTP siRNA was from Ambion and the All Stars negative control siRNA from Qiagen. Peptides containing the cytoplasmic tails of the α1 or α2 integrins, the integrin-α1 tail fused to the 11-amino acid -long TAT peptide, and scrambled TAT (scrTAT, peptide with the TAT sequence fused to a scramble sequence of the α1-tail amino acids \\[\\]). peptides were synthesized by Innovagen. EGF was purchased from Sigma, and human recombinant PDGF-BB from Cell Signaling Technology. Recombinant TCPTP, its mutants, and the constitutively active TC37 were produced and purified as GST-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and cleaved from the GST using PreScission according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions (BD Biosciences). DiFMUP (6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate) was purchased from Molecular Probes, and Cell Titer Blue from Promega. Of the small molecule libraries, Spectrum 2000 was from Microsource Discovery Systems, LOPAC (Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds) 1280 from Sigma, ChemDiv from ChemDiv Inc. ChemBridge from ChemBridge Corporation, and Tripos from Tripos International. Spermidine trihydrochloride, Mitoxantrone, Ruthenium red, and MDL-26,630-trihydrochloride were also from Sigma. Compounds N21 and F12 were no longer available from the library provider and could not be tested further.\n\n【9】Cells\n-----\n\n【10】HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5% CO2. Primary HUVECs were freshly isolated as described \\[\\] and cultured in EBM2 medium. Only HUVECs passaged ≤ three times were used in this study. They were transfected with siRNA duplexes (100 nM) by nucleofection using Amaxa. Nucleofected HUVECs were harvested for RNA extraction 4 days post-transfection and TCPTP levels were analysed with Taqman qRT-PCR to study transfection efficiency. TCPTP wt (EFM7+/+) and knockout (EFM4-/-) immortalised mouse embryonic fibroblasts (kindly provided by M. Tremblay) were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 ug/ml Plasmocin, 5% CO2.\n\n【11】Western blot assays\n-------------------\n\n【12】Serum-starved HeLa cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were left untreated on plastic, stimulated with 10 μM spermidine for 1 h, or in addition treated with 50 ng/ml EGF or PDGF for 5 or 15 min. Cells were lysed in Laemmli\\'s sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels for western blot analysis. Western blot bands were quantified using digital image analysis and only non-saturated blots were used. The bands to compare in a blot were enclosed with equal size boxes and pixel intensity was quantified using GeneGenius Bioimaging system and Genetools software (Syngene). Automatic background correction was used.\n\n【13】Elisa assays\n------------\n\n【14】96-well streptavidin plate (Costar) wells were incubated with TBS containing 2.5 μM α1-cytoplasmic tail (biotin-WKIGFFKRPLKKKMEK) or buffer alone at +4°C for 3 h. Non-specific binding was blocked with 2% BSA/TBS-Tween containing 10% FBS overnight at +4°C. Purified recombinant TC45 (cleaved from GST-TC45 as described in \\[\\]) alone or in the presence of indicated concentrations of small molecules, α1-cyt or α2-cyt peptide (α1 cytoplasmic specific sequence lacking the conserved domain RPLKKKMEK or α2 cytoplasmic domain WKLGFFKRKYEMTKNPDEIDETTELSS) was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After extensive washing, TC45 protein binding to integrin tail sequences was detected using anti-TCPTP Ab (CF4) and standard horseradish peroxidase -based detection.\n\n【15】Phosphatase assays\n------------------\n\n【16】In the in vitro phosphatase assays with purified protein, full-length purified TCPTP (TC45, see above) was incubated in phosphatase reaction buffer (25 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) in the presence or absence of synthetic integrin cytoplasmic tail peptides or the novel small molecule TCPTP activators as indicated. The samples were assayed for phosphatase activity in triplicate using DiFMUP (6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as a substrate. Sample with only reaction buffer and DiFMUP (blank) was used as a control.\n\n【17】Sprouting assay\n---------------\n\n【18】Sprouting assays from spheroids were performed as previously described \\[\\], and based on the method described earlier \\[\\]. Briefly, HUVECs were divided into round-bottomed, non-treated 96-wells (Greiner Bio-One), 3000 cells per well, in EBM2 medium with 0.25% methyl cellulose (Sigma). After overnight incubation at +37°C 5 spheroids per treatment were pooled and resuspended in spheroid medium (40% FBS, 0,5% methyl cellulose, plain medium). Collagen gel (20 mM Hepes, 1 × DMEM (Sigma), PureCol collagen (Vitrogen)) was added 1:1 to cell suspension and the mix transferred to 48-wells. After polymerisation, medium +/- VEGF 50 ng/ml, 200 nM ScrTAT or α1TAT-peptide, and 10 uM spermidine were added. Cumulative length of the sprouts around spheroids was quantified using 10× magnification after 24 h incubation.\n\n【19】High-throughput screening\n-------------------------\n\n【20】Five small molecule libraries were screened for TCPTP activators. The library compounds were transferred to 384-well assay plates with a Microlab Star automated liquid handling workstation (Hamilton Robotics) fitted with 100-nl 96-channel pintool (V&P Scientific Inc. San Diego, CA). HTS mode TCPTP dispensation was carried out using a Multidrop Combi dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and the plates were incubated for 10 min. at RT. Background fluorescence was measured during the TCPTP incubation. DiFMUP was added using Multidrop and the plates were incubated for 10 min. at RT. Urea was added to stop the reactions and fluorescence was measured with EnVision 2101 multilabel plate reader (Wallac Oy, PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Analytical Sciences, Turku, Finland). Screening data was analysed and the results normalised using the B-score method, which decreases assay and instrumentation specific variation between datapoints (Brideau et al. 2003) implemented in R, a software environment for statistical computing. (R Development Core Team 2008). B-score hits were compared with background measurement results. Hits in wells having high background signal were discarded as false positive.\n\n【21】Proliferation assay\n-------------------\n\n【22】TCPTP wt and knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were applied on 384-wells, 1500 cells in 35 μl medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine) per well. Seven different compound dilutions were prepared in DMSO of Spermidine, Mitoxantrone, Ruthenium Red and MDL. Compounds were added in medium to wells, with 6 replicates of each dilution. The resulting end concentrations of the compounds in the wells were 100 nM, 1 μM, 10 μM, 30 μM, 100 μM, 300 μM and 1 mM. Sample containing only DMSO was used as a negative control. Plates were incubated for 72 h at 37°C, 5% CO~2~. Cell Titer Blue was added to wells and incubated for a further 4 h after which fluorescence at 560 nm was measured with Envision. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, USA).\n\n【23】Statistical analyses\n--------------------\n\n【24】Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Student\\'s t-test. All results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Following P-values were used to show statistical significance: \\, P \\< 0.05; \\\\, P \\< 0.01; \\\\\\, P \\< 0.001.\n\n【25】Results\n=======\n\n【26】New TC45 activators found in small molecule screen\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】We performed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecule compounds capable of activating TC45. Five small molecule libraries, Microsource Spectrum with 2000 biologically active and structurally diverse compounds, LOPAC1280 with 1280 pharmaceutically active compounds, Tripos with 6000 compounds, ChemDiv with 25000 compounds and ChemBridge with 30000 compounds were screened in an in vitro phosphatase assay. The assay was based on incubation of purified recombinant TC45 with a fluorescent phosphatase substrate in the presence or absence of small molecule compounds. The compounds were printed on 384-well plates. Compound interference was taken into account by measuring background fluorescence from plates which contained the compounds and the reaction mix, but no TC45. TC45 activity assay was initiated by adding purified phosphatase to the wells and allowing dephosphorylation of phosphatase substrate DiFMUP to proceed for 10 minutes. The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped with urea and the fluorescence measured using a multilabel plate reader 删除21:<u>(Fig. [1A]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>.

Thus, we investigated the mechanism behind the small molecule -mediated TC45 activation. Based on our previous results, integrin α1 cytoplasmic tail residues 1164-1179 interact with the amino-terminal part of TC45 activating it by alleviating the proposed autoregulatory interaction between the C- and N-terminus of the protein \\[\\]. Since α1 cytoplasmic tail is positively charged (RPLKKKMEK) and also the majority of the identified small molecular activators of TC45 carry positively charged amine-groups, we investigated whether the compounds would compete with α1-cyt for binding of TC45. Purified recombinant TC45 interacts directly with biotinylated α1-cyt peptide and the interaction is sensitive to competition with 11 μM α1-peptide but not α2-peptide 删除21:<u>(Fig. [2C]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>.

Therefore, it was important to characterize whether they influence cell behaviour in a TC45-dependent manner. TCPTP is a known negative regulator of many mitogenic signalling pathways and acute silencing of TCPTP induces cell proliferation in cancer cells and alterations in signalling pathways \\[,\\]. To study the TC45-dependency of these compounds, we tested four of the compounds for their effect on cell proliferation in TC45 knockout and wt mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The cells were incubated with the compounds at indicated concentrations for 72 h and live cells were detected. Strikingly, spermidine displayed specificity towards TC45, since TC45 knockout cells were 43-fold more resistant to the compound than wt cells, suggesting that the presence of TCPTP makes the wt cells more sensitive to the drug regarding proliferation 删除21:<u>(Fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. Since spermidine can be oxidized in serum-containing culture \\[\\], we cannot rule out the possibility that the spermidine effect is in fact a function of a spermidine-derived compound.

Here we tested the effect of spermidine on VEGF-induced sprout formation in HUVEC spheroids (Korff, Augustin 1999).

Importantly, the ability of spermidine to inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial sprouting was at least partially dependent on TC45.

The somewhat limited effects induced by the TCPTP siRNA in these experiments are most likely due to moderate TCPTP silencing achieved in HUVEC 删除21:<u>(Fig. [5D]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>.

Many of the targeted specific therapies have failed and a growing view is that compounds hitting several targets at the same time may be more beneficial than single specificity agents (Fojo 2008). Furthermore, many patients develop resistance to the clinically used inhibitors, which could be circumvented by targeting the same pathway via other means. TCPTP is a well-characterized negative regulator of several cancer relevant RTKs including EGFR \\[\\], cMet \\[\\], PDGFRβ \\[\\], Insulin receptor \\[\\], and VEGFR2 \\[\\]. In addition, TCPTP is an important player in immune cells, suggesting that activating it might be advantageous also in treating inflammatory conditions \\[,\\]. Here we have applied a large scale HT-screen to identify small molecules capable of activating TCPTP. Our results demonstrate that one of the compounds, spermidine, is capable of activating TC45 in vitro. Activation of TC45 with spermidine attenuates EGFR, PDGFRβ and VEGFR2 signalling in different cell types and models. This suggests that TCPTP activators could possess the desired capacity of targeting multiple pathways and circumventing known acquired resistance mechanisms to TKIs like mutations in the ATP binding sites of RTKs.\n\n【49】The chemical structures of the small molecule activators of TC45 are presented in Fig. [1C]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. They are all discrete entities and the main obvious common feature is that most of the compounds contain positively charged amine-groups. Mitoxantrone is a well-known agent used in chemotherapy. It interferes with both DNA and RNA and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II \\[\\]. Mitoxantrone is used in treatment of prostate cancer and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), as well as multiple sclerosis \\[-\\]. Therefore, it was not surprising that its cytotoxic effects were not TC45-dependent in cells 删除21:<u>(Fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. However, it was the most potent activator of TC45 in vitro and this could be due to its long, rigid and flat structure, which is sufficiently large to achieve high-affinity binding to TCPTP at a site that overlaps the α1-cyt binding site. Thus structural information from this hit could be useful if TCPTP activators are to be developed further.\n\n【50】Spermidine is a long, flexible, positively charged polyamine involved in cellular metabolism \\[\\]. The fact that spermidine inhibits cell proliferation and attenuates RTK signalling in a TC45-dependent manner is somewhat surprising, considering that all cells contain substantial amounts of at least one of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine \\[\\]. However, based on our data it is clear that acute treatment with micromolar extracellular spermidine, which is taken up by an effective transport system and possibly metabolised to spermidine derivatives, is sufficient to result in activation of TC45 and subsequent negative regulation of signalling pathways. This would be in line with a previous report which demonstrated that spermidine or spermidine related compounds, which have been derived from spermidine via oxidation, are cytotoxic to cells with upregulated growth pathways \\[\\] and previous reports demonstrating spermidine effects on RTK signaling \\[,\\]. At present, the direct interaction between TCPTP and α1-cytoplasmic tail is the only mechanism of TCPTP activation in cells that has been characterized in detail \\[\\]. The structure of spermidine resembles that of α1-cyt in that both contain positively charged amine groups, and this may be reflected in its ability to trigger cellular responses similar to α1-TAT peptide 删除21:<u>(Fig. 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>)</u>. This is further supported by our finding that spermidine interacts with TC45 at overlapping sites. It is obvious that none of the molecules identified here are suitable therapeutic agents for the modulation of TCPTP function in human malignancies. This is mainly due to two reasons. First, the identified compounds have also other targets in cells. Second, they may present limited membrane permeability due to a highly ionized nature and the highly flexible, non-drug-like structures of some of the compounds. However, they provide important structural information and may function as starting points for the development of TCPTP activators in the future.\n\n【51】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【52】To the best of our knowledge similar PTP agonist screens have not been published and thus the hits add to the few examples of PTP activating molecules described thus far \\[,\\]. In conclusion, the small molecule TCPTP activators described here improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of α1-cyt-mediated activation of TC45 and can allow rational design of improved TC45 activators that could become clinically relevant therapeutics in the future.\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests\n===================</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors\\' contributions\n=======================</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>EM carried out the phosphatase assays, western blots, sprouting assays and also drafted the manuscript.

Our previous studies indicate that the selective inhibition of tumor cell growth by ET-18-OCH3 may be due to altered signal transduction mechanisms, including the inhibition of PKC. To further define the mechanism of action of ET-18-OCH3, we have used it to study the role of PKC in regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which is activated by diverse stimuli. In the 293.27.2 human kidney cell line, as in hematopoietic cells of all lineages, NF-kappa B is stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). The response to either TNF-alpha or IL-1 alpha is synergistically enhanced by TPA. However, the regulatory mechanisms and signal transduction systems responsible for NF-kappa B activation in response to these different stimuli have not been determined in detail. We have used ET-18-OCH3 and auranofin, which inhibit PKC by different mechanisms, to assess the role of PKC in NF-kappa B activation. ET-18-OCH3 markedly inhibits TPA-induced NF-kappa B activation, as measured by HIV long terminal repeat-directed expression of beta-galactosidase. The IC50 for inhibition by ET-18-OCH3 is approximately 2 microM, a noncytotoxic concentration. Inhibition of TPA-induced NF-kappa B activation was dependent upon preincubation with ET-18-OCH3, and the drug was active at approximately 2 mol% of total cellular phospholipid. ET-18-OCH3 did not inhibit NF-kappa B activation by either TNF-alpha or IL-1 alpha, indicating that there are multiple distinct signal transduction pathways leading to activation of NF-kappa B. We have confirmed these results using auranofin, an antirheumatic drug that is a specific PKC inhibitor interacting with the catalytic domain. Like ET-18-OCH3, auranofin blocked NF-kappa B activation by TPA but not by TNF-alpha or IL-1 alpha. Also like the ether lipid, auranofin only partially blocked the synergy exhibited by TPA and TNF-alpha. To confirm the role of NF-kappa B in this response, we measured NF-kappa B by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Both ET-18-OCH3 and auranofin inhibited cellular induction of the active NF-kappa B complex in response to TPA but not in response to TNF-alpha.删除23:<u>(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

There was no hematuria, oliguria, dysuria and lower urinary tract symptoms. She was evaluated elsewhere with contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan which revealed contracted left kidney with 2 calculi in the lower and middle calyx of 8--9 mm each with intrapelvic mass and multiple air pockets in the renal pelvis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【6】The retrograde uretrogram (RGU) done also revealed renal fungal ball (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【7】She had undergone cytoscopy and left DJ stenting elsewhere but continued to have fever and flank pain when she was presented to us. After routine investigation, patient was started on 3rd generation cephalosporin and she underwent left percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) which revealed brownish gray material with 2 calculi. Portion of the specimen was sent to the pathology laboratory for histopathological examination.\n\n【8】Gross specimen consists of multiple irregular gray brown tissue bits, largest measuring 0.5 cm×0.5 cm and cut portion showed gray brown areas. Section showed fungal ball containing aggregates of macerated, distorted fungal hyphae with some showing acute angle branching surrounded by cell debris and neutrophils.\n\n【9】Both urine and biopsy material sent to mycology laboratory for culture investigation were inoculated on Sabourauds dextrose agar (Hi-media Laboratories Ltd. Mumbai) and incubated at 37 °C and 28 °C which grew a rapidly growing fungus with flat, white to creamy having a smooth texture later becoming hairy consistent with Geotrichum candidum (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【10】Identification was based on the morphological characters and the biochemical test profiles. Geotrichum candidum was morphologically identified by the presence of true hyphae, hyaline smooth, one-celled, subglobose to cylindrical, slimy arthroconidia and the lack of blastoconidia. The arthroconidia vary in size and germinate at one end giving a 'hockey stick appearance' (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【11】Biochemical identification was carried out in the mycology laboratory, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal using both conventional and API 20C yeast identification system (Biomerieux Inc.). It was further differentiated from Trichosporon by the absence of urea utilization and inability to assimilate carbohydrate; maltose, sucrose, lactose, cellobiose, inositol raffinose and trehalose. Glucose, galactose and xylose were assimilated.\n\n【12】Antifungal susceptibility testing for the isolate was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document M38-A2. The MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration) for amphotericin, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were found to be 0.125 μg/mL, 16 μg/mL, 4 μg/mL and 0.25 μg/mL respectively.\n\n【13】Patient continued to have fever in the post-operative period and responded only after starting intravenous itraconazole 200 mg bd for 2 days followed by oral itraconazole 200 mg bd and continued for 6 weeks. During the follow up, a repeat CT done showed complete clearance of the fungal material from the left kidney.\n\n【14】3. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#s0015}</u>\n=============\n\n【15】The saprophytic colonization of a preformed cavity by conglomerate of fungal mycelia without invasion of adjacent tissue is termed as fungal ball or fungal bezoar . Renal colic can be caused by passage of fungal ball that obstruct the collecting system. Genitourinary tract is rarely a site of primary fungal infection with exception of Candida species, however it may be involved as a result or part of systemic infection. Candidal infection can cause pyelonephritis, abscess, papillary necrosis and obstruction with fever and flank pain ,\n\n【16】Genitourinary fungal infections are usually encountered as a part of disseminated disease in immunocompromised host (AIDS, corticosteroids, malignancy, neutropenia) , .\n\n【17】Fungal balls also called and fungal bezoars or accretions are known to cause ureteral and uretro-pelvic junction obstruction. Diagnosis is established by identification the of fungi in urine and imaging studies using (Computerized tomography, ultra sonography, intravenous urography) that document obstructive uropathy and soft tissue density with in renal collecting system . Morello et al. have successfully managed the removal of bilateral renal pelvis mycotic bezoars using a mechanical thrombectomy device followed by antifungal renal pelvis irrigation . Percutaneous nephrostomy, tract dilation and fluoroscopically guided extraction of renal fungal ball under epidural anesthesia is described by Doemeny et al.\n\n【18】The outcome of Geotrichum infections depend on the degree of tissue invasion by the organism and the immune status of the host . Sheehy et al. suggested that Geotrichum lack virulence and ability to colonize renal tubules based on the rarity of disseminated disease, lack of tissue invasion and their rapid clearance in most of the case reported .\n\n【19】Although rare, Geotrichum candidum is potential pathogen in immune compromised hosts. Its incidence may be under reported since it can be misdiagnosed histopathologically as Candida, Aspergillus or Trichosporon. This possibility of misinterpretation highlights the importance of obtaining repeated fungal cultures in addition to histopathological examination. Our patient was successfully managed by antifungal therapy and endourological debulking. We hereby reiterate the pathogenic potential of Geotrichum candidum and report its role in causing renal fungal ball.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest 删除19:<u>{#s0020}</u>\n====================</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are none.</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors acknowledge Dr. Bhalaguru Iyyan, Department of Urology and Dr. Geetha V, Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College-Manipal, Manipal University for their contribution during the work up of this case.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![CT scan image showing the renal fungal ball with two calculi.](gr1)删除19:<u>{#f0005}</u></u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![Retrograde uretrogram showing renal fungal ball.](gr2)删除19:<u>{#f0010}</u></u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![Colony macroscopy of Geotrichum candidum on Sabourauds dextrose agar after 5 days of incubation at 28 °C.](gr3)删除19:<u>{#f0015}</u></u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>![Wet mount preparation showing germinating arthrospores with a 'hockey stick appearance'---40×.](gr4)删除19:<u>{#f0020}</u>\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

There are three basic patterns of infection in the ICU: primary endogenous, secondary endogenous, and exogenous. In exogenous infection, no microbial carriage precedes colonization and infection. In endogenous infection, infection is preceded by oropharyngeal or GI carriage. A primary endogenous infection is caused by an organism carried by the patient on admission to the ICU, whereas a secondary endogenous infection is caused by organisms acquired in the ICU. The traditional approach to infection control in the ICU has included frequent hand washing, limiting the use of agents for prophylaxis of stress-ulcer bleeding, and limiting the use of injectable antimicrobials to the treatment of infection in order to prevent resistance. The recognition that hand washing only partially reduces endogenous infection led to the use of nonabsorbable antimicrobials to abolish oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, the use of an injectable antimicrobial during the first four days in the ICU to control primary endogenous infection was considered not to lead to resistance as long as it was combined with nonabsorbable antimicrobials. Of 41 fully reported clinical trials of SDD, 33 showed a significant reduction of infectious morbidity among patients who received SDD. Of the 32 trials in which carriage of potential pathogens was a measured endpoint, 31 showed a reduction in carriage. Of the 24 studies in which resistance was an endpoint, 22 showed no increase in resistance associated with SDD. Only 10 of 35 trials that examined death showed a significant decrease in mortality.

In the taperebá SDE extract, 46 substances were identified, and (Z)-caryophyllene (13.2%) and limonene (9.5%) were predominant. From the 42 substances found in the SDE extract of cajá, the major components were myrcene (38.0%) and p-cymene (6.2%). The two fruits showed similar chromatograms upon the use of SDE and SPME. These methods made it possible to determine 30 identical components in both fruits by using SDE and 32 by using SPME.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) are oral hypoglycemia agents (OHAs) that inhibit α-glucosidase in the brush border of the small intestine for delaying carbohydrate breakdown and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Several clinical trials have reported elevated liver enzyme levels in patients who received AGIs therapy compared with those who received a placebo. Several case reports have already reported reversible hepatotoxicity after AGIs use, along with re-exposure confirmation. The exact mechanism of AGIs-induced liver injury is idiosyncratic. The peak plasma concentrations of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) who received AGIs were approximately 5 times higher than those of volunteers with normal renal function. Therefore, AGIs are not recommended for patients with advanced CKD because of the risk of accumulation and lack of studies that support this prescription. However, many advanced CKD patients receive AGIs for glucose control because AGIs have been shown to be effective, safe, and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes; therefore, AGIs are of particular research interest. Many practitioners continue to prescribe AGIs even when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) falls to less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2^, possibly with dose adjustments, to account for reduced renal clearance of the compounds. A Taiwanese study reported that AGIs were used in 6.4% of CKD patients. Oral AGIs are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and then almost completely eliminated in the urine, and renal failure greatly influences pharmacokinetics and drug plasma levels. However, the exact association between AGIs and the risk of liver injury in advanced CKD is not warranted, which makes it difficult to determine this association in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. We examined the relationship between the use of AGIs and liver injury in advanced CKD patients in a Taiwanese population-based cohort.\n\n【1】Results\n=======\n\n【2】This study included 1765 diabetic patients with advanced CKD who received AGIs therapy and 5295 diabetic patients with advanced CKD who did not receive AGIs therapy as matched controls. The characteristics of these 2 groups of patients are summarized in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. The mean age of the enrollees was 63 ± 11 y and nearly 51% were men. The baseline comorbidities, including cardiovascular comorbidities, and the Charlson score, were comparable. The chronic hepatic comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis and alcoholic or viral liver diseases, did not differ between the groups. Patients in the study group were more likely to experience subsequent ESRD during the study period (92.3% vs. 82.5%). Insulin and OHA (including biguanide, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 inhibitors), meglitinide, thiazolidinedione, and sulfonylurea) were more frequently used in the study group (all P \\< 0.05).\n\n【3】AGIs versus the risk of hepatic injury\n--------------------------------------\n\n【4】AGIs prescription was not associated with an increased risk of liver injury in advanced CKD patients (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] 1.56, 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 0.80--3.04, P = 0.22) among recent users (HR 2.92, 95% CI 0.27--31.48, P = 0.38) or former users (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04--4.31, P = 0.44) while accounting for the cumulative time-varying measurements of the other OHA mediators of interest. The models revealed an increased risk of liver injury in men, and baseline liver disease patients. The C-index value (0.56) indicated high validity for the model (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The sensitivity analysis, which excluding baseline liver disease also proved that AGIs was not associated with increased risk of liver injury ([supplement table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>).\n\n【5】To evaluate the cumulated dose effect of AGIs on liver injury in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, DDD within 30--210 d before the event was plotted on GAM plots (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). A turning point is defined as the maximum slope of the tangent line on the basis of the curve. The mean DDD within 30--210 d (\\<0.4, which was equal to 120 mg of acarbose) was associated with a non-significant increased risk of liver injury, as indicated by the turning point.\n\n【6】The multivariate stratified analysis revealed no increased risk of liver injury across all examined subgroups, including the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, subsequent ESRD, or each OHAs use, including metformin, DPP4-inhibitors, thiazolidinedione, or sulfonylurea (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Moreover, a high or low DCSI score based on diabetes-related organ damage was not associated with an increased risk of liver injury after AGIs use.\n\n【7】Discussion\n==========\n\n【8】AGIs are not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance \\<25 mL/min/1.73 m^2^ because studies examining the safety of AGIs use in patients with advanced CKD are limited. In our population-based study, no increased risk of acute liver injury after AGIs use was observed in advanced CKD patients. Our results are consistent for recent and former AGIs users, and patients with chronic liver disease or those who eventually developed ESRD.\n\n【9】First approved in 1995, AGIs inhibit intestinal α-glucosidase, an enzyme for digestion and absorption of starch, disaccharides, and dextrin, and are commonly used for controlling postprandial blood glucose. In the gastrointestinal tract, 1--2% of oral AGIs are absorbed and then almost completely eliminated in the urine. AGIs have well-documented safety profiles and have been reported to effectively treat diabetes, with an advantage of reducing cardiovascular risk. Several studies have reported that the effects of AGIs as a monotherapy are similar to those of other antidiabetic agents in mitigating glycosylated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels, and the effects of AGIs are similar to those of metformin, as reported in a Chinese-based cohort. AGIs use in advanced CKD patients is avoided because this therapy has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n【10】The incidence of AGIs-induced liver injury is considerably low and unpredictable. In a phase III American trial, liver enzyme abnormalities were reported in 3.8% of AGIs-treated patients (21 of 550 patients), which is similar to the estimated percentage of AGIs-induced liver injury in our study; however the percentage in our study was higher than that of the placebo group in the trial (0.9%, 5 of 567 patients). Numerous clinical trials have reported that patients who receive AGIs therapy are more likely to experience elevation of liver enzymes than those who receive a placebo, although most of them are asymptomatic and recovered rapidly after discontinuation of drug use. Several early case reports have reported that liver injury typically develops 1--2 months after AGIs therapy is started and has a hepatocellular pattern, with mainly ALT elevation. Although this nondeleterious hepatic effect of AGIs during recent or formal use may be a spurious association caused by confounding by contraindication, our findings still support the safety of AGIs use in diabetic patients with advanced CKD in real-world practice. This study also found male as a risk factor for AGIs related liver injury. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has been extensively studied and there is still mixed evidence to support the host factors such as sex or chronic liver disease in the development of DILI. Further prospective studies may be warranted to elucidate the host factor including genetic predisposition to the development of AGIs related liver injury.\n\n【11】Glucose control in CKD patients is a complex issue. Progressive loss of renal function impairs renal gluconeogenesis and causes hypoglycemia; conversely, insulin resistance can be worsened by deteriorated renal function and accumulation of uremic toxins, thus causing hyperglycemia. OHA administration complicates this issue further because a reduced GFR leads to the accumulation of these drugs and their active metabolites with a consequent increased risk of side effects. To eliminate the confounding effect of other OHAs on liver injury, subgroup analysis was performed with each OHAs. It proved that whether patients were prescribed with other OHAs or not, there is no increased risk of hepatotoxicity in AGIs group. AGIs have an advantage over other OHAs because they are poorly absorbed into the systemic circulation, and AGIs mechanisms do not expose patients to the risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n【12】The exact mechanisms underlying AGIs-induced liver injury are not well known. In rats, AGIs induced a significant, dose-dependent increase in hepatic glycogen concentrations, which was present after 3, 7, and 28 d of AGIs administration. Light and electron microscopy results proved that the increase in hepatic glycogen concentration was caused by lysosomal storage of glycogen. AGIs are metabolized exclusively and absorbed poorly within the gastrointestinal tract; therefore, systemic toxicity with liver injury is not anticipated and remains unexplained. Early studies on liver biopsy in AGIs-induced hepatitis patients have reported inflammatory cells infiltration in lobules and portal tracts. Animal studies have reported that administration of a high AGIs dose in rats induces lysosomal glycogen storage in the liver. Idiosyncratic reaction-related liver injury is favored over direct toxic reaction-related liver injury, which may be associated with an immunological reaction with the bacterially derived oligosaccharide molecule. Collectively, our results did not indicate the apparent dose-dependent effects of AGIs on liver injury, which is consistent with the proposed idiosyncratic mechanism. We further examined the potentially interactive comorbidities on liver failure, such as old age, concomitant systemic diseases, and chronic liver disease. Predisposing liver disease is theoretically complicated by liver-related alterations in drug metabolism and the possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity. In our study, the risk of AGIs-induced liver injury was not significantly augmented despite disease stratification. Besides, a model excluding previous chronic liver disease, virus hepatitis and liver cirrhosis was performed to consolidate the results. This finding is consistent with that of a previous study, in which AGIs were reported to be a safe and effective drug used in the treatment of cirrhotic patients with low-grade hepatic encephalopathy and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【13】The strength of our study is the large sample size and nearly complete nationwide coverage of prescriptions and outcomes. The propensity score matching and the nationwide-based study design counteract the selection bias. Using the NHIRD, it is possible to detect the considerably low incidence rate of the adverse effects of drugs. We did not enroll highly selected homogeneous patients, like those recruited in clinical trials. In our study, adverse AGIs effects can be investigated in a real clinical situation. However, there were several limitations. First, drug-induced liver injury was diagnosed by exclusion clinically, and careful evaluations for competing etiologies are essential. However, this was not easily to be achieved with current study design. To minimize the uncertainty of causality between AGIs and liver injury, we further analyzed the DDD influence on outcomes. In addition, we performed multivariate stratified analysis to confirm the robustness of results. Second, the misclassification or unawareness of liver injury by physicians is a probable concern in a register-based study. Liver injury was validated from a local study including randomly sampling records of 102 hospitalized patients in a medical center. The rate of liver injury in our study was similar to previous studies. Third, because the biochemical data, virological profiles, sonographic data, and the response to rechallenge are not available in the Taiwanese NHI database, we were unable to calculate the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences scale for causality assessment in drug-induced liver injury or follow the international drug induced liver injury Expert Working Group consensus. Therefore further prospective studies were needed to elucidate the impact of host factors including sex or genetic predisposition and other socioeconomic factors on the risk of AGIs related liver injury.\n\n【14】In conclusion, we observed that AGIs treatment are not associated with an increased risk of liver injury in advanced CKD patients, even in patients who eventually developed ESRD, and in recent or former AGIs users. Neither accumulated dose-dependent effects of AGIs nor comorbidities of chronic liver disease aggravated AGIs-induced liver injury. Additional randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm our results.\n\n【15】Research Design and Methods\n===========================\n\n【16】Data source\n-----------\n\n【17】This was a nationwide population-based cohort study that used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The NHIRD contains data released for research purposes in 1999 and randomly selected from the claims records of the National Health Insurance (NHI) program of Taiwan, which is a single-payer system covering nearly 99% of all Taiwanese residents. The database includes all of the registry and claims data, ranging from demographic data to detailed prescribed and dispensed medications in outpatient and inpatient care. The dispensed medications, including names of drugs, were based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. The classification includes the quantity, frequency, and dates of drug dispensation and reimbursement. AGIs and other OHAs were identified by their specific ATC code. The NHI claims data regarding medications are reliable because they were collected on the basis of NHI procedures and drug codes that were related to the NHI reimbursement system and were audited. The identification numbers of all patients in the databases were encrypted to protect their privacy; therefore, this study was exempted from a full ethical review by the Institutional Review Board of National Taiwan University Hospital (201212021RINC).\n\n【18】Study subjects\n--------------\n\n【19】Based on the reimbursement regulations of the NHI, ESA (erythropoietin-stimulating agent) can be prescribed only for anemic advanced CKD patients having a hematocrit level of ≤28% and a serum creatinine level of \\>6 mg/dL (equivalent to an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m^2^) for achieving a hematocrit level of 33--36%. The baseline comorbidities, including CKD, were identified from at least 3 outpatient visits or one inpatient claim within 1 y preceding the first prescription of ESA with the highest positive accuracy. This identification method has been widely validated with high predictive power. In Taiwan, CKD diagnosis was based on the eGFR according to the The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. A Taiwanese study reported that 85% of patients with advanced CKD not yet requiring dialysis received ESA therapy in 2012. Besides, the median hematocrit level in patients who initiated dialysis was 24.2% in Taiwan. Therefore, this selected cohort is the most representative population of the predialysis stage 4--5 of CKD in Taiwan.\n\n【20】Only patients who did not undergo dialysis (identified using the procedure codes) before and 90 d after the first ESA prescription were enrolled to ensure a sufficient dialysis-free follow-up duration. Patients who underwent renal transplantation before ESA and those who did not survive 90 d after the first ESA treatment were excluded. In addition, we excluded the following patients: age older than 100 y or younger than 20 y, no diagnosis of diabetes mellitus within 1 y, who received AGIs within 1 y, who received renal transplantation, who died within 90 d, and who had a history of acute liver injury within 1 y before the index date (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【21】The day of ESA prescription was defined as the index date. We extracted all the relevant data, including demographic information, diagnosis codes, and drug prescriptions. Patients who received AGIs therapy after the index date were defined as the study group, and those who did not receive AGIs therapy were matched using the propensity score and defined as the control group. For each patient in the study group, 3 propensity score-matched counterparts were selected from the control group.\n\n【22】Comorbidities identification\n----------------------------\n\n【23】We defined the diseases on the basis of the diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The accuracy of the NHIRD claims data for diabetes diagnosis has been validated, To balance the risk of diabetes-related severity, we estimated the Diabetes Complications Severity Index (DCSI) for matching the 2 groups with similar diabetes-related comorbidities.\n\n【24】The ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes defined chronic liver disease, including viral hepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and alcoholic liver disease, and other causes of liver cirrhosis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplement Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). A previous validation study used the hospital administrative database and reported a positive predictive value of 90% on the basis of the aforementioned definition.\n\n【25】The cumulated dosage of AGIs\n----------------------------\n\n【26】For comparing the quantity of drug use to the risk of liver injury, we used the defined daily dose (DDD), which is defined as the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. According to the WHO definition, 300 mg of acarbose equals 1 DDD. Dose-dependent effects of AGIs on liver injury were examined by analyzing the DDD effects on the risk of liver injury. We defined recent and former AGIs users as patients who filled their prescription for AGIs within 30--60 d and 30--210 d, in that order, before the outcome event date. We did not include medications prescribed within 30 d preceding the outcome event to reduce the potential confounding effects caused by indication.\n\n【27】Outcomes\n--------\n\n【28】The outcome of interest was defined as patients being diagnosed for hepatic injuries, which was mainly adopted from a previous study, carried out by Jinjuvadia et al. and Kao WY et al. The liver injury included disorders of bilirubin excretion (ICD-9-CM code 277.4), acute and sub-acute necrosis of the liver (ICD-9-CM code 570), other sequelae of chronic liver disease (ICD-9-CM code 572.8), hepatitis (ICD-9-CM code 573.3), other specified liver disorders (ICD-9-CM code 573.8), other specified disorders of the biliary tract (ICD-9-CM code 576.8), and jaundice (ICD-9-CM code 782.4). The observation period lasted from the index date to the date of reporting liver injury, to death, or until December 31, 2010, whichever occurred first. In Taiwan, the records were validated for drug-induced liver injury on the basis of a 2-fold increase in the serum ALT level compared with the baseline, and the records were highly accurate with a positive predictive value of 89.2%. Liver injury was validated using randomly sampling records of 102 hospitalized patients in a medical center.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n--------------------\n\n【30】The demographic characteristics between the study and control groups were compared using a 2-sided t test and an X^2^ test. A time-variable cox proportional hazards model was employed to clearly characterize the variability of prescription and the time-course relationship between AGIs use and outcome development. To examine the relationship between the AGIs and liver injury in patients with an underlying liver disease, we further performed multiple stratified analyses. Time-fixed and time-varying analyses were conducted.\n\n【31】We evaluated the risk factors of long-term outcomes using a Cox proportional hazards model. To eliminate the confounding factors of underlying liver disease on liver injury, we conducted another sensitivity analysis by excluding patients with chronic liver disease, virus hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Further, we performed a multilevel discrete-time event history analysis to determine the threshold values of the AGIs dosage for liver injury, using the logistic regression method by incorporating patient-specific random effects and adopting a generalized additive model (GAM) with splines regarding AGIs dosage. All calculations were performed using R software, Version 2.14.1 (Free Software Foundation, Boston, MA, USA).\n\n【32】Additional Information\n======================\n\n【33】通用删除5(英):<u>How to cite this article: Kao, C.-C. et al.

Intracerebral injection of large amounts of glutamate between 5 min and 2.5 min after passive avoidance learning in young chicks inhibits short-term memory, which occurs between 0 and 10 min post-learning in a three-stage model of memory formation first established by Gibbs and Ng通用删除7(英):<u>(25)</u> [Physiol. Behav. 23:369-375; 1979]. This effect may be attributed to non-specific excitation. Blockade of glutamate uptake by L-aspartic and beta-hydroxamate also abolishes this stage of memory, provided the drug is administered within 2.5 min of learning. Interference with either production of percursors for transmitter glutamate in astrocytes or with glutamate receptors is also detrimental to memory formation, but the effects appear much later. After its release from glutamatergic neurons, glutamate is, to a large extent, accumulated into astrocytes where it is converted to glutamine, which can be returned to glutamatergic neurons and reutilized for synthesis of transmitter glutamate, and partly oxidized as a metabolic substrate. The latter process leads to a net loss of transmitter glutamate which can be compensated for by de novo synthesis of a glutamate precursor alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG) in astrocytes, a process which is inhibited by the astrocyte-specific toxin fluoroacetate (R. A. Swanson, personal communication). Intracerebral injection of this toxin abolishes memory during an intermediate stage of memory processing occurring between 20 and 30 min post-training 通用删除7(英):<u>(50)</u> [Cog. Brain Res, 2:93-102; 1994]. Injection of methionine sulfoximine (MSO), a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, which interferes with the re-supply of transmitter glutamate to neurons by inhibition of glutamine synthesis in astrocytes, has a similar effect. This effect of MSO is prevented by intracerebral injection of glutamate, glutamine, or a combination and alpha KG and alanine. MSO must be administered before learning, but does not interfere with acquisition since short-term memory remains intact. Administration of either the NMDA antagonist AP5, the AMPA antagonist DNQX, or the metabotropic receptor antagonist MCPF, also induces amnesia. Memory loss in each case does not occur until after 70 min post-training, during a protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory stage which begins at 60 min following learning. However, to be effective, AP5 must be administered within 60 s following learning, MCPG before 15 min post-learning, and DNQX between 15 and 25 min after learning. Together, these findings suggest that learning results in an immediate release of glutamate, followed by a secondary release of this transmitter at later stages of processing of the memory trace, and that one or both of these increases in extracellular glutamate concentration are essential for the consolidation of long-term memory. Since both fluoroacetate and MSO act exclusively on glial cells, the findings also show that neuronal-glial interactions are necessary during the establishment of memory.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The treatment options of these lesions include endovascular treatment, direct intralesional injection of sclerosing agents, ligation of feeders, and surgical excision.\\[--\\] We hypothesize that a well-planned surgical excision is sufficient to achieve satisfactory outcome for management of cirsoid aneurysm. In this study, we evaluate the surgical results of nine patients with cirsoid aneurysms without any preoperative interventions for the lesion and our results are compared with literature results.\n\n【3】Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec1-2}</u>\n=====================\n\n【4】This is a retrospective case series study on nine patients with cirsoid aneurysms who were treated with surgical excision during the period from January 2004 and January 2010.

The following investigations were done preoperatively: Plain and contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, MR angiogram, and selective internal and external carotid angiograms, to document the location, size, feeding arteries, and venous drainage of the lesions and if there are associated intracranial lesions. In CT skull, the lesion appeared as soft tissue scalp swelling while in MRI as numerous flow voids underlying the subcutaneous tissue \\[通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>\\].

The pericranium underlying the lesion was thicker than normal in all patients and there were large feeding vessels. During elevation of the flap, it was of great importance not to damage these large feeding vessels in order to avoid excessive bleeding and they were cauterized or ligated.\n\n【12】The galea around the lesion was incised and the lesion was separated from the underlying skin using a combination of bipolar diathermy and sharp dissection \\[通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4c]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>\\].

However, it is generally accepted that it may be either of congenital or traumatic origin.\\[\\] Many such lesions have been reported after interventions such as hair transplantation, craniotomy, infusions through scalp veins\\[--\\] In approximately half the cases reported in the literature, there is no history of trauma; iatrogenic, or otherwise.\\[\\] Khodadad 通用删除7(英):<u>(1971)</u>\\[\\] reported three siblings with occipital cirsoid aneurysms which were present since birth. Nagasaka et al.\\[\\] believed that at least in some of the cases, there might have been functionally nonpatent fistulae which were clinically unrecognized and already existed before trauma. They believed that trauma just activated the fistulae to become patent. Once the shunts were established, they received more blood through the abundant collaterals in the scalp. In our study, history of trauma was present in five (55.6%) patients many years before the appearance of the lesion.\n\n【25】The superficial temporal artery is particularly vulnerable to trauma due to its long and relatively exposed course in the scalp.\\[\\] For this reason, the superficial temporal artery is involved in 75% of the cases in Barnwell et al.\\[\\] study and in 90.5% of the cases in Gurkanlar et al.\\[\\] study. In our study, the STA was involved in 77.85 of cases.\n\n【26】The lesion usually begins as a small, subcutaneous lump in the head which over a period of time evolves into a large deforming mass. A bruit or a throbbing headache might be the chief complaint in some patients. Other presenting symptoms include pulsatile tinnitus or rarely, hemorrhage from the mass.\\[\\] Occasionally, large lesions may be associated with scalp necrosis.\\[\\] Congestive heart failure has occurred with large fistulas.\\[\\] Also large lesions are rarely associated with cerebral steal phenomenon that resulted in neurological symptoms including seizure.\\[\\] All the patients in our serie shad a pulsatile swelling with bruit and thrill. Five (55.6%) patients had headache and only one patient presented with ulceration of the skin. None of our patients had history of bleeding from the lesions or any neurological deficits.\n\n【27】The highest incidence of these lesions was seen during the third decade of life.\\[\\] In our study, the mean age of patients was 25.6 (±5.54 STD) years (range 19-35 years).\n\n【28】Diagnosis of cirsoid aneurysm of the scalp can be made easily on clinical examination. Angiography is the gold standard investigation to delineate the lesion and to exclude anintracranial component.\\[\\] Other supplementary investigations are CT, MRI, and MRA. MRA is non-invasive and may become the best alternative to the conventional contrast angiography in evaluation of the cirsoid aneurysm. In our study, all the patients had preoperative plain and contrast enhanced CT, MRI, MRA, and selective internal and external carotid angiograms and postoperative MRA. None of our patients had any associated intracranial lesion.\n\n【29】As the use of endovascular techniques has been improved, authors offer embolization of these lesions based upon the suggestion that these lesions are very difficult to manage surgically due to severe intraoperative blood loss, and they may have vital risk.\\[\\] Endovascular interventions, both transarterial and transvenous routes, have been used. Endovascular methods involve the placement of glues or thrombogenic coils or radio-opaque gel foam either in the fistula or the feeding arteries.\\[\\]\n\n【30】Intralesional injection of sclerosing agents like sodium tetradecyl sulfate, absolute alcohol, thrombogenic coils also has been used.\\[--\\] In selected cases, this therapy has completely obliterated the lesions without need for further intervention.\\[\\]\n\n【31】However, these techniques are not without pitfalls. Tenderness and hyperemia over the skin, necrosis over the lesion, permanent patchy hair loss, pain at the fistula site and escape of embolization material into the general circulation are the complications that can be seen after both endovascular and percutaneous embolization procedures.\\[\\] Surgery was also performed after these procedures especially for tenderness and necrosis following embolization.\\[\\] In addition, there have been reports of recurrences following endovascular intervention.\\[\\]\n\n【32】Ligation of the feeding arteries was one of the earlier treatments performed for this condition. However, this is almost always followed by recurrence because of the development of collateral vessels.\\[\\] The collateral vessels which develop following ligation of the feeding arteries might parasitize blood flow from the brain leading to ischemic complications.\\[\\]\n\n【33】In one of the largest series of these lesions reported to date, surgery alone gave excellent results.\\[\\] Also many authors concluded that conventional excision of the lesion is possible in the vast majority of cases and surgery is neither difficult nor dangerous.\\[\\] However, in many cases where the lesion cannot be totally excised either because of the excessive vascularity or because the overlying skin is exceedingly thin, en bloc resection of the scalp with subsequent reconstruction is a feasible option.\\[\\] Some recommended preliminary step in the operation by independently ligating the principal artery or arteries, leading to the lesion followed by excision of the lesion.\\[\\] Also some recommend preoperative endovascular intervention either transarterial or transvenous to reduce blood loss followed by excision of the lesion.\\[\\]\n\n【34】In our study all patients were treated surgically without any prior interventions for the lesion. Total excision of the lesion was achieved in eight patients and en bloc resection and primary closure was done in one patient because of the small size of the lesion and the very thin overlying skin. All the patients had postoperative magnetic resonance angiogram without residual lesion. No postoperative complication related to the surgery had occurred. We think that, injection of local anesthetic solution with adrenaline at the site of skin incision, individually ligating and dividing the large vessels as they were encountered in the incision prior to raising the scalp flap, gentle dissection of the scalp from the cirsoid aneurysm, ligation of the feeding and draining vessels, followed by the resection of the lesion together with underlying pericranium, are important steps to achieve the operation without massive hemorrhage. While ligating the feeding arteries, the scalp AVM spontaneously gets smaller and at the end of the procedure, one observes only a small amount of AVM \\[通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4d]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>\\].\n\n【35】The main advantage of the surgical resection of cirsoid aneurysms is the prevention of very often seen recurrences because of a development of collateral vessels following embolization of cirsoid aneurysms.\\[--\\] In our study, no recurrence have been occurred during a mean follow up period of 34.1 (±7.62 STD) months. There have been reports of cirsoid aneurysms recurring as long as 18 years after surgical excision.\\[\\] Hence, we believe that these patients should be closely followed for possible recurrences.\n\n【36】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec1-5}</u>\n==========\n\n【37】Well-planned surgery of cirsoid aneurysm of the scalp without preoperative interventions could achieve complete excision of the lesion without any residual masses or recurrence and with a low incidence of complications. Preoperative interventions should not be used as a routine management for these lesions but it should be preserved for advanced and complex lesions.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Source of Support: Nil</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest: None declared.\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The pathogenesis of PF involves a multitude of factors mediating crosstalk between various tissue components. Some factors, such as transforming growth factor beta, are recognized as key elements in the process, whereas the role of others, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is unclear. We investigated if Balb/c mice, known to be fibrosis resistant partly due to lack of CTGF induction upon stimulation with bleomycin, can be transformed into fibrosis-sensitive individuals by generation of a CTGF-rich environment using transient overexpression of CTGF by adenoviral gene transfer (AdCTGF). We show that AdCTGF is not sufficient to cause fibrosis, and that bleomycin challenge results in inflammation, but not fibrosis, in Balb/c mouse lungs. This inflammation is accompanied by lower levels of CTGF and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene expression compared with fibrosis-prone C57BL/6 mice. However, concomitant administration of AdCTGF and bleomycin leads to a persistent upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene and a significant fibrotic response in Balb/c similar to that in C57BL/6 mice. We propose that CTGF is an important mediator in the pathogenesis of PF in that it provides a local microenvironment in the lung that causes individual susceptibility.

A recent study showed that IL-10 gene expression induced by endotoxin (LPS) in mouse macrophages is controlled by the cooperation of the promoter-selective transcription factors (Sp)1 and Sp-3 as well as by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). Dexamethasone (Dex) has been recommended during cardiac surgery since it increases blood IL-10 levels during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and reduces the release of proinflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor alpha. In an experimental model of cardiac surgery, it reduces the production of iNOS and COX-2.\n\n【2】This study was designed to identify the signaling pathways involved in intrahepatic overexpression of IL-10 induced by pretreatement by Dex before CPB.\n\n【3】Methods\n=======\n\n【4】Animals were treated with Dex (1 mg/kg) (n= 9) or with saline (n= 6) given intervenously before normothermic CPB.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of approximately 100 studies examining gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms reported a pooled prevalence of 13.3% worldwide, 17.1% in Europe, 15.4% in North America, 10.0% in Asia and 2.5% in China. Patients with GORD are categorised as having non-erosive reflux disease or erosive oesophagitis (EO), which are the two main phenotypes. Using endoscopic examination, EO is graded by the severity of the mucosal injury, also referred to as mucosal breaks according to the Los Angeles (LA) classification system, which ranges from grade A (mild) to grade D (severe).\n\n【12】The main aim of EO treatment is to relieve symptoms, heal and maintain remission of EO, prevent complications, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered the standard treatment for EO and have an established efficacy and safety profile. The high potency of PPIs results from their ability to inhibit the gastric enzyme hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H^+^, K^+^ ATPase), which is responsible for gastric acid secretion by the parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. However, many early-generation PPIs have a slow, cumulative onset of action whereby several doses may be required to achieve maximum acid suppression and symptom relief.\n\n【13】Vonoprazan (TAK-438) belongs to a class of acid-inhibitory agents called potassium-competitive acid blockers, which, unlike PPIs such as lansoprazole, reversibly inhibit H^+^, K^+^ ATPase independently of acid pH. Of note, vonoprazan is stable in the presence of acid, is water-soluble and does not require a specific pharmacological preparation such as an enteric coating, unlike PPIs, which suggests that vonoprazan may have less variation in time to onset of action than PPIs. Furthermore, in contrast to PPIs that take 3--5 days to produce their maximum acid-inhibitory effects, vonoprazan demonstrates maximum acid-inhibitory effects from the first day of administration. Vonoprazan was approved and marketed in Japan in February 2015 for the treatment of acid-related GI disorders, including EO, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, peptic ulcer, reflux oesophagitis and Helicobacter pylori eradication. Recent phase II and III clinical trials in Japan have demonstrated that vonoprazan 20 mg and 40 mg is effective, well-tolerated and non-inferior to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to EO healing at 8 weeks. In a long-term maintenance study over 52 weeks, EO recurred in fewer than 10% of patients treated with once-daily vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg dose.\n\n【14】Vonoprazan 20 mg is the approved dose in Japan for the treatment of EO. However, the non-inferior efficacy and safety of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO has not been demonstrated in Asian patients. This phase III study was conducted to meet the regulatory registration requirements in mainland China, South Korea and Taiwan. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg at 8 weeks in Asian patients with EO. The secondary objectives were to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg at 2 and 4 weeks, and to compare the safety of treatment with vonoprazan versus lansoprazole in this patient population.\n\n【15】Methods 删除19:<u>{#s2}</u>\n=======\n\n【16】Study design 删除19:<u>{#s2-1}</u>\n------------\n\n【17】This was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted in 56 sites across Asia.

Patients in the vonoprazan group received a 20 mg active vonoprazan tablet or a placebo capsule for 30 mg lansoprazole, while patients in the lansoprazole group received a 30 mg active lansoprazole capsule or a placebo tablet for 20 mg vonoprazan. Patients with healed EO at either 2, 4 or 8 weeks after the start of the study were considered completed cases and were invited to enrol in the longer term maintenance study 通用删除1(英):<u>(TAK-438_305, NCT02388737)</u>, which was ongoing at the time of writing. A total of six visits were scheduled during the study: at the start of the observation phase (visit 1), at the start of the treatment phase after randomisation (visit 2), and then after 2 (visit 3), 4 (visit 4), 6 (visit 5; liver function testing only) and 8 (visit 6) weeks of treatment.\n\n【18】The study was conducted between March 2015 and July 2017 and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\n【19】Participants 删除19:<u>{#s2-2}</u>\n------------\n\n【20】Eligible patients had endoscopically confirmed EO (LA classification grades A--D) within 14 days of randomisation (treated as outpatients or temporarily admitted) and aged ≥18 years. Key exclusion criteria were prior exposure to vonoprazan or lansoprazole within 84 days of the observation phase, or exposure to vonoprazan at any time in a previous clinical trial or as a therapeutic agent; hypersensitivity or allergy to vonoprazan, its excipients or to PPIs; significant history of central nervous system, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, GI, urological, endocrine or haematological disease; presence of comorbidities or medical or surgical history that could affect the oesophagus; acute upper GI bleeding or gastric or duodenal ulcer within 30 days of the observation phase; history of or treatment for malignancy within 5 years of visit 1; and creatinine \\>2 mg/dL (\\>177 μmol/L), or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal at the start of the observation phase.\n\n【21】Study endpoints and assessments 删除19:<u>{#s2-3}</u>\n-------------------------------\n\n【22】The primary efficacy endpoint was EO healing rate at 8 weeks. The secondary efficacy endpoints were EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Endoscopy was performed at the start of the screening period and at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (or on early termination) under fasted conditions and classified in terms of LA classification grades (A--D or no mucosal breaks (grade O)). EO healing was defined as 'no mucosal breaks'. During the 8-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed from any endoscopy test performed at visit 3, 4 or 6. During the 2-week treatment period, healed EO was confirmed at visit 3 and during the 4-week treatment period at visit 3 or 4.\n\n【23】Additional efficacy endpoints included the subjective symptoms of EO as recorded in patient diaries (eg, heart burn, gastric acid regurgitation), HRQoL over 8 weeks and the percentage of days without rescue medication during treatment. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs), laboratory test values, ECG, vital signs, serum gastrin values and pepsinogen I/II values. AEs and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities V.18.0.\n\n【24】Statistical analyses 删除19:<u>{#s2-4}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【25】Assuming an 8-week healing rate of 94.7% in both treatment arms and a 20% dropout rate, it was estimated that 160 patients per group would provide 90% power to establish non-inferiority with a --10% margin using a two-sided 95% CI. A sample size of 240 subjects per group was planned to provide more subjects with healed EO for the subsequent maintenance study (TAK-438_305) and to provide adequate subjects to meet the regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which the study was being conducted. The proportion of patients with LA classification grade C/D was planned to be ≥30%.\n\n【26】Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using the full analysis set (FAS), defined as randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had at least one postbaseline endoscopy. Safety was analysed using the safety analysis set (SAS), defined as patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. No statistical tests or inferential statistics were generated for the safety data. For the primary (EO healing rate at 8 weeks) and secondary (EO healing rates at 2 and 4 weeks) efficacy endpoints, two-sided 95% CIs were calculated for the difference between the vonoprazan and lansoprazole treatment arms. Non-inferiority was claimed if the lower bound of the CIs was ≥--10%. If non-inferiority was demonstrated for the primary efficacy endpoint, the secondary efficacy endpoint of EO healing rate at week 2 was tested for superiority between the vonoprazan and lansoprazole treatment arms. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to adjust for covariates in the FAS with baseline LA classification as a stratification factor. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated in a prespecified subgroup analysis in patients with LA classification grade A/B or C/D.\n\n【27】Results 删除19:<u>{#s3}</u>\n=======\n\n【28】Patients were enrolled from March 2015 to June 2017 across Asia (mainland China, 27 sites; South Korea, 12; Taiwan, 11; Malaysia, 6).

In addition to those resulting in discontinuation, additional SAEs included colon adenoma (experienced by one patient in the vonoprazan group), and glaucoma and large intestine polyp (one patient each in the lansoprazole group). Generally, there were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory, ECG and vital signs, and there were no on-study deaths.\n\n【58】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#s4}</u>\n==========\n\n【59】This is the first study to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy and safety of once-daily vonoprazan 20 mg to once-daily lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO at 8 weeks in Asian patients, predominantly from mainland China, and from Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan (92.4% vs 91.3%, respectively; difference: 1.1% (95% CI --3.822% to 6.087%)). These findings are consistent with the results reported in a previous phase III study which demonstrated the non-inferiority of vonoprazan 20 mg to lansoprazole 30 mg with respect to healing EO at 8 weeks (99% vs 95.5%; difference: 3.5% (95% CI 0.362% to 6.732%)). Of note, there were differences in the 8-week EO healing rate reported by Ashida et al and the present study, which could be attributed to treatment compliance. Ashida et al  reported a 98% treatment compliance rate, whereas in the present study 93% of Asian patients were treatment-compliant, which could have resulted in the lower EO healing rate reported in our findings. Although our findings differ from the aforementioned pivotal study in Japan, the healing rate with lansoprazole reported in this study was similar to those reported in China.\n\n【60】There was a rapid response to treatment with both the overall population and those with LA classification grade C/D demonstrating a healing rate of \\>60% at 2 weeks with vonoprazan treatment. In the overall population, the EO healing rate at 2 weeks was numerically higher with vonoprazan than that observed with lansoprazole (75.0% vs 67.8%), which may be indicative of a more potent and faster clinical effect with vonoprazan than with lansoprazole treatment resulting from the rapid and strong suppression of gastric acid secretion. The results of a previous phase III study conducted in Japan reported higher healing rates with vonoprazan 20 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg treatment (90.7% vs 81.9%; difference: 8.8% (95% CI 2.105% to 15.448%)) at 2 weeks. As previously mentioned, the differences observed could be attributed to the differences in treatment compliance and the overall low EO healing rates in patients treated with PPIs among Asians, excluding Japanese patients.\n\n【61】The prevalence of GORD has increased in some Asian countries over the past few decades, largely owing to the ageing population and Westernisation. Despite the presence of a wide choice of therapeutic modalities and improvements in the therapeutic management of GORD, there remain several areas of unmet need, including but not limited to the treatment of advanced grades of EO, maintenance treatment of EO and refractory GORD. At present, PPIs are considered the gold standard for the treatment of GORD; however, healing rates in patients with advanced grades of EO have been limited. In the present study, subgroup analysis in patients with baseline LA classification grade C/D showed persistently higher EO healing rates at 2, 4 and 8 weeks with vonoprazan, compared with lansoprazole treatment.\n\n【62】It has been predicted that a 100% healing rate in EO can be achieved after 4 weeks with a pH \\>4 holding time ratio (HTR) of ≥90%, and after 8 weeks with a pH \\>4 HTR of ≥75%. Results from a published study have reported that the HTR with vonoprazan 20 mg was more than 83% at gastric pH ≥4 on day 7, suggesting that EO could be successfully treated especially in patients with severe EO (LA classification grades C/D) as it effectively controls both daytime and night-time acid secretion. In another study, EO healing rates in patients with LA classification grade C/D were 96% vs 82.6% at week 2, 100% vs 87% at week 4, and 100% vs 93.5% at week 8 with vonoprazan 20 mg versus lansoprazole 30 mg treatment, respectively. Furthermore, the results of a third study also demonstrated higher EO healing rates with vonoprazan treatment in patients with baseline LA classification grade C/D compared with lansoprazole after 8 weeks (98.7% vs 87.5%, respectively).\n\n【63】Patients self-administered study medications, including lansoprazole, each day after breakfast as the prescribing information for lansoprazole in China and Japan did not specify dose timing with respect to mealtimes. Of note, published phase I studies suggested that the gastric inhibitory effect of lansoprazole following 7 days of daily dosing was unaffected by food intake. There is lack of evidence to suggest differences in efficacy related to the timing of lansoprazole dosing between Asian and non-Asian patients.\n\n【64】From this study, 312 patients with endoscopically confirmed healed EO at 2, 4 or 8 weeks were enrolled in the randomised, multicentre, 24-week maintenance study (TAK-438_305) designed to evaluate the recurrence of EO after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with vonoprazan 10 mg and 20 mg compared with lansoprazole 15 mg .\n\n【65】Vonoprazan and lansoprazole were similarly well tolerated in the populations studied. The incidences of TEAEs were similar between the treatment arms. Drug-related TEAEs occurred slightly more frequently with vonoprazan (36/244, 14.8%) than with lansoprazole (27/235, 11.5%) treatment. Of note, there were no new safety signals and no deaths were reported during the study.\n\n【66】The sensitivity of vonoprazan in ethnic variations had been examined by looking at effects on pharmacokinetics linearity, metabolism by hepatic cytochrome (CY)P450 enzymes, therapeutic index and drug accumulation with repetitive dosing. Although vonoprazan exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetic characteristics, the dose-normalised exposure (maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve) for Chinese and Japanese subjects is similar, indicating that the non-linearity does not contribute to potential differences in exposure. CYP2C19 phenotypes do not affect vonoprazan pharmacokinetic parameters, indicating that ethnic differences in phenotypical distribution of CYP2C19 are not expected to play a major role in contributing to metabolic differences among Chinese, Japanese and other ethnic populations. There is evidence that vonoprazan exhibits a wide therapeutic index; it has been demonstrated that a single dose of vonoprazan 120 mg was well tolerated. There is also evidence that multiple doses of 40 mg per day were well tolerated. Interaction of vonoprazan and clarithromycin, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, resulted in an almost twofold increase in oral bioavailability, but this was not associated with a significant alteration in efficacy and/or safety as plasma concentrations remained within the therapeutic window. In addition, given that the dosing interval of vonoprazan is 24 hours and that the accumulation factor is two when the dosing interval is equal to the half-life, which is 9.4 hours, vonoprazan accumulation under CYP3A4 inhibition will be considerably lower than twofold. Taken together, this evidence suggests that vonoprazan may be insensitive to differences in ethnicity.\n\n【67】One limitation of this study was that CYP2C19 genotyping was not evaluated in Asian patients and thus we were unable to examine the efficacy of vonoprazan in patients with the extensive metaboliser phenotype. However, given the similarity of EO healing rates between the present study and the previously published pivotal study conducted in Japanese patients, the proportion of patients receiving vonoprazan with healed EO in the present study is expected to be higher in patients identified as CYP2C19 extensive metabolisers compared with patients receiving lansoprazole. Future vonoprazan studies investigating EO should also include night-time symptoms, such as heart burn and night-time awakening.\n\n【68】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#s5}</u>\n==========\n\n【69】In conclusion, these results demonstrated that vonoprazan 20 mg once daily was non-inferior to lansoprazole 30 mg once daily for healing EO at 8 weeks and was well tolerated, thus indicating that vonoprazan is effective for the treatment of EO in Chinese patients. Similar efficacy trends were observed in Korean and Malaysian patients.\n\n【70】The authors would like to thank the patients who have participated in this trial and their families.

HBoV is the second parvovirus currently being discussed as a cause of disease in humans. Comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the HBoV genome has revealed a close association between HBoV and the canine minute virus and the bovine parvovirus, both of which are members of the Bocavirus genus. To date, several HBoV isolates with high sequence homology have been described \\[\\].\n\n【1】Parvoviruses are small, nonenveloped viruses that are characterized by linear single-stranded DNA genomes of 4--6 kb. Common characteristics of parvoviruses are their exceptional stability and the structural simplicity of the virions \\[\\]. The icosahedral virus capsids generally consist of 2 proteins (viral protein 1 \\[VP1\\] and viral protein 2 \\[VP2\\]) that have identical sequences, except for the aminoterminal domain of VP1 (known as the \"VP1 unique region\"), which spans 129 and 227 amino acids in HBoV and parvovirus B19 (B19V), respectively \\[\\]. B19V VP2 proteins have been shown to possess all the characteristics required for particle formation. Viruslike particles (VLPs) consisting of VP2 alone or of VP2 and VP1 may be produced in various eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. recombinant baculovirus or yeast) \\[, \\].\n\n【2】HBoV has been a target of epidemiologic studies since its initial detection. To date, by use of polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, HBoV has been detected not only in clinical respiratory tract samples but, also, in fecal excretions from young children in Australia, North America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, thereby indicating a worldwide distribution of the virus \\[\\]. The prevalence of HBoV DNA in samples obtained from children and infants with symptoms of respiratory illness has been found to be 1.5%--18.3%, and it may vary depending on seasonal fluctuation and the age of the patients studied. Because the majority of epidemiologic studies have been performed retrospectively, HBoV has not been clearly identified as a sole infectious agent responsible for respiratory diseases. In fact, HBoV tends to be associated with a high rate of coinfection with other respiratory viruses (e.g. picornaviruses, adenoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus) in children. Clinical symptoms associated with HBoV infections include cough, fever, pneumonia, and bronchitis. To date, only single reported cases of HBoV infections in adults have been observed, mainly in immunocompromised individuals \\[, \\].\n\n【3】Immunologic studies have described the use of recombinant HBoV VP1 protein in the detection of virus-specific IgG responses in the Japanese population \\[\\]. Thereby, ubiquitous VP1-specific antibody responses (with a seroprevalence of up to 100%) were detected in adult individuals and in children (age, \\>6 years), whereas a seronegative status was predominantly noted among young children at 1 year of age. No data are currently available on HBoV-specific T cell immunity. Numerous studies of B19V, however, have described viral capsid proteins as immunodominant targets of the cellular and humoral immune response \\[\\], suggesting a possibly similar role for HBoV capsid proteins in virus-specific immunity.\n\n【4】In the present study, we describe the recombinant expression and characterization of HBoV VP2 VLPs and their use in the detection of cellular immune responses against HBoV in healthy adults.\n\n【5】Materials and Methods\n=====================\n\n【6】Study subjects and serologic testing. A total of 69 healthy, white individuals (39 men and 30 women; mean age, 39 years \\[range, 23--73 years\\]) from the southeastern region of Bavaria, Germany, were studied to identify HBoV- and B19V-specific T cell responses ([table 1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) and to detect the presence of virus-specific antibodies by means of ELISA. For HBoV, 100 ng of HBoV VP2 VLPs were coated on Nunc-Immuno MediSorp plates (Nunc) in PBS overnight at 4°C, washed 6 times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and blocked with dilution buffer (PBS containing 2% Tween 20 and 3% FCS) for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation with serum samples (1:100 in dilution buffer) was done for 2 h at 37°C, the plates were washed, and an anti-human IgG-specific, horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Dako Deutschland) (1:6000 in dilution buffer) was added for 1 h at 37°C. Development was performed using BD OptEIA Substrate (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions.

A recombinant baculovirus encoding the VP2 gene of the HBoV ST2 isolate was generated using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). In brief, the VP2 gene was amplified from a pCR 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) that included the genome sequence of HBoV ST2 (GenBank accession number NC_007455) (provided by Tobias Allander, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden), by use of the primers 5′-GAGGAGCGGCCGCATGTCTGACACTGACATTC-3′ and 3′-CCGCCCTCGAGTTACAACACTTTATTGATG-5′ with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes OY). The amplicon was introduced into the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) by the Xho I and Not I restriction sites. Generation of recombinant HBoV VP2 bacmid pFastBac/VP2bac and its subsequent transfection into Sf9 insect cells were performed according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. The resulting virus, bacVP2/HBoV, was amplified in 3 consecutive passages of infection and subsequently was used for protein production. For the expression of B19V VP2 VLPs, the previously established and described recombinant baculovirus bacVP2/B19V was used \\[\\].\n\n【9】Production and purification of recombinant HBoV VLPs. Production of both HBoV and B19V VLPs was achieved in High-5 insect cells. Cells were cultured in Insect-Xpress medium (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville), infected with bacVP2/HBoV or bacVP2/B19V at an MOI of 3, and harvested 72 h after infection. Recombinant VLPs were purified by cesium chloride (CsCl) cushion centrifugation. A total of 6 × 10^7^ cells were lysed in 5 mL of buffer containing 10 mmol/L Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L NaCl, 15 mmol/L MgCl~2~, and 0.5% Triton X-100 with 40 µl/mL Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and then were subjected to successive freeze-thaw cycles. The precleared lysates were loaded on double cushions consisting of CsCl solutions with densities of 1.52 g/cm^3^and 1.22 g/cm^3^ in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mmol/L Tris/HCl \\[pH 8.7\\], 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Ultracentrifugation was performed at 100,000 g for 4 h at 10°C without brakes. After centrifugation, protein samples were collected in fractions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Endotoxin contaminations of fractions containing antigen were excluded using the QCL-1000 Chromogenic LAL Endpoint Assay (Lonza), and they were determined to be 1.57 EU/mg and 8.2 EU/mg for HBoV and B19V VP2 VLPs, respectively. Characterized antigens underwent dialysis against PBS and were stored in aliquots at −80°C. Freeze-thaw cycles of the purified proteins were avoided.\n\n【10】Isolation and culture of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized blood samples by means of Pancoll centrifugation (PAN Biotech) (at 800 g for 30 min) with the use of Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One).

As negative and positive controls, cells were stimulated with 5 µg/mL HIV p24-derived murine e10F peptide \\[\\] and 5 ng/mL staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Sigma Aldrich), respectively. For development, the plates were incubated for 2 h with 1 µg/mL biotinylated anti-IFN-γ 7-B6-1 Biotin antibody (Mabtech) and for 1 h with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (diluted 1:1000 in PBS). Staining was performed using the NBT/BCIP Stock Solution (Roche Diagnostics) in buffer containing 0.1 mol/L NaCl, 0.1 mol/L Tris/HCl \\[pH 9.5\\], and 0.05 mol/L MgCl~2~.

Similar capacities for other parvoviruses, such as B19V, the canine parvovirus, and the porcine parvovirus, have been described elsewhere \\[, \\]. By use of electron microscopy and CsCl gradient centrifugation, HBoV VP2 VLPs were shown to possess a diameter comparable to that of native HBoV virions \\[\\] and sedimentation densities similar to those of capsids of the canine parvovirus \\[\\].\n\n【32】Recombinant VLPs are potent reagents for virologic and clinical research and have greatly contributed to the improvement of sensitive diagnostic tests and the development of vaccine against many viruses (e.g. human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus) \\[, \\]. Recombinant VP2 particles are known to be crucial in the diagnosis of B19V infections, because virus-specific antibodies lose their affinity against linear antigenic regions in a time-dependent manner and are replaced by humoral responses against conformational epitopes \\[\\]. Whether similar applications can be established for HBoV VP2 VLPs needs to be assessed in further studies.\n\n【33】Using HBoV VLPs, we observed frequent VP2-specific humoral immune responses in healthy adults, whereas seronegative status was predominantly detected in young children (age, ≤ 2 years) \\[, \\]. Furthermore, this finding is strongly supported by recent epidemiologic data, which describe a seroprevalence of HBoV-specific IgG antibodies that already reaches up to 100% during early childhood \\[\\]. Because of the very young age of the seronegative individuals, it was not possible to obtain blood samples with volumes sufficient for the analysis of HBoV-specific T cell immunity.\n\n【34】In seropositive adults, frequent cellular immune responses were observed after HBoV VP2 VLP stimulation. The median number of cells secreting IFN-γ against HBoV was thereby shown to be slightly lower than the median number of cells secreting IFN-γ against VP2 particles of B19V, which previously have been shown to serve as targets for IFN-γ- and IL-10-mediated CD4^+^ T helper cell responses \\[, \\]. However, this observation was mainly based on 4 study subjects who exhibited high cytokine responses against the B19V VP2 proteins. These single high responses might be explained by possible recent B19V infections or viral restimulation, because the average seroprevalence of B19V in the German adult population is 77%, and, therefore, acute infections may occur in adults \\[\\].\n\n【35】Compared with synthetic peptide controls, slightly elevated IFN-γ responses against B19V VP2 VLPs were observed in seronegative individuals. This finding suggests that minor, unspecific cytokine secretion may be induced in blood cells by means of residual pyrogens (e.g. endotoxin) included in recombinant antigen but not in synthetic peptide preparations \\[\\]. However, HBoV VP2-specific T cell responses were not detected in all individuals studied, because, for many donors, only low or undetectable IFN-γ secretion was observed, suggesting antigen specificity of the detected T cell responses.\n\n【36】In the study group, an age-dependent decrease in HBoV-specific T cell responses was observed. This might be the result of an age-related decrease in and an impairment of the amount and functions of virus-specific T cell populations, because it has been described for other viral infections (e.g. for populations with adenovirus) \\[\\]. Furthermore, it is known that active T cell responses against pathogens undergo confinement to specific memory populations with increasing time after primary infection in the absence of exogenous restimulation events or endogenous reactivations of latent viral infections. Because all currently published data on the epidemiologic profile of HBoV strongly suggest that primary infection occurs in the very early years of childhood \\[, \\], the time-dependent reduction in the number of virus-specific T cells might be explained by a lack of frequent pathogen contact. This may be considered to provide additional proof of the early time point when HBoV infection occurs during childhood. Independent of age, female subjects had higher numbers of cells secreting IFN-γ than did male subjects, especially among younger individuals; this finding possibly indicates more-frequent spontaneous viral restimulation (e.g. by increased contact with children with acute infection), resulting in an overall increase in the HBoV-specific cellular immune response. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the most prominent difference in sex-specific cellular responses was observed in individuals born between 1970 and 1979, an age group in which women presumably have the most frequent contact with small children. However, because no information on the family status of the study subjects is available, these data will have to be confirmed by additional epidemiologic investigations.\n\n【37】Potential conflicts of interest: none reported.\n\n【38】Financial support: German Research Foundation (grant Mo620/7-1); Deutscher Akademischer Auslandsdienst (grant PPP-Finland D/04/04483).\n\n【39】[^1]: Present affiliation: Deutsches Rheumaforschungszentrum, Berlin, Germany.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Steel structures subjected to cyclic loading are vulnerable to fatigue damage. Once fatigue cracks initiate, they may propagate at an increasing growth rate and finally cause catastrophic failure of the structures. In order to extend the service life and avoid the fatigue failure of fatigue-damaged steel members, rehabilitation, which can reduce time and economic cost, is preferred to the replacement or reconstruction of the damaged structures \\[,\\]. As the externally-bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) technique has been widely used to repair or strengthening concrete structures and masonry structures in the past several decades, this technique has proven to be a promising alternative to the traditional strengthening technique \\[,\\]. In recent years, this technique has received much attention in regard to repairing or strengthening fatigue-damaged steel structures \\[,\\]. Many experimental studies have indicated that externally-bonded carbon-FRP (CFRP) laminates can significantly decrease the crack growth rate and extend the fatigue life of cracked steel members \\[,,\\].\n\n【2】For a cracked steel member, the crack growth life is the main contributor to the fatigue life. Based on linear elastic fracture mechanics, the most important parameter in determining the crack growth life is the stress intensity factor which characterizes the magnitude of the singular stress field near the crack tip. Once the value of the stress intensity factor is known, the crack growth rate and crack growth life can be determined based on the crack growth laws of linear elastic fracture mechanics \\[,,\\]. Therefore, calculations on the stress intensity factor of FRP-strengthened cracked steel members are essential for evaluating the fatigue strengthening of cracked steel members.\n\n【3】For some steel members with simple crack configurations and loading, the expressions of the stress intensity factor have been provided in handbooks \\[,\\]. However, the expressions in the handbooks will no longer be applicable to FRP-strengthened cracked steel members as the strengthening effects of FRP laminates are not considered in the expressions. Currently, numerical methods are usually used to calculate the values of the stress intensity factor for FRP-strengthened cracked steel members. Many finite element (FE) models have been developed, such as the plate-spring model \\[\\], the three-layer plate model \\[\\], the two-layer plate-brick model \\[\\], the 3D brick model \\[\\], the 3D brick-spring-shell model \\[\\], and the 3D brick-spring model \\[\\]. In order to predict the crack growth behavior and fatigue life of an FRP-strengthened cracked steel member, many FE models corresponding to different crack lengths usually need to be developed to calculate the stress intensity factors at different crack lengths \\[,\\]. This procedure is sometimes time-consuming and inconvenient. If theoretical expressions of the stress intensity factors were derived, the crack growth behavior could be evaluated conveniently. This motivated the current authors to develop theoretical expressions of the stress intensity factors for FRP-strengthened cracked steel members.\n\n【4】Nonetheless, investigations on the theoretical expressions for FRP-strengthened cracked steel members have been rather limited. Existing studies have mainly focused on FRP-strengthened center-cracked and single-edged cracked steel plates \\[,\\]. For an FRP-strengthened cracked steel plate, the stress field at the crack tip becomes more complicated when the effects of the FRP laminates and adhesive layers are considered. An exact analytical solution is an almost intractable task. In order to simplify the analysis, correction factors are usually introduced in the stress intensity factor expressions of unstrengthened steel plates. Several studies have proposed simplified expressions of the stress intensity factor for the center-cracked and single-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates \\[,\\]. According to these equations, the crack growth behavior of FRP-strengthened center-cracked and single-edged cracked steel plates can be predicted expediently. However, to the best knowledge of the investigators, calculation equations of the double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates have not yet been reported in the literature.\n\n【5】In light of this research gap, this paper investigated the stress intensity factors of double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates with theoretical and numerical methods. The stress intensity factor solution for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with FRP plates was extended to develop expressions of the stress intensity factors by introducing two correction factors. Then, three-dimensional (3D) FE models were developed to carry out parametrical investigations on the stress intensity factors and the correction factor, β. Correction factor β was formulated and calibrated based on the FE results. Finally, the proposed expressions were validated by comparing the theoretical and numerical results.\n\n【6】This research shows that the stress intensity factors for FRP-strengthened double-edged cracked steel plates can be calculated using the proposed expressions instead of by numerical methods. As a result, the crack growth behavior and crack growth life of FRP-strengthened double-edged cracked steel plates can be predicted conveniently. Moreover, the proposed expressions can also be used to develop the expressions of the stress intensity factor for FRP-strengthened steel beams with double-edged cracks in tension flange.\n\n【7】2. Geometry of Specimens 删除19:<u>{#sec2-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n========================\n\n【8】A geometric schematic of the specimens is presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The length and width of the steel plate were 2l and 2b, respectively. The thickness of the steel plate was 2t~s~. Two through-thickness edged cracks were created on two sides of the steel plate. The length of each edged crack was a. Although the crack in this study was simplified to an ideal configuration without considering randomness in the crack geometry, such a simplification is typically used in the field of the fracture mechanics \\[\\] where stress intensity factor solutions have only been developed for some ideal crack configurations. Moreover, a previous study \\[\\] conducted by the current authors showed that the crack growth of FRP-strengthened double-edged cracked steel beam could be approximately predicted by assuming that the cracks at two edges are identical, indicating that such a simplification has practical significance. The FRP plates were bonded on the two sides of the steel plate. The FRP bond length was 2l~f~, and the bond width was the same as the width of the steel plate, i.e. 2b. The thickness of the FRP on each side was t~f~. A uniform adhesive layer was assumed, and the thickness was t~a~.\n\n【9】3.

Stress Intensity Factor for the Cracked Plates Without Strengthening 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot1-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】According to linear elastic fracture mechanics, the stress intensity factor at the crack tip of an infinite center-cracked plate under tension for mode I crack opening is expressed by $${K = \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>},$$ where K is the stress intensity factor for mode I crack opening; σ~0~ is the remote-field tension stress applied on the steel plate; and a is one-half of the central crack length.\n\n【12】For some finite cracked plates, the stress intensity factor can be calculated according to stress intensity factor handbooks \\[\\]. The unified expression is given by $${K = F \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>},$$ where F is the general correction factor that considers the effects of stress gradient, crack shape, surface crack, finite thickness and width of plate, and the eccentricity of crack against the central axis of the plate, which is given by \\[\\] $${F = F_删除19:<u>{g}</u> \\cdot F_删除19:<u>{e}</u> \\cdot F_删除19:<u>{s}</u> \\cdot F_删除19:<u>{t}</u> \\cdot F_删除19:<u>{h}</u>},$$ where F~g~ is the correction factor for the stress gradient; F~e~ is the correction factor for the crack shape; F~s~ is the correction factor for a surface crack; F~t~ is the correction factor for the finite thickness and width; and F~h~ is the correction factor for the eccentricity of a crack against the central axis of the plate. For example, for finite-size plates with a through-thickness center-crack under uniform tension stress, F~g~ = F~e~ = F~s~ = F~h~ = 1. It can be seen that the values of the stress intensity factor for the finite cracked plates can be obtained by multiplying by the correction factor F. It follows that the stress intensity factor solution for the infinite center-cracked plate is the basis of the solutions for other finite cracked plates. Based on this concept, the stress intensity factor solution for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with FRP plates may serve as the fundamental part of the solution for FRP-strengthened cracked steel plates. Hence, the stress intensity factor solution for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with FRP plates is presented first.\n\n【13】3.2. Stress Intensity Factor for the Infinite Center-Cracked Steel Plate Strengthened with FRP Plates 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot2-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】For an infinite FRP-strengthened center-cracked steel plate subjected to remote-field tension stress, σ~0~, the remote-field tension stress, σ~0~, can be equivalent to the uniform tension stress, σ~s~, acting on the two surfaces of the center-crack through the superposition principle \\[,\\]. The uniform tension stress, σ~s~, is equal to the normal stress along the prospective crack path in the strengthening zones of the FRP-strengthened uncracked steel plate \\[,\\]. In order to calculate the stress intensity factors, the uniform tension stress, σ~s~, should be first obtained.\n\n【15】For an infinite FRP-strengthened uncracked steel plate under the remote-field uniform tension stress, σ~0~, the external force is shared by the steel plate, adhesive layer, and FRP plates. In order to simplify the derivation of tension stress, σ~s~, two assumptions were employed: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the tension stress shared by the adhesive layer was very small and was neglected; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> there were no force-lag effects between the FRP and steel plate, which demonstrated that the tension strains of the FRP and steel plate were identical. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> presents the stress components of the FRP-strengthened uncracked steel plate. Based on the force equilibrium, the following equation can be easily obtained:$${\\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>A_删除19:<u>{s}</u> = \\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>A_删除19:<u>{s}</u> + 2\\sigma_删除19:<u>{f}</u>A_删除19:<u>{f}</u>},$$ where σ~0~ is the remote-field uniform tension stress applied on the steel plate; A~s~ is the cross-sectional area of the steel plate; σ~s~ is the tension stress along the prospective crack path in the strengthened zone of the steel plate; σ~f~ is the tension stress of the FRP plates; and A~f~ is the cross-sectional area of FRP plates bonded on each side of the steel plate. The tension stress, σ~s~, in the strengthening zone of the steel plate can be derived with $${\\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u> = \\frac{\\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>}删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u>},$$ where S is the stiffness ratio between the FRP plate and the steel plate, which can be approximately expressed by $${S = \\frac{2E_删除19:<u>{f}</u>A_删除19:<u>{f}</u>}{E_删除19:<u>{s}</u>A_删除19:<u>{s}</u>} = \\frac{E_删除19:<u>{f}</u>t_删除19:<u>{f}</u>}{E_删除19:<u>{s}</u>t_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}},$$ where E~s~ and E~f~ are the Young's moduli of the steel and the FRP plate, respectively.\n\n【16】It can be seen that the tension stress in the strengthening zones can be reduced by bonding the FRP plates, and the reduction mainly depends on the stiffness ratio, S.\n\n【17】For the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with FRP plates, both the geometry size and crack length are infinite. As a consequence, the stress state approximately conforms to the plane strain condition; thus, the 3D problem was simplified to the plane problem. Considering the symmetrical conditions, the one-quarter model is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Two assumptions were employed to simplify the analysis: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the adhesive layer was only subjected to shear deformation, and the shear stress was uniformly distributed along the adhesive thickness; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the steel plate and FRP plate were the elastic continuum, and the flexural deformation of the steel plate and FRP plate was neglected.\n\n【18】The equilibrium equations for the FRP plate and the steel plate can be expressed, respectively, by $${\\frac{d\\sigma_删除19:<u>{f}</u>}删除19:<u>{dy}</u> - \\frac{\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{t_删除19:<u>{f}</u>} = 0},$$ $${\\frac{d\\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}删除19:<u>{dy}</u> + \\frac{\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{t_删除19:<u>{s}</u>} = 0},$$ where τ~a~ is the shear stress in the adhesive layer.

The relationship between the shear stress and shear strain can be expressed by $${\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u> = G_删除19:<u>{a}</u>\\gamma_删除19:<u>{a}</u> = G_删除19:<u>{a}</u>\\frac{u_删除19:<u>{f}</u> - u_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}{t_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}},$$ where G~a~ is the shear modulus of the adhesive. Combining Equations 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u> and 通用删除7(英):<u>(13)</u>, the governing differential equation for the shear stress in the adhesive layer can be derived by $${\\frac{d^删除19:<u>{2}</u>\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{dy^删除19:<u>{2}</u>} - \\lambda^删除19:<u>{2}</u>\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u> = 0},$$ where $${\\lambda^删除19:<u>{2}</u> = \\frac{G_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{t_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}\\left( {\\frac{1 - \\upsilon_删除19:<u>{f}</u>^删除19:<u>{2}</u>}{E_删除19:<u>{f}</u>t_删除19:<u>{f}</u>} + \\frac{1 - \\upsilon_删除19:<u>{s}</u>^删除19:<u>{2}</u>}{E_删除19:<u>{s}</u>t_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}} \\right)}.$$\n\n【21】By solving the above differential equation, the expression of the shear stress was obtained \\[\\]:$${\\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u> = \\tau_删除19:<u>{a}</u>^删除19:<u>{\\max}</u>e^删除19:<u>{- \\lambda y}</u>},$$ where τ~a~^max^ is the maximum shear stress at the end of the adhesive layer.\n\n【22】Based on the shear stress distribution along the y axis in the adhesive layer, the upper bound of the stress intensity factor for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with double-sided FRP plates was derived by Rose and Wang \\[\\]:$${K = \\frac{\\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}{\\sqrt删除19:<u>{k}</u>}},$$ where σ~s~ is calculated according to Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>, and the parameter k is expressed by $${k = \\frac删除19:<u>{S\\lambda}</u>{(1 + S)(1 - \\upsilon_删除19:<u>{s}</u>^删除19:<u>{2}</u>)}}.$$\n\n【23】In order to formulate a similar form to the classical expression of the stress intensity factor, as shown in Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>, Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(17)</u> can be rewritten as:$${K = \\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi c}</u>},$$ where $${c = \\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{\\pi k}</u> = \\frac{\\left( 删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u> \\right)}删除19:<u>{S}</u> \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\upsilon_删除19:<u>{s}</u>^删除19:<u>{2}</u>}删除19:<u>{\\pi\\lambda}</u>}.$$\n\n【24】Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(19)</u> was derived based on the infinite crack length, so the obtained stress intensity factor is the upper bound for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with double-sided FRP plates \\[\\]. When the crack is very short, the stress intensity factor can be approximately calculated by Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Such approximate calculations are conservative due to the strengthening effect of the FRP plates; thus, the calculation results can be considered as the lower bound of the stress intensity factor for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with double-sided FRP plates \\[\\]. For an arbitrary length, a, the following expression was formulated to calculate the stress intensity factor for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with double-sided FRP plates \\[\\]:$${K = \\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>\\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{\\pi ac}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>} = \\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{c}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>} \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{s}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>}.$$\n\n【25】It can be seen that the calculated results from Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(21)</u> approach the results from Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> when crack length a is far less than c. When the crack length is very long, the calculated results from Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(21)</u> approach the results from Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(19)</u>. This demonstrates that Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(21)</u> conforms to the upper and lower bounds.\n\n【26】By substituting Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> into Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(21)</u>, the stress intensity factor at the crack length of a under remote-field tension stress, σ~0~, for the infinite center-cracked steel plate strengthened with double-sided FRP plates can be calculated with the following expression: $${K = \\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u> \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{c}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>} \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u> = \\alpha_删除19:<u>{1}</u> \\cdot \\alpha_删除19:<u>{2}</u> \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>},$$ where $${\\alpha_删除19:<u>{1}</u> = \\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u>},$$ $${\\alpha_删除19:<u>{2}</u> = \\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{c}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>}}.$$\n\n【27】Compared with the stress intensity factor solution for the infinite center-cracked steel plate, two correction factors, i.e. α~1~ and α~2~, were introduced in the stress intensity factor solution for the FRP-strengthened infinite center-cracked steel plates to consider the FRP strengthening effect. The values of both correction factors were less than one, demonstrating that FRP strengthening could decrease the stress intensity factors. The strengthening effect of FRP plates mainly arises from the reduction of the stress and constraint to the crack opening \\[,\\]. The first correction factor, α~1~, represents the reduction effect of the remote-field tension stress, which mainly depends on the stiffness ratio, S. A larger stiffness ratio, S, can result in smaller stress intensity factor values. The second correction factor, α~2~, indicates the constraint effect to the crack, which mainly depends on the crack length, the stiffness ratio, S, the shear modulus, and the thickness of the adhesive. The stress intensity factor can be decreased by increasing the stiffness ratio, S, and the adhesive shear modulus, and/or reducing the adhesive thickness.\n\n【28】3.3. Stress Intensity Factor for the Double-Edged Cracked Steel Plate Strengthened with FRP Plates 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot3-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Based on the concept presented in [Section 3.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>, the stress intensity factor solution for the FRP-strengthened double-edged cracked steel plate was formulated by modifying Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(22)</u>. Finally, the following expressions were formulated by introducing two correction factors to calculate the stress intensity factors for the double-edged cracked steel plate strengthened with FRP plates: $${K = \\beta\\left( 删除19:<u>{a,b,S,}</u> \\right) \\cdot f(a,b) \\cdot \\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u> \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{c}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>} \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>},$$ $${f = \\left\\lbrack {1 - 0.025\\left( \\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> \\right)^删除19:<u>{2}</u> + 0.06\\left( \\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> \\right)^删除19:<u>{4}</u>} \\right\\rbrack\\sqrt{\\sec\\frac删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>删除19:<u>{2b}</u>}},$$ where f is the geometric correction factor of the unstrengthened cracked plate to allow consideration of the effect of the specimen's width, and β is the additional correction factor which is used to further consider the effect of FRP reinforcements. It is noted that although coefficients α~1~ and α~2~ consider the effect of FRP reinforcements, coefficient α~2~ is only suitable for the FRP-strengthened infinite cracked plate. Therefore, for the finite cracked plate, the additional correction factor β was introduced to correct coefficient α~2~. Given the main influencing factors of coefficient α~2~, the additional correction factor, β, may depend on the crack length, specimen width, stiffness ratio, S, and adhesive properties. In order to determine the main influencing factors of additional correction factor β, parametric investigations should be conducted. Considering the complexity of the stress intensity factors at the crack tip, an exact theoretical method is an almost intractable task in parametric investigations. Methods based on numerical simulations for determining the correction factor have been widely used in previous studies on stress intensity factors \\[,\\]. Therefore, FE simulations were carried out and are described in the following section.\n\n【30】4. Finite Element Modeling 删除19:<u>{#sec4-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n==========================\n\n【31】This section describes the FE analysis, which was conducted to investigate the stress intensity factors fordouble-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates. The FE results were used to investigate the main influencing factors on the stress intensity factors and additional correction factor β, to calibrate additional correction factor β.\n\n【32】4.1. The Geometry and Material Parameters of the Specimens 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot1-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】A total of four specimens were selected for the numerical parametric investigations, as listed in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. The height and thickness of the steel plate for all four specimens were 700 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The four specimens had different widths, i.e. 90 mm, 120 mm, 150 mm, and 200 mm, respectively. P-90 denotes the specimen with a width of 90 mm. Different crack lengths were set for each specimen to simulate the different degrees of damage before strengthening. The crack lengths changed at an interval of 5 mm for the four specimens. The effects of the FRP thickness, FRP Young's modulus, the adhesive thickness, and the adhesive shear modulus on the stress intensity factors were analyzed. The variable values of these parameters covered a wide range, as summarized in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. It should be noted that existing studies show that the FRP bond length has no effect on the stress intensity factor when the bond length is longer than the effective bond length \\[,\\]. Considering that an effective bond length is usually ensured in practical applications, the bond length was not considered as a variable in the FE modeling. The different combinations of FRP thickness and Young's modulus provided different stiffness ratios, S. The Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio of the steel were 206 GPa and 0.3, respectively, which remained unchanged in the parametric investigations for all specimens. The reference material properties of the FRP plate and the adhesive are listed as follows: the thickness and Young's modulus of the FRP plate were 1.4 mm and 165 GPa, respectively; the Poisson's ratio of the FRP plate was 0.28; the thickness and shear modulus of the adhesive layer were 1.0 mm and 900 MPa, respectively; and the Poisson's ratio of the adhesive was 0.35. When investigating the effect of one variable, the values of the other variables remained unchanged during the parametric investigations. Two extra specimens with different geometric sizes, i.e. P-200\\ and P-300\\, are also listed in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. These were used to validate the proposed expressions of the stress intensity factors.\n\n【34】4.2. FE Models 删除19:<u>{#sec4dot2-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n--------------\n\n【35】The 3D linear elastic FE models were developed using ANSYS software to calculate the stress intensity factors. One-quarter of the specimens were modeled considering symmetry conditions and thus, symmetrical boundary conditions were applied to the nodes on symmetrical planes. A uniform stress of 150 MPa was applied to the FE models at the longitudinal end of the steel plate. The typical FE meshes are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. In the FE models, the FRP plate and steel plate were modeled using the eight-node 3D solid element SOLID45, which has three translational degrees of freedom at each node. The mesh refinement was set in the vicinity of the crack tip. Twelve elements were meshed around the circumferential direction in the FE models, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The element length in the vicinity of crack tip was set to 1/40 of the crack length based on the mesh convergence analysis. Using the assumption that no relative slip occurred the FRP--adhesive interface or the adhesive--steel interface, the adhesive layer was modeled using the linear spring element COMBIN14. To simulate the axial and shear deformation of the adhesive layer, three COMBIN14 elements were installed between each node pair corresponding to the FRP--adhesive interface and the adhesive--steel interface. The shear and axial spring constants were obtained by \\[\\] $${K_删除19:<u>{i}</u> = \\frac{G_删除19:<u>{a}</u>A_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{t_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}},$$ $${K_删除19:<u>{z}</u> = \\frac{2\\left( 1 - \\nu_删除19:<u>{a}</u> \\right)G_删除19:<u>{a}</u>A_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}{\\left( 1 - 2\\nu_删除19:<u>{a}</u> \\right)t_删除19:<u>{a}</u>}},$$ where K~i~ (i = x, y) and K~z~ are the shear and axial spring constants, respectively; and A~a~ is the adhesive area represented by the responding spring. In the FE models, all of the materials were assumed to be elastic, and linear elastic analyses were conducted. The virtual crack closure method \\[\\] was used to calculate the energy release rate of the crack tip. Using this method, quarter-point singular elements were not necessary in the models, and the calculated results were insensitive to the FE mesh sizes \\[,\\]. The energy release rate was obtained conveniently by picking out the elemental nodal forces at the crack tip and the nodal displacements behind the crack tip. The stress intensity factor was obtained according to the following equation:$${K = \\sqrt{G_删除19:<u>{I}</u> \\cdot E_删除19:<u>{s}</u>}},$$ where G~I~ is the energy release rate in the fracture mode I; and E~s~ is the Young's modulus of the steel.\n\n【36】5. FE Results and Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec5-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n============================\n\n【37】This section describes the investigation of the effects of the FRP thickness, FRP Young's modulus, adhesive thickness, and adhesive shear modulus on the stress intensity factors based on numerical results. As similar stress intensity factor trends were observed for all four specimens, only the results of specimen P-150 are presented here for analysis.\n\n【38】5.1. Effect of the FRP Thickness 删除19:<u>{#sec5dot1-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】The steel plates strengthened with different FRP thicknesses, i.e. 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.4 mm, 2.0 mm, and 2.8 mm, were modeled to investigate the effect of FRP thickness on the stress intensity factor. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> presents the variation in stress intensity factor with the crack length at different FRP thicknesses. It is obvious that the stress intensity factor increased gradually with the increase in the crack length for each of the curves. At the same crack length, the stress intensity factor significantly reduced with an increase in the FRP thickness. When the crack length, a, was 20 mm, the stress intensity factor reduced from 1073.5 MPa·mm^1/2^ to 682.5 MPa·mm^1/2^, i.e. a reduction of 36.4%, as the FRP thickness increased from 0.3 mm to 2.8 mm. When the crack length, a, was 50 mm, the FRP plate with a thickness of 2.8 mm had a reduced stress intensity factor by 47.7% compared with the FRP plate with a thickness of 0.3 mm. Therefore, the strengthening effect was more effective with thicker FRP plates, because thicker FRP plates are able to share more stress.\n\n【40】5.2. Effect of the FRP Young's Modulus 删除19:<u>{#sec5dot2-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> plots the variation curves of the stress intensity factor versus the crack length for specimens with different FRP plates. FRP plates with Young's moduli of 80 GPa, 165 GPa, 300 GPa, and 460 GPa were used to strengthen the steel plates. The FE results indicated that the higher the FRP modulus was, the smaller the stress intensity factor was at the same crack length. For the 20 mm crack, the stress intensity factor decreased from 968.3 MPa·mm^1/2^ to 592.6 MPa·mm^1/2^, i.e. decreased by 38.8%, when the FRP modulus increased from 80 GPa to 460 GPa. For the 50 mm crack, the increase in the Young's modulus from 80 GPa to 460 GPa reduced the stress intensity factor by 48.1%. It can be concluded that the FRP modulus has a considerable effect on the reduction in the stress intensity factor as a higher modulus can make FRP plates share more stress. The investigations presented in [Section 5.1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u> and [Section 5.2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u> show that an increase in the stiffness ratio, S, can reduce the stress intensity factor.\n\n【42】5.3. Effect of the Adhesive Thickness 删除19:<u>{#sec5dot3-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n-------------------------------------\n\n【43】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> illustrates the effect of the adhesive thickness on the stress intensity factor. The modeled adhesive thicknesses were 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm. It can be seen that the stress intensity factor increased with an increase in the adhesive thickness. When the adhesive thickness increased from 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm, the stress intensity factor increased from 764.3 MPa·mm^1/2^ to 902.3 MPa·mm^1/2^ at the 20 mm long crack, i.e. increased by 18.1%. The stress intensity factor increased by 31.2% at the 50 mm long crack. It can be seen from Equations 通用删除7(英):<u>(27)</u> and 通用删除7(英):<u>(28)</u> that an increase in the adhesive thickness can reduce the axial and shear stiffness of the spring elements, resulting in the reduction in the efficacy of stress transfer between the steel and FRP plates. Therefore, a thinner adhesive layer could result in a smaller stress intensity factor. However, the thinner adhesive could lead to a lower bond strength and thus, could cause FRP debonding based on previous studies on interfacial bond behavior \\[\\].\n\n【44】5.4. Effect of the Adhesive Shear Modulus 删除19:<u>{#sec5dot4-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【45】Specimens with different values of adhesive shear modulus were modeled to investigate the effect of the adhesive shear modulus on the stress intensity factor. The values of the shear modulus in the FE models were 400 MPa, 900 MPa, 2000 MPa, and 4000 MPa. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the variation in the stress intensity factor in terms of the crack length at different values of shear modulus. The FE results show that the stress intensity factor could be reduced by a higher adhesive shear modulus. When the crack length was 20 mm, the stress intensity factors decreased from 912.4 MPa·mm^1/2^ to 680.5 MPa·mm^1/2^, i.e. decreased by 25.4% when the shear modulus increased from 400 MPa to 4000 MPa. When the crack length was 50 mm, the increase in the shear modulus from 400 MPa to 4000 MPa reduced the stress intensity factors by 36.5%. Moreover, it should be noted that a high adhesive shear modulus can also cause the risk of FRP debonding failure \\[\\].\n\n【46】6. Development of Correction Factor β 删除19:<u>{#sec6-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n=======================================\n\n【47】Based on the FE results for the stress intensity factor, the values of additional correction factor β were obtained by rewriting Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(25)</u>:$${\\beta\\left( 删除19:<u>{a,b,S,}</u> \\right) = \\frac{K_删除19:<u>{FE}</u>}{f \\cdot \\frac删除19:<u>{1}</u>删除19:<u>{1 + S}</u> \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac删除19:<u>{c}</u>删除19:<u>{a + c}</u>} \\cdot \\sigma_删除19:<u>{0}</u>\\sqrt删除19:<u>{\\pi a}</u>}},$$ where K~FE~ is the value of the stress intensity factors calculated by the FE method. The effects of the specimen width, crack length, stiffness ratio, adhesive thickness, and adhesive shear modulus on additional correction factor β are discussed in the following sections.\n\n【48】To evaluate the effects of specimen width and crack length for different specimens together, a variable was defined as the ratio between the crack length, a, and half-width, b, of the specimen, i.e. a/b. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> plots the variation in additional correction factor β with the a/b at different stiffness ratios, S. It can be seen that the variation trend was similar at different stiffness ratios, S. The values of additional correction factor β reduced gradually with an increase in a/b. The reduction became more and more significant with an increase in a/b. Moreover, a comparison of the results for different specimens showed that the specimen width had little effect on additional correction factor β when the values of a/b were the same. The values of additional correction factor β were smaller for the wider specimens at the same a/b; however, the difference was very small. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 10]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> presents the effect of the stiffness ratio, S, on additional correction factor β for specimens P-90 and P-200. The trends for the effect of the stiffness ratio, S, were similar for the other two specimens. It was found that the effect of the stiffness ratio, S, on additional correction factor β were similar for the different specimens. When the values of a/b were smaller, the values of additional correction factor β increased gradually with an increase in the stiffness ratio, S. However, the values of additional correction factor β reduced with an increasing stiffness ratio, S, when the values of a/b became larger. Generally, changes in additional correction factor β with the stiffness ratio, S, were not very obvious when compared with the effect of a/b.\n\n【49】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 11]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 12]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> show the effects of the adhesive thickness and shear modulus on additional correction factor β for specimens P-90 and P-200, respectively. The effect trends of the adhesive thickness and shear modulus were similar for the other two specimens. It can be seen that the adhesive thickness and shear modulus had very little effect on the values of additional correction factor β.\n\n【50】Based on the above investigation, to simplify the expression of additional correction factor β, the effects of the adhesive thickness and shear modulus were neglected, and only the effects of a/b and the stiffness ratio, S, were considered in the proposed expression. Finally, the expression of additional correction factor β was formulated as $${\\beta = 1 + \\left\\lbrack {\\eta_删除19:<u>{1}</u> + \\eta_删除19:<u>{2}</u>\\left( \\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> \\right) + \\eta_删除19:<u>{3}</u>\\left( \\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> \\right)^删除19:<u>{2}</u>} \\right\\rbrack S^{\\eta_删除19:<u>{4}</u>}}\\ $$ where η~1~, η~2~, η~3~, and η~4~ are the coefficients to be determined. Based on the FE data, the best-fit values of the four coefficients were 0.187, 0.13, −1.04, and 0.12, respectively. By substituting the four values into Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(31)</u>, the expression of additional correction factor β for double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with double-sided FRP plates was obtained with $${\\beta = 1 + \\left\\lbrack {0.187 + 0.13\\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> - 1.04\\left( \\frac删除19:<u>{a}</u>删除19:<u>{b}</u> \\right)^删除19:<u>{2}</u>} \\right\\rbrack S^删除19:<u>{0.12}</u>}.$$\n\n【51】Therefore, according to Equations 通用删除7(英):<u>(25)</u>, 通用删除7(英):<u>(26)</u>, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(32)</u>, the stress intensity factor for double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with double-sided FRP plates can be calculated. It was found that the proposed expression of the stress intensity factor is a function of the applied stress, crack length, the ratio between the crack length and the width of the steel plate, a/b, the stiffness ratio, S, the adhesive shear modulus, and the adhesive thickness.\n\n【52】7. Verification of the Proposed Equations 删除19:<u>{#sec7-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n=========================================\n\n【53】According to the proposed equations, the stress intensity factors of the specimens were calculated. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 13]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> presents the comparisons of the theoretical and numerical results for the four specimens. It was found that the theoretical results had good agreement with the numerical results for all four specimens.

Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec8-sensors-18-02356}</u>\n==============\n\n【56】Theoretical and numerical studies were carried out to investigate the stress intensity factor for the double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with double-sided bonded FRP plates. Expressions of the stress intensity factor were proposed based on those for infinite center-cracked steel plates strengthened with double-sided bonded FRP plates. 3D FE modeling was conducted to investigate the main influencing factors on the stress intensity factor and the additional correction factor, β. The following conclusions were drawn:The stress intensity factor for the double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates decreased with an increase in the FRP thickness, the FRP Young's modulus, and the adhesive shear modulus. An increase in the adhesive thickness could increase the stress intensity factor.The additional correction factor, β, was mainly affected by the ratio between the crack length and the specimen width and the stiffness ratio. The adhesive thickness and shear modulus had little effect on additional correction factor β. Additional correction factor β was formulated and calibrated based on the FE results.The stress intensity factor for the double-edged cracked steel plates strengthened with FRP plates can be calculated based on the proposed Equations 通用删除7(英):<u>(25)</u>, 通用删除7(英):<u>(26)</u>, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(32)</u>. The proposed expressions of the stress intensity factor were a function of the applied stress, crack length, the ratio between the crack length and the width of the steel plate, a/b, the stiffness ratio, S, the adhesive shear modulus, and the adhesive thickness. The proposed expressions were shown to calculate stress intensity factors with reasonable accuracy.\n\n【57】The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China 通用删除7(英):<u>(51708174)</u>, Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (BK20170889), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017B00714), and the Key laboratory of concrete and pre-stressed concrete structure of Ministry of Education of China (CPCSME2017-01).\n\n【58】![Variation inf correction factor β with a/b: (a) S = 0.05; (b) S = 0.22; (c) S = 0.45; (d) S = 0.63.](sensors-18-02356-g009)删除19:<u>{#sensors-18-02356-f009}</u>\n\n【59】Comparison of the theoretical and numerical results for specimen P-150: (a) effect of the FRP thickness; (b) effect of the FRP modulus; (c) effect of the adhesive thickness; and (d) effect of the adhesive shear modulus.\n\n【60】  Specimen   Steel Plate   FRP Plate   Adhesive                                                                                                                                              \n  ---------- ------------- ----------- ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------- -------------------- ----------------------\n  P-90       700           90          10         5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40                                           0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8   80, 165, 300, 460   0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0   400, 900, 2000, 4000\n  P-120      700           120         10         5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55                               0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8   80, 165, 300, 460   0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0   400, 900, 2000, 4000\n  P-150      700           150         10         5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70                   0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8   80, 165, 300, 460   0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0   400, 900, 2000, 4000\n  P-200      700           200         10         5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90   0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8   80, 165, 300, 460   0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0   400, 900, 2000, 4000\n  P-200 \\   1000          200         16         5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,                                  1.4, 2.0, 2.8             165, 460            1.0                  900\n  P-300 \\   1000          300         10         5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140          0.3, 0.9, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8   165, 460            1.0                  900\n\n【61】\\ For verification.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

SV40-lGF-I cells also registered concentration-dependent increases in ECAR; however, unlike the parental cell line, signal attenuation upon repeat challenges was not evident. Furthermore, SV40-IGF-I cells did not proliferate in response to IGF-I. We investigated if lack of proliferation was due to differences in the protocols of the assays ([3H]thymidine incorporation and microphysiometry). We identified three key differences in the protocols: surface substrate, cell density, and fluid residence time. We found no increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation for cells on either tissue-culture plastic or polycarbonate transwells. Control levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation were cell-density-dependent, but IGF-I did not increase proliferation at any density studied. Finally, we investigated IGF-I stimulation for cells under microphysiometer flow conditions and found no proliferative response to IGF-I. We found that the cells do respond to IGF-I with increased amino acid uptake. These data suggest that IGF-I signaling is operational in the SV40-IGF-I cells, but the transduction pathway for IGF-I-induced proliferation is compromised, despite the fact that these cells respond to fetal bovine serum with increased growth.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was invented by Binnig et al. in 1986 \\[\\]. AFM is a powerful tool to provide various information via detecting the weak interactions between the tiny tip on a cantilever and the sample surface. Compared to optical microscopy and electron microscopy (EM), AFM overcomes the wavelength limitations of light and electrons, and is capable of acquiring three-dimensional topography, molecular interactions and dynamics under various conditions (vacuum, atmosphere, and liquid) \\[\\]. Since AFM has the abilities of high-resolution imaging and high-sensitivity detecting, it has been extensively applied to various areas, such as life science, surface science, and material science \\[,\\].\n\n【2】AFM has the unique ability to investigate biological samples without labelling or fixation in their native conditions at the single-molecule level. By modifying the AFM tip with specific ligands, such as antibodies and lectins, we simultaneously acquire the topographic and recognition image of a biological sample, which reveals the localizations of specific receptors on the sample surface; we also acquire various information (stiffness, elasticity, and unbinding force) of the ligand-receptor interactions using the AFM technique \\[,\\]. However, it is difficult to locate two or more types of components on the cell membranes by the AFM technique; and AFM cannot be used to image intracellular molecules because it is only used to investigate the sample surface.\n\n【3】Optical microcopy is an indispensable tool in biological research. By labelling samples with fluorophores, optical microscopy provides a way to identify specific components and to investigate interactions among different components. Due to the diffraction limit of light, conventional fluorescence microscopes, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), have a limited resolution---a lateral resolution of about 250 nm and a vertical resolution of about 500 nm---and, thus, conventional fluorescence microscopy cannot be used to investigate biological samples at the single-molecule level \\[\\]. Fortunately, several super-resolution imaging techniques, such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) \\[\\], stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) \\[\\], and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) \\[\\], have been developed and shattered the diffraction barrier; for example, STED can achieve a lateral resolution of 20--70 nm and a vertical resolution of 40--150 nm; single-molecule localization microscopy, such as STORM and PALM, can achieve a lateral resolution of 10--30 nm and an axial resolution of 10--75 nm \\[\\]. These super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques can also provide an excellent opportunity to study the distributions of specific components and the interactions among different components at nanometer resolution. Although optical microscopy has abilities to simultaneously identify several specific components and to deeply visualize a cell, it cannot provide the high-resolution topography of the cell which reveals the cell structure.\n\n【4】To complement the advantages and shortcomings of both techniques, we can combine AFM with optical microscopy to provide more information. The combination of two or more complementary techniques has currently become a hot topic in the research of novel multi-functional instruments. Recently, Nature highlighted the correlative microscopies, stating two microscopes are better than one \\[\\]. At present, several correlative microscopy techniques, such as optical microscopy/EM and optical microscopy/AFM, have been developed and achieved gratifying results \\[,\\]. In this review, we will describe the main principles of AFM and optical microscopy, and summarize the progress of correlative optical microscopy/AFM techniques in biological research.\n\n【5】2. Principles of Atomic Force Microscopy and Optical Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec2-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n===============================================================\n\n【6】2.1. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot1-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n----------------------------------\n\n【7】AFM is a topographic imaging technique with high spatial resolution (a lateral resolution of 1 nm and a vertical resolution of 0.1 nm), and can be used to acquire mechanical properties \\[\\]. The principle of AFM (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) is that the sample can be imaged at atomic resolution by detecting the near-field interactions between a tiny tip and the sample surface \\[,\\]. There are two fundamental modes (contact mode and tapping mode) for AFM imaging. For contact mode imaging, the tip on a cantilever is brought into gentle contact with the sample and then raster scanned over the sample surface; by maintaining a constant force on the tip, the tip-sample interactions will induce the deformation of the cantilever which can be detected by a photodetector and converted to an electrical signal read by a computer and, thus, the sample topography is recorded \\[,\\]. Tapping mode imaging is similar to contact mode imaging except that the piezo (acoustic) or magnetic coil (magnetic) provides a constant driving force causing the tip to oscillate at a certain frequency \\[\\]. Compared to contact mode, tapping mode can reduce the lateral forces on the tip and thereby minimize deformation of soft samples.\n\n【8】In addition to imaging, AFM-based force spectroscopy is also a versatile approach to measure the interaction forces of biological systems \\[\\]. In this mode, the AFM force curve is obtained by recording the cantilever deflection while the tip approaches the surface and withdraws from it \\[\\]. The force curve can be used to extract information, such as stiffness, elasticity, and molecular interactions \\[,\\]. Single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) is used to measure the forces of the interaction between individual ligands and receptors. To measure the molecular recognition forces, the tip is functionalized with specific ligands via a bifunctional crosslinker that can distinguish specific ligand-receptor interactions from unspecific interactions \\[\\]. SMFS has made plenty of progress in the research of the interactions between individual biomolecules, such as molecular recognition between antibodies and antigens, drugs and receptors, and complementary strands of DNA \\[,\\]. Recently, force-distance curve-based AFM has been developed to achieve multiparametric imaging at nanometer resolution. Through recording an array of force-distance curves and real-time extracting the parameters of physical properties, force-distance curve-based AFM can be used to acquire the sample topography and, meanwhile, map the distributions of multiple physical properties \\[\\].\n\n【9】2.2. Conventional Fluorescence Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】### 2.2.1. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2dot1-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n\n【11】Since confocal microscopy has a non-invasive ability and can penetrate deep into a sample, it has been applied to many scientific fields, such as drug delivery and virus invasion \\[,\\]. The principle of confocal microscopy is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>; in confocal microscopy, the illumination and detection are restricted to a diffraction-limited area in the sample, which rejects a higher background and yields a higher resolution in contrast to wide-field epifluorescence microscopy \\[,\\]. To achieve this goal, the point illumination is confocal with the pinhole in front of the photodetector; when the sample is simultaneously positioned in the plane of focus of the point illumination and the pinhole, the emitted light from the focal plane can pass through the pinhole, but light from above or below the focal plane will be hindered by the pinhole. Although confocal microscopy enhances the imaging resolution, the field of view is limited, and thereby it needs to be combined with a scanning technique to acquire a whole image and achieve three-dimensional imaging. To improve the speed of acquiring confocal images, disk-scanning confocal microscopy is developed which uses a disk (Nipkow disk or spinning-disk) including multiple pinholes to scan the sample \\[\\]. Moreover, multi- or two-photon excitation microscopy is developed for imaging thick samples (1 mm) along with the reduced phototoxicity. In multi- or two-photon microscopy, the pinhole in front of the photodetector is not necessary since the excitation and the emitted light only occurs in focus \\[\\].\n\n【12】### 2.2.2. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot2dot2-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n\n【13】TIRFM is quite suitable for investigating dynamic biological processes, such as endocytosis and cytoskeleton remodeling occurring near the cell membrane \\[,\\]. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the basic principle of TIRFM. When the excitation light propagates from a medium of high refractive index (RI) (e.g. cover slip) to a low RI medium (e.g. a cell) at a high incident angle θ (greater than the critical angle θ~c~), it is totally internally reflected back into the cover slip and generates a thin evanescent field (within 100 nm) in the low RI medium. The evanescent field has the ability to selectively excite fluorophores near the interface and reduce background fluorescence due to the intensity of the evanescent field exponentially decaying away from the interface \\[,\\]. Therefore, TIRFM is a useful tool to provide a high-contrast image of biomolecules stained with fluorochromes near the cell surface. Compared with confocal microscopy, TIRFM has a higher temporal resolution and a higher signal-to-noise ratio, but TIRFM is confined to imaging the biological molecules at or near the cell membrane \\[\\].\n\n【14】2.3. Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot3-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【15】### 2.3.1. Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot3dot1-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n\n【16】STED is a super-resolution imaging technique based on the platform of confocal microscopy, and can be used to image biological samples with resolutions of about 40 nm in both lateral and axial directions \\[\\]. The basic principle of STED is to inhibit fluorescence at the rim of the excitation spot by superimposing the excitation beam with a donut-shaped depletion beam (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). When the depletion beam has a wavelength included in the emission spectrum of the dye and the intensity beyond the saturation intensity, it can stimulate all of the excited electrons to relax at the same wavelength of the depletion beam, thereby allowing the fluorescence in the areas where the depletion beam falls to be switched off by a spectral filter that rejects photons at the wavelength of the depletion beam. In other words, the size of the excitation spot can be controlled below the diffraction limit by the depletion beam, and it can be further reduced while increasing the depletion beam intensity. Hence, the super-resolution image can be generated by the two overlaid beams (the excitation beam and the depletion beam) raster scanning across the sample point by point \\[,\\].\n\n【17】### 2.3.2. Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) 删除19:<u>{#sec2dot3dot2-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n\n【18】Recently, single-molecule localization microscopy (e.g. stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM)) has been developed \\[,\\] and provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate cell membrane ultrastructures at the single-molecule level \\[,\\]. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the imaging principle of SMLM; SMLM is based on the positions, with single-molecule precision, of each fluorophore in the sample to reconstruct a super-resolution image \\[,\\]. For SMLM imaging, photoswitchable fluorescent probes (e.g. photoswitchable dyes for STORM and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins for PALM), which have the property of switching between non-fluorescent and fluorescent states by illumination with an appropriate light, are required to label samples \\[,\\]. During the process of image acquisition, all of the probes are firstly quenched; then, using appropriate illumination, a sparse subset of probes can be randomly activated and imaged; once these probes are deactivated, a new subset is activated and imaged. By repeating the cycles of activation and deactivation many frames, with each frame containing the positions of several individual probes, are recorded. After image acquisition, the localizations of these single probes are determined with very high resolution by finding the centroid of the point spread function; by superimposing all of the successful localizations, a super-resolution image of the sample is constructed.\n\n【19】3. Correlative Optical Microscopy/Atomic Force Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec3-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n=========================================================\n\n【20】3.1. Correlative Conventional Fluorescence Microscopy/Atomic Force Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot1-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Correlative AFM and confocal microscopy has been increasingly used to investigate biological structures and processes. By correlating the AFM topographic image with the corresponding fluorescence image, Burns investigated the lateral structure of lipid domains in model membrane bilayers \\[\\]. Frankel et al. also used correlative AFM and confocal microscopy to investigate protein domains at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The authors observed that the irregularly-shaped protein domains seen in AFM topography included both resting and activated immunoglobin E receptors (FcεRI), aggregated GM1 ganglioside, and clathrin, and they found that the protein domains were related to cholesterol and the cytoskeleton. Taken together, these results suggested that both cholesterol and the cytoskeleton contribute to the formation of the protein domains that were vital for cell functions, such as signaling and endocytosis \\[\\]. To reveal the structure of focal adhesion complexes in quasi-native states, Franz and Muller combined AFM with confocal microscopy to image focal adhesions which were prepared by de-roofing fibroblasts with short ultrasonic bursts. They observed that microfilament bundles in focal adhesions were predominantly arranged in a parallel pattern and occasionally branched. By correlating the AFM height information with fluorescence intensities, they found that paxillin and F-actin respectively localized in the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal half of focal adhesions \\[\\].\n\n【22】In terms of the advantages of correlative CLSM/AFM, it cannot only correlate the topographic information with the information from fluorescence image, but can also couple the mechanical properties provided by AFM with the specific components identified by the confocal microscopy. Haga et al. used the correlative CLSM/AFM technique to correlate the AFM topography, elasticity map reconstructed from force curves, and the fluorescence images of actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules in a living fibroblast, which revealed that the cellular elasticity was closely related to the distributions of both the actin network and intermediate filaments \\[\\]. In correlative CLSM/AFM microscopy, the AFM tip can be used as a micromanipulator to stimulate cells, and the confocal microscopy is used as a detector to reveal the cellular responses \\[\\]. Recently, Hecht et al. developed a uniaxial cell stretcher to integrate into a correlative CLSM/AFM system. Therefore, this unique tool can be used to simultaneously detect cellular responses with real-time AFM and fluorescence studies while stretching cells \\[\\]. Based on correlative force-distance curve-based AFM and confocal microscopy, Alsteens and coworkers simultaneously quantified the first viral binding events while imaging living cells. By fluorescently labelling the virus and the corresponding receptors expressed in cells, and functionalizing the AFM tip with the labelled virus, the authors could precisely localize and quantify the individual virus binding events (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). They also contoured the free-energy landscape for the first virus-receptor binding events \\[\\]. The combination of colloidal probe AFM and confocal microscopy can be used to investigate the relationships between mechanical properties and the release of microcapsules that were useful for drug delivery \\[,\\].\n\n【23】TIRFM has the advantage to image biological phenomena happening at, or near, the interface with a higher axial resolution compared to confocal microscopy. Thereby, correlative TIRFM/AFM microscopy is well suited for correlating the topographic information with the distribution of specific components at the interface. Brown et al. applied correlative TIRFM/AFM to investigate self-assembled myosin filaments under liquid environments. By quantitatively correlating the height and the fluorescence intensity of the self-assembled myosin filaments, they confirmed that the myosin heads are arranged in a shell of roughly constant thickness around the filament \\[\\]. Recently, Gudzenko and Franz combined time-lapse AFM and TIRFM to study the dynamics of fibronectin fibrillogenesis in living cells at early stages. The authors respectively recorded correlative topography/fluorescence images of fixed cells which were incubated on fluorescently-labelled fibronectin for 4 and 16 h (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), and thereby acquired the structure information of fibronectin. Based on the fibronectin structure, they monitored the early fibrillogenesis dynamics at high resolution by time-lapse AFM, and they also found that Mn^2+^ enhanced the early fibrillogenesis \\[\\]. Oreopoulos et al. reported the coupling of AFM and polarized TIRFM technique, which can correlate the topographic features and the information (e.g. molecular orientation, conformation and rotational mobility) provided by polarized TIRFM \\[,\\].\n\n【24】Correlative TIRFM/AFM microscopy also has the ability to monitor real-time sub-cellular changes in response to mechanical force, which is vital for understanding mechanically-induced cellular remodeling. Using correlative TIRFM/AFM, Mathur et al. investigated stress transmission in endothelial cells. When stimulating the apical membrane with a force of 0.3--0.5 nN, they observed global focal contact rearrangements on the basal surface, which suggested that cells transfer localized force from the apical membrane to the basal membrane globally \\[\\]. Trache and Lim integrated AFM with TIRFM and fast-spinning disk (FSD) confocal microscopy to study live cell response to mechanical stimulation in real-time \\[\\]. Using this combined AFM/TIRFM/FSD confocal microscopy, Lim and coworkers investigated live vascular smooth muscle cells' (VSMC) response to tensile stress using the AFM tip functionalized with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. By integrating mechanical stimulation with simultaneous TIRFM imaging and spinning-disk confocal imaging, they found that VSMC could adaptively respond to mechanical stimulation by the actomyosin apparatus modulation \\[\\].\n\n【25】3.2. Correlative Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy/Atomic Force Microscopy 删除19:<u>{#sec3dot2-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Although correlative conventional fluorescence microscopy/AFM techniques have gained great achievements in the studies of biological questions, ranging from lipid bilayer structure and membrane protein assembly to cellular structure, function, and dynamics, the resolutions of both techniques are not well aligned, and thereby these correlative techniques are not well suited to investigate molecular localization and dynamics in cells at the single-molecule level. To correlate topography with fluorescence specificity at the single-molecule level, it is inevitable to combine AFM with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Diaspro and coworkers developed a novel nanoscopic tool by coupling AFM with STED for the first time, which is capable of correlating the topographic image, super-resolution fluorescence image, and a force map, such as Young's modulus. They confirmed the device performance using fluorescent spheres of 40 nm size and fluorescently-labelled microtubules in cos7 cells \\[\\]. The correlative STED/AFM technique also has the ability to simultaneously nanomanipulate specific molecules of interest and monitor the manipulation effects with a resolution of tens of nanometers. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 8]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows an example of nanomanipulation using the correlative STED/AFM technique. The AFM tip dragged only one specific 40 nm fluorescent sphere on the Poly-[l]删除19:<u>{.smallcaps}</u>-lysine-coated coverslip with the help of STED monitoring \\[\\]. Diaspro et al. also achieved bionanomanipulation using the correlative STED/AFM technique, which might be useful for nanosurgeries \\[\\].\n\n【27】Compared to STED, single-molecule localization microscopy is capable of precisely identifying single molecules and quantitative imaging, but has a limited temporal resolution. Therefore, the combination of AFM and single-molecule localization microscopy is highly suitable for correlating nanoscale topography with precise localization of a specific molecule. Diaspro et al. respectively used STED/AFM and STORM/AFM to image α-tubulin in Hela cells; they found that both of the correlative techniques could correlate morphological features, super-resolution fluorescence imaging, and mechanical properties, and had their own advantages \\[\\]. Correlative AFM and single-molecule localization microscopy also has the advantage to eliminate artefacts that result from poor labelling and image reconstruction \\[\\]. Recently, Odermatt et al. built a correlative SMLM/AFM microscopy by integrating an AFM and an inverted optical microscope (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 9]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). In this device, the optical path was aligned with the AFM cantilever. They first confirmed the performance of the correlative microscopy via imaging polymerized actin filaments on a coverslip with both imaging modalities (AFM imaging and STORM imaging); then, they validated that the correlative microscopy can be used to image live mammalian cells, thereby providing a new method for the investigations of structure-function relationships at the single-molecule level \\[\\].\n\n【28】4. Challenges and Outlook 删除19:<u>{#sec4-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n=========================\n\n【29】Combining AFM with optical microscopy has been successfully used to correlate the structure with the physiological function of specific components under close to native conditions. However, correlative AFM and optical microscopy still have many challenges to be solved. To achieve truly meaningful correlation between AFM and optical microscopy, it is necessary to consider resolution matching of the two techniques. Although correlative AFM and conventional fluorescence microscopy has achieved great success in overcoming the shortcomings of both techniques, the unmatched resolution between AFM and conventional fluorescence microscopy produces difficulty in correlating the structure information with the distribution of specific components at the single-molecule level. To fully utilize the advantages of fluorescence microscopy, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy achieving nanometer resolution is combined with AFM.\n\n【30】For correlative AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, the challenges include sample preparation, imaging speed and image alignment. To maintain optimal performance of both techniques, it is necessary to optimize sample preparation protocols. First of all, we choose a glass coverslip which meets the imaging requirements (good optical properties for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy imaging, and flatness for AFM imaging) of both techniques as the substrate. Then we need to consider the fluorescent labelling strategy; to avoid altering the structure of samples, using small molecules, such as fluorescently-labeled aptamer/peptide \\[,\\], or fusion proteins \\[\\] is necessary. Additionally, the excitation spectra of fluorophores must be away from the AFM laser to avoid bleaching these fluorophores. Particularly, the imaging buffer for STORM degrades samples \\[\\], which can limit the combination of STORM and AFM to achieve a truly synchronized correlation. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop small molecule markers and optimize the imaging buffer for both AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.\n\n【31】For imaging speed, AFM can achieve the temporal resolution of minutes which is comparable to that of SMLM. Due to the limit of temporal resolution, correlative AFM/SMLM is not suited for investigating cellular dynamics at nanometer resolution. Recently, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has been developed to achieve second and subsecond temporal resolution \\[,\\], which is comparable to that of high-speed AFM \\[\\]. Therefore, combining a high-speed AFM with a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy that has the advantage of quickly acquiring image will pave a new way to study cellular dynamics at the single-molecule level. To correlate the results from both AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, it is indispensable to overlay images obtained by correlative microscopy with a precision down to 10 nm. To achieve this goal, we need to optimize procedures to align these correlative images according to the identical structure of these correlative images or fiduciary markers, such as quantum dots \\[\\]. In a word, we need to substantially improve and enhance both AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and then integrate the two techniques to achieve a high degree of matching and synchronized co-localization measurement, which is adapted to the developing requirements of life sciences.\n\n【32】5. Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec5-sensors-17-00938}</u>\n==============\n\n【33】Nowadays, AFM has gradually evolved into a multifunctional tool \\[\\]. AFM can not only provide three-dimensional topography with lateral and axial resolutions of 1 nm and 0.1 nm, respectively, but also determine the mechanical properties with high sensitivity of tens of piconewton forces. Furthermore, AFM can be used to manipulate biological samples at subnanometre resolution. However, it is difficult to simultaneously identify two or more specific components using the AFM technique. Therefore, combining AFM with other techniques, particularly optical fluorescence microscopy, which can give excellent specificity, is becoming inevitable to complement the shortcomings of the individual technique.\n\n【34】The combination of AFM and conventional fluorescence microscopy has been reported, such as correlative CLSM/AFM and TIRFM/AFM. Although conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques have the advantage of specificity, they are limited by the imaging resolution: 250 nm in the lateral direction and 500 nm in the axial direction \\[\\]. Due to the resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy is incompatible with that of AFM, the combination of both techniques cannot achieve the truly synchronized co-localization measurement. Recently, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have been developed and have broken the diffraction barrier, achieving nanometer resolution \\[\\]. Hence, combining AFM with super-resolution imaging techniques can complement the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques. Several correlative AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques, such as correlative STED/AFM, PALM/AFM, and STORM/AFM, have been developed to correlate morphological information with specificity at nanometer resolution. However, the combination of AFM and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is still in the early stage and has many problems to be solved, such as sample preparation, imaging speed, and image processing. Although there are still many problems for these correlative techniques, the correlative techniques open new avenues for the investigations of biological systems at the single-molecule level.\n\n【35】This work was supported by NSFC (Grants 21373200 and 21525314).\n\n【36】The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【37】![Schematic diagram of atomic force microscopy.

Peripartum depression is clinically diagnosed when mood symptoms of major depression occur during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery \\[, \\]. Studies have shown that a woman has a greater risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital within the first month postpartum than at any other time in her life \\[\\]. Nonetheless, it has been recommended that the diagnostic criteria be expanded from 1 month to 6 months after delivery, since this entire period is a high-risk time for depression \\[\\].\n\n【2】The prevalence of peripartum depression ranges from 6.0 to 20% of pregnancies depending on how the diagnosis is made, the population, country or year \\[--\\]. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 2012, 10% of women who had a live birth had peripartum depression, which is lower than the 14% estimated in 2004 \\[\\]. The authors theorized that better recognition of risk factors for depression and improved treatment before and during pregnancy may have contributed to the decline \\[\\].\n\n【3】Contrary to the amount of evidence on the prevalence of peripartum depression, there is little evidence as to how often peripartum depression does not respond to treatment and becomes treatment resistant depression. There are many treatment resistant depression (TRD) definitions \\[, \\] that range from not responding to a single treatment to not responding to sequential treatments. A recent literature search found that the most commonly used definition of TRD in subjects with major depressive disorder requires a minimum of two prior treatment failures of adequate dose and duration \\[\\]. The treatment failure excludes adverse events. The National institute of Mental Health-funded Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR\\D) trial provides support for this definition, as the results showed that resistance to treatment markedly increased after the failure of 2 treatments at adequate dose and duration \\[, \\].A population-based study using healthcare databases found that in patients with newly diagnosed depression, 10% develop TRD within one year. However, it is not known how often TRD is diagnosed in women with peripartum depression. Therefore, this study sought to determine the incidence of TRD in women with peripartum depression depending on whether they had or did not have history of depression prior to pregnancy.\n\n【4】Methods 删除19:<u>{#Sec2}</u>\n=======\n\n【5】We designed a population-based retrospective cohort study. We used a large US claims database and included data from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2018.\n\n【6】Source 删除19:<u>{#Sec3}</u>\n------\n\n【7】We used the IBM MarketScan® Commercial Database (CCAE). This is a large US claims database that includes data from individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance health plans. Data include adjudicated health insurance claims (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy) as well as enrollment data from large employers and health plans who provide private healthcare coverage to employees, their spouses, and dependents. Data elements are outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims (coded with National Drug Codes (NDC) and inpatient and outpatient medical claims, which provide diagnosis codes (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM).\n\n【8】Population 删除19:<u>{#Sec4}</u>\n----------\n\n【9】We included women with peripartum depression. Although peripartum depression is clinically diagnosed when mood symptoms of major depression occur during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery \\[\\], it has been recommended that the onset be expanded from 4 weeks to 6 months after delivery \\[\\]. Thus, we defined peripartum depression as having depression diagnosed during pregnancy or up to 6 months after the end of pregnancy.\n\n【10】Depression was defined using a validated algorithm that requires the presence of two depression diagnosis codes within 1 year or a hospitalization with a depression diagnosis \\[\\]. We included both women with a history of depression prior to pregnancy (prevalent depression) and women with newly diagnosed depression (incident depression) any time during pregnancy or up to 6 months after the end of pregnancy.\n\n【11】Since women with peripartum depression may not be exposed to pharmacological treatments for depression early in their pregnancy because they discontinue them to conceive or after conception \\[\\], or do not start them because of concerns of exposing the fetus to antidepressants \\[\\], some of these women would not have the opportunity to develop treatment resistant depression, which is based on lack of response to pharmacological treatments. To address this, two groups of women were created: 1. all women diagnosed with peripartum depression; 2. only women with peripartum depression diagnosed 3 months before a live birth delivery or within 6 months after that delivery. The latter group is more likely to have the opportunity to be exposed to pharmacological treatments, even if pharmacological treatment had been postponed during early pregnancy. See Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>.\n\n【12】Women with psychosis, bipolar disorder, or dementia before the index date (i.e. the date of the first depression diagnosis during pregnancy or 6 months after a delivery) were excluded to ensure that any antipsychotic received was for the treatment of depression and not for the treatment of psychosis. Women with bipolar disorder were excluded because when TRD is studied and defined this type of depression is often excluded \\[, \\].\n\n【13】Pregnancy, pregnancy duration, and pregnancy outcomes were defined in the database using a validated algorithm developed for claims database studies \\[\\]. The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED) concepts used to identity depression were depression and major depression, excluding concepts for bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorders. SNOMED is a standardized, multilingual vocabulary of clinical terminology that is used by physicians and other healthcare providers for the electronic exchange of clinical health information \\[\\]. The ICD 9 and 10 codes included are listed in 通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"media\"}</u>. Fig. 1Study design illustration</u>\n\n【14】The outcome of interest was the development of treatment resistant depression (TRD) within 1 year after the first diagnosis of depression during pregnancy. There is no consensus definition of TRD, but one of the most common definitions requires a minimum of two prior treatment failures and confirmation of prior adequate dose and duration \\[\\]. Implementing such a definition in claims databases is challenging because it is difficult to ascertain why medications were changed or stopped \\-- improvement, lack of efficacy or adverse events \\[, \\]. Nonetheless, there is a definition of TRD to be used in claims database studies that has been validated \\[\\]. Using this definition, TRD was defined as women with a diagnosis of depression who were dispensed 3 distinct antidepressants or 1 antidepressant and 1 antipsychotic in 1 year. Similar to the clinical definition of TRD, the ingredient of the antidepressant or antipsychotic is not germane. For example, a pregnant woman with depression who received sertraline, escitalopram and amitriptyline within a year after the diagnosis of depression is considered to have TRD. Similarly, a pregnant woman with depression who received sertraline and quetiapine within a year after the diagnosis of depression is considered to have TRD. This definition of TRD proved to be superior to definitions that attempted to define TRD based on adequacy of treatment dose and duration \\[\\].\n\n【15】Analysis 删除19:<u>{#Sec5}</u>\n--------\n\n【16】We calculated the proportion of pregnant women with incident or prevalent peripartum depression who went on to develop TRD.

The risk of developing TRD is higher (35 to 50%) in pregnant women with a history of depression. Women who developed TRD had more psychiatric comorbidities and more painful conditions than women who did not develop TRD.\n\n【29】The prevalence estimate of peripartum depression of 2.5% is close to the estimate provided by the American Psychiatric Association of 3% \\[\\]. This estimate is much lower than published estimates of incidence or prevalence of peripartum depression, which range from 6.5 to 20% \\[--\\]. In those studies, to define depression, women responded to screening questionnaires or participated in a structured clinical interview according to DSM-IV or V criteria. In our study, peripartum depression was based on the presence of diagnosis codes, and these codes are part of a medical claim issued for reimbursement purposes not for research purpose. Therefore, it is expected that these codes are present in very symptomatic women or in women seeking care, so we are capturing only the more severe cases. Also, when the insurance does not have mental health coverage, these depression codes are not present in the claims databases. In addition, we included commercially insured women, a healthier population. Consequently, it is very likely that we are underestimating the risk of peripartum depression.\n\n【30】Five percent of women with peripartum depression developed TRD within 1 year. This is half the percentage found in the general population newly diagnosed with depression (10.4%) \\[\\]. There is increasing evidence suggesting that women with peripartum depression are often untreated or suboptimally treated \\[, \\] which could explain the lower rate of TRD observed in women with peripartum depression in this study (because the definition of TRD depends on treatment patterns). On the other hand, pregnant women are in frequent contact with healthcare providers during pregnancy because of recommended the antenatal care visits and therefore treatments/interventions can be implemented sooner and, if successful, could decrease the risk for women to develop TRD. In addition, there is evidence that non pharmacological approaches could also provide benefits similar to pharmacological treatments \\[\\] and that these treatments may be more commonly used in women with peripartum depression. All these factors could contribute to the lower incidence of TRD observed in women with peripartum depression compared to the general population with depression.\n\n【31】History of depression has been identified as a risk factor for developing peripartum depression \\[, \\] and discontinuing treatment for depression during pregnancy leads to a depression relapse during pregnancy more often than in women who maintain their medication \\[\\]. We found that the risk of developing TRD was higher in women with a history of depression than in women with no history of depression, so this may also be a risk factor for developing TRD.\n\n【32】We found that women who went on to develop TRD suffered more frequently from substance use disorders, psychiatric conditions, insomnia, and pain than women with no TRD. These risk factors are in complete agreement with the risk factors for the general population with TRD \\[\\]. Research suggests that there could be different types of perinatal depression, including one in which anxiety is a predominant symptom \\[\\]. These different types of peripartum depression could respond differently to treatments \\[\\]. Our study findings suggest that when anxiety is the predominant symptom in perinatal depression, similar to depression in the general population, it seems to be harder to treat \\[\\].\n\n【33】A limitation of this study is that the TRD definition used is based, as many other definitions are, on lack of response to pharmacological treatments. This definition, ≥3 antidepressants or 1 antidepressant and ≥ 1 antipsychotics in a year, was found to be better at discriminating between subjects with and without TRD than a definition that included non-pharmacological treatments \\[\\]. However, pregnant women were not the focus of the study, and in this segment of the population the use of nonpharmacological treatments may be more relevant than in the general population. The TRD definition used focused on the number of pharmacological treatments and dose was not germane. Although this definition was superior to the definitions that attempted to infer adequacy of treatment duration and dose, it is disparate to the clinical definition of TRD.\n\n【34】Another shortcoming is that we excluded individuals with bipolar disorders, these individuals when not responding to treatment often are prescribed not only antipsychotics but also mood stabilizers \\[, \\] which are not included in the TRD definition. Therefore, our results can only be generalized to women with depression and not with bipolar depression.\n\n【35】As mentioned earlier, this study relies on the presence of codes to diagnose depression and the study population consisted of patients with commercial insurance. As a result, the population is younger and likely healthier compared to the general US population, and the results may not be generalizable to individuals enrolled in non-commercial health plans such as Medicaid and Medicare or uninsured. For example, it is known that lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for peripartum depression \\[\\] so in that segment of the population the prevalence of TRD could be higher.\n\n【36】There is an abundance of evidence regarding the negative impact of maternal depression on children, husbands/partners, and family, but it is not known how more deleterious it would be having perinatal depression that is treatment resistant \\[, \\]. Further research is needed to understand the burden of peripartum depression that becomes TRD on women, their families and the society at large.\n\n【37】Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#Sec8}</u>\n===========\n\n【38】This retrospective cohort study found approximately 5% of women with peripartum depression developed TRD, and the risk of developing TRD was higher in pregnant women with a history of depression. Women who developed TRD had more psychiatric comorbidities and more painful conditions than women who did not develop TRD.\n\n【39】MSC: Study idea, study design, interpretation results, drafting of manuscript.

A total of 600 anidulafungin plasma samples from 225 patients across the four studies were available for analysis. Patients received daily intravenous infusions of 50, 75, or 100 mg anidulafungin, preceded by a loading dose that was twice the daily dose.

A population analysis approach was used to develop a steady-state pharmacokinetic model for anidulafungin, assess the significance of possible covariates, and determine the amount of intersubject and random residual variability. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination provided the best fit to the data. The clearance of anidulafungin was influenced by weight and gender, and subjects in the invasive candidiasis study had a typical clearance that was approximately 30% higher than subjects from other studies. Weight was determined to be a predictor of the central volume of distribution. The covariates on clearance accounted for less than 20% of the intersubject variability and therefore are deemed to be of little clinical relevance. There was no evidence that the presence of rifampin or metabolic substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of cytochrome p450 influenced the clearance of anidulafungin.

Results of anterior cervical decompression and arthrodesis in sixty-one North American patients.\nOssification of the posterior longitudinal ligament is commonly associated with cervical myelopathy. Surgical treatment is a matter of controversy. We report on a series of patients who were managed with anterior cervical decompression and arthrodesis for the treatment of cervical myelopathy associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. We retrospectively reviewed the records for all sixty-five patients who had been managed with anterior decompression and arthrodesis for the treatment of cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and associated neurologic compression from 1982 to 2001. Sixty-one patients (thirty-nine men and twenty-two women) were followed for at least two years (or until the time of death). The average number of vertebrae resected was 2.2. The average duration of follow-up for the sixty surviving patients was four years (range, two years to fifteen years and four months). The preoperative, six-week postoperative, and final follow-up clinical status (including neurological function as assessed with the Nurick grading system) was recorded for each patient. Fifty-six of the sixty-one patients had neurological improvement, with an average improvement of 1.5 Nurick grades at the time of the final follow-up. Eight patients had absent dura at the time of surgery and, of these, five had development of a cerebrospinal fluid fistula. Eight patients had development of new neurological signs and/or symptoms in the upper extremity postoperatively. Eight patients required reoperation because of a painful pseudarthrosis (one patient), strut-graft dislodgment (three), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (three), or compression of a nerve root caudad to the area of the original procedure (one). One patient died as the result of cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Fifty-eight patients had an osseous fusion, one had an asymptomatic nonunion, and one had a symptomatic pseudarthrosis that was treated with revision surgery. Anterior decompression and arthrodesis is an effective way to achieve pain relief and neurological improvement in North American patients of non-Asian descent who have cervical myelopathy associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

Here we report ionic current measurements through microfluidic devices containing one or several SWCNTs of diameter of 1.2 to 2 nm unexpectedly showing a linear or a voltage-activated I-V dependence. Transition from an activated to a linear behavior, and stochastic fluctuations between different current levels were notably observed. For linear devices, the high conductance confirmed with different chloride salts indicates that the nanotube/water interface exhibits both a high surface charge density and flow slippage, in agreement with previous reports. In addition, the sublinear dependence of the conductance on the salt concentration points toward a charge-regulation mechanism. Theoretical modelling and computer simulations show that the voltage-activated behavior can be accounted for by the presence of local energy barriers along or at the ends of the nanotube. Raman spectroscopy reveals strain fluctuations along the tubes induced by the polymer matrix but displays insufficient doping or variations of doping to account for the apparent surface charge density and energy barriers revealed by ion transport measurements. Finally, experimental evidence points toward environment-sensitive chemical moieties at the nanotube mouths as being responsible for the energy barriers causing the activated transport of ions through SWCNTs within this diameter range.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Although historically abortion was considered unacceptable in Iran, intensive consultations led to the clerical approval of induced abortion in cases with beta-thalassemia major in 1997, and a nationwide prevention program with screening, counseling and prenatal diagnosis (PND) networks has been developed. This paper reports the experience from one of the two national PND reference laboratories. As one of the oldest reference laboratories, we performed a total of 906 PND in 360 couples at risk for thalassemia from 1990 to 2003. Direct and indirect mutation detection methods were applied for all cases. In total, 22 mutations were tested routinely, and an additional 30 rare mutations were identified. 208 fetuses were found to be normal, 215 fetuses had beta-thalassemia major, and 435 fetuses were carriers of the trait. In 40 cases, we only defined one allele. In 8 cases, we were unable to provide any diagnosis, corresponding to 0.9%.

In the last 10 years, the number of papers that have dealt with the impact of elevated BHB levels in dairy cattle has increased. Therefore, this paper reviewed the recent literature on BHB concentration in blood and milk, and its relationships with dairy cow health and performance, and farm profitability. Most studies applied the threshold of 1.2 mmol/l of BHB concentration in blood to indicate HYK; several authors considered BHB concentrations between 1.2 and 2.9 mmol/l as subclinical ketosis, and values ⩾3.0 mmol/l as clinical ketosis. Results on HYK frequency (prevalence and incidence) and cow performance varied according to parity and days in milk, being greater in multiparous than in primiparous cows, and in the first 2 weeks of lactation than in later stages. Hyperketonemia has been associated with greater milk fat content, fat-to-protein ratio and energy-corrected milk, and lower protein and urea nitrogen in milk. The relationships with milk yield and somatic cell count are still controversial. In general, HYK impairs health of dairy cows by increasing the risk of the onset of other early lactation diseases, and it negatively affects reproductive performance. The economic cost of HYK is mainly due to impaired reproductive performance and milk loss. From a genetic point of view, results from the literature suggested the feasibility of selecting cows with low susceptibility to HYK. The present review highlights that milk is the most promising matrix to identify HYK, because it is easy to sample and allows a complete screening of the herd through BHB concentration predicted using mid-IR spectroscopy during routine milk recording. Further research is needed to validate accurate and convenient methods to discriminate between cows in risk of HYK and healthy animals in field conditions and to support farmers to achieve an early detection and minimise the economic losses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which hESC retain their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation remain unclear. The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in organogenesis and differentiation during development, and is also involved in the proliferation and cell-fate specification of neural stem cells and neural crest stem cells. As there has been no detailed study of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in hESC, this study examines the expression and functional role of SHH during hESC self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we show the gene and protein expression of key components of the SHH signaling pathway in hESC and differentiated embryoid bodies. Despite the presence of functioning pathway components, SHH plays a minimal role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating proliferation of undifferentiated hESC. However, during differentiation with retinoic acid, a GLI-responsive luciferase assay and target genes PTCH1 and GLI1 expression reveal that the SHH signaling pathway is highly activated. Besides, addition of exogenous SHH to hESC differentiated as embryoid bodies increases the expression of neuroectodermal markers Nestin, SOX1, MAP2, MSI1, and MSX1, suggesting that SHH signaling is important during hESC differentiation toward the neuroectodermal lineage. Our findings provide a new insight in understanding the SHH signaling in hESC and the further development of hESC differentiation for regenerative medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Furthermore, in the United Kingdom, data showed that 1 of 16 hospital admissions was associated to ADRs with the annually cost of up to £466 million. In addition, ADRs were responsible to 0.15% of in-hospital mortalities (). Therefore, detection and prevention of ADRs play an important role in improvement of treatment outcomes.\n\n【2】Streptokinase, a metabolic product of beta-hemolytic streptococci, is an indirect fibrinolytic agent that interacts with plasminogen and forms an active complex with the protease activity that transforms plasminogen to plasmin ().\n\n【3】The mortality benefit of streptokinase in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been illustrated in large, placebo-controlled trials (, ).\n\n【4】In GISSI-1, the first largest thrombolytic trial evaluated streptokinase therapy versus no treatment in AMI patients, the significant mortality benefit of streptokinase has been documented as following: 8.2% versus 15.4% for patients received streptokinase within 1 hours of onset of symptoms, 9.2% versus 12% within three hours and 11.7% versus 14.1% in those treated between 3-6 h 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>. In ISIS-2 trial, the similar benefits of streptokinase were also noted in over 17,000 patients presenting with symptom of acute MI within 24 h (). Despite the mortality benefits of streptokinase in AMI patients, it includes some adverse reactions such as allergic reactions, hypotension, and bleeding.\n\n【5】Streptokinase is a non-human protein, and its presentation into the circulatory system can lead to severe anaphylactic responses including death (, ). The risk of this immune response is dependent to the level of the anti-streptokinase antibodies in circulation. This immunogenicity limits multiple treatments with streptokinase (, ).\n\n【6】Because of the critical condition of patients with AMI and complications of streptokinase therapy, this study was performed to evaluate the pattern of adverse drug reactions induced by streptokinase therapy and its associated risk factors in patients with acute ST elevation MI (STEMI).\n\n【7】Experimental\n============\n\n【8】Study design and setting\n\n【9】A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in Shahid Madani Heart Center, the largest referral center for cardiovascular disorders at the north-west of Iran for a period of 14 months.

In case of allergic reactions and fever, it was recommended that patients concurrently should receive corticosteroids that can be repeated during treatment. Before treatment, the patient PT and PTT were being controlled. In case of anaphylactic shock symptoms and hypotension, malaise, chills, nausea and arrhythmia, the infusion was being stopped.\n\n【17】Detection and classification of ADRs\n\n【18】All patients receiving streptokinase that had completed the informed consent form were monitored for ADRs induced by streptokinase. Detection and monitoring of ADRs were done through completing a questionnaire by reviewing the patientsꞌ medical file and documentation as well as interviewing with the patients.\n\n【19】The questionnaire includes the demographic information, past medical history, drug history, familial, habitual and social history, laboratory and echocardiographic information.\n\n【20】The Naranjo probability scale was used to causality assessment of ADRs as follows: The scores between 1-4 ranked as possible, 5-8 ranked as probable and \\> 9 ranked as highly probable.

Inferior and lateral MI were also found in 44.6% and 0.5% of the patients, respectively.\n\n【49】The number of ADRs experienced by patients was between 0 and 8. In average, each patient experienced 2.3 ± 1.7 ADRs. Furthermore, the incidence of ADRs between females and males were 2.6 versus 0.63 indicating the higher rate of ADR (4.2 times more) among female patients.\n\n【50】The most common ADRs were chest pain, hypotension, coughing, and ecchymosis with the frequency of more than fifty percent. The hemorrhagic stroke as the most serious ADR of streptokinase was documented in three patients. In 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>. the patientsꞌ demographics and clinical data are presented. Also, the frequency of documented ADRs was presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【51】According to the Naranjo scale, the most ADRs ranked as \"probable\" (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). Based on the FDA severity classification of ADRs, the most ADRs were categorized in mild to moderate ADR (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【52】The results of Spearman analysis showed that the incidence of ADRs by streptokinase was associated with the female gender (r = 0.136; p =0.046), history of allergy (r = 0.160; p =0.018), hyperlipidemia (r = 0.174; p=0.010), history of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (r = 0.184; p =0.006), location of MI (r = 0.143; p =0.047), low Ejection fraction (EF) (r = -0.150; p=0.031) and history of polypharmacy (r = 0.154; p=0.023). Furthermore, the number of ADRs was linked with the age (r = 0.136; p =0.045), female gender (r = 0.152; p =0.025), incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (r = 0.205;p=0.002), history of allergy (r = 0.143; p =0.036) and use of anti-coagulant agents (r = 0.163; p=0.017) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【53】The linear regression analysis showed the three models of correlation between the incidence of ADRs and study risk factors including age, history of allergy, history of percutaneous coronary intervention and dyslipidemia (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 6]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). In the linear regression model, a significant correlation between the number of ADRs and use of anti-coagulant agents, low hemoglobin level and age of patients was documented (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 7]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【54】The logistic regression analysis showed the history of allergy as the main predictor in the incidence of streptokinase ADRs (Odds ratio: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.48-457.6; p =0.026).\n\n【55】Discussion\n==========\n\n【56】This study evaluated 217 patients with acute ST-elevation MI who received streptokinase. The main finding of this research may be that the history of drug allergy was the main predictor in the incidence of ADRs induced by streptokinase. Furthermore, hypotension was one of the most occurred ADR that may be associated with the rapid injection of the drug. Moreover, in this study hemorrhagic stroke and bleeding complications was higher than the other reports. Although, no case of anaphylactic shock was documented.\n\n【57】In our study, the incidence of ADRs by streptokinase was reported 82% that is substantially higher than the other reports. For example, in Devi et al. retrospective cohort study and Mohebbi et al. prospective study that were conducted in coronary care unit (CCU), the highest ADRs were seen by streptokinase in about 60% (, ). However, this rate is similar to our recent study on reteplase with the incidence rate of 85% ().\n\n【58】Several studies have described the history of allergy as one of the predisposing factors in occurring ADRs. Hurwits et al. () in a prospective drug surveillance study of 1160 hospitalized patients showed that there was a significant relation between incidence of ADRs during the hospitalization and history of allergy among 118 patients. In the present study, the logistic regression analysis indicated drug allergy with the odds ratio of 3.26 as a predisposing factor in occurring of ADR by streptokinase.\n\n【59】One of the most occurred ADR was hypotension that may linked with the rapid injection of the drug. According to the previous studies, hypotension during streptokinase injection is a vasodilatory effect that is occurred by activation of plasmin and producing bradykinin (, ). The rate of hypotension during streptokinase therapy was reported between 1-10% that is relatively lower than our study finding (more than 50%) which can reflect the rapid injection of streptokinase (). In the recent review of Iranian literature, hypotension and arrhythmia were identified as the most frequent ADRs induced by streptokinase that is in agreement with our findings ().\n\n【60】Hemorrhagic stroke was the most severe side effect that occurred during hospitalization after the injection of streptokinase by documenting in 3 cases (1.4%). However, the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in these patients substantially was higher than the other reports. In a prospective and spontaneous reporting-based pharmacovigilance program in Cuba among 792 patients who received streptokinase, the hemorrhagic stroke were reported only in 3 cases (0.3%) (). In GISI-1 and ISIS-2 trials the incidence of major bleeding such as hemorrhagic stroke was reported between 0.3-0.5% (, ). Moreover, in Maggioni et al. () study, the incidence of various forms of stroke in patients treated with streptokinase was 0.94 %. Many factors including drug related factors such as bleeding complications as well as host related factors such as older age, female gender, anterior MI, history of smoking and hypertension are the main participating factors in occurring stroke ().\n\n【61】Several studies have described the role of gender in the incidence of ADRs. In the analysis of 48 cohort studies with 513,606 patients in UK, females were more likely to experience ADRs (60% more than males) (). Also, according to the Hurwits and Seidl et al. studies female patients are more likely than men to experience ADRs (, ). Similarly, in our study the incidence of ADRs in females was more than males that is in agreement with the earlier reports.\n\n【62】Moreover, our study indicated that the number of side effects increased along with the increasing age that is consistent with the numerous previous reports. Ageing related decrease in kidney and liver function may be one of the responsible factors (, ). Existence of various underlying diseases and poly pharmacy are the other participating factors that put the older patients to experience more ADRs (, ).\n\n【63】The significant correlation between the incidence of ADRs and underlying diseases such as hyperlipidemia, VF, PTE was the other finding of present study that is in line with the other reports, which had indicated the background diseases as a main predictor in the incidence of ADRs ().\n\n【64】Limitations and strengths\n\n【65】Despite the acceptable sample size of the study (n = 217), the major limitation in such studies is the partially small sample size. In fact, for precise detection and evaluation of all ADRs induced by a special drug a large sample size (more than 10,000) are needed. Second, present study included the relatively weak correlation coefficient that may be linked to this matter. Therefore, the result of this study should be interpreted with a caution. This study also included some key findings as strength points. First, it showed that the patients with history of drug allergy 3.2 times are more vulnerable to show one ADRs by streptokinase. This result could guide clinicians to use streptokinase with a caution in patients with the history of drug allergy. Second, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke in Iranian population is relatively higher than the other reports. This point along with the lower efficacy of streptokinase in the maintaining of thrombolysis in myocardial ischemia (TIMI) III flow may discourage the use of streptokinase by clinicians.\n\n【66】In summary, our study showed that the history of drug allergy is the main predictor in occurring ADRs by streptokinase. Furthermore, streptokinase therapy was associated with a higher rate of hemorrhagic stroke in Iranian population.\n\n【67】We would like to thank Shahid Madani Heart center of Tabriz and Tabriz University of Medical Science for their supporting of this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Introduction\n===============\n\n【1】Talin is a large cytoskeletal protein (2541 amino acid residues) that activates the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules and couples them to cytoskeletal actin . It is composed of an N-terminal globular head (∼50 kDa) that interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of β-integrins , linked to an extended flexible rod (∼220 kDa) comprising 62 helices organized into a series of helical bundles arranged like beads on a string  (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A). The rod contains a second integrin binding site , numerous putative binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin , at least two actin binding sites , and a C-terminal helix required for assembly of talin dimers . Talin exists in both an extended and a compact auto-inhibited form, and a domain in the talin rod (residues 1655--1822) interacts with the talin head rendering it unable to bind integrin tails .\n\n【2】While it is clear that the talin rod consists of a series of helical bundles the definition of the boundaries between these domains has not been straightforward. The first structures of the talin rod revealed a 5-helix bundle packed against a 4-helix bundle (residues 482--789) , and two 4-helix bundles (residues 755--889 and 1843--1973) . Among helical bundle domains, 4-helix bundles are among the most frequently observed, with an up-down-up-down topology such as that seen in talin being particularly common (structural classification of proteins (SCOP) ID 47161: <http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.b.dg.html>; ). However, our subsequent work showed that the domains towards the C-terminal end of the rod, spanning residues 1974--2482, are in fact 5-helix bundles , and this led us to re-examine the boundaries of the preceding domain. Here we show that this domain is actually a 5-helix bundle (residues 1815--1973) rather than a 4-helix bundle, and that the extra helix dramatically enhances the stability of the domain and renders the vinculin-binding site contained therein cryptic.\n\n【3】2. Materials and methods\n========================\n\n【4】2.1. Expression of recombinant talin polypeptides\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The regions encoding murine talin1 residues 1788--1973 (6h), 1815--1973 (5h) and 1843--1973 (4h) were synthesized by PCR using a mouse talin1 cDNA as template, and cloned into the expression vector pet-151TOPO (Invitrogen). Talin polypeptides were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 STAR (DE3) cultured in M9 minimal media containing ^15^NH~4~Cl and/or ^13^C-glucose. His-tagged talin polypeptides were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. The His-tag was removed by cleavage with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen), and the proteins were further purified by anion-exchange.\n\n【6】2.2.

Results and discussion\n=========================\n\n【15】3.1. Mapping the domain boundaries of the VBS3 region\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Our earlier studies of talin residues 1843--1973, which contains a vinculin-binding site referred to as VBS3, showed that its \\[^1^H, ^15^N\\]-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum had good dispersion with peak line widths consistent with a monomeric state (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B) and the structure (PDB ID: [2B0H](pdb:2B0H)) showed a well folded 4-helix bundle domain . However, in the light of our subsequent demonstration that the domains on either side (residues 1655--1822, 1974--2140, 2137--2294 and 2300--2482) are all 5-helix bundles , we sought to establish whether residues 1843--1973 could also be part of a larger 5-helix bundle. To test this we produced a series of constructs with different boundaries containing 4-helices 通用删除7(英):<u>(1843--1973)</u>, 5-helices 通用删除7(英):<u>(1815--1973)</u> and 6-helices 通用删除7(英):<u>(1788--1973)</u> (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B). Each of these polypeptides expressed well and was soluble.\n\n【17】Addition of a further predicted helix at the N-terminus resulted in a polypeptide (residues 1815--1973) whose spectrum showed a similar pattern of chemical shifts to that of residues 1843--1973 but with better chemical shift dispersion and similar signal intensities for all the peaks, suggesting that the 5-helix construct has a more stable fold. Addition of a sixth helix (residues 1788--1973) did not affect the signals of the 5-helix bundle but introduced a cluster of sharp signals close to the middle of the \\[^1^H, ^15^N\\]-HSQC spectrum, suggesting that the additional residues were unfolded (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B).\n\n【18】3.2. Structure of talin residues 1815--1973\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【19】The solution structure of the talin domain comprising residues 1815--1973 was calculated from 5117 NOE-based distance and 232 dihedral angle restraints. The structure consists of five anti-parallel amphipathic α-helices forming a bundle with up-down-up-down-up left-handed topology (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C and D). Helices 2--5 bear a strong resemblance to the 4-helix bundle structure previously determined (PDB ID: [2B0H](pdb:2B0H) ), with an RMSD of 1.2 Å for the region 1843--1973 and the same topology (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A--D). The 4-helix up-down, left-handed twist bundle is a common fold (SCOP 47161), and it forms the core of this and other domains in the talin rod. However in talin, uniquely, this fold is augmented by an extra N-terminal helix (here residues 1825--1842) connected by a long (9 residue) loop that allows this helix to pack against helices 3 and 4 of the bundle. Helix-1 is relatively short compared with the other helices (15 residues compared to 27--28 residues) and sits half way down the bundle, packing against the core of the bundle by an extensive hydrophobic interface (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C). Like the other helices, helix-1 is amphipathic and has its more hydrophobic surface buried in the bundle, packing against the hydrophobic groove between helices 3 and 4. The aromatic ring of Y1893 partially protrudes from the side of the 4-helix core of the bundle but the small side chain of A1834 in helix-1 allows close packing of the helices. This 5-helix left-handed crossover connectivity (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A) has been observed in several other talin bundles (482--655, 1655--1822, 1974--2140 and 2137--2294; SCOP ID 109879) but, to date, has not been observed in other proteins. We show here in the case of residues 1815--1973 that the extra helix has very striking effects on the properties of the domain.\n\n【20】The 4-helix up-down-up-down fold results in the N- and C-termini of the domain being at the same end of the bundle (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>A), whereas with a fifth helix the N- and C-termini are at opposite ends of the bundle. This is a key difference in a long rod such as talin; it is possible to arrange 5-helix bundles in the rod with the component helices parallel to the rod axis, whereas this is not possible for 4-helix bundles (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B and C).\n\n【21】This clear difference in the orientation of the helices relative to the long axis of the rod will result in significant differences in the mechanical properties of these two arrangements, which may be important for the activation of vinculin binding .\n\n【22】3.3. Helix-1 stabilises the bundle\n----------------------------------\n\n【23】The 4-helix construct, residues 1843--1973, forms a stable bundle with a melting temperature of 58° (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>E). Whilst the addition of the extra helix has only minimal structural effect on the core of the bundle (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>B and D) it has a substantial effect on the stability of the bundle, the 5-helix bundle having a melting temperature of 74 °C (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>E).\n\n【24】3.4. The vinculin binding characteristics of the domain depend on helix-1\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The four helix bundle containing VBS3 can bind the vinculin Vd1 domain at room temperature  (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, since the addition of the extra helix has a large effect on the stability of the bundle we anticipated that this would affect vinculin binding, since this requires unfolding of the bundle , and indeed the 5-helix bundle requires incubation at ⩾37 °C for binding to be observed (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). This result highlights the importance of using complete domains for vinculin binding studies, and suggests that the vinculin-binding site (VBS) in the 1815--1973 5-helix bundle is unlikely to be constitutively active in full length talin.\n\n【26】The various vinculin binding sequences in talin are similar  and the corresponding peptides all bind tightly to vinculin in vitro. However, this and previous studies show that VBSs buried within stable 5-helix bundles are cryptic, whereas those in 4-helix bundles are constitutively active . Experimental and theoretical studies show that vinculin binding to cryptic binding sites in talin can be activated by mechanical strain , and the present results indicate that this is likely to be essential for all the VBSs in the C-terminal part of the talin rod which are contained within 5-helix bundles (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>C). By contrast, two VBSs in the central and N-terminal part are likely to be constitutively active and may provide the initial attachment points for vinculin.\n\n【27】The work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust, the NIH Cell Migration Consortium (Grant U54 GM64346 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences) and Cancer Research UK.\n\n【28】![Characterisation of the talin polypeptides containing VBS3.

{"seq_id": "8fbaa11b-464e-4247-8216-d15b8aabf8f9", "title": "", "text": "【0】Silicon carbide (SiC) possesses the potential for excellent performance in powered electronic device, with characteristics such as a wide bandgap (approximately 3.25 eV for 4H-SiC), high thermal conductivity (4.9 W cm^−1^K^−1^), and high electric breakdown field (2.5--3.5 MV/cm for SiC versus 0.6 MV/cm for Si), which make it suitable for high-power and high-frequency metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices with reduced power loss. However, MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) that are fabricated on 4H-SiC exhibit extremely low inversion-channel mobilities because of the high density of interface traps (D~it~) at the SiO~2~/4H-SiC interface. According to recent studies, interface traps in SiC-based MOSFETs may be caused by the presence of excess C atoms, point defects, such as Si vacancies, and silicon oxycarbides (SiO~x~C~y~). The SiO~x~C~y~ species in the interfacial transition region (thickness ≈1 nm) are considered to be primarily responsible for the observed D~it~. Therefore, a high-quality gate oxide (e.g. SiO~2~) with a well-engineered interface is essential for enhancing the performance of SiC-based MOSFET devices. In particular, reducing the concentrations of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition region of the SiO~2~ film is critical for making a high-quality gate dielectric. It has been reported that thermally grown SiO~2~ contains a transition layer that is less than 10 Å thick. The transition region contains impurities (e.g. SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition layer of the SiO~2~/SiC interface) and other defect sites, such as dangling bonds, strained bonds, interface traps, and fixed charges. These defects deteriorate the electrical properties of SiC-based MOSFET devices, such as the charge-to-breakdown, carrier mobility, and gate-leakage current. Furthermore, because the relative thickness of the transition region of the SiO~2~ film increases as the scale of such devices decreases, the fabrication of high-quality SiO~2~ gates on SiC is becoming more important.\n\n【1】Thermal oxidation is the standard method for growing high-quality SiO~2~ films. However, because the growth of SiO~2~ on SiC substrates in a furnace is time consuming (several minutes to hours) and requires high temperatures (800--1400 °C), a high thermal stress is inevitably induced during the oxidation process, which results in a thicker transition region (i.e. higher concentrations of SiO~x~C~y~ species) and the generation of defects (e.g. excess C atoms and O vacancies) at the SiO~2~/SiC interface. Therefore, the interface between a SiO~2~ gate and SiC substrate is degraded during the thermal oxidation process by a greater extent than that of an equivalent SiO~2~ gate grown on a Si substrate. Recently, several studies have reported that the bulk traps caused by the generation of defects during high-temperature oxidation are responsible for the low mobility of 4H-SiC-based MOSFETs. Moreover, an excess of C atoms near the interface of the SiC substrate results in the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species via a reaction process involving O~2~ and di-interstitial C clusters \\[(C~i~)~2~\\] that are formed through the pairing of interstitial C atoms, which is a major cause of the degraded performance of MOSFET devices with SiC substrates.\n\n【2】In this study, the characteristics of SiO~2~ films grown on SiC substrates at room temperature for 300 s via direct plasma-assisted oxidation were investigated. A combination of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations showed that there is a clear difference between the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition regions of thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films. The results of this study indicate that the plasma-assisted oxidation method is very effective in improving the electrical characteristics of SiO~2~/SiC systems because of the reduced concentrations of SiO~x~C~y~ species and the energetically stable interface states of such systems.\n\n【3】Results and Discussion\n======================\n\n【4】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1(a,b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> show cross-sectional HR-TEM images of the thermally grown (dry oxidation) and plasma-assisted (O~2~ plasma oxidation) SiO~2~ films on SiC substrates, respectively. For both oxidation processes, SiO~2~ films with thicknesses of approximately 5 nm have been successfully grown via interfacial reactions on SiC substrates. To confirm the chemical states created by each oxidation process, XPS measurements (detection angle = 90°) were performed. The two main peaks in the Si 2p spectra of the SiO~2~ films (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1(c)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>) are caused by the fully oxidized state of the SiO~2~ films (Si^4+^ near 103.8 eV) and the bulk state of the SiC substrates (Si-C near 100.8 eV). However, there is a large difference in the chemical bonding states of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films, with the Si 2p spectrum of the thermally grown film containing an additional broad peak between 103 and 101.5 eV. This broad peak corresponds to the intermediate oxidation state of SiO~x~, which is indicative of unstable Si-O bonding near the SiO~2~/SiC transition region. Generally, the standard thermal oxidation process for growing SiO~2~ on Si-based semiconductors results in excellent electrical characteristics, such as a high intrinsic breakdown voltage and low leakage current. However, a side reaction occurs during the thermal oxidation of on SiC substrates, which results in the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species or clusters of excess C atoms. That is, interstitial C, graphite-like clusters, and/or sp^2^-bonded clusters are formed at the interfacial transition region (thickness ≈ 1 nm) between the SiO~2~ film and SiC substrate, the presence of which negatively affects the reliability of SiC-based MOS devices.\n\n【5】The chemical bonding characteristics of the intermediate broad peak in the Si 2p spectra were investigated in detail because it is related to the SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition region. The XPS spectra of the samples were measured at various detection angles to determine the distribution of SiO~x~C~y~ species along the depth direction of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Recently, Zhu et al. measured the depth distributions of various SiO~x~C~y~ species near the SiO~2~/SiC interface as a function of polar emission angle via angle-dependent XPS (ADXPS). The ADXPS measurements showed that there is not an abrupt change between the chemical bonding states of the resulting SiO~2~ layer and the SiC substrate at the interface. That is, there is a transition layer with a thickness of approximately 1 nm at the interface, which Zhu et al. described as a four-layer structure. Zhu et al. reported that the first layer of the transition layer contained SiOC~3~, which is formed through the reaction of O with the sub-surface Si atoms of the SiC substrate. Moreover, the results of the ADXPS measurements showed that the second, third, and fourth layers of the transition layer had different depth distributions of SiO~2~C~2~ and SiO~3~C species. Prior to performing the curve fitting of the XPS results, a Shirley background subtraction was performed and all spectra were charge compensated relative to the binding energy of the Si-C bond (100.8 eV). The Si 2p spectra were decomposed into contributions from SiC, SiOC~3~, SiO~2~C~2~, SiO~3~C, and SiO~2~ species, which will hereinafter be referred to as S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively. The chemical shifts of the S1--S4 peaks relative to the S0 peak at 100.8 eV are 0.7, 1.2, 2.0, and 3.0 eV, respectively. The results of ADXPS curve fitting show that the concentrations of the S1--S3 species in the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film decrease towards the subsurface of the film (i.e. traveling from the bulk SiC substrate to the SiO~2~ surface), which is unlike the results obtained in case of the thermally grown SiO~2~ film. In addition, in the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film, the S1--S3 species are not detected when the detection angle = 20°. These changes in the concentrations of the S1--S3 species indicate that the formation of the S1--S3 species in the transition region is closely related to the different oxidation processes caused by using an O~2~ plasma process. For a detailed and quantitative analysis of the depth distributions of the SiO~x~C~y~ species, changes in the chemical bonding ratios of the S1--S3 species were compared by calculating the peak areas of the ADXPS results, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The peak areas corresponding to the S1 (non-existent) and S2 species in the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film dramatically decrease in the film surface direction compared to that of the thermally grown film, with the SiO~x~C~y~ species no longer detected when the detection angle = 20°. The surface of the SiC substrate (atomic ratio of Si:C = 1:1) is gradually transformed into SiO~2~ (atomic ratio of Si:O = 1:2) during the oxidation process according to the reaction shown in [Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u>, which can be followed by a high-temperature oxidation process ([Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u>). The reaction shown in [Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u> involves dissociated C atoms that are created by the reaction shown in [Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u>, which are then incorporated into the SiO~2~ film at the interfacial region.\n\n【6】From the quantitative analysis of the depth distribution of SiO~x~C~y~ species in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>, a simplified reaction mechanism for each oxidation process was developed by considering the different diffusivities of the sources of O and the decomposition of Si and C at the SiO~2~/SiC interface during the initial growth stage, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The diffusion of O~2~ gas is not extremely fast during the thermal oxidation process. The O~2~ gas that inter-diffuses through the SiO~2~ film reacts with the SiC substrate at the SiO~2~/SiC interface, which results in the formation of mixed SiO~x~ states and the incorporation of C to create SiO~x~C~y~ species (S1, S2, and S3) at the transition region. On the other hand, during the plasma-assisted oxidation process, the highly activated and ionic O plasma, which is in either an atomic state or a radical state, can easily react with Si and C. The energy of the plasma is sufficient to form the more stable SiO~2~, which suppresses the incorporation of C into SiO~x~C~y~ species (S2 and S3). Moreover, the irradiation from the plasma-assisted oxidation process can break the unstable Si-O-C network structure, and the decomposed Si and Si-O can then react with the plasma to form the more stable SiO~2~. The highly active O plasma can also react with defect sites in the SiO~2~ layer, i.e. it can easily react with unstable SiO~x~C~y~ species, resulting in the formation of the more stable SiO~2~. Simultaneously, C-based by-products, such as CO or CO~2~ ([Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u>), are vaporized during the plasma-assisted oxidation process through reactions with decomposed C~i~ and C-O.\n\n【7】During the plasma-assisted oxidation process, some of the highly active O (ionic O) diffuses into the SiO~2~/SiC interface, while in the thermal oxidation process, it is mostly O~2~ that diffuses into the interface. Therefore, the thermal and plasma-assisted oxidation processes are very different, i.e. the former is controlled by interfacial reactions, while the latter is dependent upon the inter-diffusion process at the interface. In addition, the calculated formation energy (ΔE) for CO~2~ is extremely negative (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>; ΔE ≈ −21.939 eV, gas phase) in the 4H-SiC system. That is, it is easier to form CO~2~ during the plasma-assisted oxidation process than during the thermal oxidation process because of the reaction of the plasma with interstitial C atoms in the SiO~2~ film and SiO~2~/SiC interfacial region. The resulting CO~2~ then diffuses out as a gas through the thin SiO~2~ layer, and thus, it cannot contribute to the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species. Moreover, the generation of a gas phase and its outwards diffusion can enhance the oxidation of Si because the interstitial C atoms that are removed by the reaction do not hinder the oxidation process at the SiO~2~/SiC interface. Based on the aforementioned reactions, the decrease in the S1--S3 peak areas towards the surface of the SiO~2~ film in the ADXPS data for the plasma-assisted sample imply that the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species is effectively suppressed by the removal of C atoms.\n\n【8】To confirm the formation of stable Si-O bonds depending on the oxidation process, O K-edge XAS measurements were performed. The layer of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition region can induce defect states and disturb formation of stable SiO~2~ in the insulating bandgap. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the XAS spectra of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films, which directly reflect the molecular orbital hybridization between the Si and O states based on the unoccupied p-projected DOS of O, with the local atomic bonding symmetry determined by dipole selection rules. The XAS results in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5(a,b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> show an increase in the number of pre-edge states (indicated with a blue arrow). To analyze the absorption spectra in a narrow energy region of the pre-edge states, the renormalized O K-edge spectra were fitted with Gaussian peaks under the detection limit of the XAS set-up. The background was subtracted from the raw data via a straight background line before the normalization was performed. The difference in the pre-edge states is useful for comparing the relative magnitudes of the defect states in the O K-edge spectra. The energy states located near the pre-edge are evident after fitting the XAS data with Gaussian functions: peak D1 at 533 ± 0.2 eV. The D1 state is closely related to the unoccupied O states of SiO~x~, which can be defect states that induce gate-oxide leakage because of the O vacancies. The D1 state was present in the thermally grown sample, while a reduced-intensity D1 state is exhibited by the plasma-assisted sample. The different intensities of the D1 states clearly indicate that the plasma-assisted oxidation process suppresses the generation of O vacancies and forms more stable SiO~2~, it is relatively reduction of formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species. This reduction in the number of defect states can significantly affect the characteristics of SiC-based MOSFET devices because the carrier scattering that is caused by defect states critically degrades device performance. Therefore, it is important to obtain high-quality SiO~2~ films on SiC substrates with suppressed interfacial defects for reliable device characteristics.\n\nTo clarify the effects of plasma-assisted oxidation on the SiC substrate, electrical measurements were performed on a MOSCAP. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6(a,b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> show the C-V characteristics of the 5-nm-thick SiO~2~ films grown on SiC substrates via thermal and plasma-assisted oxidation methods, respectively, at three different frequencies. The most distinctive changes are the decrease in hysteresis at 100 kHz and the frequency dispersion of the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film (approximately 0.05 V and 4.3%) compared to that of the thermally grown film (approximately 0.18 V and 7.6%). This change in the frequency dispersion is accompanied by a frequency-dependent flat-band shift, which is related to the weak Fermi-level pinning by the interfacial states rather than the series resistance. Moreover, because the decrease in the C-V hysteresis is related to the reduction of the defect trap charge (O vacancies in the SiO~2~ film) in the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film, the reduced frequency dispersion of the plasma-assisted sample can be interpreted as a decrease in the number of interfacial defect states. In addition, the G-V characteristics was evaluated using the conductance G~m~ normalized by the angular frequency (ω) versus the applied gate voltage (V~g~) of the both MIS structures (thermal and plasma oxidation), as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6(c,d)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The conductance peak values of plasma-assisted oxidation are lower than those for thermal oxidation at each frequency (1 M, 100 k, 10 k and 1 kHz). This indicates that the decreased conductance peak values of plasma oxidation are caused by the drastically low concentrations of interface traps and reduced surface potential fluctuations related to the charge exchange at the SiO~2~/SiC interface compared with interface traps of thermal oxidation. This is because of the advantages of the plasma-assisted oxidation process, such as the low processing temperature, highly activated oxidant, and short processing time. To confirm the differences between the interfacial defect states of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~/SiC systems, D~it~ values (E~c~ − E; 0.2--0.55 eV at room temperature) were determined via the typical conductance method. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6(e)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows that the D~it~ value of the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film is approximately 10^11^ cm^−2^·eV^−1^, which is much lower than that of the thermally grown film (D~it~ ≈ 10^12^ cm^−2^·eV^−1^). This result corresponds well with the aforementioned reduction in the frequency dispersion. The significant reduction of D~it~ in the case of the plasma-assisted oxidation process strongly reflects the control of the interfacial defect states at the SiO~2~/SiC interface. In addition to the D~it~ characterization, the differences between the border trap densities of the samples were investigated by measuring the C-V hysteresis characteristics at 100 kHz, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6(f)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The shift in the C-V curve toward a positive voltage during the reverse sweep indicates that the electron trapping process communicates electrically via a slow response time, such that substrate injection into the SiO~2~ film occurs near the interface between SiO~2~/SiC, which is referred to as a border traps. The border traps exchange the charges with the substrate on the time scale of the measurement. The C-V measurement was performed at a sweep rate as low as \\~0.1 Vs^−1^ to encompass most of the border traps. The effective border trap density per unit energy was calculated from the difference between the capacitances of the forward and reverse C-V scans \\[C~rf~ (V~g~) = \\|C~r~ − C~f~ \\|\\], where C~r~ and C~f~ are the capacitance densities at a given V~g~ during the reverse and forward scans, respectively. The results show that the number of the effective border trap in the plasma oxidation sample (1.36 × 10^10^ V^−1^cm^−2^) is smaller than in the thermal oxidation sample (7.02 × 10^10^ V^−1^cm^−2^). It is known that slow traps can be located at the interfacial region between the oxide (thermal or plasma-SiO~2~) and the interfacial transition layer near the SiC substrate. Therefore, the high border trap density in the thermal-SiO~2~ sample could result from formation of oxygen vacancies and SiO~x~C~y~ species at the interface region during the thermal oxidation process, as observed in the previous XPS and XAS results. These defects influence the charge trapping and detrapping process, resulting in a large hysteresis. Finally, we can determine from the border trap characteristics that defect generation in the SiO~2~ oxide is more suppressed in the plasma-assisted oxidation process than in the thermal oxidation process. Moreover, we evaluated the electrical characteristics of the thermal and plasma oxidation samples using the thicker films (\\~30 nm SiO~2~). The frequency dispersion, hysteresis, D~it~, and border trap density are significantly decreased in the plasma-assisted oxidation sample when compared to the thermal oxidation sample, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u> of the [supporting information]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>. Therefore, the electrical results from the thin (\\~5 nm) and thick (\\~30 nm) films suggest that the plasma process used to obtain an energetic oxygen source is a successful approach to the growth of high-quality insulating films on SiC substrates for FET devices.\n\n【10】On the other hand, based on the electrical characteristics, the defects (high border traps and D~it~) are responsible for the degraded performance of 4H-SiC MOSFETs. Thus, to confirm the effects of the plasma-assisted oxidation process on the defective excess of C atoms, DFT calculations were performed to evaluate the interstitial C defect states in the SiO~2~ films. Using a unit cell with a single C atom in the interstitial site of the SiO~2~ structure, the partial density of states (PDOS) for the C, O, and Si atoms in the SiO~2~ film was evaluated by considering the optimized values for the atomic structure, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 7(a)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. By comparing the PDOS of the C, O, and Si atoms at the interstitial C site of the SiO~2~ structure, it can be seen that the defect states within the SiO~2~ bandgap are predominantly generated by interstitial C atom (dashed red line). The PDOS results indicate that the electrical characteristics (higher frequency dispersion (C-V) and D~it~) of the thermally grown SiO~2~ film are significantly affected by the presence of interstitial C atoms at the SiO~2~/SiC interface. The corresponding changes in the total density of states (TDOS) of the SiO~2~ structure depending on the presence of interstitial C atoms were also confirmed, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 7(b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The TDOS results show that the generation of defect states within the bandgap is controlled by the presence of interstitial C atoms within the SiO~2~ film. That is, the low border traps and D~it~ values of the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ clearly support the conclusion that the improvements in the electrical characteristics can be attributed to the reactions of the energetic plasma with the SiC substrate.\n\n【11】To confirm the effects of the band structure (i.e. the conduction-band offset (CBO) and valence-band offset (VBO)) on the conduction mechanism, the REELS and valence band (VB) spectra of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~/SiC systems were obtained, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 8]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Energy-band parameters such as the bandgap (E~g~) can be defined as the threshold energy required for band-to-band excitation, as shown in the REELS spectra (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 8(a)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The measured optical E~g~ of each SiO~2~ film is 9.0 ± 0.2 eV, which is almost the same as the literature value. To measure the VBO between the SiO~2~ film and SiC substrate, VB spectra were obtained for the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~/SiC samples, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 8(b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. The effective electron-barrier height, i.e. the CBO, is calculated with Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>:\n\n【12】The energy-band diagrams of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 8(c,d)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. In the plasma-assisted system, the effective hole-barrier height decreases to approximately 0.15 eV, while the effective electron-barrier height increases to approximately 0.15 eV.\n\n【13】Finally, the stability of the SiO~2~ films under voltage stressing conditions was evaluated by measuring the stress-induced leakage current (SILC). The I-V measurements were performed under a positive gate voltage (substrate electron injection). Successive forward I-V measurements with different ramping voltages were applied under ramped voltage stressing (RVS), as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 9]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Once the stressing voltage increases beyond 2.6 V, the degree of leakage current in the I-V curve of the thermally grown SiO~2~ film increases. Since tunneling processes such as quantum mechanical tunneling and trap-assisted tunneling through the dielectric are increased by the electrical stress, defects (i.e. new electron traps) can be generated in the thermally grown SiO~2~ film by repeated high-field stresses. Thus, applying a high-field stress to the thin gate dielectric produces a leakage current. Hence, the increase in the leakage current of the thermally grown SiO~2~ film indicates that defects are generated in the film after a stressing voltage of 2.6 V is reached, which is lower than the breakdown voltage (3.0 V), as shown 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 9(a)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. On the other hand, with the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film, the leakage current characteristics are unchanged within the breakdown voltage of 3.0 V, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 9(b)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. In addition, we performed cumulative distribution measurements of XPS (detection angle = 90^o^) and SILC (stressing voltage of 2.9 V) for sufficient statistical analysis of reproduced samples using the direct plasma-assisted oxidation process under the same process condition (SiO~2~ thickness \\~5 nm), as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. S3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>. The results of quantitative quantity of the S1, S2 and S3 (SiO~x~C~y~ species) were suppressed in plasma oxidation samples and maintained their ratios. Moreover, the cumulated SILC measurements of the leakage current characteristics is unchanged below the hard breakdown voltage of 3.0 V at the stressing voltage of 2.9 V. Thus, direct plasma-assisted oxidation strongly suggests the suppressed formation of SiO~x~C~y~ and improved interfacial quality of the SiO~2~ film. The main reasons for the low leakage current under high applied fields are as follows. First, the CBO of the plasma-assisted system compared to that of the thermally grown system is relatively high; the CBO is the potential barrier for electrons, and it is determined from the energy-band diagram shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 8(c)]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>. Second, the intrinsic defects, such as O vacancies and SiO~x~C~y~ species, in the interfacial transition layer are effectively suppressed in the plasma-assisted system. Thus, the difference between the SILCs of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted systems indicates that the plasma-assisted oxidation process has distinct advantages, such as controlling the electron-barrier height and defect states.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n===========\n\n【15】In summary, the different characteristics of the transition regions of thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films on 4H-SiC substrates were demonstrated through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. The plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film grown at room temperature for 300 s had significantly decreased concentrations of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the transition region compared to that of the thermally grown film. The decreased concentrations of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the plasma-assisted SiO~2~ film improved its electrical characteristics (reduced frequency dispersion, hysteresis, and D~it~ ≈ 10^11^ cm^−2^ · eV^−1^) and SILC characteristics. The results of this study indicate that the plasma-assisted oxidation process improves the quality of SiO~2~ films by suppressing the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species in the interfacial transition region and encouraging the formation of an energetically stable interfacial state between the SiO~2~ film and SiC substrate, which is achieved by effectively preventing the formation of interstitial C atoms at the SiO~2~/SiC interface. The results of this study also show that the C atoms generated during the oxidation process play a significant role in inducing interfacial defect states through the formation of SiO~x~C~y~ species. Therefore, the physical and electrical results have shown that using a plasma source to obtain energetic O is a successful approach for the growth of high-quality insulating films on SiC substrates. Furthermore, the results of this study provide important information for improving the reliability of SiO~2~/SiC-based MOSFET devices. Therefore, simple and low-cost thin-film SiO~2~ can be rapidly fabricated on SiC substrates via a direct plasma-assisted oxidation process at room temperature. Finally, the results of this study suggest that an active oxidation process is highly favorable for the fabrication of high-power FET devices.\n\n【16】Methods\n=======\n\n【17】Experiment\n----------\n\n【18】SiO~2~ films that were approximately 5 nm thick were grown via thermal and plasma-assisted oxidation methods on the 通用删除7(英):<u>(0001)</u> Si face of epi-ready, n-type, 4H-SiC substrates (doping concentration ≈ 1 × 10^18^ cm^−3^). Before performing the oxidation processes, the SiC substrates were cleaned for 1 min in a dilute solution (approximately 1%) of hydrofluoric (HF) acid. The thermal oxidation process was performed in a furnace for 20 min under a dry O~2~ atmosphere at 1050 °C. The plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films were grown in a remote radio-frequency (RF) plasma chamber at room temperature for 300 s under a flow of O~2~ gas (1000 sccm; ignition gas = Ar, 20 s) and plasma power of 1100--1400 W (通用删除8(英):<u>[supporting Fig. S1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}</u>). The thicknesses of the SiO~2~ films on the SiC substrates were investigated via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The HR-TEM images were obtained using a field-emission gun at an acceleration voltage of 200 keV. The energy bandgaps of the SiO~2~ films were measured via reflection electron energy-loss spectroscopy (REELS) with a primary beam energy of 1.0 keV. The chemical bonding states and valence band of the SiO~2~ films grown on the 4H-SiC substrates were examined via high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS); a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.7 eV) with a pass energy of 23 eV was used with detection angles of 20--90°. The SiC substrates were electrically grounded to the electron analyzer to eliminate any charging effects. The binding energies of the measured core-level spectra and valence band were calibrated relative to the SiC substrate peak in the Si 2p spectrum (100.8 eV for the Si-C bond). The characteristics of the defect states in the SiO~2~ films were examined via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS); a synchrotron X-ray source at the X1B beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) was used for these measurements. XAS photon energies of 520--560 eV (energy step = 0.05 eV) were used to measure the O K~1~-edge absorption spectra of the SiO~2~ films by using the total electron yield mode.\n\n【19】To examine the effects of the plasma-assisted oxidation method on a MOS capacitor (MOSCAP), a TiN film (area = 6.4 × 10^−5^ cm^2^; thickness = 200 nm) was deposited on a SiO~2~/SiC substrate via a top electrode via a lift-off technique. To obtain an accurate understanding of the interfacial defects, forming gas annealing (i.e. a defect-curing process) was not performed. Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and leakage current density-electric field (J-E) measurements were performed with an Agilent E4980A LCR meter and an Agilent B1500A semiconductor device analyzer, respectively. To compare the D~it~ values of the thermally grown and plasma-assisted SiO~2~ films, the capacitance (C~m~) and conductance (G~m~) of the films were measured. The D~it~ values were determined via calculations by using a combination of forward bias capacitance-frequency (C-f ) and G-f measurements to obtain the parallel conductance (G~p~), while the energy levels of the defect states were determined from frequency measurements. The G~p~/ω values were calculated using Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>:\n\n【20】where ω = 2πf, f varies from 1 kHz to 1 MHz, and C~ox~ is the gate-oxide capacitance. A correction term was introduced to account for the leakage current, which was obtained from the current-voltage (I-V) curves. The D~it~ in the depletion region is proportional to the maximum value of G~p~/ω, as shown in Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>:\n\n【21】where A is the area of the electrode and q is the elemental charge. The trap energy level given by Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics for the carrier capture and emission rates was evaluated using [Equation 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"disp-formula\"}</u>, which describes the relationship between the time constant of the trap (τ) and the frequency:\n\n【22】In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the defect-formation energy of the C atoms (interstitial and converted atoms) in the SiO~2~ films by applying super cell models. The atomic structures and energy states were calculated with the Vienna Ab-initio simulation package; a generalized-gradient approximation functional, PBESol, was used for the exchange-correlation energy functional. First, geometry optimization was performed for the unit cell of the SiO~2~ structure. To evaluate the defect-formation energy and energy state, O sites or interstitial sites were replaced with C atoms and the geometry optimization was performed with a 3 × 3 × 1 super cell. DFT calculations for the geometry optimization and density of states (DOS) were then performed. Gamma k-points were used for the geometry optimization, and 3 × 3 × 1 k-points were used to calculate the energy state and DOS. All calculations were performed with a plane wave cut-off energy of 500 eV.\n\n【23】Additional Information\n======================\n\n【24】通用删除5(英):<u>How to cite this article: Kim, D.-K. et al.

Glutathione is known to have multifaceted physiological functions and is a critical factor in protecting organisms against toxicity and disease. Intracellular cysteine concentration is a limiting factor for glutathione synthesis. In the present study, the metabolism of intra- and extracellular glutathione in HeLa and hepatoma cell cultures is investigated by using different transport inhibitors for cellular uptake of cystine/cysteine. There exist several ways of cystine/cysteine transport into HeLa and hepatoma cells, and inhibition of them decreased intracellular concentration of cystine/cysteine and in some cases also of glutathione. It was also shown that a large pool of total cell culture glutathione was located extracellularly in both HeLa and hepatoma cell cultures when gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GT) activity was inhibited by acivicin (ACI). Furthermore, the addition of thiol-reactive metal ions significantly increased the total amount of glutathione in hepatoma cell cultures during acivicin inhibition. Thus, occasional determinations of extracellular concentrations of glutathione without GT inhibition strongly underestimate the total turnover of glutathione in a cell culture.

Proper selection of surgical candidates is considered critical not only for successful DBS, but also to prevent complications by adequately planning surgical-related procedures \\[--\\]. DBS complications have been classified as surgery-, device-, and stimulation-related issues and complications can be a cause of a prolonged length of hospital stay or re-hospitalization after surgery. Most common surgery-related complications, which present in the acute setting, are neurovascular disorders, seizures, postoperative confusion, and infections. Hardware- or stimulation-related issues are present as subacute or longer-term effects. The reported incidence of complications vary in the published literature, with most of the surgery-related side effects presenting in less than 5% of cases, and device- and stimulation-related side effects varying from 1--75% \\[\\].\n\n【3】DBS has shown to be a risk factor for unintended hospitalization in PD patients, and DBS PD patients are 2.5 times as likely to be hospitalized than non-DBS PD patients \\[\\]. However, specific DBS complications leading to hospitalization have not been reported in large series. To date, there are no universally accepted criteria for assessing DBS candidacy, and selection has been based largely on expert consensus \\[\\]. Many DBS centers utilize an interdisciplinary approach to determine the appropriate candidate for surgery. At our institution, we perform a multi-specialty interdisciplinary preoperative assessment followed by a team discussion of risks and benefits classifying patients in levels of surgical concern in order to decide on candidacy. This interdisciplinary assessment is widely felt to be the optimal model for the delivery of patient centered care for PD patients, however there is wide variability in practice and there are little data to support its implementation and use.\n\n【4】In an effort to identify patients who were at higher risk for hospitalizations post-surgery, with the ultimate goal of guiding follow up and interventions that can reduce or prevent unintended hospitalizations, we aimed to compare the history of UH following DBS with the concerns reported during the interdisciplinary DBS screening evaluation. We also compared postsurgical complications, clinical outcomes, and quality of life (QoL) measurements between groups. Additionally, we reported the issues uncovered by each DBS screening specialty team contributing to the decision on DBS surgery candidacy.\n\n【5】Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec007}</u>\n=======\n\n【6】The University of Florida (UF) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study. All patients provided informed consent according in the IRB approved UF INFORM protocol. Patient records were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. The UF INFORM database holds data of over 9,000 patients, including information of the DBS and clinical follow-up data.\n\n【7】Study design, setting, and participants 删除19:<u>{#sec008}</u>\n---------------------------------------\n\n【8】An observational cohort study was conducted at the UF Health Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration. Patients with a diagnosis of PD who had DBS implantations from the period of January 2011 to February 2013 were selected for the study and evaluated at 6 and 12 months post DBS surgery. The diagnosis of PD and the decision to screen for DBS surgery was made by a movement disorder trained specialist based on current expert recommendations \\[, \\]. There were 164 candidates screened by the UF interdisciplinary DBS team and 133 (81%) were approved for DBS surgery. Thirty-one patients (19%) were excluded either because they were previously implanted at another medical center or were not considered appropriate candidates for surgery by the DBS team.\n\n【9】As part of our Center's standard of care, all DBS candidates were pre-operatively and independently evaluated by seven interdisciplinary team members. The team members consisted of a movement disorders trained neurologist, a functional neurosurgeon, a neuropsychologist, a psychiatrist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and a speech-language pathologist. The risks and potential benefits for each DBS candidate, as well as the proposed surgical interventions, were discussed during an interdisciplinary team meeting requiring the input of all seven specialties, and consensus approval was reached prior to any intervention.\n\n【10】Data sources and measurements 删除19:<u>{#sec009}</u>\n-----------------------------\n\n【11】Demographics and clinical variables were obtained from the UF INFORM database complemented by each patient's electronic medical record. The variables documented included gender, age at surgery, disease duration, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III at baseline (\"off\" and \"on\" medication scores), at 6 and 12 month post DBS surgery (\"off\" medication \"on\" stimulation, and \"on\" medication \"on\" stimulation scores), and the 39-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) was also obtained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post DBS \\[\\]. The PDQ-39 is a self-reported quality of life scale composed of 8 subscores (mobility, activities of daily living, emotional, stigma, social, cognition, community, and discomfort) graded in a Likert-type scale (never, occasionally, sometimes, often, and always) where higher scores represent a better QoL.\n\n【12】Outcomes 删除19:<u>{#sec010}</u>\n--------\n\n【13】The UF interdisciplinary team classified all DBS candidates as having major, minor, or no concerns for future DBS therapy based on each team's clinical evaluations. A concern was defined as a clinical finding, which could place an individual patient at risk for post-surgical complications. These concerns were stratified as, 1. Major Concern: the risk of surgery possibly exceeded the benefit; 2. Minor Concern: a potentially increase the risk of DBS existed, but the benefits outweigh the risks; 3. No Concern: no concerns for surgery were observed (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除18:<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> details examples of concerns raised by services during interdisciplinary discussion). Although the evaluations were based on detailed quantitative assessment, the final discussion and concerns were expressed in qualitative manner. Assessments used by Neuropsychology and included the Depression Rating Scale (DRS), Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Apathy scale (AS). Psychiatry used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). The physical therapy team used certain criteria to determine fall risk that included clinical judgment combined with quantitative measures: previous history of falling and performance on the Berg Balance Scale, timed up and go, and the 10-meter walk test. Speech and swallow therapists used the Communicative Effectiveness Survey (CES) and a dysphagia-specific quality of life (SWAL-QOL) and quality of care (SWAL-CARE) scales. In this analysis concerns from each specialty were given equal weight regardless of the individual specialty. DBS approved candidates were informed of their risks and concerns and it was therefore possible to have one or more specialties express a major concern and for an individual patient to still receive the operation.\n\n【14】10.1371/journal.pone.0153785.t001\n\n【15】###### Examples of concerns raised by specialties during discussion of DBS candidacy.\n\n【16】删除20:<u>![]</u>删除18:<u>(pone.0153785.t001)</u>删除19:<u>{#pone.0153785.t001g}</u>\n\n【17】  Specialty                        Major Concern                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Minor Concerns\n  -------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Neurology                        Revision of diagnosis (e.g. PD to atypical parkinsonism); lack of levodopa response or poor levodopa response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Age, comorbidities (e.g. DM, HTN); Disease characteristic that is not of primary concern to the patient but may be unresponsive to DBS; Pacemaker; Seizure disorder\n  Neurosurgery                     Aggregate high surgical risk: advanced age, HTN, DM, obesity or malnutrition, smoking/COPD, cardiac disease, anticoagulation, h/o anesthetic complications.

If a hospitalization was reported, this was then verified by reviewing the patient's electronic medical record. Any hospital admission for a PD- or a non- PD related causes were considered as hospitalization. The reason of hospitalization was also documented. Hospitalizations for DBS lead implants or Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) changes were not included. Postsurgical complications presenting within the 1^st^ year after DBS surgery were documented, including postoperative infections, systemic or device-related, falls, post-operative mental status changes, or local skin changes around the incision site, regardless of the presence or absence of hospitalization. The complications were classified as related to DBS or not related to DBS in accordance with a previously performed study \\[\\].\n\n【20】Statistical Analysis 删除19:<u>{#sec011}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【21】Patient characteristics, clinical, and QOL assessments were compared between UH-positive and -negative groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Fisher exact test was used to assess UH by levels of concerns from pre-surgery assessments. The comparisons of the DBS and non-DBS related data in UH, falls, and infection were analyzed using the Exact binomial test. The number of concerns and UH were compared using the Cochran-Armitage analysis. To identify potential predictors for UH following DBS, multiple logistic regression analyses were used considering the presence of UH as a dependent variable while age, disease duration, pre-and post-operative severity of motor symptoms (on and off UPDRS), pre and post-operative PDQ-39 were used as independent variables. All calculations were performed using SAS software, version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was set at p \\< 0.05.\n\n【22】Results 删除19:<u>{#sec012}</u>\n=======\n\n【23】Participants 删除19:<u>{#sec013}</u>\n------------\n\n【24】A total of 164 PD candidates for DBS were assessed by the UF interdisciplinary team, where 133 (81.1%) patients were considered appropriate for DBS surgery. All completed follow-up and were included in the final analysis. The cohort was composed of 66.4% males, which had a mean age at surgery of 62.8 (SD 8.9) years, with mean disease duration of 11.4 (SD 5.1) years. Mean UPDRS part III preoperative \"off\" and\"on\" medication scores were 38.6 (SD 10.7) and 24.7 (SD 9.7), with mean postoperative \"off\" medication \"on\" stimulation score of 39.5 (SD 11.7) and \"on\" medication \"on\" stimulation score of 26.9 (SD 9.9) at 6 months and 34.5 (SD 9.5) and 25.1 (SD 9) at 12 months post DBS implantation. Mean preoperative PDQ-39 score was of 258.1 (SD 127), with a mean score of 202.9 (SD 106.4) at 6 months and of 193.5 (SD 114.3) at 12 months follow-up.\n\n【25】DBS team outcomes 删除19:<u>{#sec014}</u>\n-----------------\n\n【26】Forty-seven percent (63/133) of the appropriate DBS candidates were classified as having either major or minor concerns.

Twenty-one percent of patients (1 in 5) had an unintended postoperative hospitalization following DBS therapy. Other studies have revealed that regardless of DBS status, patients with PD experienced a higher rate of hospitalization when compared to age-matched controls \\[--\\] and that up to one-third of patients with PD will visit the emergency department or be hospitalized at least once a year \\[\\]. Our results add to the literature on PD hospitalization, and demonstrate that patients seeking DBS therapy with major or minor concerns uncovered by interdisciplinary screening have more UH. This finding supports the potential importance of fall prevention therapy and other directed approaches for reducing morbidity in DBS patients. In fact, the rate of major and minor concerns in the UH group eclipsed 90%. Major causes of UH were variable and included depression, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, dysphagia, balance issues, and falling. A non-significant difference in the rate of hospitalization was observed in those candidates who had DBS when compared to those who did not undergo DBS surgery, (21% vs. 19%, p = 1), however, only documented hospitalizations could be considered in this analysis.\n\n【70】The three most common disciplines whose concerns were associated with UH were psychology, neuropsychology and neurology. Though the other disciplines were not as vital to UH and QOL, this does not diminish the value of these services particularly to the DBS screening process. In a related study by our group looking at UH in ET DBS patients, the most common specialty of origin for concerns in UH patients were neurosurgery, physical therapy, neurology, neuropsychology, and speech. This finding underscores the importance of having a sufficiently wide array of specialties in order to address the risks associated with utilizing DBS for heterogeneous diseases often requiring different therapeutic brain targets. We suspect that much of the reasons for the importance of these disciplines hinged on the critical importance of non-motor PD symptoms which may affect up to 88% of PD patients \\[\\]. It is difficult to reconcile that although the most common concerns raised in the UH group were mood or cognitive related, the most common cause for hospitalizations was falls.\n\n【71】In patients who required hospitalization following DBS, the cause was not directly DBS-related in over 80% of cases, consistent with previous findings \\[\\]. The results of the UH group also revealed that the higher the level of concern, the higher the rate of UH. Management of the concerns uncovered by an interdisciplinary DBS team have been previously addressed in a cohort of Essential Tremor patients by our group \\[\\], however, we would argue that PD patients with concerns raised by the screening team should undergo pre-operative counseling and closer post-operative follow-up care. These care issues were not addressed by our study. Avoidance of UH likely will include fall prevention, more frequent follow up, drug optimization, and active monitoring of pharmacological and behavioral therapy compliance \\[, \\].\n\n【72】This study was limited by the retrospective chart review methodology which has the tendency to miss or to under-report complications, though it should be pointed out that the sample size was reasonably large, and may have somewhat protected against this bias. Additionally, the levels of concerns used in the study were determined based on the judgment of specialists who focus solely on movement disorders and thus may affect the generalizability of results to those practices that do not employ movement disorder specific specialists. However, assessments were based in part on quantitative tests. Each team evaluated the candidates based on their detailed quantitative assessment, though discussion and concerns were expressed qualitatively. Further studies should be conducted to compare qualitative and quantitative screening methodologies, though we suspect both techniques will be needed to account for the complexity of the DBS screening process. No comparisons were made of assessment outcomes between screens employing seven specialties versus those employing a more traditional approach of fewer specialties. It would be interesting to quantitate the incremental value, if any, of adding more extensive evaluations comprising more specialties. The absence of a control group (without interdisciplinary team evaluation) limited the interpretation of the results, however using a control group would not have been considered ethically reasonable. There were many different targets implanted across patients reporting falls as the main reason of UH, suggesting the possibility that other factors such as disease progression underpinned falling. A previous study reported an association between using antidepressants and the frequency of falls in PD patients; however, we did not investigate this association \\[\\].\n\n【73】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec020}</u>\n==========\n\n【74】The current study demonstrated that the DBS interdisciplinary team approach provided important information on risk for UH and improvement in QOL following DBS surgery. The success of DBS therapy is known to heavily depend on the quality of candidate selection. We would contend that detailed screenings by interdisciplinary teams may be useful for more than just patient selection. These evaluations may help to stratify risk for post-operative hospitalization and QOL outcomes.\n\n【75】This manuscript was run through the iThenticate system provided by the University of Florida and the 1^st^ author takes all responsibility for ensuring originality.\n\n【76】通用结尾删除-1:<u>[^1]: Competing Interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</u>\n\n【77】通用结尾删除-1:<u>[^2]: Conceived and designed the experiments: MH HM MSO.

{"seq_id": "d9915dc7-54cc-4250-8017-20c94f20d55b", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】Chronic prostatitis remains somewhat of an enigma in Urology. Ever since its description in 1968 () and initial attempt at classification 10 years later (), this condition has been long on hypotheses and short on hard data. The last 10 years have, however, seen significant growth in research on prostatitis, resulting in better evidenced-based therapies. This review will focus on the latest development on the treatment strategies developed for the treatment of category III/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) of the NIH classification (). Category III prostatitis (previously referred to as nonbacterial prostatitis or prostatodynia) is defined by the persistent symptoms of pelvic and genital pain and urinary symptoms without evidence for urinary tract infection.\n\n【2】General supportive measures\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Although efficacy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, men with CP/CPPS are frequently suggested to avoid spicy food, caffeine and alcohol, together with sitz baths. The issue of ejaculation is controversial, as some men report exacerbation of symptoms () whereas other report reduction () with regular ejaculation. Stress has also been convincingly associated with CPPS. Indeed, in a well designed study, Ullrich et al () reported greater perceived stress during the 6 months after the healthcare visit was associated with greater pain intensity and disability at 12 months. Based on those findings, stress reduction is frequently advocated. Importantly, stress reduction can assist in reducing the disability and response to pain. Furthermore, men with CP/CPPS are more likely to suffer from neurologic and psychiatric conditions then control patients ().\n\n【4】Antimicrobials\n--------------\n\n【5】At some point in the natural course of the disease, it is possible that bacterial infection is implicated in the etiology of CP/CPPS. Even though uropathogenic bacteria are cultured from a minority of patients with CP/CPPS, antimicrobial therapy is the most commonly prescribed treatment (). Importantly, there is no difference in culture results of urine and prostatic fluid between men with CPPS and asymptomatic controls.\n\n【6】The prostatic tissue is best penetrated by lipophillic drugs that have high pKa. In this group, we find the quinolones, the macrolides and sulfa drugs. Based on their pharmacokinetic profile, the quinolones are the drug of choice for patients with CP/CPPS. From a microbiological stand point, their broad spectrum (Chlamydia, mycoplasma and both gram positive and gram negative bacteria) also cover most uropathogens. In non-placebo controlled studies, ciprofloxacin, levaquin and lomefloxacin have all proved clinically effective for patients with category II prostatitis (chronic bacterial) (; ). Unfortunately, neither levaquin nor ciprofloxacin were found more effective than placebo in a randomized controlled trial in men with CPPS (; ). Macrolides such as azithromycin or clarithromycin also penetrate the prostate well (). These drugs have been reportedly used with some success in men with CP/CPPS (, ), but never in the context of a randomized controlled trial. In light with the above-mentioned results, a critical analysis of the therapies for use in CP/CPPS, among which antibiotics, can be found in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the available data so far does not support use of antibiotics in CP/CPPS ().\n\n【7】The observed beneficial effect of antibiotics in some trials could be explained by a placebo effect or through a mechanism of action of the compounds not related to their antimicrobial activity. Antibiotics such as quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-inflammatory effects independent of their antimicrobial effects. It is also unclear if bacteria in the prostate proliferate in a environment protected by biofilms, as this may affect the choice of antibiotics ().\n\n【8】Despite these controversies, antimicrobials remain the most common treatment used in patients with CP/CPPS. While it appears that some patients with CP/CPPS show clinical improvement with antimicrobials, prolonged use without a documented infection or symptomatic improvement is unwarranted.\n\n【9】Prostate massage and ejaculation\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】Before the availability of broad-sprectum antimicrobials, prostatic massage was the mainstay of treatment for patients with prostatitis (). Mechanistically, prostate massage could help drain occluded prostatic duct and increase penetration of the gland by antimicrobial agents (). It could also disrupt bacterial biofilms or massage a neuromuscular trigger point along the pelvic side wall. In a non-controlled study, prostate massage 2--3 times per week for 4--6 weeks with concurrent antibiotic treatment had some clinical benefit in patients with CP/CPPS (). Frequent ejaculation achieves similar results (). It has also been demonstrated that 40% of CP/CPPS patients treated with antibiotics and prostatic massage had lasting clinical improvement, especially if there was large volume of clumpy expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) at the first visit or if prostate cultures remained positive despite adequate antibiotics ().\n\n【11】Alpha-blockers\n--------------\n\n【12】CP/CPPS patients also frequently present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) of both obstructive and irritative nature. Furthermore, some of these patients will present with urodynamic evidence of bladder outlet obstruction (; ). A subset of these patients will also have ultrasonographic evidence of bladder neck hypertrophy () with an accompanying obstructive pattern on uroflowmetry (). Such dysfunctional voiding is, however, probably not the predominant factor for the majority of men suffering from CP/CPPS (; ) and the use of urodynamic testing in patients with CP/CPPS is not widely accepted (). Alpha-blockers can also have a direct effect on pain. It has been demonstrated that prostatic inflammation leads to substance P-mediated changes in the pain perception regions of the spinal cord and that these changes are blocked by tamsulosin (). Importantly, the presence of urinary symptoms does not correlate with improvement in pain in CPPS patients who take alpha blockers.\n\n【13】A well designed study with alfuzosin was performed in patients with CP/CPPS and demonstrated a small, but statistically significant improvement in the NIH-CPSI score (). The effect was only apparent after several months of treatment and disappeared when the treatment was stopped. Results with tamsulosin are mixed, with one study demonstrating a significant effect () and another one no effect () when comparing against placebo. The latter negative study used a shorter treatment duration and included men who may have failed alpha blocker therapy in the past. Terazosin was also found to be superior to placebo in another study (). Until larger definitive trials are completed, it appears reasonable to attempt treatment of CP/CPPS patients with 3--6 months of an alpha-blocker.\n\n【14】Anti-inflammatory\n-----------------\n\n【15】There is growing evidence that inflammation plays a significant role in CP/CPPS. Indeed, elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (; ), low level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (), reactive oxygen species () and endorphin or prostaglandins () have all been associated with the diagnosis or symptom severity of patients with CP/CPPS when compared to healthy controls. It may be possible that an initial bacterial infection triggers a dysregulated inflammatory reaction.\n\n【16】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have long been used in CP. In a non-controlled study, it has been shown that ketoprofen suppository or oral nimesulide had some efficacy in CP/CPPS patients (). There is a well designed, blinded placebo-controlled study of an anti-inflammatory agent in CP/CPPS patients in which a small effect was observed (). Unfortunately, the drug used, rofecoxib, has been voluntary withdrawn by its manufacturer. Corticosteroids also have potent anti-inflammatory activity, and in a small, non-controlled study, prednisolone was effective in relieving symptoms of patients with CP/CPPS (). One must carefully weigh the benefits and risk of using steroids to treat patients with CP/CPPS and their multiple side effects. Some phytotherapeutic agents, to be discussed later, may act by preventing inflammation.\n\n【17】Hormonal manipulation\n---------------------\n\n【18】The influence of androgen on the development of the prostate is well known, together with the effects of androgen deprivation. In a non-controlled study of men with CP/CPPS, finasteride use led to significant and durable improvement in symptoms (). In a randomized, placebo controlled study of finasteride used in combination with other therapies, there was some symptom improvement seen (). The effect was small, however, and the authors did not recommend monotherapy with finasteride unless a significant component of BPH was present. Phytotherapeutic agents, to be discussed later, may act through similar mechanisms.\n\n【19】Surgery and minimally invasive therapy\n--------------------------------------\n\n【20】Unless a specific indication is encountered during a work-up of patients with CP/CPPS, surgery does not have an important role in its treatment. In the 1980's, it was popular to try a \"radical\" TURP with mixed results () and it is no longer advocated for patients with CP/CPPS. With the introduction of minimally invasive therapy, a surgical option was again explored. Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the prostate was shown to be of benefit in men with CP/CPPS in open-label studies (; ). However, a sham controlled study could not demonstrate any efficacy of TUNA in men with CP/CPPS (). Another minimally invasive approach is transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT). It has been studied in men with CP/CPPS, and found to be effective in non-controlled studies (; ). The main issue is whether the high temperatures used in BPH therapy are necessary for CP/CPPS and whether prostatic necrosis may lead to an increase in the inflammatory component of the condition. Sham controlled studies are required before these therapies can be recommended for routine use.\n\n【21】Alternative medicine\n--------------------\n\n【22】With an apparent dissatisfaction with 'standard' medical approach to the treatment of CP/CPPS, a large number of patients are seeking relief outside of traditional approaches. For instance, acupuncture has been reported to be effective in patients with CP/CPPS (Ge, Meng, and Xu 1988; Chen et al 1995; Chen and Nickel 2004;). However, none of those studies are adequately controlled.\n\n【23】Phytotherapy is another alternative to allopathic medications. Herbal-based therapies are prevalent and popular in urologic disease, more so in prostatic disorders, with compelling evidence (). Examples include: Chinese herbs (Jia et al 2001; Xu, Zhang, and Ding 2003; Han et al 2004;), green tea extracts (), quecertin (; Katske et al 2001), saw palmetto () and bee pollen (Buck, Rees, and Ebeling 1989; Buck et al 1990; Rugendorff et al 1993; Chen et al 2002; Elist 2006). Unfortunately, not all studies are adequately controlled.\n\n【24】通用删除2(英):<u>Extracts of bee pollen are thought to be effective in prostatic conditions from their presumed anti-inflammatory and anti-androgen effects (Buck, Rees, and Ebeling 1989; Buck, Cox, Rees, et al 1990). In an open-label study, 90 patients received one tablet of Cernilton N three times a day for 6 months. Excluding patients with complicating anatomic factors (urethral stricture, bladder neck stenosis or prostatic calculi) who had a minimal response to the treatment (1 or 18 patients saw improvement), 36% of the remaining patients were cured of their symptoms while another 42% saw their symptoms improved (Rugendorff, Weidner, Ebeling, et al 1993). In a double-blind randomized study with a different pollent extract (Prostat/Poltit), Elist et al reported significant clinical improvement when comparing with the placebo group (Elist 2006). Saw palmetto, probably the most commonly used phytochemical in prostatic conditions, is believed to act, in part, through an anti-androgen/anti-inflammatory mechanism has been tested in a open-label study in patients with CP/CPPS (). However, it was not found to be more effective than placebo.</u>\n\n【25】Quercetin, a polyphenolic bioflavonoid, is commonly found in red wine, green tea and onions (Hollman et al 1997; Hollman and Katan 1998). It is a biologically active compound with well demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties (Guardia et al 2001) and can, for instance, inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines presumably implicated in the etiology of CP/CPPS such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-8 (Sato et al 1997). In a prospective, randomized double-blind placebo controlled study using the NIH-CPSI as end-point, 500 mg of Quercetin was administered twice a day for 4 weeks to CP/CPPS patients (). Patients receiving quercetin had a significant improvement over the placebo group. Using prostaglandin E2 in expressed prostatic secretion as a surrogate marker of prostate inflammation, it was later found that quecertin significantly decreased inflammation in the prostate (Shahed and Shoskes 2000, ).\n\n【26】Neuromuscular and chronic pain therapy\n--------------------------------------\n\n【27】Patients with CP/CPPS will often complain of pain and spasm of the pelvic floor muscles. Therapies aimed at relaxation of these muscle groups and proper use of pelvic floor muscle may therefore be expected to be beneficial. Unfortunately, not very many large clinical trials have been published, data is available from small trials. For instance, biofeedback physical therapy and pelvic floor re-education lead to a significant improvement of the NIH-CPSI score in men with CP/CPPS (Cornel et al 2005). In another study, myofascial trigger point release and pelvic floor re-education also lead to a significant improvement in NIH-CPSI score (Anderson et al 2005) and also improved sexual function in men with CP/CPPS (Anderson et al 2006). Also, a sham-controlled study of men with CP/CPPS found that electromagnetic therapy could significantly improve the NIH-CPSI score of the patients, with the greatest improvement in the pain related symptoms (Rowe et al 2005). Amytriptyline (Holroyd et al 2001) and gabapentin (Covington 1998) can both be useful for the management of chronic pain and chronic muscle pain conditions and we have used them with some success in the management of patients with CP/CPPS.\n\n【28】Prostatic stone therapy\n-----------------------\n\n【29】The role of prostatic calcification is unclear in the etiology of CP/CPPS. Indeed, many asymptomatic older men have stones detected during transrectal ultrasound. However, large, central calcifications are often associated with symptoms in younger men (Geramoutsos et al 2004). Nanobacteria have attracted attention of late with their possible implication in biomineralization (Kajander et al 2001). With medical therapy against both nanobacteria and prostatic stones, it has been demonstrated that patients who had failed conventional therapy for CP/CPPS saw their NIH-CPSI significantly improve after such therapy (Shoskes, Thomas, and Gomez 2005). Such an approach awaits validation through a placebo-controlled study.\n\n【30】Treatment approach\n------------------\n\n【31】Given current data, we favor a complete examination of the patient followed by multimodal therapy. In a treatment naive patient, a 2--4 week course of antibiotics is reasonable, but should not be continued if cultures are negative and there is no improvement in symptoms. If cultures are negative, we then use a combination of an alpha blocker (tamsulosin, alfusozin) and anti-inflammatory phytotherapy (quercetin and bee pollen, for instance 1 capsule of Q-Urol (Farr Labs, Santa Monica CA) twice daily) for 6--12 weeks. If not successful, we use neuromuscular therapies such as pelvic muscle physical therapy, amytriptiline or gabapentin. In patients who don't respond to conventional therapy and have prostatic stones on transrectal ultrasound, we use an anti-nanobacterial therapy such as Calciclear (Calgenex Corp, Tampa FL). In the minority of patients who do not improve with these therapies, referral to a pain management specialist is appropriate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The role of rituximab in treating NLPHL still needs clarification. We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 23 patients with NLPHL treated with rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as part of their first- or second-line treatment. The median follow-up of the whole group was 67 months, and all patients remained alive.

However, the rapid masculinization induced by testosterone and other anabolic steroids and especially the disproportionately rapid epiphyseal maturation produced by these compounds have brought this form of therapy for short stature into disrepute. Not all investigators concur that testosterone therapy inevitably results in reduction of eventual adult height attainment and, depending on the age of onset of therapy and the dose employed, it has been reported that adult height attainment equals or exceeds the adult height prediction at the time of instituting therapy. Attempts to synthesize anabolic steroids with improved anabolic/androgenic ratios have been continuing for many years. Among currently available anabolic steroids it appears that the best separation of anabolic and androgenic properties has been attained with oxandrolone. This is reflected by the fact that most recent studies of growth promotion by anabolic steroids have employed this compound. From the results of these studies, it appears that doses of this drug capable of significant stimulation of growth generally do not cause excessive masculinization or unacceptably rapid acceleration of epiphyseal maturation and do not compromise eventual height attainment. Certain studies mentioned above suggest that it might be possible to devise therapeutic programmes employing other anabolic steroids which would produce equally satisfactory results. However, because of the more favourable anabolic/androgenic ratio of oxandrolone it seems likely that the increasing trend toward use of this drug for growth promotion will continue.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Satisfactory recordings were obtained from single dorsal horn neurons in kittens aged 3-6 days. Reconstruction of recording tracks from pontamine blue dye spots and comparisons of the depths of recording sites with Nissl-stained sections of cord showed that most single-unit recordings were obtained from laminae III and IV of Rexed. In animals of all ages neurons were found which responded briskly to light cutaneous mechanical stimulation. Their receptive fields varied widely in size, being smallest on the distal digits and largest on proximal skin. Receptive field areas were similar in proportion to the size of the hindlimb to those seen in the equivalent region in the adult cat. Because of the shape of the dorsal horn and the relatively narrow dorsal columns in neonatal kittens it proved difficult to locate units with receptive fields on proximal skin. Nevertheless the main features of the somatotopic organization of the dorsal horn were similar to those in the adult cat. Thus the somatotopic map of the kitten showed a medial representation of glabrous skin that was bounded laterally by the representation of the hairy skin of the toes. Proximal skin was represented in the lateral parts of the dorsal horn, a region which was not easily accessible for microelectrode recording. The individual toes were represented in a rostral to caudal sequence such that toe 2 was represented rostrally and toe 5 caudally. Around the toe representation the medial surface of the foot was represented rostrally, the ventrolateral surface caudally, and the dorsal surface laterally.

Current estimates suggest that 9 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths have occurred in 2013.^^ India, with approximately 2-3 million new cases of TB, is the world's largest TB epidemic country.^,^ The incidence rate of TB in India is in the range of 160 to 180 per 100,000 population, which is a disproportionately high burden compared to other developing countries^^ Several risk factors have played, and will continue to play, a role in escalating this public health problem in India. One of the most important of these risk factors, the effect of which on TB was underestimated for several years in our country, is diabetes mellitus (DM) especially poorly controlled DM.\n\n【6】There is an accelerating pandemic of type-2 DM worldwide. Currently, 230 million people live with DM worldwide and it is anticipated that about 366 million could be affected by 2030. By that time, 80% of those will be living in low- and middle-income countries where active TB is widespread.^-^ Eight of the ten countries with the highest incidence of diabetes are also classified as high burden countries for TB by the World Health Organization (WHO).^^ The consequences of these converging epidemics led WHO to declare both DM and TB as global epidemics. The synergistic relationship between TB and DM has been creating a growing concern around the world. Recently, WHO and the International Union Against TB and Lung Disease (The Union) have acknowledged the need for international guidelines on the joint management and control of TB and DM. They have published a provisional collaborative framework for the care and control of both diseases.^^ The recent estimates suggest that there were 20-30 million people in India with DM in 2000 and projected to reach as high as 80 million by 2030. India is advancing towards becoming the diabetic capital of the world, as every fifth diabetic in the world is an Indian. This surge in DM prevalence in India is severely affecting TB control program and the impact is similar to TB-HIV co-infection.^,^\n\n【7】The prevention and treatment of both TB and DM present major public health challenges in all settings across the globe, particularly when DM is poorly controlled. Given the rising incidence trends of both diseases, it is generally important to understand the association in detail within this setting so that any relevant information can be utilized to aid local TB and DM prevention and control. Evidence from clinical practice and the literature suggests that approximately half of the most common chronic disorders like DM are undetected, that half of those detected are not treated, and that half of those treated are not controlled: the 'rule of halves' is still applicable in Indian population.^^ In our country, a significant number of DM patients remain undiagnosed and also uncontrolled or poorly controlled after diagnosis. Several studies done in the past proved that DM is associated with increased incidence of TB, but studies linking poor glycemic control and the severity of TB are scarce. Therefore, the present study was planned to understand the impact of PGC pre-treatment on the severity of TB and TB treatment outcome in newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) patients with type-2 DM.\n\n【8】Patients and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec1-2}</u>\n====================\n\n【9】In this prospective study, 630 newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) patients with DM were enrolled during January 2012 to December 2014. The patients were registered for treatment in the Departments of Pulmonary Medicine, Internal Medicine, Diabetes and Endocrine Department and DOTS centre (TB unit) at a tertiary care hospital. The diagnosis of smear-positive PTB was done according to the RNTCP (revised national tuberculosis control program in India, 2013) criteria and Type-2 DM according to guidelines from WHO. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, HIV infection, connective tissue disorders, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, malignancies on long-term steroid or cytotoxic drug therapy, chronic alcoholics, and previously treated for TB.\n\n【10】Procedure 删除19:<u>{#sec2-1}</u>\n-----------\n\n【11】Patients diagnosed as new smear-positive PTB were enrolled for the study after meeting the inclusion criteria as per RNTCP guidelines of India. A new smear-positive case is defined as a patient with one or more initial sputum smear examinations positive for acid-fast bacilli.^^ Informed consent was obtained from all participants regarding the required investigations and the purpose of the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the statutory board of Karnataka Lingayat Education University. A symptom score 通用删除7(英):<u>(0--6)</u> was calculated based on the presence of cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss (1 point for each symptom was assigned). Patients with a symptom score 4 were classified as having highly symptomatic disease.^^\n\n【12】DM screening was done as per national guidelines. In short, FBG\\>126 mg/dl indicates DM, FBG≥110 mg/dl to \\<126 mg/dl indicates impaired fasting glucose, and FBG\\<110 mg/dl is normal.^^ Random blood sugar testing was done in patients with unclear DM status and if it was more than 200 mg/dl, they were further evaluated with fasting and postprandial blood sugars (FBS and PPBS). If FBS was more than 126 mg/dl or PPBS more than 200 mg/dl, the patients were confirmed as having DM. All participants were assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) evaluation. Patients with HbA1c levels\\>7% were considered to have poor glycemic control.^^ The patients with PTB and DM were then subjected to chest radiography (posterior-anterior view). A pretreatment chest radiograph was read by two qualified pulmonologists blinded to patients' disease status. The films with discordant reading were read by a third reader. Reading of the chest radiographs focused on lung parenchymal opacity and cavitation. Radiological lesions on chest X-ray were classified into minimal, moderately advanced, and far advanced as per American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.\n\n【13】Clinical, radiographic features, sputum conversion rates after 2 months and at the end of the treatment, cure rates, and relapse rates were compared between patients with poor glycemic control and that of the optimal glycemic control group. Relapse was defined as the recurrence of TB after successful completion of treatment, either proven by isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or in the absence of bacteriological confirmation, recurrence diagnosed on clinical, radiological and/or histological grounds. Participants were followed for 2 years after the initiation of treatment as per RNTCP guidelines for treatment outcome. All patients received standard DM care as per national guidelines for DM care during the study period.\n\n【14】Statistical Analysis 删除19:<u>{#sec2-2}</u>\n----------------------\n\n【15】Mean±SD values were calculated for normally distributed numerical outcomes. Mean±SD values for demographic characteristics among PGC and OCG were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. The chi-square test was used to compare non-numerical variables. ANOVA 通用删除1(英):<u>(Sigma Plot version 12.5, Systat Software Inc. San Jose, CA, USA)</u> was used for numerical variables in the univariable analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used for multivariable analysis of treatment outcome. The significance level was kept at P≤0.05. The analysis was done after adjusting for confounding variables.\n\n【16】Results 删除19:<u>{#sec1-3}</u>\n=======\n\n【17】From the 7,400 TB suspects screened 1,935 new PTB cases were identified. In total, 774(40%) patients had concomitant type-2 DM (old or new). About 99 patients were excluded from the study, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria.

The percentage of diabetic patients with symptoms and positive-smear was higher in patients with HbA1C\\>7%. Our study also demonstrated that the influence of DM on the outcome of TB treatment was proportionately related to pretreatment of HbA1C. These observations complement and extend the recently published study by Chiang et al.^^ They established that the proportions of patients with any symptom, cough, hemoptysis, tiredness, and weight loss were entirely the highest in diabetic patients with PGC and these patients were significantly more likely to be smear-positive and remain smear-positive after 2 months of treatment. Our interpretations were in line with another study by Leung et al.^^ They demonstrated that among patients with the results of sputum culture at 2 months of treatment, diabetic patients were significantly more likely to be culture-positive as compared with non-diabetic patients (adj. OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.14-2.34) and the association was significantly influenced by the level of HbA1c.\n\n【51】Current observations of more extensive lung disease, lung cavitations, and high positive sputum smears among PGC patients were in agreement with many of those reported in previous studies.^,^ Noteworthy evidence from the current study was that the poor PGC was negatively associated with cure or treatment completion, even after controlling the baseline socio-demographic variables, comorbidities, extent of lung disease, lung cavitations, and bacteriology. Park et al.^^ also established that uncontrolled diabetics have more cavities, high positive smear rates, and poor culture conversion after two months of therapy. Another interesting analysis by Webb and colleagues is worth mentioning, which showed a higher mean HbA1c among TB-DM in comparison to DM without TB. They also hypothesized that in patients with PGC (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.18-1.63), per unit increase in HbA1c and contact with a TB source case (P=0.0011) was associated with prevalent TB disease.^^\n\n【52】The present study confirms and complements the findings of Chiang et al.^^ stating that the proportions of patients with DM with any cavity, cavitatory lesions over upper lung field, cavitatory lesions over lower lung field, large cavity (\\>3 cm), and multiple cavities were all highest among patients with PGC. The atypical radiological findings of lower lung field lesions and multilobar involvement with far advanced tuberculosis, as noted in our PGC patients, have been significantly affected by HbA1c levels similar to findings in a study by Park et al.^^ These atypical radiological manifestations will lead to a significant delay in TB diagnosis, which is a matter of serious concern. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion and should screen all such patients for DM and HbA1C.\n\n【53】The observations in our study, in spite of using standard four-drug short course regimens for drug-susceptible TB, were under a fully functioning treatment program setting that also allowed individualized regimen modification and treatment prolongation. Relapse rates were also as high as 16.5% in PGC when compared to 2.3% in OGC patients.\n\n【54】India TB-Diabetes Study Group (the corresponding author of the present article is also a member of the group) screened TB patients for DM. They found that the prevalence of DM in patients with TB in tertiary care hospitals was around 16% and as high as 20% in South India. They strongly recommended screening all TB patients for DM at all levels of health care facilities.^,^ In our study, the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed DM was as high as 22.85%.\n\n【55】The effects of DM and PGC on clinical parameters (lung cavitations, positive sputum smear) and slower smear conversion after initiation of treatment emphasize a serious need for prevention of community-level transmission. In the current study, even for patients with initial drug-sensitive TB, the treatment completion rates fell substantially below the WHO target of 85% among poorly controlled DM patients. The high proportion of these patients also raises concern over the emergence of drug resistance and secondary spread within the community. In our study, we noted that 47 of 423 patients (11.11%) with poor control had MBR-TB confirmed either by culture or by the Xpert MTB/RIF technique.^^ The emerging results from our study, as well as many studies discussed above, have demonstrated that a large number of DM patients with TB, despite successful treatment, still ran a substantially higher risk of developing active TB again compared with the overall TB risk in the general population. The unfavorable outcome in these TB patients with prolonged poorly controlled DM poses the risk of extended period of contagiousness and may transmit mycobacteria to their contacts for a longer period, both before the diagnosis and after the initiation of treatment.\n\n【56】DM is expected to delay the Millennium Development Goals of WHO. The Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015, established by the Stop TB Partnership, set the target for the elimination of TB by 2050 with a 50% reduction in prevalence by 2015. WHO global TB report 2013 highlighted that while significant progress is being made in many aspects of tuberculosis control, it is too slow and altogether off-target with only a 2% decrease in prevalence per year.^,^ Such discouraging report highlights the urgent need for addressing important risk factors like DM, especially poorly controlled DM at all levels of health care services.^^ It is essential to note that interventions to decrease the prevalence of DM and optimal control of DM in patients with TB (or in the general population) may have an important impact on the incidence of TB and treatment outcome as well. In the absence of global guidelines on the collective management and control of TB and DM, national programs of all countries need to establish a coordinated response to these two diseases at both the organisational and clinical levels. It is also necessary to add DM prevention and control strategies to TB control programs and vice versa and to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n【57】A major strength of our study is the prospective design, which avoided the problems of control selection in case-control studies and obscured temporality in cross-sectional studies. Availability of thorough DM and HbA1C details of all patients made it possible to demonstrate a clear relationship between PGC and PTB treatment outcome. The study is limited by the fact that it is a single-centre study, the results of which cannot be generalized. However, this provides a window of opportunity for clinicians and researchers to carry out further studies with the involvement of different geographical areas across India. In addition, studies can be performed to assess the impact of early screening for DM and HbA1C on TB treatment outcome in such high-risk patients. Our study was not powered to assess the relationship between poorly controlled DM and MDR-TB. It is essential to clarify, in a program setting by randomized controlled trials, many unanswered issues in this field (e.g. to what extent the unsatisfactory outcome of TB in DM patients can be prevented by optimal glycemic control?). Furthermore, glycemic status of patients after diagnosis and during the treatment was an important factor as this may affect the outcome of the study since post treatment HbA1c levels were not assessed. Our study was not powered to establish the association between PGC and MDR-TB. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between PGC and an increased risk of drug-resistant TB. In addition, extra-pulmonary and smear-negative pulmonary TB cases were not included in the study. Perhaps this has added to selection bias prevention.\n\n【58】Conclusion 删除19:<u>{#sec1-5}</u>\n==========\n\n【59】Pre-treatment poor glycemic control is associated with a significant increased risk of advanced and more severe TB disease in the form of lung cavitations, positive sputum smear, and slower smear conversion after initiation of treatment. Poor glycemic control has a profound negative effect on treatment completion, cure, and relapse rates in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis with diabetes.\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest: None declared.\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Oceans are becoming warmer and more acidic as atmospheric concentrations of CO~2~ increase \\[\\]. Marine organisms will need to acclimate or adapt in the face of these shifts in seawater chemistry and temperature. Many studies have described the negative impacts of ocean acidification (OA) and rising temperatures on the calcification, energy metabolism, reproduction, development and growth of marine calcifiers, such as oysters \\[--\\]. For instance, under elevated CO~2~ conditions, oysters exhibit weaker shells \\[\\], higher mortality rates and lower soft tissue growth \\[\\], as well as impaired immune functions (e.g. increase in apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production) \\[\\]. Such pervasive impacts may ultimately affect the survival and sustainability of entire populations, especially when coupled with a warmer ocean.\n\n【2】The impacts of OA and rising temperatures on oysters also extend to the intracellular level. Proteomic studies have shown that CO~2~-driven OA (pH 7.3 to 7.87; 856 to 3000 μatm pCO~2~; 2- to 4-week exposure) alters the concentrations of proteins involved in antioxidant defence, stress responses, energy metabolism and the cytoskeleton in the oysters Crassostrea gigas (gills, hepatopancreas and larvae) \\[--\\], Crassostrea virginica (mantle) \\[\\], Crassostrea hongkongensis (larvae) \\[, \\] and Saccostrea glomerata (gills and hemocytes) \\[, \\]. Similarly, transcriptional analysis of C. virginica oysters exposed to elevated CO~2~ (gill, mantle and hemocytes; pH 7.5 to 7.6; 2000 to 3500 μatm pCO~2~; 2-week exposure) has identified changes in the expression of genes associated with calcification, stress and immune responses \\[, \\]. Increasing temperature also causes substantial changes in the molecular processes of marine organisms \\[\\]. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are one of the major protein families involved in the physiological response to thermal stress. Exposure to acute heat stress (+15 °C to 19 °C increases relative to current ambient conditions) has been shown to substantially increase (up to 2000-fold) Hsp expression in the gills of the Pacific oyster C. gigas (up to 12 h exposure) \\[, \\]. Acute heat stress (+12 °C relative to ambient) also induced changes in the transcriptional levels of other genes involved in cellular homeostasis and protein synthesis (gills and mantle; 3--24 day exposure) \\[\\]. At the protein level, increased concentrations of Hsp, as well as changes in the concentrations of proteins involved in energy metabolism, calcium binding and immune responses, were observed in the gills of C. gigas following exposure to temperature extremes (+20 °C relative to ambient; 1 h exposure) \\[\\]. Although relevant given the broad temperature ranges oysters encounter in their natural environment, these studies have focused on acute heat stress (+1﻿2 °C to 20 °C relative to control) and so do not reflect near-future climate change scenarios where projected temperature increases span between 1.5 °C and 3.2 °C by the end of this century \\[\\].\n\n【3】The transcriptomic response of oysters to a combination of low pH and increasing temperature has been assessed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) \\[, \\]. The authors found that OA and the combination of both OA and increasing temperature have distinct effects on the intracellular systems of C. virginica and C. gigas. OA enhanced the expression of genes involved in antioxidant and metabolic processes in the gills and hepatopancreas of C. virginica. Both OA (up to −0.5 pH units relative to control) and increasing temperature (up to +3 °C relative to control) affected protein synthesis and processes involved in cell growth, as well as altering the expression of genes related to metabolism \\[\\]. In the Pacific oyster, C. gigas, low pH (−0.4 pH units relative to control) enhanced the expression of immune response genes and the production of antioxidants, while the combination of both pH and thermal stresses (+5 °C relative to control) induced the expression of protease inhibitors and cytoskeleton-related genes in mantle tissue \\[\\].\n\n【4】Recent evidence also suggests that oysters may be able to rapidly acclimate or adapt to such stressful conditions \\[, \\]. Molluscs from naturally CO~2~-enriched environments do not show the physiological effects typically induced when they are experimentally exposed to elevated CO~2~ \\[, \\]. Moreover, environmental stressors associated with climate change often elicit different phenotypic responses in distinct populations within a species. Populations of C. gigas selectively bred for tolerance to acute heat stress (higher survival rates during experimentally-induced summer mortality events) show distinctive transcriptional profiles relative to populations that are sensitive to rising temperatures \\[\\]. These heat-tolerant oysters exhibited lower expression levels of Hsp27, collagen, peroxinectin and S-crystallin, and higher expression of cystatin B following heat shock (+ 25 °C relative to ambient; 1--24 h exposure; gill tissue).\n\n【5】Elevated CO~2~ concentrations have also been shown to induce differential physiological and intracellular responses in a genetically-distinct population of Sydney rock oysters (S. glomerata). The B2 breeding line represents a unique genetic resource because of its capacity to cope with the effects of CO~2~ stress at the physiological level \\[, \\]. This breeding line has been produced through mass selection for faster growth and resistance to the most significant oyster diseases in Australia \\[\\]. Surprisingly, artificial selection for these characteristics appears to have coincidentally resulted in resilience against CO~2~-driven OA \\[, \\]. Larvae from the B2 breeding line have higher survival rates and grow faster than wild type (non-selected) larvae following exposure to elevated CO~2~ (pH 7.90, 856 μatm pCO~2~) \\[, \\]. B2 adults have higher standard metabolic rates (SMR) than wild type oysters under ambient conditions, and their SMR is further increased by CO~2~ stress \\[\\].\n\n【6】Differential responses between populations of Sydney rock oysters are also evident at the molecular level. Distinctive changes in protein and gene regulation were found in B2 oysters after exposure to elevated CO~2~ (625 to 856 μatm pCO~2~, resulting in pH 7.78 to 7.84). Molecules involved in metabolism, oxidative stress, transcription, protein synthesis and modification, as well as signal transduction were the most affected by CO~2~-driven OA (gills and juvenile whole-body tissue) \\[, \\]. The transgenerational responses of the B2 breeding line to CO~2~ stress have also been investigated at the level of gene expression. Exposure of B2 oysters to elevated CO~2~ over three consecutive generations (F2 juveniles) resulted in the up-regulation of genes associated with antioxidant defence, metabolism and the cytoskeleton (whole-body tissue) \\[\\]. These findings suggest that the distinctive performance of B2 oysters might result from their capacity to regulate metabolic activity and control oxidative stress in face of elevated CO~2~ through differential regulation of molecules involved in these processes.\n\n【7】Despite the comprehensive characterisation of the responses of B2 oysters to near-future projected ocean pH, particularly at the physiological level, little is known about how these CO~2~-resilient oysters will respond to more realistic future scenarios that combine OA with increasing temperature. The current study addressed this deficit by describing the molecular processes of B2 oysters that are affected by the combination of OA and increasing temperature at both the protein and transcriptional levels. In the current study, we investigated the interactive effects of OA and increasing temperature on the molecular response of B2 oysters using a combination of proteomics and transcriptional analysis. This work is the first to explore the heritable potential of oysters for acclimation or adaptation to both climate change variables at the molecular level. This understanding will be crucial for assessing the performance of marine calcifiers and the sustainability of their populations in a changing ocean. It will also aid the development of marker-assisted breeding programs designed to safeguard oyster aquaculture industries as climate change progresses.\n\n【8】Methods 删除19:<u>{#Sec2}</u>\n=======\n\n【9】Oysters and exposure to elevated CO~2~ and temperature 删除19:<u>{#Sec3}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Adult Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata; Gould 1850) from the B2 breeding line were kindly provided by the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute (PSFI, Taylors Beach, NSW, Australia) of the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Primary Industries (DPI). The B2 breeding line has been bred for faster growth and resistance to the most significant oyster diseases in Australia: QX disease (causative agent: Marteilia sydneyi) and winter mortality syndrome (causative agent is currently under review \\[\\]) \\[\\]. Progenitors of the B2 line were established from parents collected from four rivers in NSW that had been affected by severe annual outbreaks of QX disease \\[\\]. The breeding line has been produced by mass selection where fast growing survivors of disease epizootics are selected as parents for subsequent generations. The oysters used in this study were from the sixth generation of the B2 line. Surprisingly, this artificial selection for fast growth and disease resistance in the B2 line appears to have coincidentally conferred resilience against CO~2~-driven OA, such that B2 oysters can better withstand the impacts of elevated CO~2~ at the physiological level, compared to non-selected S. glomerata \\[, \\].\n\n【11】Oysters (6.63 ± 0.71 cm shell length) were transferred to the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (Chowder Bay, NSW) and acclimated to aquarium conditions in a flow-through seawater system (0.5 L per minute, seawater filtered at 20 μm; corresponding to ambient conditions in Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The nutritional supply from the flow-through seawater was supplemented every 3 days with a concentrated blend of microalgae (Shellfish Diet® 1800, Reed Mariculture Inc. 4.3 × 10^8^ algal cells per oyster). Following a 10-day acclimation, B2 oysters were exposed for 1 month to combinations of ambient (495 μatm pCO~2~, pH 8.09) or near-future elevated (1276 μatm pCO~2~, pH 7.72) CO~2~ concentrations with ambient (22.11 °C) or near-future elevated (25.38 °C) temperatures 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>.

Seawater CO~2~ concentrations and temperatures were controlled by a custom-made system that included pneumatic components from Parker Hannifin (Castle Hill, NSW), CO~2~ sensors from Vaisala (Hawthorn, VIC) and a control system from Greenstar Building Automation & Citywide Electrical Services (Marrickville, NSW). CO~2~-enriched air and heated water were added into two header tanks, which supplied the treatments with reduced pH (elevated CO~2~). Each treatment comprised three replicate tanks (45 L), each of which contained 7 oysters (n = 21 oysters per treatment).

Following the one-month exposure to CO~2~ and/or thermal stress, oyster gills were collected and used for both proteomics and transcriptomics. Gills are amongst the tissues most immediately affected by changes in seawater quality, because they are metabolically active and represent the key interface between the organism and its environment. In addition, gill tissue is a tractable source of high quality RNA and protein in oysters. Hence, they have been used for proteomic and transcriptomic analyses in numerous previous studies (e.g. \\[, \\]). For proteomics, oyster gills were immediately frozen at −80 °C (n = 15 per treatment), while gill samples for transcriptional analysis were stored in RNA later (Ambion) at −20 °C (n = 21 per treatment; including same oysters used for proteomics).\n\n【13】RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis 删除19:<u>{#Sec4}</u>\n---------------------------------\n\n【14】Total RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg of gill tissue (n = 21 oysters per treatment; individually sampled and processed) using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Concentration and quality of total RNA were checked with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System (Promega) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)~15~ in a 20 μl reaction volume.\n\n【15】qPCR analysis 删除19:<u>{#Sec5}</u>\n-------------\n\n【16】The transcriptional responses of B2 oysters to ocean acidification and warming were investigated by assessing the expression profiles of 60 genes involved in multiple biological processes. These genes were selected based on a previous study that explored the transcriptome of B2 oysters exposed to elevated CO~2~ (Goncalves et al. in preparation). Primers for quantitative (q) PCR analysis were designed to amplify the contigs most affected by ocean acidification (highest up- or down-regulation) (通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"media\"}</u>: Table S1).</u>\n\n【17】Three microliter qPCR reactions were prepared in duplicate in 384-well plates using an epMotion® 5075 pipetting robot (Eppendorf) and an Echo® 550 Liquid Handler (Labcyte). Each reaction contained 1.5 μl KAPA SYBR® FAST qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems), 300 nM each primer, 0.3 μl PCR grade water and 1 μl cDNA template (diluted 1:9). qPCR assays were carried out on a LightCycler® 480 II (Roche). The cycling program used consisted of 3 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 6 s. At the end of the qPCR cycles, melting curve analysis was performed by collecting fluorescence data between 65 and 95 °C at 0.5 °C increments. Reaction efficiencies were calculated from standard curves generated in triplicate for each primer pair using five four-fold serial dilutions of a pool of cDNA samples (通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"media\"}</u>: Table S1). Cq values were obtained using the LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR System .</u>\n\n【18】Gene expression stability of three potential reference genes was evaluated using the web-based RefFinder platform, which integrates results from different software tools \\[\\]. Elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α), β-actin and GAPDH were previously found to be stable under CO~2~ stress \\[\\] and thus were tested in the current study. The geometric mean of these three genes combined were found to be the most stable combination (compared to each gene used individually or in pairs) and so all three genes were used as references (geNorm stability value = 0.102; NormFinder stability value = 0.051; Stability value by ΔCt method / Average SD = 0.17; BestKeeper stability value = 0.251). qPCR data are presented as changes in relative expression normalised with the geometric mean of the Cq values of EF1α, β-actin and GAPDH \\[\\].\n\n【19】Protein extraction 删除19:<u>{#Sec6}</u>\n------------------\n\n【20】Proteins were isolated from approximately 100 mg of gill tissue (n = 15 per treatment; individually sampled and processed) using 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After removal of RNA and DNA fractions, proteins were precipitated with acetone (3× volume) for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12000×g (4 °C). The resulting protein pellet was purified by multiple washes, following the protocol previously described by \\[\\], with slight modifications. Briefly, protein pellets were washed by adding 1 ml of 0.3 M guanidine hydrochloride in 95% ethanol (3 × 10 min, room temperature) before centrifugation at 8000×g (4 °C). A final wash was carried out with 95% ethanol for 10 min followed by centrifugation as above. Protein pellets were air dried at room temperature and resuspended in 50 μl of rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT and bromophenol blue).\n\n【21】Once purified, protein samples were quantified using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) with BSA as the standard \\[\\]. Equivalent amounts of proteins (30 μg) were pooled from five oysters taken from the same exposure tank, resulting in three biological replicates per treatment (3 pools of 5 oysters eac﻿h per treatment) and twelve 2D--gels across the four treatments (150 μg protein per gel).\n\n【22】2D gel electrophoresis 删除19:<u>{#Sec7}</u>\n----------------------\n\n【23】The proteomic responses of B2 oysters to ocean acidification and warming were assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). A total of three gels were run per treatment (representing each of the three replicate tanks per treatment). Proteins (150 μg in 125 μl of rehydration buffer containing 0.2% pharmalytes) were immobilised in pH linear gradient gel strips (7 cm, pH 4--7; ReadyStrip™ IPG Strips, Bio-Rad) by overnight passive rehydration. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using an IPGphor IEF System (GE Healthcare) at 100 V for 2 h, 250 V for 20 min, a gradient up to 5000 V for 2 h and then 5000 V for 2 h. Following IEF, gel strips were equilibrated for 20 min in equilibration buffer I (1% DTT, 75 mM of 1.5 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, bromophenol blue) and then for 20 min in equilibration buffer II (2.5% iodoacetamide instead of 1% DTT in equilibration buffer I). Second dimension separation was conducted using 12% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-PROTEAN® Tetra Vertical Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with blue silver \\[\\] and visualised using a ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad). Quantitative image analysis of protein spots was performed by PDQuest 2-D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad).\n\n【24】In-gel digestion of differentially regulated proteins 删除19:<u>{#Sec8}</u>\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】The protein spots found to be differentially regulated by elevated CO~2~ and/or elevated temperature were excised manually and subjected to in-gel digestion. A fresh set of 2D gels was used for spot picking. Gel pieces were washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then destained with 50% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (multiple washes for 10 min each). Following destaining, gel pieces were dehydrated in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min before being air dried. They were then reduced with 10 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 1 h, alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (45 min at room temperature) and further washed and dehydrated as above. Trypsin (12.5 ng/μl in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate; Promega) was added to each gel piece and the mixture was incubated first for 30 min at 4 °C and then overnight at 37 °C. After overnight digestion, gel pieces were washed twice in 50% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid for 30 min to recover the peptide-containing supernatant (50 to 60 μl final volume). Supernatants were concentrated to 12 μl in a vacuum concentrator (Concentrator Plus, Eppendorf) and then centrifuged at 12000×g for 10 min to remove microparticles.\n\n【26】Protein characterisation by mass spectrometry 删除19:<u>{#Sec9}</u>\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【27】Trypsin-digested peptides were analysed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a Finnigan Surveyor MS Pump Plus coupled to a Finnigan LTQ XL™ Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Chromatography was performed in reversed-phase peptide trap columns packed to approximately 9 cm (100 μm ID) with Magic C18AQ (5 μm, 200 Å, Michrom Bioresources), in a fused silica capillary with an integrated electrospray tip, coupled to pre-columns packed with PS-DVB resin (3 cm, 100 μm ID, Agilent Technologies). A 1.8 kV electrospray voltage was applied through a liquid junction up-stream of the C18 column. Sample injection was carried out using an EASY-nLC II (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were washed with buffer A (2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) for 2 min at 140 nl/min and then eluted from the column with 0--20% gradient of buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at 140 nl/min for 38 min. Following peptide elution, the column was washed with 95% buffer B at 140 nl/min for 10 min. Spectra were acquired for 60 min in positive ion mode for the scan range of 400 m/z to 1500 m/z. Automated peak recognition, dynamic exclusion and MS/MS of the top nine most intense precursor ions at 35% normalisation collision energy were performed using Xcalibur™ software .\n\n【28】Mass spectrometry data files were analysed using Global Proteome Machine (GPM) software  and the X!Tandem algorithm \\[, \\]. Files were searched against a non-redundant (nr) protein database for Mollusca (downloaded from NCBI in March 2015), using default settings. The Mollusca nr database contained 378,914 sequences, including those derived from the C. gigas genome, in addition to common human and trypsin peptide contaminants. Spectra were also searched against a reversed sequence database for estimation of false discovery rates (FDR). Peptides that yielded log(e) values ≤ −10 and at least five spectral counts were retained for protein characterisation.\n\n【29】Statistical analyses 删除19:<u>{#Sec10}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【30】The statistical significance of differences between treatments for proteomic and transcriptional data was assessed by a linear model, considering the ambient control condition as the reference (p \\< 0.05), and by the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM; FDR \\< 10%). Statistical analysis on proteomic data was performed on the normalised intensities of protein spots from 2D gels. Relative gene expression data used for statistical analysis were calculated by normalising Cq values of each target gene with the geometric mean of the Cq values of EF1α, β-actin and GAPDH (reference genes) \\[\\]. Tests were carried out using the mean response of oysters from the same exposure tank, such that each of the 3 tanks per treatment was considered to be an independent biological replicate. Three tanks per treatment each containing a pool of 5 oysters were used for proteomic analysis, while 3 tanks per treatment each containing 7 oysters (individual samples) were used for gene expression analysis.\n\n【31】Fold differences for each differentially expressed protein or gene were determined by comparing the mean normalised protein spot intensities or mean relative expression of each treatment where at least one parameter (CO~2~ or temperature) was elevated relative to those of ambient control conditions (aCO~2~ + aT). Fold change (FC) values \\>1 reflect up-regulation in the elevated treatment relative to ambient controls. FC values \\<1 reflect down-regulation in the elevated treatment. Differences between CO~2~ and temperature conditions were also visualised in non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) plots. NMDS was based on Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients calculated from normalised intensities of differentially regulated proteins or differentially expressed genes (absolute fold-change ≥1.5).\n\n【32】Differences in seawater parameters (temperature, pH, pCO~2~, salinity and total alkalinity) between the elevated treatments were assessed by Student's t test, comparing the conditions in tanks sharing the same elevated parameter (e.g. elevated CO~2~ + ambient temperature vs. elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature treatment; and ambient CO~2~ + elevated temperature vs. elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature).\n\n【33】Results 删除19:<u>{#Sec11}</u>\n=======\n\n【34】Experimental conditions for exposure to OA and warming 删除19:<u>{#Sec12}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】Seawater chemical and physical parameters were assessed throughout the experimental exposures 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. Tanks for elevated CO~2~ and for elevated temperature treatments were supplied by independent seawater reservoirs, which resulted in differences in pH and temperature among treatments. Such variation in pH and temperature was also reflected by small differences in seawater carbonate chemistry, since pCO~2~ concentration was calculated based upon measurements of these two variables (in addition to salinity and total alkalinity, which did not show significant variability). Seawater pH was 0.04 units lower in elevated CO~2~ + ambient temperature (eCO~2~ + aT) relative to the elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature treatment (eCO~2~ + eT) (p = 0.04, two-tailed t-test). As a result, pCO~2~ concentration was higher (+107 μatm) in elevated CO~2~ + ambient temperature (eCO~2~ + aT) tanks relative to the elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature condition (eCO~2~ + eT) 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>. However, this difference in pCO~2~ concentrations between the elevated CO~2~ treatments was not statistically significant (p = 0.08, two-tailed t-test).\n\n【36】Similar variation was also evident between the elevated temperature treatments. Tanks for ambient CO~2~ + elevated temperature (aCO~2~ + eT) and elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature (eCO~2~ + eT) were also supplied by independent flow-through seawater systems, which led to differences in temperature between treatments. Tanks for ambient CO~2~ + elevated temperature (aCO~2~ + eT) treatment were 0.96 °C warmer than those for elevated CO~2~ + elevated temperature (eCO~2~ + eT) (p = 3.88e-11, two-tailed t-test) 删除21:<u>(Table 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>.\n\n【37】Molecular profiles of oysters in response to ocean acidification and warming 删除19:<u>{#Sec13}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Ocean acidification (OA) and warming induced substantial changes in the proteomes and gene expression of B2 oysters. The differential proteomes of oysters in response to elevated CO~2~ and/or elevated temperature were resolved by 2D gel electrophoresis. An average of 345 protein spots was detected across the 2D gels, with molecular weights (MW) ranging from 12 to 200 kDa and isoelectric points (pI) ranging from 4 to 7.\n\n【39】Of the 345 protein spots identified, 39 were found to differ significantly in intensity (p \\< 0.05 or FDR \\< 10%) in at least one of the elevated CO~2~ and/or elevated temperature treatments, relative to control conditions (aCO~2~ + aT). Of these, three differential proteins were common to all three elevated treatments (aCO~2~ + eT, eCO~2~ + aT and eCO~2~ + eT), while 27 were unique to particular treatments. Of these, most (19; 70%) were unique to the elevated CO~2~ + ambient temperature treatment (eCO~2~ + aT) (Fig. [1a]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Mass spectrometry was performed on 36 differentially regulated proteins (proteins spots are highlighted in Fig. [2a]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).

We evaluated the relative expression profiles of 60 genes that have been previously shown to be differentially regulated following transgenerational exposure of B2 oysters to CO~2~ stress (Goncalves et al. in preparation). Twenty-one genes (35%) were found to be affected by one or both stresses (elevated CO~2~ and/or elevated temperature). Figure [1b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> shows the number of differentially expressed genes that were unique to particular treatments and those that were affected by one or more treatments. Five differentially regulated genes were common to all three elevated treatments (aCO~2~ + eT, eCO~2~ + aT and eCO~2~ + eT), while nine were unique to particular treatments.\n\n【41】Effects of ocean acidification 删除19:<u>{#Sec14}</u>\n------------------------------\n\n【42】The exposure of oysters to elevated CO~2~ altered the expression of numerous individual proteins and genes. This is reflected by the clear spatial discrimination of cumulative protein and gene expression profiles between CO~2~-exposed oysters (eCO~2~ + aT) and the other treatments (Fig. [2b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and Fig. [3a]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Elevated CO~2~ by itself (eCO~2~ + aT) significantly affected the expression of 27 proteins and 11 transcripts (relative to aCO~2~ + aT). (Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). This represented the highest number of differentially regulated proteins among all of the CO~2~ and temperature treatments. NMDS plot incorporating data for differential proteins reveals that the eCO~2~ + aT treatment had the most substantial response relative to ambient controls (aCO~2~ + aT) (Fig. [2b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The majority of differentially regulated proteins (63%) and genes (64%) were less abundant in eCO~2~ + aT oysters relative to the control treatment (aCO~2~ + aT). In this comparison, the proteins found in lower abundance included actin (0.23-fold), ferritin (0.33-fold), cytochrome b5 (0.40-fold), vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A (VPS13A; 0.49-fold) and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (Rho-GDI; 0.50-fold) (Fig. [2c]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Similarly, genes encoding von Willebrand factor D (VWF) and EGF domain-containing protein (0.17-fold), structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3 (SMC3; 0.27-fold), multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains protein 10 (MEGF10; 0.36-fold), dual oxidase (0.54-fold) and heat shock 70 kDa protein 12a (Hsp70a; 0.57-fold) were down-regulated by CO~2~ stress (Fig. [3b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).Fig. 3Transcriptional responses of oysters to ocean acidification and warming. a Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot showing the cumulative expression profiles of differentially regulated genes among B2 oysters (gill tissue) exposed to elevated CO~2~ and/or elevated temperature (T).

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNP Q; 2.66-fold), nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like protein 5 (NDK5; 2.51-fold), 14--3-3 protein (2.26-fold), septin 2 (2.15-fold) and sperm associated antigen 6 (SPAG6; 2.00-fold) were found at higher concentrations in eCO~2~ + aT oysters when compared to the aCO~2~ + aT treatment (Fig. [2c]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). At the transcriptional level, extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD; 2.46-fold), cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 (6.88-fold), pentraxin fusion protein (2.44-fold) and hemagglutinin/amebocyte aggregation factor (HAAF; 1.83-fold) had higher expression levels in CO~2~-exposed oysters relative to controls (Fig. [3b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【44】Effects of ocean warming 删除19:<u>{#Sec15}</u>\n------------------------\n\n【45】Thermal stress by itself (aCO~2~ + eT) also affected the gill proteomes and transcriptional responses of B2 oysters. Oysters exposed to elevated temperature alone (aCO~2~ + eT) exhibited protein and gene expression profiles that were clearly different from those of oysters held under ambient conditions (aCO~2~ + aT) and oysters exposed to elevated CO~2~ alone (eCO~2~ + aT) (Fig. [2b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u> and Fig. [3a]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The transcriptional response of aCO~2~ + eT oysters was also distinct from the combined eCO~2~ + eT treatment (Fig. [3a]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). However, this distinction was less apparent in their proteomic responses. NMDS of differentially regulated proteins showed substantial overlap between the aCO~2~ + eT and eCO~2~ + eT treatments (Fig. [2b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【46】Elevated temperature alone (aCO~2~ + eT) altered the regulation of 15 proteins and 14 genes, affecting a greater number of genes compared to elevated CO~2~ alone (Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). Most of the differentially regulated proteins (60%) and genes (79%) were found at lower concentrations in oysters exposed to elevated temperature (aCO~2~ + eT) relative to control conditions (aCO~2~ + aT). In this comparison, down-regulated proteins included enolase (0.42-fold), Rho-GDI (0.49-fold) and actin (0.51-fold) (Fig. [2c]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>), while uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG; 0.42-fold), dual oxidase (0.44-fold) and Hsp70 (0.42-fold for Hsp70a; 0.49-fold for Hsp70b) were among the down-regulated transcripts (Fig. [3b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).

Conversely, the differential proteomes of oysters exposed to both CO~2~ and heat stresses (eCO~2~ + eT) overlapped with the proteomes of oysters exposed to heat stress only (aCO~2~ + eT) (Fig. [2b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【49】The combination of elevated CO~2~ and elevated temperature changed the expression patterns of 12 proteins and 13 genes (Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The majority of differentially regulated proteins (58%) and genes (77%) were found at lower concentrations in eCO~2~ + eT relative to ambient conditions (aCO~2~ + aT). Proteins found in lower abundance in eCO~2~ + eT oysters included actin (0.41-fold), Rho-GDI (0.67-fold) and protein spot 7516 (0.47-fold) (Fig. [2c]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).

At the transcriptional level, ecSOD (1.90-fold), CYP1A1 (3.28-fold) and kelch 3 (1.55-fold) showed higher expression levels in eCO~2~ + eT oysters relative to controls (Fig. [3b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【50】Only 3 proteins and 5 genes were affected by all stress treatments (elevated CO~2~ alone, elevated temperature alone, and the combination of elevated CO~2~ and elevated temperature) (Fig. 通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).

At the transcriptional level, MEG10, Hsp70a, SMC3 and VWF were down-regulated by all of the treatments (0.01 to 0.65-fold), while CYP1A1 transcripts were more abundant under CO~2~ and/or thermal stresses (3.28 to 6.88-fold) (Fig. [3b]通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【51】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#Sec17}</u>\n==========\n\n【52】B2 oysters represent a valuable genetic resource because of their capacity to withstand the impacts of CO~2~ stress at the physiological level \\[, \\]. They also appear to be capable of rapid acclimation or adaptation, responding faster than wild type oysters in the face of ocean acidification (OA) \\[\\]. These features make this population a potential tool for climate-proofing Sydney rock oyster aquaculture and restoring natural oyster beds. The current study characterised the molecular profile of B2 oysters responding to realistic near-future scenarios that combine OA with ocean warming. By assessing the intracellular effects of elevated CO~2~ and increasing temperature, we found substantial changes in protein concentrations and gene expression in oyster gills following exposure to one or both stressors. Although the combination of these two stressors also altered the regulatory patterns of proteins and genes, the concurrent effects of elevated CO~2~ and temperature were not shown to be synergistic or additive.\n\n【53】Overlapping responses to OA, increasing temperature and the combined stressors 删除19:<u>{#Sec18}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】A suite of proteins and genes showed substantial changes in expression in response to all stress treatments - elevated CO~2~ alone, elevated temperature alone, and combination of elevated CO~2~ and elevated temperature. This overlap in stress responses among treatments suggests that a similar set of molecular processes is recruited in the face of OA and warming in B2 oysters. The intracellular processes simultaneously affected by OA and/or increasing temperature were the control of redox balance, maintenance of cellular homeostasis, stress responses and the cytoskeleton. Differentially regulated molecules included Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (Rho-GDI), actin, Hsp70a, von Willebrand factor (VWF) D and EGF domain-containing protein, multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains proteins 10 (MEG10), structural maintenance of chromosomes 3 (SMC3) and a cytochrome P450 encoded by CYP1A1.\n\n【55】Rho-GDI and actin are of particular interest in t﻿he con﻿text of clima﻿te change resilience. Both proteins were found in lower concentrations in stress-exposed oysters relative to control conditions. Rho-GDI is an inhibitor of the small GTPase Rho, and is involved in oxidative stress and cytoskeleton organisation. Following interaction of Rho-GDI with membrane proteins, this complex activates NADPH oxidase, which in turn initiates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) \\[\\]. Lower abundance of Rho-GDI has been observed in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis recovering from hyposaline stress \\[\\]. The down-regulation of Rho-GDI found in our study may be associated with the control of oxidative damage that is typically induced by OA and rising temperature in oysters. The low abundance of Rho-GDI could prevent the formation of ROS in response to CO~2~ and/or thermal stresses in B2 oysters by reducing the activation of NADPH oxidase. Alternatively, the down-regulation of this protein could increase the activity of Rho GTPase, leading to cytoskeletal modifications. In this context, it is relevant that the major cytoskeletal protein, actin, was also found at lower concentrations in oysters exposed to any the three stress treatments. Actins are highly abundant structural proteins that play a fundamental role in the division, shape and mobility of eukaryotic cells. The changes observed in actin abundance could be related to cytoskeletal remodelling due to intracellular stress \\[, \\].\n\n【56】At the transcriptional level, a gene encoding the stress response protein Hsp70 was also down-regulated in oysters exposed to any of the three stress treatments (OA, increased temperature and the combination of these stresses). Heat shock proteins, including Hsp70, are among the most abundant intracellular proteins protecting cells from stress-induced damage. Hsp70s act as molecular chaperones, promoting protein folding, membrane translocation, degradation of misfolded proteins and maintenance of cellular homeostasis \\[\\]. Down-regulation of Hsp70s following exposure to elevated CO~2~ has been previously shown in the oysters C. virginica and S. glomerata (B2 line) (pH 7.59 to 7.88; one-month exposure; hemocytes and gills) \\[, \\]. In the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, Hsp70 mRNA levels increased immediately after exposure to elevated CO~2~ alone (pH 7.70, 1425 μatm pCO~2~), elevated temperature (+3 °C relative to control) alone and a combination of these stressors. However, Hsp70 expression in the mantle of P. fucata decreased after 4 days of stress exposure (relative to non-exposed oysters) \\[\\]. In line with these studies, our findings suggest that longer exposures to stressful seawater conditions cause a decrease in the concentration of Hsp70. Such reductions in the expression of Hsp70, as well as of Rho-GDI and actin, may indicate that B2 oysters are prone to protein denaturation and cytoskeleton remodelling caused by CO~2~ and thermal stresses.\n\n【57】Exposure to OA, increased temperature and the combination of both stresses also altered expression of genes involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the cell cycle. Genes encoding proteins that contain von Willebrand factor D (VWF) and EGF-like domains were substantially down-regulated in exposed B2 oysters. Von Willebrand factor D (VWF) and EGF domain-containing proteins are involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, as well as in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of protein subunits \\[\\]. MEGF10, another gene down-regulated by all three stress treatments, encodes a membrane protein involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, cell adhesion and motility. The expression of MEGF10 was down-regulated by hypoxia and hypo-osmotic stress in the Pacific oyster C. gigas (pool of tissues) \\[\\]. A gene encoding SMC3 was also down-regulated by CO~2~ and/or thermal stresses in the current study. SMC3 is a central component responsible for maintaining chromosome cohesion during cell division. In addition to its involvement in DNA replication and the cell cycle, SMC3 is associated with DNA repair \\[\\]. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing differential regulation of SMC3 in response to stress in oysters. Due to this lack of information about the role that SMC3 plays in oysters, it is difficult to explain the implication of its low expression in stressed oysters. In contrast, CYP1A1 was the only molecule that showed increased expression in response to all three stress treatments. CYP1A1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and encodes a protein that is involved in a variety of detoxification and endogenous processes, being the major form induced by xenobiotics, including dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \\[, \\]. Induction of CYP1A1 transcription has been frequently reported after exposure to environmental stress, particularly chemical contaminants \\[, \\]. The down-regulation of genes involved in the cell cycle and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, along with the increased expression of CYP1A1, indicate that changes in seawater chemical and/or physical characteristics could have substantial effects on oyster growth and development, and their ability to respond to stress.\n\n【58】Molecular responses induced by OA 删除19:<u>{#Sec19}</u>\n---------------------------------\n\n【59】Despite the similarities in responses to all three stress treatments (OA alone, increased temperature alone and the combination of these two stressors), each of the treatments produced additional unique impacts on different proteins and genes. CO~2~ stress by itself induced the greatest changes at the protein level among all of the treatments, both in terms of number of proteins affected and magnitude of those changes. Previous studies have shown that molluscs are particularly susceptible to OA \\[--, \\]. Changes in seawater chemistry have negative effects on growth, development, survival, calcification and acid-base regulation in different species of molluscs \\[, \\]. These changes are likely to be a reflection of complex rearrangements at the molecular level that ultimately result in physiological impacts \\[\\]. Increasing temperature, in contrast, has not been shown to produce such strong impacts on the performance of molluscs \\[\\]. Among the genes/proteins affected by CO~2~ stress alone in the current study, a number are associated with responses to stress, redox balance and cytoskeleton organisation. In the context of the molecules involved in redox balance, cytochrome b5 and ferritin were found at lower concentrations following exposure to elevated CO~2~. Both proteins participate in reduction-oxidation reactions and iron homeostasis. Given that these processes are linked to energy metabolism (through expression of Krebs cycle enzymes, for example), lower concentrations of cytochrome b5 and ferritin may be associated with shifts in energy requirements induced by CO~2~ stress \\[\\].\n\n【60】Other stress-related genes affected by elevated CO~2~ alone included extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) and septin 2 (both up-regulated). EcSOD participates in ROS scavenging while septin is required for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton \\[, \\]. Increased concentrations of ecSOD and septin 2 may be related to the capacity of B2 oysters to cope with oxidative damage typically induced by OA. They could mitigate damage to the actin cytoskeleton and other fundamental cellular components, minimising cell death through apoptosis. Overall, these findings suggest that B2 oysters may be able to withstand and limit the adverse impacts of CO~2~ stress on their physiological responses (i.e. growth, survival and metabolism) by hindering disturbance of the cellular redox balance and controlling cellular homeostasis.\n\n【61】Molecular responses to increasing temperature 删除19:<u>{#Sec20}</u>\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【62】Thermal stress alone also induced unique, substantial changes in the regulation of proteins and genes in B2 oysters. While elevated CO~2~ was the stress that altered the largest number of proteins, elevated temperature was responsible for the greatest changes at the transcriptional level. Thermal stress reduced the abundance of enolase and uracil-DNA glycosylase transcripts, but increased the levels of protein disulphide isomerase and stress-induced protein 1. Enolase participates in carbohydrate metabolism, specifically glycolysis, and may also be involved in stress responses \\[\\]. Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is a major component of the cellular machinery responsible for DNA repair and prevention of DNA damage \\[, \\]. Very little information is available on the biological role and transcriptional regulation of enolase and UDG in molluscs responding to stress. However, our data might suggest that thermal stress reduces the ability of cells to control oxidative damage and resulting mutation, with consequences for the prevention of heat-induced cell death.\n\n【63】Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and stress-induced protein 1 were among the molecules whose expression was increased by thermal stress. PDI is a molecular chaperone found in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in protein folding, assembly and post-translation modifications, including those induced by ROS \\[\\]. Higher levels of PDI have also been observed in thermally-stressed sea cucumbers \\[\\] and in larvae from Pacific oysters (C. gigas) exposed to the combination of elevated temperature (+2 °C relative to control) and elevated CO~2~ (pH 7.9, 656 μatm pCO~2~) \\[\\]. In line with our results, stress-induced protein 1, another molecular chaperone, was also found to be up-regulated in the gills of C. gigas following acute heat stress (+ 20 °C for 1 h) \\[\\]. It has been extensively reported that elevated temperature triggers oxidative stress in different species of marine invertebrates \\[, \\]. This response is often elicited by an imbalance between the production and neutralisation of ROS due to heat-induced metabolic shift and increased oxygen requirements. Our findings suggest that the increased expression of molecular chaperones may preserve correct conformation and stability of a number of proteins, in an attempt to prevent damage from thermally-driven stress.\n\n【64】Molecular responses to the combination of OA and warming 删除19:<u>{#Sec21}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【65】The combination of OA and warming induced specific changes that were not evident when oysters were exposed to elevated CO~2~ or temperature alone. The combined stressors caused down-regulation of perlucin and multidrug resistance protein 1. Perlucin is a C-type lectin involved in nucleation of calcium carbonate ions during shell formation \\[--\\]. Although the expression of perlucin may be expected to be altered by CO~2~-driven OA, no changes in its mRNA levels were observed in the mantle of the mussel Mytilus edulis after exposure to elevated CO~2~ (pH 7.8, 766 μatm pCO~2~, 60-day exposure) \\[, \\]. In contrast, higher levels of perlucin was observed in gills of B2 oysters following transgenerational exposure to CO~2~ stress alone (pH 7.77, 1067 μatm pCO~2~, 4-week exposure) (Goncalves et al. in preparation). Therefore, it appears that B2 oysters could be able to maintain carbonate homeostasis and shell deposition under CO~2~ stress alone, but their calcification process may be hampered when increased temperature is combined to CO~2~ stress. Multidrug resistance proteins play a role in detoxifying various toxic agents in marine organisms due to their ability to transport xenobiotic conjugates and metabolites \\[\\]. Our findings indicate that multidrug resistance protein 1 may also participate in oyster responses to OA and warming.\n\n【66】Combined, the substantial changes in protein and gene expression observed in this study suggest that the inducible responses of oysters to near-future changes in seawater temperature and pH may depend upon energy reallocation. Such reallocation could regulate fundamental cellular processes, including control of oxidative damage, maintenance of cellular homeostasis and immune responses. Although testing the physiological outcomes of this stress-induced energy reallocation was beyond the scope of our study, it is likely that these intracellular changes have an impact on oyster growth and survival (as previously shown by \\[, \\]) as well as on the immune functions and response to infectious diseases. Intracellular changes induced by thermal stress in Pacific oysters (C. gigas) have been related to potential susceptibility to infectious diseases \\[--\\].\n\n【67】Concurrent effects of OA and warming are not synergistic or additive 删除19:<u>{#Sec22}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【68】Numerous studies suggest that exposure to elevated CO~2~ enhances the responsiveness of marine organisms to thermal stress and vice versa \\[--\\]. However, our data did not reveal such a synergistic or additive interaction at the molecular level. In the context of the current study, synergistic or additive effects would have been reflected in more substantial responses, in terms of the number or fold changes of differentially expressed genes and proteins, when the combined effects of elevated CO~2~ and temperature were compared to those stressors in isolation. By this definition, our data did not identify synergistic or additive effects of elevated CO~2~ and temperature. This lack of additive or synergistic interactions may be due to limitations in our experimental design or to potentially antagonistic effects of OA and increasing temperature in B2 oysters. Variability in pH and temperatures (but not in pCO~2~ concentrations) were observed among the different treatments as a consequence of our experimental design. Tanks for elevated CO~2~ and elevated temperature treatments were supplied by independent seawater reservoirs. This resulted in unintended, albeit minor differences in seawater chemistry and temperature among the treatments. These differences may have prevented us from identifying synergistic or additive effects by CO~2~ and thermal stresses.\n\n【69】The lack of a synergistic or additive response might also have been due to the differential performance of B2 oysters under climate change-associated conditions. If that is the case, the combination of OA and increased temperature would induce antagonistic effects in these oysters. Previous studies have reported that thermal stress ameliorates some impacts of elevated CO~2~. Increasing temperature (+2 °C to 3.2 °C relative to control conditions) minimised the negative effects of elevated CO~2~ (resulting in pH 7.79 to 7.90) on growth and calcification rate of C. gigas larvae \\[\\], and on calcification of coral reefs \\[\\] and the sea star Pisaster ochraceus \\[\\]. Similarly, a recent meta-analysis assessing the physiological responses of marine organisms to OA and warming revealed restorative effects of the combined stressors on the growth of echinoderms and calcifying phytoplankton, and on photosynthesis of calcifying and non-calcifying marine autotrophs. It has also been shown that OA alone negatively affects both calcification and photosynthesis in corals, while these processes were not disturbed by the combination of OA and increased temperature \\[\\]. In line with these findings, our data suggest that the addition of warming may alleviate the effects of acidification on the molecular responses of oysters. Alternatively, our results might imply that the combination of elevated CO~2~ and temperature cumulatively overwhelms the stress response system of B2 oysters, so that their intracellular processes more closely resemble those of oysters held under ambient conditions compared to those exposed to elevated CO~2~ or temperature in isolation.\n\n【70】Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#Sec23}</u>\n===========\n\n【71】The current study has investigated the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on gill proteomes and transcriptional responses of B2 oysters. Our findings show that low seawater pH and elevated temperature affect a variety of biological processes at the protein and transcriptional levels. These effects are not additive or synergistic and may be antagonistic, even though many of the same intracellular processes are affected by elevated CO~2~ and elevated temperature when the stressors are applied separately. The differential responses observed in oysters exposed to a combination of stressors indicate that the inherent capacity of B2 oysters to cope with elevated CO~2~ that was described at the physiological level may not be substantially relevant once thermal stress is added in marine environments. Further studies are required to clarify the complex biological outcomes of the concurrent exposure to ocean acidification and warming, as well as to elucidate the potential of B2 oysters to further acclimate or adapt to such stressful conditions.\n\n【72】通用删除12(英):<u>Additional files</u>\n================\n\n【73】 删除19:<u>{#Sec24}</u>\n\n【74】通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Table S1.Primers used for qPCR analysis.

One of our recent studies showed that auranofin, a gold complex that has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and promoted apoptosis in some NSCLC cells. Because the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the major downstream pathways of EGFR, we hypothesized that ibrutinib's activity might be enhanced by combination therapy with auranofin in NSCLC cells. To this end, we examined ibrutinib's dose responses in EGFR-mutant H1975, PC9, and H1650 cells and in EGFR wild-type Calu3 and H460 cells in the presence or absence of auranofin. Although low concentrations of auranofin alone demonstrated mild anticancer activities, its presence dramatically enhanced ibrutinib's activity in H1975, PC9, and H1650 cells (IC50 value reduced 10- to 100-fold), but had only mild effect on Calu3 and H460 cells, demonstrating that ibrutinib's anti-EGFR activity is enhanced when it is combined with auranofin. A mechanistic analysis revealed that ibrutinib alone induced dramatic inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway in both H1975 and H1650 cells, whereas auranofin alone inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway. The combination of ibrutinib and auranofin led to a dramatically enhanced inhibition of the expression or phosphorylation of multiple key nodes in the AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways in both cell lines. In mice, the combination of ibrutinib and auranofin significantly suppressed the growth of H1975 xenografted tumors without inducing obvious toxic effects. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of improving ibrutinib's anti-EGFR activity for NSCLC using combination therapy with auranofin.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】The balance between cell division and cell death is very important to coordinate normal cell turnover in both development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms \\[\\]. The process of cell death has been selected evolutionarily over the years as an integral cellular mechanism \\[\\] and any deregulation may lead to irregularities in embryogenesis, neurodegenerative disorders, and development of cancer \\[\\]. Cell death may occur both normally or under certain pathological conditions. The existence of multiple death pathways is an in-built strategy to protect the organism against abnormalities arising in a single or multiple pathways, making the occurrence of diseases like cancer relatively rare, considering the large number of cell divisions and mutations incorporated during the lifetime of a multicellular organism \\[\\].\n\n【2】With the advances in recent research over the last two decades new insights into the mechanisms and the factors involved in cell death have emerged, increasing its importance with respect to diseases. At the molecular level, cell death involves DNA damage, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, and so forth. The classification of the cellular death pathways is not discrete at certain instances and due to the presence of overlapping signaling pathways regulating these processes, there are a number of common factors involved, making the classification ambiguous. More than one death program may be activated at the same time and also there may be switching from one pathway to another depending on the context \\[\\]. However, the basic mechanisms of cell death may be broadly classified as either suicide or sabotage \\[\\]. In programmed cell death, the ultimate fate of the cell depends on the initiation signal and the degree of assault, and the outcome is known.\n\n【3】The programmed cell death processes involve well-coordinated factors and hence are subject to various modes of regulation. As in all cases the regulation may be at the gene, mRNA, or protein level. In this review, we focus on the post-translational modifications of proteins, specifically deubiquitination. We know that the process of ubiquitination is extremely dynamic, involving transient protein-protein interactions with high specificity and functions in a highly context-dependent manner. Ubiquitination may be monomeric, polymeric, or multimonomeric, involving a variety of ubiquitin (Ub) linkages such as Lys 6 (K6), K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63, and Met1, each having specific functions \\[\\]. This is a reversible process, involving deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) \\[\\]. There are about 100 genes encoding DUBs in the human genome and this large number strongly suggests that distinct enzymes have highly specialized functions, but this study is still in a very nascent stage \\[\\]. The basic features of DUB activity are processing of Ub precursors, editing of Ub chains, reversal of Ub conjugation, and recycling of Ub \\[\\]. The specificity and activity of the DUBs is ensured by protein-protein interactions, the multiprotein complexes with which DUBs are associated, subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and changes in their expression or even differential activity in the various phases of cell cycle \\[, \\]. Deubiquitinases regulate a variety of cellular processes by reversing ubiquitination.\n\n【4】DUBs are classified into six families: ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs), ovarian-tumor proteases (OTUs), JAMM/MPN domain-associated metallopeptidases (JAMMs), Machado-Joseph disease protein domain proteases (MJDs), and monocyte chemotactic protein-induced proteases (MCPIPs). All these enzymes are cysteine proteases except the JAMMs. The largest family is the USPs with more than 50 members, all containing conserved domains and catalytic sites \\[\\]. DUBs are often deregulated in cancers showing either mutations or altered expression levels \\[\\]. Moreover, cancer cells are more sensitive to defects in protein folding and stability and E3 ligases are already being targeted for therapeutic purposes (e.g. bortezomib). But the DUBs are comparatively lesser in number and much more specific with respect to their functions and, hence, likely to be better targets \\[, \\]. Recent research is bringing up first-generation inhibitors with specificity against either a single or a related group of DUBs \\[\\]. Hence, the growing interest and importance of targeting DUBs bring the study of DUBs to high priority. In this review, we have tried to outline briefly the various programmed cell death pathways and their players and have also emphasized on the various deubiquitinases that are associated with these factors, focusing mainly on the context of cancer.\n\n【5】2. Importance of Cell Death in Cancer 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n=====================================\n\n【6】2.1. Modes of Cell Death 删除19:<u>{#sec2.1}</u>\n------------------------\n\n【7】The three main programmed cell death mechanisms are apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death \\[\\]. Several other modes of cell death have been reported such as paraptosis and mitotic catastrophe (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The different modes of cell death are not discrete at all times and there are frequent crosstalks. The outcomes may be a shared response of different modes of cell death but each one has its own salient features as described below. A comparative analysis of the different modes is illustrated in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>.\n\n【8】Apoptosis. Apoptosis may occur during embryonic development, in mature tissues like thymus or under pathological conditions. The cardinal features of apoptosis include membrane blebbing, rounding up of cells, reduction of cell volume, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. This follows either a caspase-dependent or caspase-independent pathway, which may or may not be associated with mitochondrial and/or immunological involvement, based on intrinsic or extrinsic cues.\n\n【9】Necrosis. Necrosis generally occurs as a response to physical cellular injury and is mostly associated with pathological conditions. Necrosis is characterized by gain in cell volume, swelling of organelles, rupture of plasma membrane, and elicitation of inflammatory tissue response. Necrosis was initially thought to be an uncontrolled (accidental) death process, but recent evidences of well-defined signaling pathways involved in necrosis are coming into focus. Thus, programmed necrosis also known as \"necroptosis,\" exists as a back-up system for the cell when apoptosis is inhibited \\[\\].\n\n【10】Autophagic Cell Death. Autophagy is a prosurvival strategy for the cells in cases of stress like nutrient or growth factor deprivation or cytokine-induction. The mode of action is via sequestration of cytoplasmic material within autophagosomes for lysosomal degradation, with the absence of chromatin condensation, generally mediated by the autophagy genes (ATGs) \\[, \\]. Hence, activation of autophagy under cellular stress has a cytoprotective outcome to maintain cellular homeostasis and inhibiting it may lead to cell death. This may again cause inhibition of developmental cell death indicating a role of autophagy in cell death. Therefore, the decision of whether autophagy results in cell survival or death depends on the context \\[\\].\n\n【11】Pyroptosis. Pyroptosis involves caspase-1 mediated cell death, an atypical caspase-dependent mechanism seen in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in case of microbial infection with implications in host defence \\[, \\].\n\n【12】Paraptosis. Paraptosis is cytoplasmic vacuolization initiated by swelling of mitochondria and ER. The response is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) \\[\\].\n\n【13】Mitotic Catastrophe. Mitotic catastrophe is a process occurring in the absence of complete mitosis. It is characterized by multinucleated enlarged cells \\[\\] and generally marked as a cellular strategy to combat genomic instability, which is very common in cancer. The major factors involved are cell cycle-dependent kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), aurora kinase B, polo-like kinases (Plks); cell cycle checkpoint proteins (Chk1 and 2, p53, and Rb); Bcl-2 family proteins; and caspases \\[\\].\n\n【14】Senescence. The outcome of senescence in cells can be visualized by tumor suppression or promotion, aging, and tissue repair, because the process is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation, aging, and cell death \\[\\]. Cellular senescence can occur during irreversible cell cycle arrest upon encountering oncogenic stress, wherein cells become flattened, highly vacuolated, and heterochromatinized and form autophagosomes. The key players are PTEN, p53, p21, p16, and so forth \\[\\]. In the somatic cells, telomere shortening occurs with each replicative cycle, leading to replicative senescence and ultimately cell death which may be partially due to elicitation of DNA damage response signaling. It is the normal process of aging resulting from loss of clonogenic potential. But almost 85% of human cancers show enhanced expression of telomerases \\[\\] accounting partially for immortalization of the cancer cells. Culture stress, like substrata, serum, oxidative stress, and so forth, may also lead to senescence inin vitro settings \\[, \\].\n\n【15】2.2. Pathways Involved in Cell Death and Their Components 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】For better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the various modes of cell death mentioned above, here we have discussed the different pathways and the factors that are the main players involved in executing the cellular fates (also see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). As mentioned earlier, several signaling pathways are common in case of the cell death pathways and these involve various common players. The cellular response elicited may also overlap in certain cases. Hence, in this section, we have described the pathways one by one and intermittently discussed the involvement of the organelles in the specific contexts.\n\n【17】### 2.2.1. Intrinsic Cell Death Pathways 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2.1}</u>\n\n【18】The intrinsic death pathways are triggered by internal cellular cues and can generally be classified on the basis of their caspase dependency.

The intrinsic pathway is initiated by intrinsic stimuli, like DNA damage, overload in cytosolic calcium, cellular starvation, oxidative or radiation or cytotoxic stress, and so forth, resulting in mitochondrial events determined by the Bcl-2 family proteins which have opposing roles: proapoptotic, Bax, Bak, Bad, Bcl-X~S~, Bid, Bik, Bim, and Hrk (cause mitochondrial damage) while antiapoptotic, Bcl-2, Bcl-X~L~, Bcl-W, Bfl-1 and Mcl-1 antagonize them \\[, \\]. In humans, twelve caspases have been identified \\[\\]. These are present as inactive zymogens, cleaved to produce the active caspases upon specific stimuli and function in a hierarchical fashion starting from the upstream initiator caspases (2, 8, 9, and 10) to the downstream executioner caspases (3, 6, and 7). Caspase 9 initiates mitochondrial pathways while caspase 8 and 10 trigger the death receptor mediated pathways. Under early apoptotic conditions, DNA fragmentation initiates caspase-mediated poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) cleavage, binding the DNA fragments and blocking the access of DNA repair enzymes leading to apoptosis \\[\\].\n\n【20】Caspase-Independent Intrinsic Cell Death Pathways.Calcium-activated calpain promotes release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria \\[\\] and AIF translocation to the nucleus which requires PARP-1 activity \\[\\], leading to apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. Endonuclease G (endo G) may also participate in caspase-independent cell death pathways. Endo G is released from mitochondria under apoptotic stimuli like UV radiation or use of anti-Fas antibodies, to translocate to the nucleus, wherein it cleaves chromatin DNA into nucleosomal fragments. Endo G acts in cooperation with exonucleases and DNase I, to facilitate DNA processing. This nuclease activity may be found even in the presence of caspase inhibitors.\n\n【21】Granzyme A (Gzm A) also plays a role in caspase-independent apoptosis caused by massive single-stranded DNA nicking. Gzm A induces loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the nucleus, ROS cleaves three members of the ER-associated DNA repair SET complex (HMG2, APE1, and SET). As a consequence, DNase NM23-H1 is activated, along with enhanced activity of other DNases due to destabilization of nuclear lamins and histone H1 \\[\\]. Gzm C/H and K function similar to Gzm A, but their roles have not yet been fully identified \\[\\].\n\n【22】Mitochondrial Response.The mitochondrial involvement in cell death may occur under cellular stress like nutrient deprivation or hypoxia, DNA damage, or activation of oncogenes leading to deregulated cell cycle and evasion of cell cycle checkpoints triggering aberrant cell death pathways. The Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax and Bak) oligomerize, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP). This is considered as the state of \"no return.\" This leads to the release of cytochrome C and/or AIF and endo G to the cytosol. Cytochrome C interacts with the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome complex \\[\\] and subsequently activating the caspase pathway (procaspase 9, followed by caspases 3, 6, and 7). AIF and endo G trigger caspase-independent pathways. Sometimes free radicals are generated due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and diversion of electrons from the respiratory electron transport chain \\[, \\]. Other mitochondrial proteins like inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) can inhibit the caspases via direct interaction; for example, XIAP (X-linked IAP) inhibits caspases 9, 3, and 7 \\[\\] or IAP antagonists like SMAC/DIABLO (second mitochondrial activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with Low pI) or Omi/HtraA2 bind IAPs, preventing their function and favoring caspase activation.\n\n【23】Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress-Induced Intrinsic Pathway. ER stress induced by altered calcium homeostasis, glucose starvation, hypoxic stress, low redox potential, excessive or defective protein synthesis/secretion, and so forth may lead to apoptosis \\[\\]. Upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, unfolded protein response (UPR) is set off, consisting of reduction in global protein synthesis, induction of chaperones and proteins related to protein folding, and translocation of improperly folded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation \\[\\]. Prolonged ER stress may induce autophagy (discussed later in [Section 3.5]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>); activation of \"caspase 8-Bid-cytochrome C release\" axis via the mitochondrial pathway (described later in the \"crosstalks\" subsection) \\[\\]; or calpain-mediated activation of caspase 12 further activating caspase 9 \\[\\].\n\n【24】### 2.2.2. Extrinsic Cell Death Pathways 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2.2}</u>\n\n【25】The extrinsic pathways are generally initiated by external stimulation of the death family of receptors and, hence, this mode is also known as the death receptor mediated extrinsic death pathway. The death receptors (DR) are a family of six members containing a conserved death domain (DD): Fas/CD95/APO-1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), DR 3, TNF apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) R1/DR4, TRAIL R2/DR5, and DR6. Signal transduction via these receptors depends on the cellular context and stimulus, determining the outcome, which may be prosurvival, proinflammatory, apoptotic, necrotic, and so forth. The two death domain associated adaptor proteins involved here are FADD (Fas associated death domain) and TRADD (TNF receptor associated death domain). Signaling through FADD results in apoptosis while involvement of TRADD may have both apoptotic as well as nonapoptotic outcomes \\[\\].\n\n【26】Extrinsic Apoptotic Cascade.Binding of TNF family ligands (FasL and TRAIL) to the death receptors (Fas, TNFR1, etc.) at the plasma membrane leads to recruitment of FADD, receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) and procaspase 8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC formation triggers caspase 8 activation, ubiquitination, and degradation of RIP1 followed by caspase 3 activation and induction of apoptosis \\[\\]. Fas may also associate with another DD associated protein Daxx (DD associated protein 6) inhibiting the FADD induced pathway and triggering JNK signaling. This leads to the induction of another discrete apoptotic cascade \\[\\].\n\n【27】Extrinsic Nonapoptotic Cascade.When TNF-α binds to TNFR1, TRADD is recruited, leading to the formation of two distinct complexes, I and II \\[, \\]. Complex I contains TRAF2 and 5 (TNF receptor-associated factors 2 and 5), RIP1, cIAP1 and 2; polyubiquitinating RIP1 by linking K63-Ub chains; recruiting TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1 binding protein 2 (TAB2), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) essential modifier (NEMO) and I-kappa B kinase (IKK); activating NFκB and leading to expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as IAPs, and cFLIP (cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein), and cell survival \\[\\]. Later on, TNFR1 is internalized, leading to formation of a cytosolic complex (complex II) containing TRADD, FADD, RIP1 and 3, and procaspase 8, initiating either the extrinsic apoptotic cascade or truncating Bid  to trigger the mitochondrial pathway. Hence, the balance between these two complexes leads to the differential outcomes \\[\\].\n\n【28】Extrinsic Necrotic Cascade or Necroptosis. When the caspases are inactivated, a pronecrotic ripoptosome complex \\[\\] similar to DISC is formed containing an additional member RIP3. RIP1 and 3 are activated and RIP1-RIP3 complex formation triggers production of mitochondrial ROS, PARP-1 cleavage, activation of calpains, and so forth, leading to programmed necrosis \\[\\]. Again, DNA damage activates PARP-1, which elicits TRAF2 and RIP1 mediated JNK-1 activation to induce mitochondrial AIF release and translocation to nucleus, leading to necrotic cell death \\[\\].\n\n【29】### 2.2.3. Autophagic Cell Death and Lysosomal Response 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2.3}</u>\n\n【30】Bcl-2 family of proteins has also been implicated in autophagic cell death, wherein, Bcl-2 can bind to Beclin-1 (a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor) and inhibit its activity. This suppresses autophagy and leads to tumorigenesis \\[\\]. UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated) and Bif-1 (Bax-interacting factor 1) are positive regulators of Beclin-1 promoting autophagy \\[\\]. Bif-1 may also act via its interaction with proapoptotic Bax \\[\\]. During starvation, Bcl-2 is phosphorylated and Beclin-1 is released inducing autophagic cell death. PARP-1 cleavage may also be associated with autophagic cell death \\[\\]. Lysosomes are essential for autophagy. The rupture of lysosomes releases cathepsins (acid hydrolases) to the cytosol pushing cells to apoptosis or necrosis. The cathepsins trigger both caspase-dependent mitochondrial response as well as caspase-independent activation of Bax and release of AIF \\[\\]. Some cathepsins also induce Bid mediated apoptosis \\[\\].\n\n【31】### 2.2.4. Crosstalks 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2.4}</u>\n\n【32】In some cases, extrinsic signals may lead to low DISC formation, leading to Bid cleavage by activated caspase 8, changing the MOMP. This results in mitochondrial translocation of truncated Bid (tBid), cytochrome C release, apoptosome formation, and triggering of downstream caspase cascade, linking the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways \\[\\]. Formation of tBid in the cell may also result from Gzm B mediated Bid cleavage ultimately resulting in apoptosome formation as described above. Unlike the other granzymes mentioned earlier, Gzm B can also trigger a caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade and is known to cleave and activate caspases 3 and 8, while cleavage of prosurvival protein Mcl-1 leads to its inactivation \\[\\].\n\n【33】DNA damaging agents may induce cell cycle arrest and induce autophagy and mitophagy, by delaying apoptosis. Both apoptosis and autophagy are regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins \\[\\]. Hence, apoptosis and autophagy may show synergistic effects at times, while at other times, suppression of apoptosis may lead to autophagy. Although not very clear, the two processes may be regulated by discrete DNA damage response pathways and the Bcl-2 family proteins play a crucial role in maintaining this balance. Inactivation of caspases may lead to necroptosis instead of apoptosis, while presence of necrostatin-1 (a specific inhibitor of necroptosis) may lead to reversal of necrosis to apoptosis. Sometimes programmed necrosis and autophagic cell death may occur simultaneously \\[\\].\n\n【34】### 2.2.5. Compartment-Specific Responses in Cell Death Pathways 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2.5}</u>\n\n【35】Nuclear Response. The response elicited upon nuclear DNA damage is mainly via p53 activation, either triggering the transactivation of a number of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bad, Bid, Puma, and Noxa) which are effectors of mitochondrial destabilization or activation of caspase 2 and further inhibition of NFκB signaling, both leading to apoptosis. Upon genotoxic stress, most commonly double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) kinases, which phosphorylate and stabilize p53, blocking its ubiquitination by Mdm2 \\[\\]. The outcome may be either G1 or G2 cell cycle arrest due to stabilization of p21 or apoptosis due to upregulation of Bax or PUMA \\[\\]. Other kinases, like Plk-3, homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK-2), may also phosphorylate p53 giving apoptotic outcomes \\[\\].\n\n【36】Cell cycle is a highly regulated process with multiple checkpoints arresting cells at G1/S, intra S, G2/M, mitotic spindle assembly; either for DNA repair or sending cells to death pathways if the damage is extreme; or even forcing cells to enter quiescence by exiting cell cycle (G0 phase) during starvation. Cell cycle arrest may become irreversible sending cells to senescence \\[\\]. Rb controls the G1 checkpoint and is phosphorylated by an array of cdks to be inactivated, for transition from G1 to S phase. The mitotic checkpoint is maintained by Mad, Bub, aurora kinases, and Plks, to check the mitotic spindle formation. To circumvent aberrations in this phase, cells undergo mitotic catastrophe. Loss of control of the checkpoints leads to genomic instability, providing adaptive or selective advantage to the cancer cells \\[\\].\n\n【37】Cytosolic Response. Akt is an important oncogenic kinase which is one of the master regulators acting upstream of many pathways involved in cell survival, proliferation, death, transcription, translation, and so forth \\[\\]. Phosphorylation of forkhead box proteins (FOXOs) by Akt leads to their nuclear exclusion repressing proapoptotic genes---p27, Bim, and FasL. Other direct proapoptotic targets of Akt are Bad, caspase 9, Mdm2, and GSK-3β \\[\\]. IKK activation induces NFκB signaling to transcribe antiapoptotic proteins---Bcl-X~L~, XIAP, and so forth \\[\\]. All the above processes inhibit apoptosis. One of the negative regulators of Akt is phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which is often deleted or mutated in cancers. While under nutrient deprivation, mTOR complex 1 is inactivated and autophagic response is initiated. Therefore, deregulation of Akt pathway is another strategy of the cancer cells to gain chemoresistance.\n\n【38】2.3. Perspectives in Cancer 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3}</u>\n---------------------------\n\n【39】Evasion of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer \\[\\] and alterations in the apoptotic cascade may result in changes in tumor development and cancer progression \\[\\]. Malignant cells inactivate the endogenous inducers of cell death as a strategy to block the natural cell death pathways, providing a selective survival advantage to the cancer cells \\[\\]. There are several examples where targeting the cell death pathways in regulating the process of oncogenic progression has been used as a strategy for drug development by restoration of the endogenous autodestruction pathways \\[--\\]. Most of the chemotherapeutic drugs act by triggering the cell death pathways in the tumor cells \\[\\]. A major part is by inducing apoptosis, either via the mitochondrial pathways \\[\\] or by stimulation of the death receptor pathways \\[\\], although involvement of the other modes of cell death has also been reported \\[, \\]. Apoptosis and autophagic cell death do not elicit any immune response in the cells and hence are preferred over necrosis. While both of these processes are often found to be defective in cancer, necrosis may be found in tumors. A possible explanation may be elicitation of a persistent cytokine production helping in tumor growth leading to poor prognosis \\[\\]. Cancer cells adapt to hypoxic stress and activate stress response pathways involving the hypoxia-inducing factors (HIFs), inducing autophagy at the hypoxic core and promoting cell survival. The response mostly depends on the dose of the chemotherapeutic stress and on the cell type \\[\\]. Some of the strategies have been discussed below.\n\n【40】### 2.3.1. Targeting Bcl-2 Family Proteins 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.1}</u>\n\n【41】Natural compounds, synthetic antagonists, and analogs of Bcl-2 family members have been used to regulate cell death pathways. Bid and Bax are subject to ubiquitin mediated degradation attenuating apoptosis in cancer cells (example, mitochondrial Bax is degraded in PCa cells). While this strategy is utilized by cancer cells, it has also been exploited for therapeutic purposes; for example, inhibition of the proteasomal system sensitizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis \\[\\].\n\n【42】### 2.3.2. Targeting the Caspases 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.2}</u>\n\n【43】The cancer cells follow three mechanisms to negate the effect of caspases: preventing the activation of the procaspases, neutralizing active caspases, and regulating the gene expression of either caspases or their activators. There are eight members in the IAP family in humans which can directly bind to the caspases and either block their activity or mark them for ubiquitin mediated degradation. These IAPs are frequently found to be upregulated in cancers \\[\\]. For example, c-FLIP suppresses TNF-α induced apoptosis via caspases 8 and 10; CARD8 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 8) binds to procaspase 9; XIAP inhibits caspases 3, 7, and 9. Natural antagonists of the caspases such as SMAC/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 compete with caspases to bind IAPs \\[\\].\n\n【44】### 2.3.3. Targeting the Tumor Suppressors 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3.3}</u>\n\n【45】In cancers, p53 pathway is frequently inactivated by either p53 mutations or Mdm2 overexpression. In such cases, DNA damage response is elicited via ATM and ATR kinases which regulate the Chks, in turn, activating NFκB, Akt, survivin, and so forth \\[\\]. Cancer cells have evolved strategies to counteract these basic cellular mechanisms to deregulate the cell cycle and facilitate either cancer cell growth or to evade cell death. Frequent inactivating mutations or deletions in tumor suppressors like PTEN, p53, Rb, BRCA-1 and 2, p16, and ATM are associated with cancers. Premature senescence has been reported as a drug-induced tumor suppressive mechanism having a potential in cancer treatment \\[\\]. Some tumor suppressors induce autophagy, for example, Beclin 1, UVRAG, PTEN and Bcl-2, while some oncogenic proteins like mTOR inhibit autophagy. p53 displays a dual role by both inducing and inhibiting autophagy.\n\n【46】3. DUBs Involved in Cell Death Associated Pathways Related to Cancer 删除19:<u>{#sec3}</u>\n====================================================================\n\n【47】As DUBs are integral regulatory molecules of most of the cellular functions, it has high implications in proper functioning of the cellular machineries (elaborated in other reviews \\[, --\\]). Deubiquitinating enzymes negatively regulate the ubiquitin signaling pathway and influence both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Due to their varied substrates, the nature of the DUBs always remains dual (both oncogenic and tumor suppressive) and their function is largely tissue-specific and context-dependent. Some of the cellular processes that are integrally related to cell death include cell cycle, DNA damage response and repair, and other signaling pathways. In this review, we emphasize on the different DUBs involved in these pathways (briefly outlined in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>).\n\n【48】3.1. Cell Cycle 删除19:<u>{#sec3.1}</u>\n---------------\n\n【49】The process of cell division goes on simultaneously with cell death processes, establishing several links. Any deregulation in the continuous cycling may lead to cell cycle arrest, senescence, or death. Many DUBs such as USP7, USP13, USP39, USP44, CYLD (cylindromatosis), and BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein-1) are associated with the different phases of cell division.\n\n【50】### 3.1.1. G1, S, and G2 Phases 删除19:<u>{#sec3.1.1}</u>\n\n【51】USP2 stabilizes cyclin D1 by direct interaction \\[\\]. USP7 or HAUSP (herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease) deubiquitinates SCF-β-TrCP mediated K48-linked Ub chains on claspin, the upstream regulator of Chk1 \\[\\]. USP13 counteracts S phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) ubiquitination via the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C^Cdh1^), delaying cell cycle by accumulation of p27 \\[\\]. USP19 deubiquitinates Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex protein 1 (KPC1) regulating p27^Kip1^ \\[\\] and some KPC1 independent cell cycle regulation also exists \\[\\]. UCH-L1 colocalizes with Jab1 sending p27^Kip1^ to proteasomal degradation, prevents senescence, and ensures proper somatic cell division \\[\\]. USP17L2 deubiquitinates cdc25a, promoting oncogenic transformation \\[\\].\n\n【52】### 3.1.2. Spindle Assembly and Mitosis 删除19:<u>{#sec3.1.2}</u>\n\n【53】USP39 deubiquitinates aurora B kinase maintaining spindle assembly checkpoint integrity \\[\\] while USP44 stabilizes Mad2/Cdc20 complex inhibiting premature activation of the APC/C^Cdh1^ complex \\[\\].\n\n【54】### 3.1.3. G1/S and G2/M Checkpoints 删除19:<u>{#sec3.1.3}</u>\n\n【55】USP7 regulates multiple cell cycle checkpoints, via deubiquitination of p53 \\[\\] and Rb \\[\\] or their negative regulator Mdm2 \\[\\]. USP4, reported as an oncogenic protein, is known to interact with the pocket proteins (Rb, p107, and p130) although no deubiquitinating activity has been reported \\[\\]. USP7 deubiquitinates checkpoint with forkhead and RING finger domains protein (Chfr), which in turn ubiquitinates histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), leading to upregulation of p21^Cip1/Waf1^ and induction of G1 arrest \\[\\]. Cdk2 activates USP37 which also antagonizes APC/C^Cdh1^ complex, deubiquitinating cyclin A and entry into S phase, another G1/S checkpoint \\[\\]. BAP1 also controls G1/S cell cycle progression by regulating BRCA-1 \\[\\], Ying Yang 1 (YY-1), and host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) \\[\\]. CYLD regulates Plk-1 \\[\\] protecting G2/M checkpoint. USP50 regulates HSP90-dependent Wee1 stability preventing mitotic entry, acting as another G2/M checkpoint \\[\\].\n\n【56】3.2. DNA Damage and Repair 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2}</u>\n--------------------------\n\n【57】DNA damage and high mutation rates are responsible for genomic instability in cancer cells. DNA damage triggers DNA repair pathways and some of the major ones in the mammalian system are mismatch repair (MMR), double strand break (DSB) repair, base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR) repair, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and so forth. The different pathways exist to combat the insults from a variety of DNA damage stimuli and this is known as cellular DNA damage response. These pathways are highly subject to regulation by the UPS and DUBs \\[\\]. When the cells reach a state of chronic damage, that is, the point of no return, several other cellular responses are elicited such as apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and senescence \\[\\].\n\n【58】### 3.2.1. Double Strand Break Repair 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2.1}</u>\n\n【59】DSB repair pathway is initiated by recruitment of BRCA-1 and p53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1). K63-linked ubiquitin accumulates on Rap80 at the DSB foci with the concerted effect of RNF8, RNF168, and Ubc13, which are clipped off with the assistance of USP3 and BRCC36 to maintain the G2/M checkpoint. BRCC36 also hydrolyzes K63-linked Ub chains form H2A and H2AX at the sites of double strand DNA damage \\[, \\]. Although OTUB1 is not catalytically involved in deubiquitinating these K63-linked chains, it may interact with Ubc13 and inhibit the E3 ligase RNF168 \\[\\]. USP11 plays a role in the HR in response to DNA damage induced by DSBs caused by agents like bleomycin, mitomycin C, cisplatin, and so forth \\[\\]. Although there is no evidence of BRCA-2 deubiquitination by USP11, the interaction may be involved in recruiting USP11 to the damage site \\[\\]. USP28 stabilizes Chk2 in Chk2-p53-PUMA pathway inducing apoptosis \\[\\]. OTUD5 also helps in stabilizing p53 and inducing apoptosis upon DNA damage signals \\[\\].\n\n【60】### 3.2.2. Base Excision Repair 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2.2}</u>\n\n【61】BER mechanisms are elicited by genomic instability arising from DNA base lesions. DNA Pol β is a component of the BER complex. It is ubiquitinated by Mule and CHIP and is deubiquitinated by USP47 \\[\\]. USP7 plays multiple roles in BER. It promotes BER by regulating chromatin remodelling by deubiquitination of H2B, though this activity was shownin vitro, this activity was also seen as an indirect result of Mdm2 deubiquitination by USP7 \\[\\]. Also, DNA damage induced dephosphorylation of USP7 subjects Mule (an E3 ligase for p53) to self-ubiquitination and degradation, stabilizing p53 and activating the damage repair pathway \\[\\]. In this context, it might be worthwhile to mention that post-translational modifications are very important in BER pathways. Apart from phosphorylation and acetylation, AP endonuclease (APE1) is also ubiquitinated, with the help of Mdm2 for degradation. This is a point of crosstalk between p53 and BER pathways \\[\\]. As USP7 is a crucial factor in regulating the p53-Mdm2 balance in the cells, it may be speculated to play yet another role in BER response via modulation of APE1.\n\n【62】### 3.2.3. Nucleotide Excision Repair 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2.3}</u>\n\n【63】During UV radiation-mediated damage, stalling of RNA Pol IIo at DNA lesion sites is a signal for apoptosis and its removal or degradation allows the access to NER machinery. The RNA Pol II cofactors are UV-sensitivity scaffold protein A (UVSSA), ERCC6, and ERCC8. USP7 is an additional cofactor in the complex and stabilizes ERCC6 \\[\\].\n\n【64】### 3.2.4. Crosslink Repair 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2.4}</u>\n\n【65】This mechanism involves PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and FANCD2 (Fanconi anemia, complementation group D2) and acts at the site of fork-blocking lesions arising from interstrand crosslinks. USP1 deubiquitinates both PCNA and FANCD2 \\[, \\]. Response to cell damage is generally under the control of ATM/ATR and Chk1 and 2. FANCD2 stabilization leads to activation of Chk1, the initial step in DNA damage repair \\[, \\]. A number of DUBs, such as USP15, USP19, USP28, and USP34 \\[, \\], act at the interface of DNA damage and cell cycle progression by DNA repair to decide the cell fate \\[\\].\n\n【66】3.3. Apoptosis 删除19:<u>{#sec3.3}</u>\n--------------\n\n【67】Both apoptosis promoting and suppressing roles are displayed by the various DUBs linked to the apoptotic pathways. USP2, USP7, USP8, USP9X, USP15, USP16, USP17, USP28, CYLD, UCH-L1, A20, and so forth promote apoptosis while USP2, USP7, USP9X, USP18, and so forth suppress apoptosis \\[\\]. USP7 deubiquitinates and stabilizes the acetyltransferase Tip60 to induce p53-dependent apoptotic pathways \\[\\]. The opposing roles played by USP7 and Mdm2 is critical for maintaining the level of Daxx in the cancer cells \\[\\]. In colon adenocarcinoma cells, the WDR48 and USP12 complex deubiquitinates PHLPP1 (PH domain and leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) to enhance its stability, hence negatively regulating Akt activation and promoting cellular apoptosis \\[\\]. USP1 \\[\\] and USP46 \\[\\] are other DUBs known to deubiquitinate PHLPP1, with a similar outcome in other cancers as well. Radiation-induced activation of USP9X deubiquitinates Mcl-1, inhibiting its degradation and apoptosis, conferring radioresistance \\[\\].\n\n【68】3.4. Signaling Pathways Involving Key Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4}</u>\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【69】The decision of cell death or aberrant growth leading to tumorigenesis is an outcome of the imbalance in the regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. So here we have indicated the different DUBs regulating these processes.\n\n【70】### 3.4.1. Signaling through Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4.1}</u>\n\n【71】RTKs are important upstream factors in oncogenic signaling cascades and also targets for drug development. These are frequently internalized, ubiquitinated, and sorted in the endosomes leading either to lysosomal degradation or change in subcellular localization like nuclear translocation. These processes are prone to multiple aberrations in cancers with varying outcomes. AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) expression is elevated in many cancers and is capable of hydrolyzing K63-linked Ub chains from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) recycling it to the plasma membrane \\[, \\]. Cezanne-1 deubiquitinates and stabilizes EGFR, enhancing EGFR signaling and cancer progression \\[\\]. USP18 also regulates EGFR \\[\\]. POH1 regulates ErbB2, an EGFR family member \\[\\]. USP8 regulates another EGFR family member, ErbB3 by modulating Nrdp1 (neuregulin-receptor-degradation protein-1) \\[\\].\n\n【72】### 3.4.2. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4.2}</u>\n\n【73】DUBs regulate canonical Wnt signaling, by modulating β-catenin activity. USP4 deubiquitinases TCF4, to suppress β-catenin dependent transcription \\[\\]. While USP15 deubiquitinates and stabilizes tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) involved in the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin \\[\\]. TRABID (TRAF-binding domain-containing protein) or ZRANB1 (zinc finger Ran-binding domain-containing protein 1) deubiquitinates APC by removing K63-linked Ub chains, inducing TCF4-mediated transcription upon Wnt stimulation \\[\\].\n\n【74】### 3.4.3. NFκB Signaling 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4.3}</u>\n\n【75】Activation of IKK leads to phosphorylation and degradation of the IκBs, promoting the nuclear translocation of NFκB. K63-linked Ub-NEMO binds IKK recruiting it to complex I, activating NFκB (via cIAP 1 and 2; cFLIP; and TNF-α and IL-8); or JNK and p38 MAPK; for antiapoptotic or proinflammatory responses, respectively, \\[\\]. K63-linked Ub chains on RIP1 serve as a scaffold for binding of TAK1 and TAB2. Upon TNF-α induction, RIP1 ubiquitination may show three specific outcomes. In the first case, K48-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 may lead to targeting it for degradation and triggering the apoptotic cascade. In the second case, K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 may lead to association of complex I, inducing proinflammatory or antiapoptotic response. In the third case, removal of K63-linked ubiquitin chains from RIP1 may lead to the association of complex II again sending the cells to death pathway. Hence, it is clear that the ubiquitination of these factors, especially, the ubiquitin linkage of RIP1 is very important in determining cellular fate. The involvement of multiple DUBs in this pathway shows the importance of deubiquitinating enzymes in determining the cell fate via this signaling axis \\[\\].\n\n【76】CYLD.CYLD is a negative regulator of NFκB signaling contributing to oncogenesis. Knockdown of CYLD resulted in enhanced NFκB signaling upon TNF-α stimulation \\[\\]. The members of NFκB signaling are subjected to K63-linked ubiquitination for their activation which is again deubiquitinated, as for example--CYLD deubiquitinates with NEMO, TRAF2, 6 and 7, RIP1 and TAK1 \\[--\\]. CYLD itself is regulated by NFκB creating a negative feedback loop \\[\\]. CYLD also inactivates BCL-3 by deubiquitination \\[\\]. As BCL-3 is a coactivator of NFκB, this inactivation of BCL-3 leads to switching in the transcriptional activity of NFκB from repression to activation of cell proliferation \\[, \\]. CYLD negatively regulates BCL-3 mediated NFκB signaling by induction of p50-BCL3 and p52-BCL3 complexes and inhibiting cell proliferation \\[\\].\n\n【77】A20. A20 negatively regulates NFκB signaling. The targets of A20-mediated deubiquitination are K63-linked ubiquitinated TRAF6 and RIP1 \\[, \\]. The enzyme A20 has been shown to have a dual role on RIP1, by acting both as a DUB (removing K63-Ub) as well as an E3 ligase (linking K48-Ub and marking it for degradation), negatively regulating the NFκB signaling \\[\\]. Apo2L induces both K48 and K63-linked polyubiquitination of caspase 8. K63-linked caspase 8 ubiquitination makes it enzymatically more potent leading to apoptosis. A20 acts as a DUB removing the K63-Ub and has been hypothesized to add K48-Ub due to its E3 ligase activity similar to its dual role as seen in case of RIP1 \\[\\]. In B-cell lymphomas A20 is frequently inactivated and upon its restoration, cells undergo apoptosis \\[\\].\n\n【78】USP7. USP7 is ubiquitinated by TRIM27 complex, which deubiquitinates RIP1, resulting in positive regulation of TNF-α induced apoptosis \\[\\]. USP7 deubiquitinates p65-NFκB by interacting with p65 at the target gene promoters, increasing their transcription \\[\\].\n\n【79】Other DUBs.USP2a removes K63-linked Ub chains from RIP1 and TRAF2 again negatively regulating NFκB signaling pathway \\[\\]. Both USP11 and USP15 also negatively regulate and function by deubiquitinating IκB to sequester NFκB in the cytoplasm. USP11 stabilizes IKK-α to stabilize and activate p53 \\[\\]. USP21 and Cezanne or OTUD7B negatively regulate NFκB signaling by deubiquitinating and inactivating RIP1 upon TNF-α stimulation, providing a feedback loop in the proinflammatory signaling \\[\\]. Cezanne has been reported to hydrolyze linear K11-Ub chains from RIP1. MCPIP1 also removes K63-Ub from RIP1 and TRAF2 and 6 but its activity is unclear \\[\\].\n\n【80】### 3.4.4. Other Oncogenic Signals 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4.4}</u>\n\n【81】USP2 deubiquitinates both Mdm2 and MdmX. Upon androgen stimulation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, USP2 deubiquitinates and stabilizes Mdm2 \\[\\] and its homologue MdmX \\[\\]. USP2a can also deubiquitinate Fas preventing apoptosis in PCa \\[\\]. cMyc plays a pivotal role in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by regulating (both activating and repressing) the transcription of proteins involved in cell cycle, survival, protein synthesis, cell adhesion, and so forth, depending on its interacting partner in forming the functional heterodimer \\[\\]. cMyc shows multiple mutations in various cancers. The UPS mediated degradation of cMyc involves an array of E3 ligases. USP28, often overexpressed in cancers, was shown to stabilize cMyc by reversing FBW7-α mediated ubiquitination \\[\\].\n\n【82】### 3.4.5. Tumor Suppressors and Associated Pathways 删除19:<u>{#sec3.4.5}</u>\n\n【83】USP7 deubiquitinates tumor suppressors p53, PTEN, FOXO, Rb, and so forth. The stabilization of p53 is triggered upon DNA damage stress, while under normal conditions Mdm2 is a better target for USP7 \\[, \\]. USP7 helps in removing mono-Ub link on PTEN, facilitating its translocation back to the cytosol, which enhances tumor aggressiveness in PCa. USP7 also regulates p27^Kip1^ via deubiquitination of the FOXOs (3a and 4). FOXO 3a and 4 are deubiquitinated by USP7, to be retained in the nucleus to promote their tumor suppressive transcriptional activity \\[\\]. In case of Rb, USP7 shows a differential deubiquitination in normal and cancer (glioma) cells depending on the Mdm2 levels \\[\\]. Regulation of p53 is also subject to other DUBs, such as USP4, USP10, USP29, and USP42 \\[\\]. USP2a deubiquitinates Mdm2 hence promoting p53 degradation \\[\\].\n\n【84】3.5. DUBs as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer 删除19:<u>{#sec3.5}</u>\n------------------------------------------\n\n【85】Some of the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs generally rely on restoration of the endogenous cell death pathways such as activation of proapoptotic proteins like Bax, PUMA, caspases, Apaf-1, and so forth; induction of p53 apoptotic pathway by generating genotoxic stress; creating DNA damage to trigger the repair mechanisms; pharmacological inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies to target oncogenic receptors (e.g. EGFR), kinases (e.g. Akt), transcription factors (e.g. Stat3, cMyc, NFκB), and so forth to regulate the major signaling pathways. In the clinical context, differentially targeting cancer cells from normal cells according to the above strategies largely depends on the dependency of cancer cells on these aberrant signals. But cellular signaling redundancy overpowers, leading to resistance. Also many drugs turn out to be carcinogenic as discussed by Apraiz et al. \\[\\]. This can be avoided by targeting the UPS and DUBs. Some of the possibilities are restoration of tumor suppressive deubiquitinases like CYLD \\[\\] and inhibition of oncogenic deubiquitinases like USP9X \\[\\]. But this approach is also not that straight forward because of the dual nature of certain DUBs like USP7.\n\n【86】The UPS controls a large number of cell cycle proteins such as p27, Rb, cyclin D1, p53, the Bcl-2 family members, and NFκB signaling \\[, \\]. And as discussed earlier in [Section 1]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>, the successful use of bortezomib in multiple myeloma (MM) utilizes the aggregation of misfolded proteins in cancer cells as compared to their normal counterparts. In this cellular perspective, the principles of autophagy, that is, nutrient recycling via delivery of cytosolic contents to the lysosomes, has been found to be utilized in disposing protein aggregates, leading to the emergence of the \"quality control autophagy\" concept. The two ubiquitin binding proteins p62 and HDAC6 recognize the Ub-linked protein aggregates that have evaded proteasomal degradation and reroute them to the aggresome-autophagy machinery. The DUB ataxin 3 plays an important role here in remodelling the Ub-tags on protein aggregates to modify the existing signals and subsequent cell fate \\[\\]. Combinatorial antitumoral effects of autophagic and proteasomal inhibitors have shown promises in MM \\[\\].\n\n【87】The DUBs themselves are subject to different modes of regulation like transcriptional, post-translational, change in subcellular localization via multiple protein-protein interactions as discussed by Fraile et al. \\[\\]. Some of the regulatory mechanisms are feedback loop (e.g. autoproteolysis of USP1; proteolysis of CYLD and A20), caspase 3 mediated proteolytic processing of USP7 (as reported in playing a role in thymocyte apoptosis \\[\\]), phosphorylation (inactivates CYLD, USP8; activates A20, USP7, USP15, USP19, USP28, USP34, USP37), ubiquitination (inactivates UCH-L1, USP7, USP36), neddylation and sumoylation (inactivates USP25); ROS (modifies Cezanne); targeting of USP30 to mitochondria, or USP36 to nucleoli, and so forth. From the structural point of view, conserved catalytic sites may be blocked or conformational changes may modulate their activity (UCH-L1, OTU1, USP1, USP7, USP12, and USP46).\n\n【88】All these reports suggest a potential of DUBs as therapeutic targets in cancer. Till date several strategies to inhibit the DUB activity have been studied. Here we have discussed the various inhibitors of DUBs and the degree of success achieved with regard to cancer cell death. There are many small molecule inhibitors, natural compounds, and their analogs and quite a few are in preclinical trials (see details in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). Some of the inhibitors are broad spectrum, while there are some which are very specific, targeting only a particular DUB. On the basis of the wide range of DUB substrates, it is very interesting to target them to induce cell death pathways in the cancer cells. But due to the highly context-dependent functioning of these DUBs, it becomes very important to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of the DUB activity in a specific pathway before targeting them with inhibitors. All the processes discussed in [Section 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u> can be exploited to our benefit. It may be speculated that this approach of targeting DUBs may have an edge over the conventional therapies to combat the tendency of cancer cells to acquire resistance. It is also suggestive of a combinatorial drug treatment of DUB inhibitors with the conventional cytotoxic drugs \\[\\].\n\n【89】4. Concluding Remarks 删除19:<u>{#sec4}</u>\n=====================\n\n【90】It is well established that uncontrolled cell growth in cancer is not an outcome of abnormal cell proliferation alone but is also because of the lack of cell death, especially, the pathways that are programmed. The significance of cell death pathways in the perspective of cancer is that any deregulation in cell death leads to abnormal cell survival and proliferation, leading to oncogenesis. Hence, the knowledge of the various signaling pathways involved in cell death and their crosstalks is very important to figure out the most plausible therapeutic targets. During radio- or chemotherapy, one of the strategies exploited is the reactivation of signaling pathways, to induce cell death. The major hurdle in cancer treatment has been the redundancy in signaling pathways, favoring development of resistance against conventional therapies \\[\\]. Hence, the requirement of focusing on alternative strategies arises.\n\n【91】This work was supported by Grants from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) \\[EMPOWER: OLP-002; MEDCHEM: BSC-0108 and CSIR-MAYO Clinic: MLP-0017\\].\n\n【92】通用结尾删除-1:<u>!通用删除8(英):<u>[Relative occurrence of the various modes of programmed cell death.

Cervical cancer is preventable and treatable, yet few older Hispanic women seek screening and continue to be a high-risk group for cervical cancer. A literature review was conducted to address the relationship between cervical cancer screening, health literacy, and older Hispanic women. Eighty studies were reviewed, and nine addressed health literacy and Hispanic women. One study addressed the association between functional health literacy and Pap smear screening among older Hispanic women. Few studies have explored the association between preventive cervical cancer screening and health literacy among older Hispanic women. Nurses must assess health literacy and be prepared to provide care, which is culturally, and linguistically appropriate to improve health outcomes. Further research is needed to be inclusive of all populations including older Hispanic women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Forty-four participants were randomized into 4 groups: physical training (PH; 8 weeks' aerobic training, n = 11), mental training (ME; special computer gaming, n = 11), combined (PH + ME; n = 13), and control group (CO; n = 9).

The coefficient of error (CE) of the Cavalieri estimator was predicted by a computer-intensive method. The method is based on polynomial regression of area values on section number and simulation of systematic sectioning. The measurement function is modelled as a quadratic polynomial, with an error term superimposed. The relative influence of the trend and the error component is estimated by techniques of analysis of variance. This predictor was compared with two established short-cut estimators of the CE based on transitive theory. First, all predictors were applied to data sets from six deterministic models with analytically known CE. For these models, the CE was best predicted by the older short-cut estimator and by the computer-intensive approach, if the measurement function had finite jumps. The best prediction was provided by the newer short-cut estimator when the measurement function was continuous. The predictors were also applied to published empirical datasets. The first data set consisted of 10 series of areas of systematically sectioned rat hearts with 10-13 items, the second data set consisted of 13 series of systematically sampled transectional areas of various biological structures with 38-90 items. On the whole, similar mean values for the predicted CE were obtained with the older short-cut estimator and the computer-intensive method. These ranged in the same order of magnitude as resampling estimates of the CE from the empirical data sets, which were used as a cross-check. The mean values according to the newer short-cut CE estimator ranged distinctly lower than the resampling estimates.

AA is naturally occurred in diverse foods such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and fruit beverages . In addition, it is also added as a flavor enhancer in various beverages including soft drink and as a preservative in fruits and fish products . AA provides a pleasant fruity aroma at low levels while it has an irritating odor note at high levels . In fruits, it is produced as an intermediate in the respiration of higher plants, whereas, in alcoholic beverages, it is mainly formed by yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and the auto-oxidation of ethanol and phenolic compounds . In addition, AA can be produced from alanine metabolism by some yeasts . Its level can increase due to the chemical oxidation of ethanol during aging of spirits . AA is also generated from Strecker degradation of alanine in the food systems , Furthermore, AA, a saturated aldehyde, can be formed as one of secondary products from the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids through chemical and/or enzymatic reactions in food systems . AA is extremely reactive and binds readily to proteins, peptides, and amino acids . AA is also able to cross-link to proteins, suggesting that it can react with DNA which may cause further biological changes, including mutagenesis and carcinogenesis . In addition, AA can exacerbate the neurologic, hepatic, and cardiac complications of alcoholism and cause membrane damages and inhibition of several enzyme activities such as aldehyde dehydrogenase which causes metabolic strain to acetate . The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified AA as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) and AA associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) .\n\n【2】FA is colorless, highly volatile, and flammable with a strong and irritating odor. It is readily soluble in water, alcohol, and other polar solvents. FA is commercially produced from methanol and used as a preservative, reducing agent, and a sterilizing agent in food industry . It is naturally present as a product of normal metabolism in many foods including fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, crustacean, and dried mushrooms . In some sea foods and crustaceans, FA is known to develop postmortem from the enzymatic reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) in their bodies to FA and dimethylamine . In this process, the level of FA is different among the species and between frozen and fresh seafood due to their different amount of TMAO from species to species and depending on bacterial activity . FA is also generated from the oxidation of dietary methanol or methanol derived from aspartame, an artificial sweetener . In addition, it can be formed from Strecker degradation of glycine in the presence of glyoxal in food system . Furthermore, FA, a saturated aldehyde, is also derived from the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by chemical and enzymatic reactions in food systems . FA has been related to the increased risks of leukemia and nasopharyngeal cancer in humans . The classification of FA is carcinogenic to humans by IARC (Group 1)  and known to be a human carcinogen by the US National toxicology program (NTP) .\n\n【3】GC-electron capture detection (ECD), GC-mass spectrometry (MS), headspace (HS)-SPME GC system, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after derivatization are mostly used to determine AA and FA in foods . Since both are highly volatile and reactive to carbonyl compounds, they are usually required to derivatize prior to analysis. The most common derivatization reagents include 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) , PFBHA , and 2-aminoethanethiol (cysteamine) , Regarding analytical methods for AA and FA, GC system has higher sensitivity and selectivity for both compounds compared to HPLC system .\n\n【4】AA in various foods was determined using HS-GC-FID after the extraction using simulated digestion, and the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0.01 mg/L and 0.04 mg/L, respectively . In recent, AA in children foods including yogurt, purees, and milk products was analyzed using SPME-GC combined with time of flight (TOF)-MS after derivatization with PFBHA . In addition, AA level in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages was also evaluated using GC-MS combined with SPME after PFBHA derivatization . European Union (EU) has recommended that AA in alcoholic beverages such as spirits is analyzed using GC-flame ionization detection (FID) with a direct injection method . The content of FA in various fish species was evaluated using SPME-GC-MS system based on derivatization with PFBHA with LOD of 17 µg/kg and LOQ of 28 µg/kg . Its level in Korean traditional fermented foods including kimchi, soybean paste, and soy sauce was determined using HS-SPME-GC-MS after derivatization with 2,2,2,-trifluoroethylhydrazine (TFEH) . There is little information available on the levels of AA and FA in a variety of foods since their determination has been reported in only very limited food products such as alcoholic beverages, fermented foods and fish products ,\n\n【5】The objective of the current study was to determine the contents of both AA and FA in a variety of food groups consumed in Korea using SPME-GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA.\n\n【6】MATERIALS AND METHOD\n====================\n\n【7】All chemicals used were of analytical grade. AA, FA, and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (an internal standard compound) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, USA) and derivatizing agent PFBHA \\[O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-benzyl)-hydroxylamine hydrochloride\\] was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n【8】Preparation of standard solutions and method validation. Stock standard solutions of AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ were prepared at 10,000 mg/L in deionized water. All standard solutions were stored at −5℃ before use. Validation was carried out in food matrices, such as peanut butter, beef, milk, 20% ethanol solution, rice porridge, orange juice, and corn oil. Calibration samples were prepared in the range of 5\\~10,000 ng/g using food matrices and standard solutions. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were defined as lowest concentration with signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of 3.3 and 10, respectively.\n\n【9】Sample preparation and solid phase micro-extraction. All samples obtained were kept at −70℃ until being used for the experiments. Solid and semi-solid sample (1 g) were mixed with 9.950 mL of 30% NaCl solution and an internal standard \\[50 µL AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (10 µg/L, w/v)\\] and then sonicated at ambient temperature for 30 min. After the sample was centrifuged (3000 rpm) at 4℃ for 10 min and voltexed for 30 sec, supernatant (5 mL) was transferred to in 10-mL headspace vials with screw caps. Being mixed with 4.475 mL of 30% NaCl solution and an internal standard \\[25 µL AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (10 µg/L, w/v)\\], liquid sample was sonicated at ambient temperature for 30 min. Then 100 mg potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) and 50 µL PFBHA (10 mg/mL) were added to 5 mL sample before voltexing for 30 sec and derivatizing at 45℃ for 40 min. SPME fiber coated with 65 µm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzebe (PDMS/DVB) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used to adsorb volatile compounds in the headspace at 45℃ for 15 min.\n\n【10】Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis was performed using a 7890A series gas chromatograph connected to a 5975C mass selective detector (MSD) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was run as a carrier gas at a constant column flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. In the case of SPME, the fiber was maintained in the splitless mode in GC injector at 220℃ for 5 min to desorb the adsorbed volatiles. GC oven temperature was held 50℃ for 2 min, raised to 120℃ at a rate 30℃/min and then held at 200℃ for 10 min. The other GC-MS conditions were as follow: The front inlet and detector transfer line temperatures were 220℃ and 250℃, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV through electron ionization (EI). Data were acquired in the selected-ion monitoring mode (SIM mode). AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ derivatives were quantified at m/z-209, 195, and 211, respectively. Additionally, 181 at m/z was monitored for qualifier ion of AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~.\n\n【11】RESULT AND DISCUSSION\n=====================\n\n【12】Method validation. An efficient method was developed to analyze the contents of AA and FA in various food matrices. Method validation included linearity, LOD, and repeatability of the present method using calibration samples spiked with authentic AA and FA compounds. Linearity (correlation efficient r) ranged from 0.949\\~0.9993 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). LOD ranged from 5.74\\~175.03 ng/g. On the other hand, RSD (%) of precision ranged from 1.34\\~14.53, whereas recovery (%) was in the range of 68.37\\~128.22%. Our validation results showed that the method had an acceptable performance for their analytical method based on Guidelines for the Validation of Chemical Methods for the FDA Foods Program.\n\n【13】###### The equations and the correlation coefficients of aldehydes\n\n【14】  ------------------ ---------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------- -----------\n  Matrices           Calibration curve      Limit of detection (ng/g)   Calibration range (ng/g)   Linearity\n\n【15】  Acetaldehyde                                                                                 \n  Rice porridge      Y = 0.0031X − 0.7071   51.8                          50-10,000                0.0976\n  Orange juice       Y = 0.0029X + 0.2312   19.9                          50-10,000                0.9935\n  Corn oil           Y = 0.0022X + 0.2199   66.8                          50-10,000                0.9988\n  Peanut butter      Y = 0.0024X + 2.0043   175.03                      250-10,000                 0.9977\n  Beef               Y = 0.0025X + 0.426      25.08                     100-5,000                  0.9982\n  Milk               Y = 0.0023X − 0.0535       5.74                      50-10,000                0.9993\n  20% EtOH           Y = 0.0021X + 0.2879     12.57                       50-10,000                0.9973\n  Formaldehyde                                                                                 \n  Rice porridge      Y = 0.0038X − 0.2778   38.0                          50-10,000                0.9504\n  Orange juice       Y = 0.0029X − 0.0333   17.2                          50-10,000                0.9957\n  Corn oil           Y = 0.0073X − 0.7389   120.9                         50-10,000                0.949  \n  Peanut butter      Y = 0.0066X + 0.1529     15.05                       50-10,000                0.9921\n  Beef               Y = 0.0033X + 0.1611       7.80                    5-700                      0.9985\n  Milk               Y = 0.0056X + 0.0595     12.20                       5-1,000                  0.9974\n  20% EtOH           Y = 0.0027X + 0.0056     11.00                     10-1,000                   0.998  \n  ------------------ ---------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------- -----------\n\n【16】Aldehydes contents in food samples.

content of AA in fruits was in the range of 483.42\\~19,530.53 ng/g, whereas that of FA was in the range of 116.90\\~356.73 ng/g. There was a previous study on AA content in some fruits. AA content in apple, grape, kiwi, orange and pineapple was 320\\~2,390 ng/g, 910\\~3,230 ng/g, 730\\~810 ng/g, 5,560\\~8,370 ng/g, and 630 ng/g, respectively . In the case of FA, its level was also different depending on fruits; 6,300\\~22,300 ng/g in apple, 22,400 ng/g in grape, and 9,200 ng/g in water melon . The present results on AA content in apple and grape were similar to those of the previous studies . However, in the case of kiwi, orange, and pineapple, higher content of AA was determined in this study compared to the previous ones. Also, AA content of canned pineapple was shown to be 483.42 ng/g, which was lower than that of raw pineapple. This result was consistent with that of a previous literature on the comparison of AA contents between canned and raw carrot samples . In addition, FA contents of all fruits studied in this study were lower than those of the previous studies.\n\n【38】In dairy products, the overall content of AA was N.D\\~1,525.18 ng/g, whereas that of FA was 26.67\\~409.74 ng/g. A previous study showed that AA contents were 2,400\\~17,420 ng/g in yogurt, and 120\\~2,050 ng/g in cheeses, respectively . World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the content of naturally forming FA was about 13\\~57 ng/g, whereas some other studies demonstrated that it was in the range of 1,000\\~3,300 ng/g in milk, \\< 3,300 ng/g in cheese , and 164 ng/g in processed milk , respectively. Those results clearly indicated that the formation of FA can be increased by fermentation and thermal processing in dairy products. In the present study, the content of AA in yogurts and cheeses was similar to that those of previous researches. On the other hand, the content of FA in raw milk was shown to be 42.88\\~54.05 ng/g, which was in the range of natural FA content suggested by WHO. Also, the content of FA in processed milk was 43.50 ng/g, which was not increased compared to that of raw milk.\n\n【39】In alcohol-free beverages, the content of AA was N.D\\~20,061.48 ng/g, whereas that of FA was 125.28\\~1,522.46 ng/g. There have been some studies on the content of AA in various beverages. Different levels of AA were found depending on the types of beverages ; 1,350\\~9,860 ng/g (in teas), 930\\~1,630 ng/g (in fruit drinks), 280 ng/g (in soft drinks), 10\\~5,890 ng/g (in fresh fruit juices), and 150\\~16,300 ng/g (in processed juices). On the other hand, instant coffee and roasted coffee were shown to contain 31,200\\~35,510 ng/g and 1,150\\~40,140 ng/g of AA .\n\n【40】Also, a previous study on FA content in beverages reported that FA content of processed soft drinks such as cola, fruit/vegetable juices, instant coffee, and roasted coffee were 7,400\\~8,700 ng/g, 800,000 ng/g, 10,000\\~16,000 ng/g, and 3,400\\~4,500 ng/g, respectively . FA in alcoholic beverage is thought to be mainly generated by bacteria that oxidize methanol . Glycine is also converted to FA by Strecker degradation . In the present study, AA content of tea was shown to be similar with those of previous studies whereas AA content of fruit drink was lower. We cannot detect AA in soft drinks, and previous studies also have reported lower AA concentration in soft drinks than other beverages.\n\n【41】In alcoholic beverages, the content of AA was 1,043.57\\~40,607.02 ng/g, whereas that of FA was determined to be 18.38\\~782.10 ng/g. Previous studies on AA contents in alcoholic beverages showed that AA contents of red wine, white wine, sparkling wine, champagne, beer, whiskey, Makgeolli, Soju (Korean distilled spirits), Sake, and liqueur were 6,818\\~55,800 ng/g, 6,818\\~67,000 ng/g, 123,000 ng/g, 2,355\\~8,460 ng/g, 76,900\\~15,263 ng/g, 9,561 ng/g, 805\\~13,371 ng/g, 10,368 ng/g, and 5,674\\~62,300 ng/g, respectively , On the other hand, FA contents of wine, beer, whiskey, Makgeolli, Soju, Sake and liqueur were 32 ng/g, 100\\~1,500 ng/g, 272 ng/g, 60 ng/g, 9\\~106 ng/g, 27 ng/g, and 228 ng/g, respectively , AA is a highly volatile aroma component found in most beverages and foods. It provides pleasant aroma as like fruity note at low concentrations, whereas it can be related to a harsh odor note at high concentrations . Aldehydes, which are mainly produced by yeast during alcoholic fermentation, can be also generated by low-grade yeast and bacteria from non-fresh material during the manufacturing process of alcoholic beverage, affecting flavor characteristics of alcoholic beverages. AA is also very reactive, and can participate in binding with proteins via Schiff base. In particular, it can be easily lost by binding with amino groups of amino acids and peptides ,\n\n【42】AA in alcoholic beverage, which had been previously considered as a by-product of the alcoholic fermentation by yeast, was also reported to be generated by the glucose metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, natural oxidation of ethanol in the presence of phenolic components , and the metabolism of alanine by yeasts . In the case of spirits, AA content was often increased by chemical oxidation of ethanol during aging and distillation processes . On the other hand, fermentation conditions of alcoholic beverage, such as the type of yeast, fermentation temperature, CO~2~ level, and raw material have been known to be highly involved in the generation of AA ,\n\n【43】Analysis of AA content in alcoholic beverages showed that all samples, except for Magkeolli, contain lower level of AA, compared to that of previous studies. Since Makgeolli is not exposed to the filtration and sterilization process, AA content can be increased even after the ethanol fermentation by the continued metabolism of yeast. Particularly, AA content of Soju was lowest among alcoholic beverages studied. Most of fermentation by-products and flavor components are removed during the purification process (distillation). That purification process can be responsible for the lowest content of AA in Soju . The present results on FA content of alcoholic beverage indicated that all samples, except for Sake and whiskey, contain lower level of FA, compared to those of previous studies.\n\n【44】This research was supported by a grant (13162KFDA049) from Korea Food and Drug Administration in 2013\\~2015.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Effects in vitro.\nWe have studied the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor on rat embryonic mesencephalic neurons in vitro. Basic fibroblast growth factor promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons in vitro, the effect increasing with dose and reaching a maximum at 10 ng/ml. In the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-stained (tyrosine hydroxylase positive) neurons declines to almost zero within 14 days, whereas in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor numbers remain almost constant from three to 28 days in vitro. This effect of basic fibroblast growth factor is abolished by preventing non-neuronal cells from appearing in the cultures, apart from a basic fibroblast growth factor-mediated increase in the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells during the first two days in vitro. The presence or absence of non-neuronal cells also influences dopaminergic neuronal morphology, the neurons having more, longer, and more varicose processes in the absence of astrocytes. Survival of dopaminergic neurons in vitro in the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor is very dependent on plating cell density, but in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor this dependency vanishes. It is also possible to make survival independent of plating density by growing the cultures on inverted coverslips, which have the effect of concentrating secreted molecules in the thin layer of medium between coverslip and dish. Our conclusions from these experiments on plating density are that astrocytes probably constitutively secrete a small amount of a trophic factor which promotes survival of dopaminergic neurons, and that the rate of production of this factor is greatly increased by basic fibroblast growth factor. If basic fibroblast growth factor is withdrawn from cultures after two or seven days the dopaminergic neurons soon die. However, if basic fibroblast growth factor is withdrawn after 14 days, after the period of naturally occurring cell death of these neurons, there is no increase in dopaminergic neuronal death compared to controls in which basic fibroblast growth factor treatment is maintained. If basic fibroblast growth factor is used to improve the survival of dopaminergic neurons grafted in vivo, it should therefore be sufficient to treat the grafts for 14 days.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Gout results from sodium urate crystals that form when serum urate persistently exceeds saturation. Deposition of sodium urate crystals can cause extremely painful gout flares or attacks, joint damage, and subcutaneous nodules (tophi). Furthermore, gout and hyperuricaemia are associated with various comorbidities, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life. The causes of hyperuricaemia are known, and urate-lowering treatments can maintain serum urate concentrations at less than saturation, which prevents crystal formation and dissolves existing crystals, making gout the only common arthritis where the pathogenic agent can be eliminated. Addressing risk factors for hyperuricaemia (eg, overweight, excessive alcohol intake, high dietary intake of purines and fructose) is advised as well as medical treatment, but alone rarely reduces concentrations of serum urate sufficiently to alter the disease course. \n\n【2】Despite good understanding of the disease and the availability of curative treatment, gout care remains suboptimum.  In the UK, gout is managed predominantly in primary care by general practitioners (GPs), but less than half of patients receive urate-lowering therapy.  In those who do, the dose is usually fixed without titration to achieve a target serum urate concentration and adherence is poor.  Common misconceptions about gout (eg, that it is not a serious condition and that it is self-induced by lifestyle) are important barriers to care,  and, therefore, education of patients is central to management.  Unfortunately, some physicians share these misconceptions and many, because of factors such as work pressures, might have insufficient time to educate patients adequately.\n\n【3】Research in contextEvidence before this studyDespite increasing prevalence of gout in the UK, various barriers prevent patients from receiving optimum care. Only 40% of gout patients receive urate-lowering therapy that is usually given at a fixed dose without titration to achieve a target serum urate concentration, and adherence is poor. In a search done for a previous proof-of-concept study, we found no long-term randomised controlled trials that had assessed recommended best practice management of gout in a primary care setting. The proof-of-concept study showed that when people with gout are fully informed and involved in management decisions, uptake of urate-lowering therapy is high and adherence under nurse-led care is excellent. The findings led to a 2-year randomised controlled community trial to compare directly nurse-led care and usual care led by general practitioners (GPs).Added value of this studyNurse-led care, including providing patients with individualised information and engaging them with care, along with a strategy of treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy, resulted in very high treatment uptake and adherence. Patient-centred outcomes, such as flare frequency, tophi, and quality of life were substantially improved. Adherence was 95% at 2 years, which is greater than in any previously reported clinical studies of gout. We also found that the allopurinol doses needed to achieve target serum urate concentrations were greater than the upper dose of 300 mg/day used by most UK GPs. The nurse-led approach was cost-effective in the short-term and would potentially be cost saving in the long-term.Implications of all the available evidenceIndividualised education and engagement of patients and a treat-to-target strategy are important elements in successful management of gout. The management principles are potentially generalisable to any health professionals who manage people with gout. These findings add to the evidence that refutes the American College of Physicians advice, which seems to ignore patients\\' involvement in deciding whether urate-lowering therapy should be used, and, when it is used, to not treat to a target serum urate concentration.\n\n【4】In the UK, community-based nurses manage many chronic conditions, and in randomised controlled trials nurse-led care has been similar or superior to physician care. We did a proof-of-concept study involving 106 gout patients. When the patients were fully informed and involved in decision making, all wanted urate-lowering therapy and, after 1 year of nurse-led care, 92% had serum urate concentrations within the target range (\\<360 μmol/L \\[6 mg/dL\\]), which we based on national and international guidelines and recommendations,  and had started to show improvements in patient-centred outcomes. Our findings prompted us to do a randomised controlled trial in primary care over a period long enough to show improvements in patient-centred outcomes. The objectives were to compare the efficacy, including patient-centred outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led care, reflecting recommended best practice, with usual GP-led care of patients with gout over 2 years.\n\n【5】Methods 删除19:<u>{#cesec20}</u>\n=======\n\n【6】Study design and participants 删除19:<u>{#cesec30}</u>\n-----------------------------\n\n【7】We did a parallel arm, non-blinded randomised controlled trial in 56 East Midlands general practices that represented urban and rural settings around the Nottingham area. Each practice sent a questionnaire to adults (age \\>21 years) on their database who had a diagnosis of gout. Respondents who reported at least one gout flare in the previous 12 months and indicated willingness for further contact were sent information on the study which explained that nurses successfully manage many long-term conditions in primary care and that the aim of the trial was to assess how well gout would be managed over a 2-year period by specially trained nurses compared with GPs. Patients who were interested in participating returned a reply slip and were telephoned to ensure they fulfilled 1977 American College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria. Eligible patients were assessed in their GP surgery by a research nurse. Placement of a study advertisement in two Nottinghamshire newspapers was added to the study protocol as a further recruitment approach. People who responded to these advertisements were sent the questionnaire and those willing to participate underwent telephone screening and assessment in their homes. Exclusion criteria were not meeting the 1977 American College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria, inability to consent, and terminal or severe illness. After a protocol amendment, financial incentives were offered to unresponsive patients in the usual-care group in return for completing the questionnaire and attending the assessment at the end of year 2.\n\n【8】The study was approved by East Midlands Nottingham Research Ethics Committee (12/EM/0044). The University of Nottingham was the study sponsor (reference 11115). The [study protocol]删除19:<u>{#interrefs30}</u>, including amendments following commencement of the study, and the statistical analysis plan, are available online. All participants gave written informed consent.\n\n【9】Randomisation 删除19:<u>{#cesec40}</u>\n-------------\n\n【10】A randomisation schedule was created centrally by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, with a secure web-based system. Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive nurse-led care or GP-led usual care in randomly permuted blocks of two, four, or six, stratified by the clinical commissioning groups to which the general practices belonged (n=26). To enrol a patient in the study, a research nurse telephoned the trial coordination office in Academic Rheumatology, University of Nottingham, where a researcher accessed the online system to ascertain the next treatment allocation, which was given to the nurse during the telephone call. Patients were told their allocation by the nurse and their GP was informed by letter.\n\n【11】Intervention 删除19:<u>{#cesec50}</u>\n------------\n\n【12】Nurses received training about gout and its management that reflected national and international recommendations and was developed from qualitative research on illness perceptions and determination of the key elements to explaining gout that we had established in our previous proof-of-concept study ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). As part of an individualised package of care, the nurses provided patients with holistic assessment, discussion of illness perceptions, and full information on gout (nature, causes, associations, consequences, and treatment options), and encouraged them to share in decision making. Patients were given the Arthritis Research UK gout information booklet. Follow-up assessments and measurement of serum urate concentrations were done as often as required by the nurse. Telephone contact (eg to review serum urate results) could be substituted for face-to-face visits, and home visits were permitted (eg for older patients). Urate-lowering therapy was obtained from Nottingham City Hospital Pharmacy. As recommended,  first-line treatment was oral allopurinol, started at 100 mg once per day and titrated upwards in 100 mg increments every 3--4 weeks according to serum urate concentrations, to a maximum of 900 mg once per day. As second-line options, oral febuxostat could be started at 80 mg and if required increased to the maximum dose of 120 mg once per day or benzbromarone could be started at 50 mg and titrated up in 50 mg increments to a maximum of 200 mg once per day. Combination urate-lowering therapy (xanthine oxidase inhibitor plus uricosuric) could be used as the final treatment option. Colchicine as prophylaxis against gout flares could be considered. If the nurses had questions about gout management, they could seek advice from a study rheumatologist (MD, FR, or AA). All contacts with participants were logged.\n\n【13】Patients assigned to continue usual GP-led care were given the gout information booklet from Arthritis Research UK. Treatment of flares could be discussed by the research nurse at baseline and at yearly assessments, but if participants enquired about other aspects of management they were advised to ask their GP.\n\n【14】Assessments 删除19:<u>{#cesec60}</u>\n-----------\n\n【15】At baseline we recorded patients\\' self-reported age, sex, gout history (age at onset and flare frequency in the previous 12 months), medications, comorbidities, and quality of life (measured with the Short Form \\[36 item\\] general Health questionnaire \\[SF-36\\] and the Gout Assessment Questionnaire, which includes the Gout Impact Scale disease-specific quality of life measure). We also assessed patients by clinical examination at baseline to measure body-mass index and subcutaneous tophi (number, sites, and maximum diameter of the largest tophus measured with a Vernier caliper) and did blood tests to measure serum urate concentration and creatinine concentration to estimate glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【16】Patients in both study groups were given diaries in which to record flares.\n\n【17】Outcomes 删除19:<u>{#cesec70}</u>\n--------\n\n【18】The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had achieved serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L at 2 years. Secondary outcomes were other serum urate measures (percentage of patients who had achieved serum urate concentrations \\<360 μmol/L at 1 year, \\<300 μmol/L at 1 and 2 years, and group mean serum urate concentrations at 1 and 2 years); frequency of gout flares during years 1 and 2; the percentage of patients with tophi overall; the median number of tophi and the maximum diameter of the largest tophus at 1 and 2 years among patients with tophi at baseline; quality of life (physical and mental components) and Gout Impact Scale at 1 and 2 years; and cost-effectiveness, calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.\n\n【19】Statistical analysis 删除19:<u>{#cesec80}</u>\n--------------------\n\n【20】We initially calculated that an overall sample size of 724 patients would be needed to show a difference in quality of life between groups in this trial based on two Nottingham observational studies.  After we obtained data from our proof-of-concept study we revised the sample size estimate. For 90% power at a significance level of 0·05 (two-tailed), the sample size needed was 20 to show a difference in the percentage of patients achieving serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L (92% vs 13%), 166 to assess a difference in the frequency of acute flares (mean difference 2·4 \\[SD 2·3\\]), and 648 to assess a difference in quality of life (mean difference 0·74 \\[SD 2·9\\]). Owing to recruitment being slower than expected, we reduced the power to 80% at a significance level of 0·05 (two-tailed), changing the required sample sizes to 16, 124, and 486, respectively. Thus, we aimed to recruit 512 patients, allowing for 10% dropout over 2 years.\n\n【21】We compared groups at baseline and after 1 and 2 years by intention to treat with multiple imputation, assuming that data were missing at random. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method was used to impute missing continuous data, and a fully conditional specification model was used to impute missing dichotomous or categorical data. Missing values were imputed within each group with adjustment for the baseline level of the imputed variable, serum urate concentration, use of urate-lowering treatment, age, and number of flares. We did a per-protocol analysis involving patients who completed 2 years of treatment to test sensitivity.\n\n【22】We used ANCOVA to analyse continuous variables (between-group comparisons and tests for linear trend). Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CIs were calculated for dichotomous data with Poisson regression. We adjusted all analyses for the baseline level of the outcome assessed. A repeated-measures analysis was used to assess linear trends for effect of time from baseline to 1 year and 2 years. We used the GLM procedure in SAS  with three time points (baseline, 1 year, and 2 years) to handle multilevel data and to adjust for cluster effects within individuals.\n\n【23】The cost-effectiveness analysis was done with a National Health Service perspective and a lifetime horizon. A state transition model was constructed based on four serum urate concentration ranges (\\<360 μmol/L, ≥360 to \\<480 μmol/L, ≥480 to \\<600 μmol/L, and ≥600 μmol/L). To reduce stochasticity in the model we assumed that the flare rates per range of serum urate concentrations would be constant within each of the periods 0--6 months, 7--12 months, and 13--24 months. These values were calculated as the number of flares divided by the number of patient-months of follow-up during a period. Beyond 24 months we assumed that the flare rates per range of serum urate concentration would be independent of initial management and set the values to the average nurse-led and usual-care values between 12 and 24 months.\n\n【24】The cost of the management of gout flares was estimated according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) review of treatment with pegloticase. We did a sensitivity analyses in which we lowered the cost per flare (from £341 to £50) and added nurse time for reviewing patients (an extra 30 min per 6 months) in years 3 and 4 ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). We also did a post-hoc analysis that made pessimistic assumptions regarding the efficacy of the nurse-led approach, in which the flare rates were increased by 20% in the first 2 years and the split of patients across the serum urate concentration ranges at the end of year 2 was altered ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). The model was simplistic and typically unfavourable to the nurse-led treatment, for example, it ignored the effects of tophi, assumed that longer-term flare rates within each serum urate concentration band are independent of treatment strategy, and that crystals did not dissolve in patients with serum urate concentrations maintained below 360 μmol/L. Finally, we did a post-hoc comparison of participants with renal impairment (defined as chronic kidney disease stage 3 \\[estimated glomerular filtration rate \\<60 mL/min per 1·73 m^2^\\]) and those without renal impairment in the nurse-led group to investigate the percentages of patients taking urate-lowering therapy, with serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L, and with side-effects while taking urate-lowering therapy. We used the χ^2^ test for comparison between groups.\n\n【25】This study is registered with 通用删除8(英):<u>[www.ClinicalTrials.gov]</u>删除19:<u>{#interrefs40}</u>, number 通用删除8(英):<u>[NCT01477346]</u>删除19:<u>{#interrefs50}</u>.\n\n【26】Role of the funding source 删除19:<u>{#cesec90}</u>\n--------------------------\n\n【27】The funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

The differences between groups at 1 and 2 years reflect a mean decrease of 183 μmol/L in the first 3 months of treatment in the nurse-led group that was sustained compared with reductions of around 10 μmol/L achieved by each of years 1 and 2 in the usual-care group.Table 2Dichotomous efficacy outcomesNurse-led care (n=255)Usual care (n=262)Risk ratio (95% CI)Serum urate concentration \\<360 μmol/LBaseline22·35%21·46%1·04 (0·72--1·51)1 year94·75%26·22%3·59 (2·72--4·75)2 years94·88%29·71%3·18 (2·42--4·18)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·0757.Serum urate concentration \\<300 μmol/LBaseline8·63%10·34%0·83 (0·48--1·46)1 year87·42%13·75%6·46 (4·46--9·34)2 years88·05%17·46%5·11 (3·61--7·23)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·0387.Taking urate-lowering therapyBaseline39·61%38·93%1·02 (0·77--1·34)1 year96·70%46·83%2·06 (1·65--2·57)2 years96·10%56·13%1·71 (1·38--2·11)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·0053.Two or more flaresBaseline79·92%79·77%1·00 (0·83--1·22)1 year53·99%39·82%1·36 (1·05--1·77)2 years8·00%24·29%0·33 (0·19--0·57)p for trend within group\\<0·0001\\<0·0001.Four or more flaresBaseline38·04%35·11%1·08 (0·82--1·44)1 year27·92%20·76%1·33 (0·92--1·92)2 years1·15%12·39%0·09 (0·02--0·36)p for trend within group\\<0·0001\\<0·0001.Presence of tophiBaseline13·73%8·78%1·56 (0·92--2·65)1 year7·06%10·15%0·53 (0·28--1·02)2 years2·85%11·29%0·21 (0·08--0·52)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·4145.[^4]Table 3Continuous efficacy outcomesNurse-led care (n=255)Usual care (n=262)Mean difference (95% CI)Serum urate concentration (μmol/L)Baseline443·07 (100·50)438·85 (98·17)4·22 (−12·97 to 21·40)1 year250·56 (60·59)427·87 (103·65)178·86 (164·80 to 192·92)2 years251·52 (72·15)421·13 (109·62)170·98 (154·37 to 187·58)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·0647Number of tophiBaseline2 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--4)</u>2 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--3)</u>0·28 (−2·89 to 3·45)1 year1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--3)</u>1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--2)</u>2·19 (0·77 to 3·61)2 years1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--1)</u>1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1--2)</u>2·06 (0·94 to 3·19)p for trend within group0·00100·3784.Diameter of largest tophus (mm)Baseline16·89 (14·08)20·09 (13·25)−3·20 (−10·73 to 4·32)1 year7·53 (11·34)16·54 (16·27)7·18 (1·08 to 13·28)2 years3·29 (7·89)13·61 (15·06)8·77 (3·75 to 13·79)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·1478.SF-36 scorePhysical componentBaseline35·64 (14·20)35·48 (14·29)0·16 (−2·31 to 2·62)1 year40·46 (14·10)36·54 (14·21)3·82 (1·88 to 5·76)2 years41·01 (16·71)37·43 (14·80)3·48 (1·20 to 5·75)p for trend within group\\<0·00010·1371.Mental componentBaseline51·44 (10·47)52·81 (10·35)1·37 (0·43 to 3·17)1 year53·46 (8·99)54·01 (9·33)0·21 (−1·14 to 1·56)2 years52·92 (14·34)54·02 (9·26)0·22 (−1·62 to 2·07)p for trend within group0·15820·1658.Gout Impact Scale scoreGout concern overallBaseline71·56 (23·61)68·51 (23·14)3·31 (−0·71 to 7·33)1 year48·78 (25·05)57·79 (26·53)10·66 (6·39 to 14·93)2 year37·54 (24·97)53·62 (27·02)17·54 (13·15 to 21·94)p for trend within group\\<0·0001\\<0·0001.Unmet gout treatment needBaseline44·33 (21·81)43·19 (21·62)1·14 (−2·62 to 4·90)Year-125·62 (18·16)36·29 (18·81)11·00 (7·71 to 14·30)Year-221·03 (15·93)33·71 (19·67)12·88 (9·58 to 16·19)p for trend within group\\<0·0001\\<0·0001.[^5]Figure 2Mean (95% CI) serum urate concentrations throughout the studyData in the usual-care group were only available at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years but serum urate monitoring data recorded in follow-up visits were available in the nurse-led group.Figure 3Serum urate concentration, number of flares and presence of tophi at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years(A) Mean (95% CI) serum urate concentration. (B) Mean (95% CI) number of flares. (C) Proportion of patients with any tophi.\n\n【33】Use of urate-lowering therapy increased in both groups but was significantly higher in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care group at 1 and 2 years ([table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). In the nurse-led group, based on multiple imputations, 97% and 96% of patients were taking urate-lowering therapy at 1 year and 2 years, respectively, compared with 47% and 56%, respectively, in the usual-care group. Most patients were taking allopurinol (84% vs 96%). Doses of allopurinol were greater than 300 mg/day in 80% patients in the nurse-led group at 1 year and in 79% at 2 years, compared with 11% and 10%, respectively, in the usual-care group ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). The mean dose at 2 years in the nurse-led group was 460 mg/day compared with 230 mg/day in the usual-care group. Among the patients taking other urate-lowering therapy, febuxostat was being taken by more patients in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care group at 2 years (14% vs 3%). Only four patients in the nurse-led group and one in the usual-care group were receiving uricosurics at 2 years and none required combination urate-lowering therapy. Only three participants in the nurse-led group elected to receive colchicine prophylaxis against gout during the titration phase of urate-lowering therapy.\n\n【34】In the nurse-led group 24 (10%) patients discontinued urate-lowering therapy, among whom 12 did so due to one or more side-effects (rash or pruritus n=4; reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate n=4; gastrointestinal upset n=2; arthralgia n=2; systemic upset, including fatigue and sweating n=2; reduced libido n=1; and breast tenderness, flushes, and cramps n=1) and the remainder because of no perceived benefit and wish for different treatment (n=8), no response to urate-lowering therapy after titration (n=3), and cessation during chemotherapy (n=1). All side-effects resolved within 1 week of stopping treatment. All 24 patients wished to receive an alternative urate-lowering regimen and were successfully taking treatment by the end of year 1, including two patients who had second regimen changes.\n\n【35】Equivalent surveillance and monitoring of side-effects were not available in the usual care group. Two (1%) participants reported side-effects attributed to allopurinol that led to discontinuation, and neither was started on another urate-lowering regimen. A post-hoc comparison of patients with and without renal impairment in the nurse-led group showed no difference after 2 years among those taking urate-lowering therapy (50 \\[94%\\] of 58 with renal impairment vs 171 \\[97%\\] of 191 without renal impairment), those achieving serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol/L (50 \\[94%\\] vs 168 \\[95%\\]) or less than 300 μmol/L (46 \\[87%\\] vs 156 \\[89%\\]), or those who had had side-effects associated with allopurinol (eight \\[14%\\] vs 15 \\[8%\\]).\n\n【36】Flare frequency reduced gradually from baseline to 2 years in both groups (p\\<0·0001 for trend, [table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, 通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The risk of having two or more flares per year was higher in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care group at 1 year but had become much lower after 2 years ([table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). A similar pattern was observed for risk of four or more flares ([table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【37】The risk of having any tophi was similar in the two treatment groups at baseline, but number of patients with tophi reduced from 35 (14%) at baseline to six (3%) at 2 years in the nurse-led group, whereas no change was seen in the usual-care group ([table 2]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>, 通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 3]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The median number of tophi fell in the nurse-led group (p\\<0·0010 for trend, [table 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) and at years 1 and 2 the numbers of tophi were lower than in the usual-care group (p\\<0·0001 and p=0·0090, respectively; [table 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The mean diameter of the largest tophus was significantly smaller among patients in the nurse-led group than among those in the usual-care group at years 1 and 2 ([table 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【38】In a post-hoc per-protocol analysis, the relationship between serum urate concentrations and clinical outcomes was assessed in tertiles of serum urate concentrations at 2 years in all patients who completed the study (lowest \\<247 μmol/L, middle 248--365 μmol/L, and highest \\>365 μmol/L). The percentages of participants experiencing flares during year 2 were 7%, 10%, and 29%, respectively, for two or more (p\\<0·0001 for trend) and 1%, 3%, and 14%, respectively, for four or more (p\\<0·0001 for trend), and the percentages of patients with tophi at the end of year 2 were 2%, 6%, and 10%, respectively (p=0·0050 for trend).\n\n【39】The SF-36 physical component, but not the mental component, significantly improved in the nurse-led group but did not change in the usual-care group ([table 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). Mean scores were significantly better in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care group at 1 year (p\\<0·0010) and 2 years (p=0·0027). Gout Impact Scale scores improved significantly in both groups, for the overall and unmet needs components ([table 3]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) but were better in the nurse-led group at 1 and 2 years (both p\\<0·0001).\n\n【40】Participants in the nurse-led group attended a mean of 9·3 visits (SD 2·2) and had a mean of 8·3 (3·2) telephone calls about gout, mostly occurring in the first year of treatment, and mainly in the first 6 months of treatment ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). Patients in the usual-care group visited GPs a mean of 0·6 times (SD 1·4) specifically for gout during the 2-year study period.\n\n【41】When assessed per protocol, results for all primary and secondary outcomes did not differ qualitatively from those in the intention-to-treat dataset ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>).\n\n【42】The cost per QALY gained for nurse-led care at 2 years was £5066 and was modelled to be £286 at 3 years. We calculated that nurse-led care would produce 2% more health than usual care and cost £1726 less per QALY gained at 5 years, and would produce 3% more health gain and cost £2783 less per QALY gained at 10 years. If the cost of gout flares were decreased, the cost per QALY gained would rise to £6144 at 3 years, £3578 at 5 years, and £2425 at 10 years, but remained cost-effective given the NICE threshold of £20 000 ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>). The inclusion of additional nurse time did not substantially alter the cost per QALY gained value at 3 years (increase £520), and at 5 years and beyond the nurse-led approach led to cost savings. Even with the model of extremely unfavourable efficacy, the cost per QALY gained was £5011 at 3 years and £648 at 5 years, and became cost saving at 10 years ([appendix]删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"sec\"}</u>).\n\n【43】Discussion 删除19:<u>{#cesec110}</u>\n==========\n\n【44】Nurse-led care of people with gout in the UK community can achieve high uptake of urate-lowering therapy and adherence over 2 years. 95% of participants in the nurse-led group achieved the recommended target serum urate concentration of less than 360 μmol/L, and patient-centred outcomes, including flare frequency, presence of tophi, and quality of life, improved significantly compared with those in the usual-care group. This study strongly reaffirms the importance of education and engagement of patients in disease management and the usefulness of a treat-to-target strategy. As well as clinical benefits to patients with gout, the cost per QALY gained was far below the standard NICE threshold of £20 000 and started to save costs at 5 years. A similar pattern was seen even in an extremely unfavourable efficacy model and when the cost of managing gout flares was substantially reduced.\n\n【45】To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to compare nurse-led gout care with usual GP-led care. The key differences from usual care in the nurse-led approach in this study were the time spent explaining gout and making the explanations individualised and easy to understand, addressing illness perceptions, and involving patients in shared decision making. Although education and engagement are thought to be professional responsibilities and core elements of care, they are often suboptimum in gout management, which possibly reflects misconceptions and poor understanding of gout by physicians,  and time constraints on health-care delivery. The role of non-physician health-care professionals in providing gout education has been examined in two US pilot studies. One assessed pharmacist-assisted management of urate-lowering therapy for 100 patients referred by primary care physicians and the other assessed nurse-delivered education plus pharmacist telephone calls in 45 patients referred to hospital-based rheumatologists. As with our pilot study of nurse-led care, the two US studies reported good acceptability and benefits to patients from education irrespective of the health professionals involved. In a later US randomised controlled trial involving 77 patients, pharmacist-led, telephone-based management of urate lowering therapy was compared with usual care led by primary physicians. At 26 weeks, 13 (35%) of 37 patients in the pharmacist-led group compared with five (14%) of 40 in the physician-led group had serum urate less than 360 μmol/L.\n\n【46】Strengths of our study are that it was a randomised controlled trial with a usual-care comparator and that it was done in the community, where most gout patients are managed. Additionally, we followed up patients for 2 years and the study was powered to show differences between groups in patient-centred outcomes. The patients included were typical of those encountered in clinical practice, with many having associated comorbidities (eg, being overweight or obese or having cardiovascular disease) and around 20% had renal insufficiency (chronic kidney disease stage 3), yet were able to achieve optimum clinical outcomes with nurse-led care. Furthermore, retention in this group was 91% at 2 years and adherence to urate-lowering therapy was the best reported in clinical trials of gout. These findings probably reflect the importance of education and engagement of patients, but also regular follow-up and positive patient--practitioner interactions. A qualitative study to assess the various elements of care in relation to outcomes has been done in 30 of the patients in this study who were sampled 18--26 months after study end, and results will be published separately.\n\n【47】Several aspects of nurse-delivered treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy deserve emphasis. First, allopurinol doses were higher in the nurse-led group than in the usual-care group (mean 460 mg/day vs 230 mg/day), and in the UK overall, where prescriptions rarely exceed 300 mg/day. These higher doses were needed to improve outcomes. Suboptimum dosing in the usual-care group might reflect physician inertia, lack of a treat-to-target strategy, poor monitoring of serum urate concentrations,  and concerns over safety of and adherence to urate-lowering therapy. Febuxostat was a successful alternative urate-lowering therapy, uricosurics were needed infrequently, and no patient needed combined therapy. Second, only three participants elected to receive prophylaxis against gout flares during the titration phase at the start of urate-lowering therapy.  This low uptake might explain the slightly higher flare frequency in the nurse-led group in year 1 than in the usual-care group, but adherence was not affected, which suggests that prophylaxis might not be needed if up titration is done slowly. Third, 99% of patients in the nurse-led group, when fully informed about treatment options, wanted to start urate-lowering therapy. This finding challenges the recommendations to reserve such treatment for patients with severe gout. Some guidelines that support full education about gout, including urate-lowering therapy, at time of diagnosis,  are moving towards early definitive treatment rather than waiting until gout is severe. A similar paradigm has been applied to rheumatoid and other inflammatory arthritides. Finally, the American College of Physicians has advised doctors to not use treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy because they found no evidence of benefits to patient. However, their treat-to-avoid-symptoms strategy, which ignores serum urate concentrations and engagement of patients, is not clearly explained, and the approach is not supported by evidence. If that strategy is taken to approximate the usual-care situation in our GP-led group, our study supports treat to target.  The improved patient-centred outcomes we saw in the nurse-led group at 2 years and clear relationships between tertiles of serum urate concentration at the end of the study and flare frequency in year 2 and presence of tophi at the end of the study further refute the American College of Physicians advice.\n\n【48】This study has limitations. First, recruitment might have been subject to selection bias if participating practices were interested in gout. Likewise, if people concerned about gout were more likely to participate, the population might have been subject to response bias. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients taking urate-lowering therapy at baseline (39%) is representative of the UK,  and neither bias would diminish or enhance between-group differences. Second, blinding of the intervention was not possible, which might have affected the behaviour of GPs and participants in the usual-care group (eg, GPs more actively managing the gout of patients known to be in the study or patients feeling encouraged to consult more after receiving the gout information from a nurse and booklet at baseline). Certainly, use of urate-lowering therapy increased from 39% to 56% in the usual-care group, but allopurinol doses remained low and mean serum urate concentrations did not improve. Therefore, any behaviour changes did not importantly affect results and, if anything, would have diminished between-group differences. Third, because crystal identification was not required for the diagnosis of gout, some patients might have been misclassified. This diagnostic method is, however, rarely used by GPs and should not affect between-group differences. Misclassification might also have occurred through patients self-reporting flares without requirement for specific clinical criteria or assessment and irrespective of any modification by rapid self-treatment. Again, though, this factor should not have altered between-group differences. Fourth, although the study lasted 2 years, longer observation would be useful to allow sufficient time to eliminate all sodium urate crystals and assess people through to true remission. Fifth, the study was done in just one UK region, and generalisability of the findings remains to be determined. Similarly, this care model might not suit countries with less well established nurse-led care. However, providing that patients are fully informed and engaged and a treat-to-target strategy is used for urate-lowering therapy, our findings are likely to be generalisable to any practitioner who delivers the care. Finally, we trained research nurses rather than practice-based nurses. This caveat will be addressed in a future research-to-implementation study.\n\n【49】Community-based nurse-led care involving education and engagement of patients and a treat-to-target strategy for urate-lowering therapy achieved target serum urate concentrations and improved patient-centred outcomes in more than 90% of patients with gout. Compared with usual GP-led care, this model was cost-effective and potentially cost-saving, and merits further consideration in the UK. Our results highlight the importance and success of individualised education and care of patients, a principle that should be considered by any health-care professional who manages people with gout.\n\n【50】Data sharing statement 删除19:<u>{#cesec111}</u>\n======================\n\n【51】Deidentified patients\\' data can be requested by researchers for use in independent scientific research and will be provided following review and approval of the research proposal (including statistical analysis plan) and completion of a data sharing agreement with the University of Nottingham.

Introduction 删除19:<u>{#sec1}</u>\n===============\n\n【1】Methods of topical fluoride application include professional topical application and home use of fluoride dentifrice and fluoride mouth rinse. Professional topical application is a means of preventing dental caries in both deciduous and permanent teeth and is performed by dental specialists (dentists and dental hygienists) in dental clinics, health care facilities, and other appropriate settings specializing in dental care. Advantages of professional topical fluoride application include the ability to treat patients starting from a very young age, immediately after the deciduous anterior teeth erupted, in addition to the fact that application is necessary only two to four times a year. In addition, the ingestion of fluoride from the professional topical fluoride application is not considered to be a risk factor in dental fluorosis \\[\\]. The fluoride agents in professional topical application are available in liquid, gel, and foam types. Because the gel and foam are generally applied using a tray, these have an advantage in that the fluoride can be applied to all of the teeth simultaneously \\[\\]. In the United States and a number of other countries, the tray method using acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) foam is widely used, and the foam application procedure, including the amount of foam used, is standardized \\[\\]. In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare has issued \"Guidelines Governing Professional Topical Application of Fluoride,\" which describes a method for applying the neutral and acidic NaF liquids that were initially introduced in Japan in the 1960s \\[\\]. A method for applying APF gel, which was subsequently introduced in the 1980s, has also been established based on fundamental research on factors, such as the amount of gel to be used and the residual amount in the oral cavity \\[--\\]. Strongly acidic APF has an advantage in that a large amount of uptake into the tooth substance can be expected, but there are also reports expressing concerns about damage occurring to several types of restorative material \\[--\\]. These reports underscore the necessity for topical application of neutral NaF, and as a result, neutral NaF foam is now available on the market in Japan. However, no information is currently available on aspects such as methods for applying this neutral NaF foam or the amount of foam that remains in the oral cavity after application.\n\n【2】2. Materials and Methods 删除19:<u>{#sec2}</u>\n========================\n\n【3】2.1. Experiment  1: Investigation of Appropriate Amount of NaF Foam Using Dentition Study Models 删除19:<u>{#sec2.1}</u>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】First, various amounts of foam (Butler Fluodent Foam N, Sunstar Inc. Osaka, Japan) in the deciduous and permanent dentition study model trays (Butler Tray, Sunstar Inc. Osaka, Japan) were prepared to apply to the deciduous and permanent dentition study models (Study model PE-ANA004 and Study model PE-ANA002, respectively, Nissin Dental Products Inc. Kyoto, Japan) \\[\\]. The trays were the accompanying items of the 2% neutral NaF foam. They were made of styrene foam, unlined type. Initially, the weight of tray without the foam was measured by an electronic balance (LIBROR AEG-45SM, SHIMAZU Co. Kyoto, Japan), then the foam was placed, and the total weight was measured. The amount of fluoride foam was calculated by subtraction of the weight of tray from the total weight.\n\n【5】To sufficiently cover all the dried teeth surfaces of the study models and to minimize leakage outside of the dentition, the appropriate amount of foam (AAF) was filled to be adjusted to a level approximately 2 mm below the tray. Using the deciduous and permanent dentition study models, the foam was applied for a 4-minute period. After the foam application, the tray was removed from the study model immediately, and the net weight of foam remained in the tray (TRF: tray-remained foam) and the net weight foam adhering to the study model were measured, respectively. Then the foam adhering the area of mucosa of study model was wiped with a wiping paper (Kimwipe S-200, NIPPON PAPER CRECIA Co. LTD, Tokyo, Japan ), and the net weight of foam adhering to the surface of study model (TRSF: tooth-surface retained foam) was measured. The weight difference between above study models was defined as overflowed foam (OF). Each of these was measured 10 times.\n\n【6】2.2. Experiment  2: Changes over Time in Fluoride Concentration in Saliva following NaF Foam Application 删除19:<u>{#sec2.2}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Based on the procedure of experiment 1, an application experiment was carried out in human subjects. Eight healthy participants (three males and five females), ranging in age from 21.3 to 24.8 years, were recruited from the students at Kanagawa Dental College. The mean (±SD) age of the subjects was 22.6 ± 1.3 years. Each subject signed the informed consent form, which had been approved by the Ethics Committee of Kanagawa Dental College 通用删除1(英):<u>(No. 44)</u>.\n\n【8】The inclusion criteria in this study were: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> with at least 28 natural teeth; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> unstimulated saliva flow rate \\> 0.3 mL/min; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> no orthodontic appliance in their oral cavity.

The experiment began at 2:00 p.m. Before the NaF foam was applied to subjects, their teeth were dried with the compressed air. The trays were filled with NaF foam to a level approximately 2 mm below the edge of the trays and were placed over the teeth, the subject was instructed to close the jaws with the trays in contact for 4 minutes. The subject was instructed not to swallow but to allow the saliva to dribble into a 500-mL plastic beaker held directly under the mouth. At the end of the topical application, the trays were removed from the mouth and placed in the same beaker, and the subject expectorated the mixture of saliva and foam into the same beaker immediately after removal of the tray and expectorated once again 30 seconds later. Whole saliva was collected into a separate 50-mL plastic vessel for 5 minutes a total of eight times (immediately prior to application, 5 minutes afterwards, 15 minutes afterwards, 30 minutes afterwards, 60 minutes afterwards, 120 minutes afterwards, before the subjects went to bed, and immediately after they awoke the following day).\n\n【10】The saliva samples obtained up to 30 minutes afterwards were diluted by double-deionized water at the ratio of 1 : 10, and others were not diluted. Total ionic strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) (TISAB II, Orion Research Inc. Beverly, Mass, USA) were added to all saliva samples as the ratio of 1 : 1, and the fluoride concentration of saliva was analyzed as ppm using the ion-specific electrode (Orion 9609BNWP combination electrode, Thermo Electron Corp. Beverly, Mass, USA).\n\n【11】2.3. Experiment  3: Amount of Residual Fluoride in the Oral Cavity following Application of NaF Foam 删除19:<u>{#sec2.3}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】As in Experiment  2, NaF foam was applied for 4 minutes using the same procedure. The subject was instructed not to swallow but to allow the saliva to dribble into a 500-mL plastic beaker held directly under the mouth. At the end of the topical application, the trays were removed from the mouth and placed in the plastic beaker, and the subject expectorated the mixture of saliva and foam into the same beaker and expectorated once again 30 seconds later. Total amount of 500 mL double-deionized water was added to the beaker. The solution was stirred by the magnetic stirrer until no traces of the foam were visible. Then the solution was analyzed for fluoride concentration using the ion-specific electrode (Orion 9609BNWP combination electrode, Thermo Electron Corp. Beverly, Mass, USA).\n\n【13】The total amount of fluoride recovered to the oral cavity was calculated as the product of the fluoride concentration and volume. The weight of residual fluoride was calculated by subtracting the weight recovered from the weight applied.\n\n【14】In addition, the ratio of residual fluoride in the oral cavity was determined from the percentage of fluoride remaining in the oral cavity in relation to the amount of fluoride used.\n\n【15】2.4. Statistical Analysis 删除19:<u>{#sec2.4}</u>\n-------------------------\n\n【16】The data are expressed as mean ± SD. The test of population mean for the fluoride concentrations in saliva following the foam application and the test of coefficient of correlations between with AAF, TRF, TRSF, and OF in the study models were analyzed (JMP, ver. 8, SAS institute Japan, Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). An alpha of 0.5 was selected a priori as the indicator for statistical significance.\n\n【17】3. Results 删除19:<u>{#sec3}</u>\n==========\n\n【18】3.1. Experiment  1: Investigation of the Appropriate Amount of NaF Foam Using Dentition Study Models 删除19:<u>{#sec3.1}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Using deciduous and permanent dentition study models, we found that in order to sufficiently cover the dentition when applying the NaF foam and to minimize leakage outside of the dentition, the tray needed to be filled to a level approximately 2 mm below the tray edge. Using this method, we applied NaF foam 10 times to deciduous and permanent dentition study models. The results showed significant variation in mean appropriate amount of foam (AAF); that of the deciduous dentition study model was 0.57 ± 0.17 (0.36--0.86) g (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), while that of the permanent dentition study model was 0.96 ± 0.24 (0.68--1.39) g (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). The mean of the amount of foam retained on the tooth surfaces (TSRF: tooth-surface-retained foam) of the deciduous and permanent dentition study models were 0.03 ± 0.01 (0.01--0.05) g and 0.12 ± 0.06 (0.03--0.20) g, respectively, 删除21:<u>(Tables 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> and 删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>)</u>.\n\n【20】Analysis of the coefficient of correlations between the appropriate amount of foam (AAF) and the amount of foam adhering to and recovered from the tray (TRF: tray-retained foam), AAF and the amount of foam adhering to the mucosa other than the tooth surface on the models (OF: overflowed foam), and AAF and the tooth surface retained foam (TSRF) showed a strong positive correlation between AAF and TRF and between AAF and OF in both the deciduous and permanent dentition study models (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>).\n\n【21】3.2. Experiment  2: Changes over Time in Fluoride Concentration in Saliva following NaF Foam Application 删除19:<u>{#sec3.2}</u>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The mean amount of NaF foam applied in each adult subjects was 0.81 ± 0.20 (0.54--1.12) g. The mean fluoride concentration in saliva following application was 35.95 ± 28.84 (7.48--85.80) ppm, which was the maximum value 5 minutes after application, and by 30 minutes after application had dropped sharply. It continued to drop gradually thereafter, but the concentration of fluoride in saliva measured at the time subjects awoke the following morning was relatively high, at 0.12 ppm (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). There were significantly differences in salivary fluoride concentrations up to 120 min following the application compared with 0.05 ppm as criterion value (test of population mean, P \\< .05).\n\n【23】3.3. Experiment  3: Amount of Residual Fluoride in the Oral Cavity following Application of NaF Foam 删除19:<u>{#sec3.3}</u>\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【24】The mean amount of NaF foam used was 0.80 ± 0.22 (0.56--1.16) g. The mean amount of fluoride used was 7.18 ± 1.94 (5.00--10.47) mg, and the mean amount of fluoride used per kilogram body weight was 0.14 ± 0.04 (0.09--0.19) mg F/kg. The amount of fluoride recovered was 5.44 ± 1.75 (3.65--8.70) mg, and the amount and ratio of residual fluoride in the oral cavity after foam application were 1.74 ± 0.47 (1.32--2.44) mg and 24.9 ± 5.80 (16.9--34.40) %, respectively. The amount of residual fluoride in the oral cavity per kilogram body weight was 0.033 ± 0.012 (0.017--0.053) mg F/kg (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). A strong correlation was observed between the amount of fluoride used per kilogram body weight and the amount of residual fluoride in the oral cavity per kilogram body weight (r = 0.71,  P \\< .05).\n\n【25】4. Discussion 删除19:<u>{#sec4}</u>\n=============\n\n【26】The fluoride agents in professional topical application are available in liquid, gel, and foam types. Currently, the fluoride agents in professional topical application are available in liquid or gel types in Japan. Accompanying documentation specifies that the amount of professional topical application to be used is 2 mL or less using the paint-on technique \\[\\]. This applies when a liquid or a gel is used but does not apply to foams.\n\n【27】In an experiment conducted by Whitford et al. \\[\\] in 46 children between the ages of 8 and 12 years, the appropriate amount of APF foam or APF gel used to cover the dentition without leaking into the oral cavity was one-third the depth of the tray, which was 0.89 ± 0.02 g of foam and 3.86 ± 0.06 g of gel. With these results, the amount of foam needed to sufficiently cover the dental surface was 23.1% that of gel. Moreover, in research by Arakawa et al. \\[\\] using APF gel, the amount of gel used with a deciduous dentition study model was 2.13 ± 0.77 g and that for a permanent dentition study model was 3.94 ± 1.38 g, while the amounts of residual gel on the dental surface after wiping away gel that had leaked from the dentition study models were 0.06 ± 0.03 g and 0.18 ± 0.08 g, respectively. In our experiment, we initially prepared enough foam to reach the tray edge, meaning an amount of foam equivalent to the capacity of the tray. When the prepared foam was applied to the study model, a large amount of foam overflowed from the tray and the model. As a result, it was determined that the appropriate amount of foam should be filled to be a level approximately 2 mm below the edge of the tray. The mean amount of foam used with the deciduous dentition study model was 0.57 (0.36--0.86) g (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>) and that with the permanent dentition study model was 0.96 (0.68--1.40) g (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). These are 26.7% and 24.9%, respectively, of the amounts of gel reported by Arakawa et al. \\[\\] and are largely consistent with the results reported by Whitford et al. \\[\\]. For the amounts of foam remaining on tooth surfaces, the results were 0.03 (0.01--0.05) g for the deciduous dentition study model and 0.12 (0.03--0.20) g for the permanent dentition study model (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>), which was approximately half the amount of gel reported by Arakawa et al.\n\n【28】In the present experiments, the variations in the appropriate amount of foam were comparatively wide, even though the tray was filled with foam to a level approximately 2 mm below the tray edge, using the same study model and using foam from the same container. The reason of this phenomenon is not clear.\n\n【29】In Experiments  2 and 3, the tray was filled with foam to a level approximately 2 mm below the tray edge. The mean amount of foam used for the eight adult subjects was approximately the same, 0.80 g. This was largely consistent with the amount of foam used by Whitford et al. \\[\\]. This result suggests that with the neutral NaF foam used in the present experiments, the amount used can be set at a lower amount than that for gel. In research conducted by Sudo et al. \\[\\], in which APF gel was applied using the toothbrush method in subjects 1.5 years of age, the mean amount of gel applied was 0.66 g, and the mean amount of residual fluoride in the oral cavity per kilogram body weight was 0.19 mg/kg. The mean residual ratio was 25.8%. In our experiments, the mean amount of residual fluoride in the oral cavity following application of NaF foam was 1.74 mg, and the amount per kilogram body weight was 0.033 mg/kg, with a mean residual ratio of 24.9% (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u>). Comparing the results of this study, the residual ratios in our experiments were largely the same, but because our experiments targeted adult subjects, the residual amount of fluoride per kilogram body weight was extremely small. The amount of fluoride that causes acute toxicity is 1.35 to 1.8 mg/kg or higher \\[\\]. The results of our experiment indicate that the maximum value would be 0.16 mg/kg, even in a child weighing 15 kg; therefore, this amount assures adequate safety.\n\n【30】Where the application of highly acidic dental coatings such as APF is cited as possibly causing corrosion of dental restorative materials such as glass-containing resin composites, glass-ionomer cement, and porcelain, 0.9% neutral NaF foam is reported to have little effect on surface hardness of the materials \\[, \\]. Moreover, in patients who have restorative materials, use of a neutral NaF coating is recommended in order to avoid corrosion, discoloration, and other problems with the restorative materials \\[\\].\n\n【31】Earlier studies have reported that when fluoride products such as dentifrice, rinse, and gels are used, a high fluoride concentration in the saliva was initially obtained, subsequently it dramatically reduced with time \\[, \\]. The results of this research showed that the concentration of fluoride in saliva immediately following foam application was extremely high and still be elevated at 1.2 ppm F in the next morning (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>通用删除1(英):<u></u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"fig\"}</u>). The retention of fluoride in saliva may be very important in the prevention or reversal of caries. It has been proven that low levels of fluoride (0.03--0.5 mg/L) in saliva are sufficient to effectively inhibit demineralisation and/or enhance remineralisation of enamel \\[\\]. It seems that this 2% neutral NaF foam is effective in prevention of caries immediately after the application because the salivary fluoride concentration up to 120 min is higher than 0.05 ppm.\n\n【32】Based on the results of the research described here, using a 2% neutral NaF foam enables application using the tray method with smaller amounts of fluoride. Another advantage that follows is that less fluoride is ingested into the body. Foam types of fluoride agents are readily dispersed within the oral cavity and are easier to apply than other forms, even when patients have fixed orthodontic appliances present. Furthermore, in vitro research has shown no significant differences between APF gel and foam in the amount of uptake into enamel, and while foam could provide an effect similar to that of gel in terms of preventing dental caries \\[, \\], there has not yet been any clinical research showing that the professional topical application of fluoride using 2% neutral NaF foam prevents dental caries.\n\n【33】In this research, the number of subjects might not be enough large, it caused the large values of standard deviation in the results. Further research which included not only adults but also children as subjects is necessary to investigate the appropriate frequency of use and the effects in preventing dental caries.\n\n【34】5. Conclusions 删除19:<u>{#sec5}</u>\n==============\n\n【35】The present results found the following:\n\n【36】1.  When carrying out professional topical fluoride application using 2% neutral NaF foam with a dedicated tray, filling the tray with foam to a level approximately 2 mm below the tray edge was appropriate, and this amount made it possible to adequately cover all the dentition.\n\n【37】2.  The appropriate amount of 2% neutral NaF foam used for permanent dentition was approximately 0.8 g on average, which was approximately one-fifth the amount of gel ordinarily used with the tray method.\n\n【38】3.  The residual ratio of fluoride in the oral cavity following a 4-minute application of 2% neutral NaF foam was approximately 25% of the amount of foam used, and a strong correlation was observed between the amount of fluoride used per kilogram body weight and the amount of residual fluoride in the oral cavity per kilogram body weight.\n\n【39】![Changes over time in fluoride concentration in saliva following 2% neutral NaF foam application.

A developmental view.\nA decline in the capacity of bone marrow cells to differentiate to T lymphocytes was found when cells from young and old donors were seeded onto an alymphoid fetal thymus. A step-by-step analysis of cell-cell interactions of the lymphohemopoietic cells and the thymic stroma indicated an effect of age on a variety of cell differentiation parameters. These included a decrease in the affinity of bone marrow cells to the stroma, and in their capacity to compete with the thymic lymphoid resident cells on colonization of the thymus. There was a significant decrease in the ability of cells of old donors to replicate sequentially within the thymic microenvironment. There was a reduced capacity of bone marrow cells from aging mice to express a developmental preference after seeding onto a syngeneic fetal thymus in a mixture with cells from allogeneic donors. We addressed the question whether the aging thymus contains increased levels of immature cells that fail to differentiate in the involuted thymic microenvironment by seeding thymocytes from young and old donors onto the fetal thymic stroma. The values of T cells that developed from the old donor inoculum were lower under these conditions. Our studies suggest that at least some of the manifestations of aging in the T cell compartment are related to developmentally programmed events in the lymphohemopoietic cell compartment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Limited hemodialysis machines, limited trained staff and large travel distances to dialysis centers created the need for patients to be trained to perform their own dialysis at home. Patients and their families were trained in all aspects of hemodialysis including arterio-venous fistula (AVF) cannulation. The ideal person to perform the cannulation is the patient since they will always be present for the hemodialysis session. This remains true today for home or in-center hemodialysis patients.\n\n【1】The United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services updated the 'Conditions for Coverage for ESRD Facilities' in 2008. The regulations are broken down into specific areas by 'V code'. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> contains the specific wording, which includes self-cannulation as part of self-care training should a patient desire to learn.\n\n【2】###### \n\n【3】US Medicare/Medicaid regulations regarding home dialysis training, 2008\n\n【4】  Tag number   Regulation (law passed by the US Congress)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Interpretive guidance (guidance provided to the state inspectors on how to evaluate compliance with the regulation)\n  ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  V582         \\(a\\) Standard: training. The interdisciplinary team must oversee training of the home dialysis patient, the designated caregiver or self-dialysis patient before the initiation of home dialysis or self-dialysis (as defined in § 494.10) and when the home dialysis caregiver or home dialysis modality changes.   A certified dialysis facility approved for outpatient maintenance dialysis services needs no additional certification or approval to provide in-center self-dialysis or to teach an in-center patient to perform all or part of their dialysis treatment (e.g. self-cannulate, monitor blood pressure). If a patient expresses the desire to perform self-dialysis in-center, the facility interdisciplinary team\\'s response should incorporate assessment of that patient for self-care training and planning for the goal of self-care as appropriate. Refer to V512 under patient assessment. Any patient who performs aspects of self-dialysis care must be trained and verified as competent prior to independently performing any part of his/her care.\n\n【5】The goal of this clear wording in the Interpretive Guidance document is to encourage dialysis facilities to allow patients to perform self-cannulation. This change in mindset is partially a result of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative (FFBI) \\[\\]. Patients performing self-cannulation are actively involved in their care and can help preserve their own vascular access site. The FFBI was based on the NKF KDOQI Vascular Access Guidelines \\[\\]. Cannulation clinical studies are greatly lacking in the nephrology literature and thus the cannulation recommendations are mainly based on option and clinical expertise. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>删除19:<u>{ref-type=\"table\"}</u> highlights the advantages and disadvantages of staff cannulation and patient self-cannulation.\n\n【6】###### \n\n【7】Advantages and disadvantages of staff cannulation and patient self-cannulation\n\n【8】  Advantages                                                                                               Disadvantages\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Staff cannulation                                                                                        \n  Expert level cannulation skills should be staff skill set                                                Not all staff have expert level skills\n  Staff should have a wide experience with all types of vascular access cannulation                        Not all staff have wide cannulation experience\n  Staff should have the ability to perform the task quickly                                                Quick may not equal quality and best practice\n  Staff skill set should include troubleshooting skills                                                    Not all staff have good troubleshooting skills\n  Patient self-cannulation                                                                                 \n  Expert level skill can quickly be achieved by the patient since a single vascular access is cannulated   Initial time investment to teach the patient to perform self-cannulation\n  The patient is always in the chair for their own treatment                                               None\n  The patient can cannulate the vascular access while staff is busy doing other pre-dialysis tasks         None\n  Patient only need to learn to troubleshoot their own vascular access                                     The patient will initially lack skills and need to be taught to troubleshoot cannulation issues\n\n【9】Richard and Engebretson \\[\\] conducted in-depth interviews with 14 hemodialysis patients who currently had an AVF, had a history of an AVF or were scheduled for AVF creation. The goal of the research was to examine how patients negotiate living with an AVF. The interviews revealed that the patients feel dependant on the dialysis care team and thus vulnerable to the care team's skill level, knowledge base and actions. This can lead to mistrust and fear. The patients become vigilant and assertive to protect their lifelines.\n\n【10】Self-care is a key component to the patients overcoming the dependency and the related vulnerability created by the routines in a typical outpatient dialysis unit. Cate Lewis RN, BSN, CNN is a nephrology nurse and former hemodialysis patient. She shares her personal story in a book chapter entitled 'Dynamic Duo: The Chairside Perspective of Buttonhole Method and Self-Cannulation' \\[\\]. She points out that even the words used to describe needle insertion are fearful to the patients. The care team uses words like 'stick', 'needle' or 'needling'. Cate supports use of 'insert' or 'place' the needles.\n\n【11】Techniques for training patients to do their own self-cannulation have been used for years. In the absence of clinical research to demonstrate the best training technique for self-cannulation, we can only look to methods described in clinical use. The method of 'Tandem Hand' cannulation \\[\\] is detailed in the article by Stuart Mott and Harold Moore. Both work in the nephrology program at the University of Missouri, MO under the mentorship of the Buttonhole Cannulation Method founder Dr ZJ Twardowski.\n\n【12】Like all areas of cannulation, clinical research is required to advance the practice and provide the highest level of care with the best possible clinical outcomes. But we as nephrology care team providers cannot wait until the research is completed. I have been in nephrology for 28 years and I still await a randomized controlled trial that would meet the level of evidence criteria required to be used as evidence in future KDOQI Vascular Access Guideline updates. Personally, I think we need to return to the older practice of teaching and empowering the patients to learn self-care to the level of their ability and desire. I believe for many of our patients, this level of independence will include self-cannulation. Once we help them over the hurdle of self-cannulation, many can easily advance to home dialysis.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest statement.
