The heterolactic strain Lactobacillus pentosus CECT 4023 T, that can consume glucose and xylose, was studied to produce lactic acid from steam exploded wheat straw prehydrolysate. The effect of temperature and pH on bacterial growth was analyzed. Besides, the effect of oxygen on lactic acid production was tested and fermentation yields were compared in different scenarios.

{"seq_id": "4d38a2aa-95a9-4419-ba61-97ca9232eece", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\n【1】Carbohydrates (CHO) and fat are the main sources of fuel oxidized in muscles during exercise \\[[@CR1]\\]. In contrast to fat, endogenous stores of CHO are limited. The storage form of carbohydrate, glycogen, is found almost exclusively in muscle and liver and represents only \\~ 8000 kJ (about 1911 kcal) in untrained individuals and about 20--50% higher in trained men and women. However, there is a vast quantity of fat stored even in the leanest of athletes (approximately 600,000 kJ) \\[[@CR2]\\]. Physical performance (mainly endurance) and exercise ability can be limited when endogenous CHO are the dominant fuel \\[[@CR3]\\]. A high CHO diet has been traditionally promoted for athletes in order to maximize muscle and liver glycogen stores, as well as the ability to maintain their effective utilization, which often determines the final effectiveness of physical exercise \\[[@CR4]\\]. However, over the last two decades, reports suggesting benefits from purposely and strategically reducing the availability of CHO during some or all of an athlete's training sessions (e.g. low CHO high fat diet, high/low CHO periodization, fed/fasted training) has appeared with increased frequency in the literature \\[[@CR5]--[@CR8]\\]. These dietary regimes are supposed to optimize fuel mobilization and utilization during exercise by activating fatty acids as an energy source during exercise.\n\n【2】The ketogenic diet (KD) is a special example of a low CHO high fat diet. The original KD was designed with a 4:1 lipid:non-lipid ratio with \\~ 75--80% of the daily energy intake from fat, 15% from protein (PRO), and less than 5% and/or 20--50 g CHO per day \\[[@CR3], [@CR9]--[@CR11]\\]. After several days of drastically reduced CHO intake while maintaining the usual energy intake, glucose reserves become depleted and are no longer sufficient for either normal fat oxidation (via oxaloacetate in the Krebs cycle) or to supply energy to the brain and central nervous system \\[[@CR10]\\]. It is worth mentioning that the first studies on KD focused mainly on its efficacy in treating epilepsy and came from the early 1930s \\[[@CR12]\\]. Its possible efficacy was further investigated with regard to weight loss \\[[@CR13]\\], insulin resistance, diabetes or high blood pressure \\[[@CR14]\\].\n\n【3】The KD can be characterized by pleiotropic activity. The significant influence of the KD may be related to its impact on the adaptation of the body through the regulation of the molecular mechanisms of cellular signaling \\[[@CR11], [@CR15]--[@CR17]\\]. Activation of these signaling pathways may lead to a significant increase in the physical and exercise capacity, by stimulating, e.g. mitochondrial biogenesis, capillarization, regeneration processes, and especially, effective fat energy substrate utilization \\[[@CR18]--[@CR20]\\]. The relationship between KD and inflammation/oxidative stress may also be significant, which has been observed in the therapy of metabolic, neurodegenerative, and other disorders related to the severity of inflammation (e.g. diabetes and obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, autism, acne, asthma, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) \\[[@CR11], [@CR15], [@CR16], [@CR21]--[@CR30]\\]. Beneficial effects may also involve the strengthening of brain function and cognitive performance \\[[@CR18], [@CR20], [@CR31]\\].\n\n【4】However, the main mechanism of influence of the KD on the human body is its impact on metabolic reorganization \\[[@CR11], [@CR16], [@CR32]--[@CR35]\\]. Due to the lack of optimal CHO availability, free fatty acid (from the diet or adipose tissue) oxidation and ketogenic amino acid degradation result in the formation of ketone bodies (KB; β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) in the mitochondrial matrix of liver cells \\[[@CR11], [@CR16]\\]. After transporting the KB to extrahepatic cells, they can be used as an energy substrate (acetyl-CoA) in the production of ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the citric acid cycle (TCA) \\[[@CR16]\\].\n\n【5】In addition, the metabolic effects of KB are also associated with the sparing and/or attenuation of fuel (glycogen, glucose) selection and lactate production during exercise, anti-lipolytic effects, and increased reliance on intramuscular triglycerides \\[[@CR11], [@CR17]\\]. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of the KD on the synthesis/proteolysis of muscle proteins, although it now seems that anabolic pathways may be downregulated in individuals following a KD diet \\[[@CR36]--[@CR38]\\]. It can therefore be concluded that diets high in fat upregulate the release, transport, uptake, and utilization of fat in the muscle, even in endurance athletes whose training would have been expected to maximize such adaptations \\[[@CR39]--[@CR41]\\].\n\n【6】The effectiveness of KD in supporting weight reduction has made it quite popular among athletes competing in sport disciplines with weight categories or aesthetic aspects \\[[@CR42], [@CR43]\\]. New lines of research concerning the utility of KD in sports have focused on performance in endurance trained athletes, most of which concurrently addressed the issue of energy metabolism during exercise and revealed increased fat oxidation under KD \\[[@CR3], [@CR41], [@CR44]--[@CR46]\\]. However, few studies have investigated the relations between exercise intensity (as measured by maximal oxygen uptake) and fat utilization in detail and these have been underpowered due to low sample sizes \\[[@CR46]\\]. Moreover, no between-gender comparisons in possible energy metabolism differences related to the KD have been made. However, it is known that there are gender differences in whole-body fat oxidation kinetics during exercise. Fat oxidation rates and maximal fat oxidation at submaximal intensities are greater in women than in men, and maximal fat oxidation occur at substantially higher exercise intensities in women than in men \\[[@CR47]\\].\n\n【7】Based on the above facts, we hypothesized that in actively training male and female CrossFit practitioners, a KD for 4 weeks would induce shifts in fuel utilization during exercise in favor of fat utilization. Our secondary hypotheses were that changes in fat utilization under the KD would differ between exercise intensities (as measured by %VO~2max~) and between gender. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a single arm nutritional intervention trial in a group of CrossFit athletes (11 females and 11 males) consuming a KD (≥75% of daily energy from fat, 1.7 g of PRO per kilogram of body mass, and up to 5% energy from CHO) for 4 weeks.\n\n【8】Methods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n【9】Participants {#Sec3}\n------------\n\n【10】Thirty participants were initially enrolled in this study.

Throughout the KD intervention period, participants kept a nutritional diary to assess each individual's diet compliance with the study diet. After the participants had completed a four-week experimental KD intervention, the second series of laboratory study visits (T~2~) was conducted. Exercise tests were performed twice, before (at the CD) and after the KD diet (T~1--2~), in the laboratory. During the exercise tests, substrate oxidation rates and EE were evaluated.

Three hours before the T~1~ and T~2~ visits, the participants consumed a standardized meal corresponding to their habitual food intake or to menu of the KD diet, respectively.

During the bioimpedance analyses, the recommended measurement conditions were strictly followed \\[[@CR52]\\].\n\n【46】Daily energy expenditure {#Sec8}\n------------------------\n\n【47】The total daily EE was assessed as described previously using heart rate (HR) monitoring data (Polar RS-400, Vantaa, Finland), based on a previously validated method \\[[@CR50], [@CR53], [@CR54]\\]. During run-in phase, each participant's HR was recorded minute-by-minute for five consecutive days. To eliminate any accidental errors (e.g. cell phone interference, loss of skin contact during sleep) in HR recordings, participants were asked to report the times and types of habitual daily activities and training. The information was used to fill the potential gaps in HR recordings. Recorded wrist-worn HR data were downloaded to a computer equipped with the Polar ProTrainer 5 program (ver. 5.41.002, Vantaa, Finland). On a T~0~ visit, the HR thresholds (HR~FLEX~) for activity categories (sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous) were estimated individually for each participant. The EE for each category was calculated as recommended, and four-day HR data were categorized into intensity levels and used to estimate the total daily EE \\[[@CR50], [@CR53], [@CR54]\\].\n\n【48】Blood and urine sample analysis {#Sec9}\n-------------------------------\n\n【49】In order to obtain confirmation of compliance with the KD regime by the subjects, the KB concentration was assessed in urine and blood samples. Fingertip blood and urine samples were taken pre-exercise at T~1~ and T~2~ (\\~ 3 h post prandial). All blood samples were taken with the patient in a seated upright position. β-hydroxbutyrate (βHB) concentrations were determined with a handheld Optium Xido Neo analyzer (Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd. Witney, Oxon, UK) and Optium Xido β--ketone testing strips (Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd. Witney, Oxon, UK). The apparatus measurement accuracy (CV) was 3.8%. Furthermore, the KB concentration in the urine was examined using the URYXXON® Relax analyzer (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The sensitivity settings were adjusted into four ranges (NEG: \\< 25 mg·dL^− 1^; +: \\> 25 mg·dL^− 1^; ++: \\> 100 mg·dL^− 1^; and +++: \\> 300 mg·dL^− 1^).\n\n【50】A βHB concentration of 0.5--3.0 mmol·L^− 1^ in the blood and KB \\> 25 mg·dL^− 1^ in the urine used as confirmation of proper adherence to the diet by the subjects \\[[@CR3], [@CR55], [@CR56]\\].\n\n【51】Exercise tests {#Sec10}\n--------------\n\n【52】Throughout the study protocol, the subjects performed two exercise tests (T~1--2~). The incremental cycling tests (ICT) were performed under standardized conditions (temp. 20--22 °C and humidity 60--70%) in the morning (from 8.00 to 12.00 a.m.). Prior to each test, the subjects were instructed about its procedure and completed a brief 5-min warm-up on a cycloergometer (Kettler-X1, Kettler, Ense-Parsit, Germany) (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The aerobic capacity and level of exercise intensity at different ICT stages were evaluated based on the subject's maximal oxygen uptake (VO~2max~). Following \\~ 5-min warm-up on the cycloergometer (Kettler-X1, Kettler, Ense-Parsit, Germany) followed by \\~ 5 min rest and preparation for exercise testing, the ICT began at a workload of 75 W for females and 100 W for males at 70 ± 5 rpm (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Every 1.5 min, the workload increased by 25 W until reaching maximum perceived exhaustion, assessed using the Borg scale 通用删除7(英):<u>(6--20)</u> \\[[@CR57], [@CR58]\\]. The respiration indices were recorded with a calibrated ergospirometer (Quark CPET, Cosmed, Rome, Italy) and analyzed with Cosmed CPET software (ver. 9.1b, 2010). VO~2max~ was defined as the point where a workload increase stopped generating further increases in oxygen uptake (VO~2~) and HR \\[[@CR57], [@CR58]\\]. Although all participants were familiar with the tests from T~0~ as well as from previous studies and training, they were encouraged to ask questions about the details of the protocol. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to wear proper workout clothing and shoes. All testing was supervised by an experienced researcher.\n\n【53】Statistical analysis {#Sec11}\n--------------------\n\n【54】The results are presented as means ± SD or ± 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to significant differences in body composition in females and males, all the results (substrate oxidation rate and EE) are given in relation to fat free mass (FFM) content. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoid rule for EE and fat and CHO oxidation. The differences between pairs of observations for the rates of substrate utilization and energy expenditure (at separate VO~2max~ points in the range of 30 to 100% of VO~2max~) were tested using repeated measures ANOVA (for normally distributed variables) with post hoc analysis using Scheffe's test or the Wilcoxon test (for variables without normal distribution of the data after Box-Cox transformation). Either the one-side paired t-Student test or the Wilcoxon test (depending on the distribution of data---normal or not normal) was used to compare the CD-KD (at the CD and after KD) differences in AUCs, the AUC at ≤65% VO~2max~ and the AUC at \\> 65% VO~2max~ were assessed. The t-Student test for independent variables or the Mann--Whitney U test was implemented to test gender differences for the rates of substrate utilization and EE (at separate VO~2max~ points in the range of 30 to 100% of VO~2max~) between CD and KD, as well as to test differences in percentages of change in AUCs (AUC ≤65% VO~2max~ and AUC \\> 65% VO~2max~) between females and males. The chi-square test of independence was implemented to verify the relationship between gender and response to KD (increase/decrease in fat/CHO oxidation). Statistical significance was set at p \\< 0.05. Data were analyzed using the STATISTICA 12 (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA) software program.\n\n【55】Based on other studies that have evaluated nutritional interventions with KD on energy metabolism during exercise, a sample size of eight to eleven per group was deemed to be common \\[[@CR41]--[@CR45], [@CR59]\\]. Therefore, an initial sample size of 11 per group (females and males) was selected. Furthermore, to confirm that this would be sufficient to detect an intervention effect, a statistical power analysis was performed 通用删除1(英):<u>(G\\Power, version 3.1.9.2, Universität Düsseldorf, Germany)</u>. The power analysis was performed based on the following inputs: t-test differences between two dependent means (matched pairs) or ANOVA repeated measures between-factors; an alpha value of 0.05, a desired power of 0.80; and a sample size of 11 subjects in each group. The results indicated that a standardized effect size of 0.63 or 0.54 would be detectable (large effect). Furthermore, based on our pilot study and previous studies on different dietary regimes on energy metabolism \\[[@CR50]\\], we assumed that a sample size of 11 in each group (females and males) would be sufficient to detect significant differences in fat oxidation.\n\n【56】Results {#Sec12}\n=======\n\n【57】Participants and adherence {#Sec13}\n--------------------------\n\n【58】There were no differences in energy intake or PRO intake at the CD and during the KD (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}). Fat intake was significantly higher and CHO intake was significantly lower during the KD compared to the CD in both females and males. The compliance with the prescribed KD was high and intakes of energy and macronutrients did not differ between prescribed diets and data from dietary records (all p \\> 0.05; data not presented). Also, the analysis of the concentrations of βHB (1.3 ± 0.9 mmol·L^− 1^ in females and 1.2 ± 0.5 mmol·L^− 1^ in males in blood samples, respectively) and KB (in all subjects \\> 25 mg·dL^− 1^ in urine) confirmed compliance with the diet. Importantly, in the context of results interpretation, we did not observe significant changes in VO~2~max under KD (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【59】Furthermore, despite the low supply of fiber in the diet (about 9--10 g·day^− 1^), the subjects did not report gastrointestinal problems, constipation, or diarrhea. On the other hand, reported inconveniences resulting from the conversion of energy processes related to the use of glucose in favor of KB were irritability, drowsiness, and changes in mood. In some of the subjects, none of the above ailments occurred, while in athletes who had difficulty with ketoadaptation, the symptoms lasted from a few days to a maximum of a week. This aspect was also one of the reasons for the resignation of some study participants. Apart from low supply of fiber, the KD during the study protocol was characterized by high nutritional value with regard to vitamins and minerals. The intake of most of them did not changed or was even higher during KD. The only exception was Mg, intake of which was lower during KD compared to CD (通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}: Table S1).</u>\n\n【60】From 30 participants, eight did not complete the study either due to injury (1 female and 1 male) or non-adherence to the protocol and failure to achieve a state of ketosis (2 females and 4 males) (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Twenty-two participants (11 females and 11 males) met the criteria required in the study protocol, completed the nutritional intervention periods and two visits (T~1--2~), and reported no significant lifestyle and training routine changes during the study.\n\n【61】Fat and carbohydrate oxidation during the customary diet and after the ketogenic diet {#Sec14}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【62】In females, the rate of fat oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) and the percentage contribution of fat oxidation to the energy yield (% oxidation) were noticeably higher during the KD starting from 60% of VO~2max~ (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}a-b). However the differences between CD and KD reached statistical significance solely at 85% of VO~2max~. In males, the rate of fat oxidation during the KD was higher throughout the whole exercise as compared to CD testing (Fig. [2a](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and the differences were significant at 35% and 50--65% of VO~2max~. Similarly, the %fat oxidation was also higher at each separate %VO~2max~ point, but the differences were significant at 30--35, 50--70 and 80% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2b](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}).Fig. 2Fat and CHO oxidation rate (a and c) and their contribution to energy metabolism (b and d) at the CD and after the KD. Note: Values are means ± 95% CI. \\Significantly different from CD for VO~2~max points treated separately in females; \\\\Significantly different from CD for VO~2~max points treated separately in males; ^\\$^significantly different between females and males at CD; ^\\$\\$^significantly different between females and males at KD; (p \\< 0.05)\n\n【63】Moreover, in females, starting from about 65% VO~2max~, the rate of CHO oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) at KD assessment was lower compared to during the CD analyses (Fig. [2c](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), yet the differences did not reach statistical significance at any tested point. While, the contribution of CHO to energy metabolism was significantly lower at KD assessment at 50--55, 75 and 85% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2d](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In contrast, in males, the rate of CHO oxidation at KD testing was lower throughout the whole exercise as compared to during CD testing (Fig. [2c](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Still, the differences reached statistical significance only at the lower ranges of VO~2max~ (30% and 50--65% of VO~2max~). Similarly, the contribution of CHO oxidation to energy metabolism during the KD exercise was lower for the whole analyzed range of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2d](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and reached significance at 30--35% and 50--70% of VO~2max~.\n\n【64】Substrate utilization and energy expenditure between females and males {#Sec15}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【65】At CD testing, the rate of fat oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) was significantly higher in females at 40--70% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2a](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). At KD assessment, despite the apparent differences between females and males starting from 45% of VO~2~max, no significant between-gender differences were noted (Fig. [2a](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). At CD testing, the percentage of fat oxidation was significantly higher in females at 30 and 40--70% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2b](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}) but took almost the same values as in men at the highest ranges of VO~2max~ (85--100%). In contrast, after KD, there were no significant between-gender differences at any point of VO~2~max testing (Fig. [2b](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, some between-gender differences occurred at middle and higher levels of VO~2~max (70--100% VO~2~max), the contribution of fat oxidation in energy metabolism was slightly higher in females compared to males.\n\n【66】During CD testing, the level of CHO oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) in males was significantly higher at 30%, and 40--70% of VO~2max~ points, while at the KD assessment, the differences remained significant solely at 45% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2c](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Furthermore, at the CD testing, the contribution of CHO oxidation to the energy yield was significantly higher in males compared to females at 30%, 40--70% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2d](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). At the KD testing point, contribution of CHO oxidation was higher at in males starting from 45% of VO~2max,~ still the differences were significant solely at 45--50% of VO~2max~ (Fig. [2d](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【67】Although the level of EE (kcal·min^− 1^) seemed to be comparable for the CD and KD analyses, statistically significant differences occurred at 55% and 85--95% of VO~2max~ in females (lower at KD; Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In males EE was significantly higher compared to females at all the analyzed VO~2max~ point during CD and KD testing. While when expressing EE in kcal·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^, no differences between females and males were observed at CD or KD testing (Fig. [3b](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, in females EE was significantly lower at 45%, 55--65, 75% and 85--95% VO~2max~ at KD compared to CD.Fig. 3Energy expenditure during exercise at the CD and after the KD intervention. Note: Values are means ± 95% CI. \\Significantly different from CD for VO~2max~ points treated separately in females (p \\< 0.05)\n\n【68】Areas under the curve (AUCs) of substrate utilization and energy expenditure during the customary diet and after the ketogenic diet in females and males {#Sec16}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【69】In females, there were no differences in the AUCs of fat and CHO oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) or for the percentage contributions of fat and CHO oxidation to energy metabolism between CD and KD (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"}). However, in females, the AUC of EE (kcal·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) at KD testing was significantly lower compared to CD. In males, the AUCs for the rate of fat oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) and %fat oxidation (% oxidation) were significantly higher at KD compared to CD. There were no differences in the percentage changes of AUCs between females and males for any of measured parameters (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#Tab3){ref-type=\"table\"}). Furthermore, more males than females showed an increased AUC for fat utilization and a decreased AUC of CHO utilization during KD (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#Fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, the differences were not significant.Table 3Differences in AUC and percentage changes in AUC at the CD and KD testing pointsIndicatorFemales\\\nCD vs KD\\\npMales\\\nCD vs KD\\\np% CD-KD changes\\\nfemales vs males\\\npFat oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^)\\> 0.05\\< 0.05↑\\> 0.05%Fat oxidation (% oxidation)\\> 0.05\\< 0.05↑\\> 0.05CHO oxidation (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^)\\> 0.05\\> 0.05\\> 0.05%CHO oxidation (% oxidation)\\> 0.05\\> 0.05\\> 0.05EE (kcal·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^)\\< 0.05↓\\> 0.05\\> 0.05Note: Data express p-value for differences between CD and KD or females and malesFig. 4Numbers of female and male participants who experienced an increase or reduction in the AUCs of fat and carbohydrate utilization after the KD diet\n\n【70】AUCs of substrate utilization and energy expenditure according to exercise intensity (≤65% VO~2max~ and \\> 65% VO~2max~) during the CD and after the KD in females and males {#Sec17}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】In females, at ≤65% VO~2max~, there were no differences in the AUCs of fat or CHO utilization (oxidation in g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^ and % oxidation) or EE (kcal·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^) between CD and KD (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#Tab4){ref-type=\"table\"}).

We demonstrated shifts in macronutrient utilization in favor of fat utilization. Interestingly, there were gender differences in the post-intervention relation between exercise intensity and fat oxidation. For both genders, an increase in fat oxidation during exercise was noticeable. However, in males, an increased rates of fat utilization (oxidation in g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^ and % oxidation) occurred at exercise intensities of up to 80% of VO~2max~ and were statistically significant at 35% and 50--65% of VO~2max~ and 30--35% and 50--70 and 80% of VO~2max~, respectively. In contrast, in females, increased fat utilization (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^ and % oxidation) was noted at the higher ranges of VO~2max~ (65--100% VO~2max~), but reached statistical significance solely at single points of VO~2max~ (85% of VO~2max~). Gender differences in macronutrient utilization following the KD were particularly apparent when comparing the AUCs of fat and CHO utilization (g·min^− 1^·kg~FFM~^− 1^ and % oxidation) of exercise intensity ≤65% VO~2max~, respectively. In males, the AUC of fat utilization was significantly higher and the AUC of CHO utilization was significantly lower at ≤65% VO~2max~ after the KD compared to the CD. No differences were noted in females.\n\n【74】The authors of this paper are of the opinion that the legitimacy of using the KD is particularly interesting in the increasingly popular disciplines of functional training, such as CrossFit. In this group of athletes, the KD is characterized by a large and constantly growing popularity; however, there is not enough research on its actual impact. Attention is drawn to the fact that in this type of effort, exercises of varying intensities are combined (resistance, speed-strength, and endurance) \\[[@CR60]\\]. The question then arises as to whether the limited availability of CHO and the use of a KD will effectively influence changes in metabolic adaptation in CrossFit training on the basis of variable exercise stimuli. Attention is also drawn to the fact that the nature of the effort may be related to the effective use of the KD. In addition to the known impacts of classical strength training on the activity of the mTORC1/p70S6k/4E-1BP pathway leading, among other factors, to the stimulation of protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis as well as increases in muscle mass and strength, high intensity interval training (often used as part of the Crossfit training) also stimulates the activity of AMPK, SIRT 1, and p38 MAPK signaling and the expression of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle \\[[@CR61]\\]. The latter leads, among other effects, to increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and the fatty acid oxidation capacity \\[[@CR61]--[@CR65]\\]. These aspects seem to explain, in part, the metabolic adaptations induced by this kind of exercise. Furthermore, short-term high-intensity interval training and/or sprint interval training (SIT), as opposed to traditional endurance training, can, in many cases, lead to similar adaptations in human skeletal muscle and exercise performance (but without a suppressive influence on factors such as muscle protein synthesis and strength), which will be even more the case when combining these types of training, as is often observed in CrossFit \\[[@CR61]\\].\n\n【75】Among the factors affecting the rate of fat oxidation during exercise there are training status, gender, acute and chronic dietary intakes, fat mass content, and exercise intensity \\[[@CR66]--[@CR68]\\]. In general, fat oxidation is the predominant fuel source (%) during exercise at submaximal intensities (\\< 65% VO~2max~). Increases in exercises intensity that exceed 65% of VO~2max~ induce a shift in energy contribution that favors CHO oxidation \\[[@CR68]\\]. In our study, at the pre-intervention testing stage when participants consumed their CD (with percentage energy from CHO 44.2--45.4%, from fat 36.4--36.9%, and from PRO 17.7--19.4%), we confirmed the abovementioned relations regarding exercise intensity (%VO~2max~) and fat and CHO oxidation rates. These were noted in both females and males. Furthermore, in non-athlete, healthy adults consuming a traditional mixed diet (with energy contributions of 45.4%, 34,3, and 17.3% from CHO, fat, and PRO, respectively), it was previously noted that fat and CHO intakes make modest, but importantly, independent contributions to one's capacity to oxidize fat during exercise \\[[@CR69]\\].\n\n【76】In recent years, Cox et al. \\[[@CR70]\\] has performed a series of experiments in exercising high-performance athletes after generating acute ketosis through the administration of a ketone ester-based drink. The experiments revealed that ketosis may alter substrate competition for respiration and improve oxidative energy transduction under conditions such as endurance exercise. In this manner, nutritional ketosis may help to unlock greater human metabolic potential which can be suppressed by a high CHO diet \\[[@CR70]\\]. Still, the aforementioned effect needs to be interpreted carefully, while it was achieved after generating acute ketosis by synergistic ingestion of ketone esters and CHO. These conditions cannot be recreated in long-term consumption of KD. It should be also taken into account that in practice the \"metabolic\" potential may not affect the \"performance\" potential, which seem to confirm the works in which no effect \\[[@CR71]\\] or even a performance impairment after ketones ester treatment were observed \\[[@CR72], [@CR73]\\]. However, the utility of the KD in athletes has been studied extensively in the last decade \\[[@CR3], [@CR38], [@CR41]--[@CR46], [@CR59], [@CR74], [@CR75]\\]. Still, there is great diversity in study designs and methodologies, including the use of various sport disciplines (artistic gymnastics \\[[@CR42]\\], taekwondo athletes \\[[@CR43]\\], off-road cyclists \\[[@CR44]\\], endurance trained cyclists and runners \\[[@CR3], [@CR45], [@CR46], [@CR59]\\], race walkers \\[[@CR41]\\], CrossFitters \\[[@CR74]\\], overload training \\[[@CR38]\\]) and lengths of dietary intervention (4 days \\[[@CR75]\\], 3 weeks \\[[@CR41], [@CR43], [@CR45]\\], 4 weeks \\[[@CR42], [@CR44]\\], 8 weeks \\[[@CR38]\\], 10 weeks \\[[@CR46]\\], 12 weeks \\[[@CR74]\\], the use of the KD on a habitual basis \\[[@CR59]\\]), as well as differences in the analyzed outcomes. For this reason, it is difficult to make direct comparisons between our results and results obtained by other authors. Most of the studies included only male subjects \\[[@CR3], [@CR38], [@CR41], [@CR42], [@CR44]--[@CR46], [@CR59]\\], with only a few studies including both male and female participants \\[[@CR38], [@CR43], [@CR46]\\]. It needs to be emphasized that none of the previous studies focused solely on female athletes or compared the effect of the KD between males and females. For this reason, the between-gender comparison conducted in our study seems to be an original approach and a valuable scientific and practical contribution. Furthermore, CrossFit is still gaining popularity \\[[@CR60]\\], but to our knowledge, there is only one published study on the use of a KD in CrossFit \\[[@CR74]\\]. In the latter study, it was observed that a 12-week KD, in comparison to a control diet, caused marked reductions in whole-body adiposity while not affecting performance indices in recreationally-trained CrossFit trainees. Still, the results of this study need to be interpreted carefully due to its relatively low sample size (7 participants in the KD group and 5 participants in the control group) and lack of randomization of participants into KD or control group (participants were free to choose which diet to follow).\n\n【77】The exercise intensity during CrossFit workouts is estimated to be about 64% of VO~2max~ \\[[@CR76]\\] or 57--66% VO~2max~ \\[[@CR77]\\] depending on training experience, the purpose of training, and for different workouts ('Cindy' or 'Fran'). The increase in fat utilization and in the contribution of fat to energy metabolism expressed by an increase in AUC at intensities ≤65% VO~2max~ in male participants may have led to more optimal employment of energy reserves of the body and hypothetically improved performance during specific efforts in CrossFit workouts. Attempts to evaluate fat utilization and physical performance during discipline-specific efforts have been undertaken by other authors \\[[@CR3], [@CR41], [@CR45], [@CR59]\\]. In those studies KD led to an increase in fat oxidation during exercise, still it was not effective in improving performance in discipline-specific workouts \\[[@CR3], [@CR41], [@CR45], [@CR59]\\]. In a recent, very well controlled study by Burke et al. \\[[@CR41]\\], it was found that KD led decreased performance in elite race walkers by impairing exercise economy and falling into lower end of the intensity spectrum. Thus, there is the need to evaluate the efficacy of the KD, not only with respect to energy metabolism, but also with respect to discipline-specific performance capacity.\n\n【78】Furthermore, the enhancement in fat oxidation under the KD seems to be specific to submaximal intensity exercise. In off-road cyclists, it was noted that the use of a 4-week KD during a period of high-volume low to moderate intensity training led to an increase in the contribution of free fatty acids (FFA) to the total EE during moderate intensity exercise. However, during maximal intensity exercise, FFA metabolism was inhibited, among other factors, by intensified glycolysis \\[[@CR44]\\]. It therefore seems that the KD may also be an inappropriate dietary regime for disciplines characterized by high-intensity, short duration activities relying mainly on the anaerobic energy system. It was previously observed that a 4-day KD resulted in lower peak and mean power during the Wingate anaerobic cycling test, as well as a lower distance run in the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test compared to high CHO diet \\[[@CR75]\\]. In addition, KD could impair also exercise economy and performance in endurance performance \\[[@CR41]\\].\n\n【79】It should be mentioned here that the duration of the KD may play a crucial role in its efficacy. This is perhaps related to the fact that full ketogenic metabolic adjustment (keto-adaptation) requires about 7 days \\[[@CR42]\\]. Dietary interventions with a KD lasting less than 2 weeks seem to be insufficient to reveal the real effects of ketosis. It is thus crucial to verify that the state of ketosis has been achieved via an evaluation of the level of KB in the urine and/or blood. There are intra-day courses of blood and urinary concentrations of KB during a KD. The highest and most reliably detected levels tend to be observed in the early morning and post-dinner urine \\[[@CR78]\\]. It is thus reasonable to study participants at the exact same time when testing urine or blood ketones.\n\n【80】When analyzing gender differences in substrate oxidation, the way of expressing results -- absolute values or in relation fat free mass content, need to be taken into consideration. In a review by Maunder et al. \\[[@CR67]\\], where the fat oxidation was expressed in absolute values (g·min^− 1^) it was concluded that in terms of mixed, mainly high CHO diets, maximal fat oxidation is generally greater in males compared to females, but maximal fat oxidation relative to fat free mass is likely greater in non-obese females compared to non-obese males. It is unknown if this type of metabolic effect would be observed in highly trained individuals. Purdom et al. \\[[@CR68]\\] concluded that women have a significantly greater ability to oxidize fat during exercise. In our study, in general, we observed higher level of fat oxidation in relation to FFM in females compared to males, with significant differences at CD at 40--70% VO~2max~. It seems likely that the gender differences in fat oxidation during exercise can be attributed to the level of circulating estrogen. Estrogen directly stimulates AMPK and PGC-1α, which is thought to increase the downstream fatty acid oxidation protein CD36 and the beta-oxidative protein HAD \\[[@CR68]\\]. Furthermore, beta-oxidative proteins that oxidase long chain fatty acids have been shown to be regulated, in part, by estrogen. The increase in beta-oxidative proteins is directly related to the increased potential of fatty acid oxidation \\[[@CR68]\\]. Circulating estrogen is naturally higher in pre-menopausal women compared to men. There are fluctuations in the level of circulating estrogen throughout the menstrual cycle. The link between estrogen and substrate oxidation, which is reflected in increased fat oxidation rates and decreased CHO oxidation rates during exercise, has been shown by studies in men who received estrogen treatment \\[[@CR79]\\]. However, there are also reports suggesting that elevated estrogen during the follicular phase does not affect fat oxidation when compared to the luteal phase \\[[@CR68]\\]. As it was mentioned before, this is the first study to compare the effects of a KD between females and males. On the basis of our results, it could be stated that male CrossFit practitioners, despite the lower regular rate of fat oxidation during exercise, are more prone to shifts in macronutrient utilization during exercise under the KD than their female counterparts. In males there were more evident changes in fat and CHO utilization after KD, while in females the differences were apparent, but not significant. It is highly interesting that in males, the tendency of increased fat utilization was noticeable at the whole analyzed range of VO~2max~, while in females, the tendency was noted at a higher range of VO~2max~ (65--100% VO~2max~). In a case study by Zinn et al. \\[[@CR46]\\], in which four out of five participants were female, a great increase in the %VO~2max~ at which the peak of absolute fat oxidation occurred was observed after a 10-week KD (48.2% vs 63.7% of VO~2max~). Taking into account our results and the results presented by Zinn et al. it could be hypothesized that, in females, a KD tends to promote a shift of maximal fat oxidation toward higher exercise intensities. It is thus reasonable to consider the effectiveness of KD application not only with regard to the nature and intensity of an effort, but also to consider gender differences in response to the KD at a given exercise intensity in a given sport. It is therefore hypothetically possible that a KD may be beneficial for given types of physical effort in one gender but not the other. Furthermore, as we observed the decreased energetic cost at particular levels of exercise intensity, we believe that the issue demands further insights, with respect to alternations in EE during longer-lasting exercises or training units. The possible alternations may be also conditioned by sex.\n\n【81】However, it should be taken into account that our study has some limitations. Firstly, regarding female participants, the menstrual cycle phase was not monitored by hormonal markers or ultrasonography throughout the study course. Still, none of studied women declared the presence of a menstrual cycle disorder that may have affected levels of circulating estrogen and therefore influenced the rate of fat oxidation. It would be valuable to include monitoring of the menstrual cycle in further investigations. Secondly, the lack of a control group may serve as a slight limitation of our study. However, we believe that in CrossFit practitioners with training experience of at least 2 years, consecutive 4 weeks of training with habitual and constant training load (among others without any specific training micro / macrocycle), will not lead to significant changes in aerobic capacity and alternations in macronutrient utilization during exercise. Another issue is the individual variation in vulnerability to the KD and willingness to continue the KD. We would like to highlight that, in our study, we observed positive responses to the KD (increase in fat oxidation) in nine out of 11 males and in seven out of 11 females. McSwiney et al. \\[[@CR3]\\] noted that a 12-week KD led to improvement in 100 km time trial performance in six out of nine participants (the mean time for the 100 km time trial did not change significantly). In our study, three females and five males dropped out during the diet. In the study by McSwiney et al. five out of 27 participants dropped out because the dietary intervention was too difficult to follow. It is thus suggested that the KD may not be suitable for every athlete and should not be undertaken without consideration of an individual's dietary preferences \\[[@CR3]\\]. It would be also reasonable in the future investigations to attempt to identify factors determining responsiveness to KD. It could be achieved via evaluation of food preferences, eating behaviors, nutritional value of CD or even genetic diversity in participants who dropped out from the study comparing to those who were able to complete the study protocol. Taking into account aforementioned individual variation in vulnerability to the KD, food preferences of athletes, or type of efforts they are undertaking, it is crucial for athletes to start KD solely under the supervision of experienced dietitians. Eventually, the lack of accounting for ketones while calculating of substrate oxidation \\[[@CR80]\\] may be considered as a slight limitation of the study. However, we intended our results to be referable with results from other authors. An indisputable strength of our study is the double-checking of achievement of a ketosis state in our participants (whose achievement determined final inclusion in the analysis) via βhB blood concentration and urine ketone level. Compliance with the study protocol in regard to diet and training was also evaluated during face-to-face meetings with study dietitians and CrossFit coaches at clubs as well as via e-mail and phone consultations. Finally, in our study, the effect of the KD was assessed only with regard to the incremental cycling test. Although the results are promising, indicating that the consumption of a KD by male CrossFit practitioners may metabolically lead to more optimal fuel utilization during submaximal exercise, its efficacy during specific workout efforts (typical for the discipline) should be evaluated.\n\n【82】Future research should focus on better understanding gender differences and the influence of female sex hormones on the response to the KD in a larger population. Furthermore, future methodologies should include the effect of KD on performance during discipline-specific workouts.\n\n【83】Conclusions {#Sec19}\n===========\n\n【84】Compared to a baseline customary diet, a 4-week ketogenic diet resulted in greater fat oxidation and lower carbohydrate oxidation at exercise intensities ≤65% VO~2max~ in males. In females, a tendency towards increased fat oxidation at exercise intensities \\> 65% VO~2max~ was observed. Still, males seem to be more prone to having shifts in macronutrient utilization during exercise when following the KD. The presented data on metabolic adaptation to KD, seems to indicate, that CrossFit athletes may effectively adapt to training at wide, but gender-dependent range of exercise intensities. However, these observations should be taken with caution, because in practice the metabolic adaptation may not support the exercise performance, especially in high-intensity disciplines like CrossFit.\n\n【85】Novelty statement {#Sec20}\n-----------------\n\n【86】The novelty of our approach are between gender comparisons of the influence of ketogenic diet on possible differences in energy substrates metabolism at different exercise intensities in actively training male and female CrossFit athletes. These findings could serve as guidance for trainers and athletes who consider achieving their dietary goals based on the ketogenic diet.\n\n【87】通用删除12(英):<u>Additional files</u>\n================\n\n【88】 {#Sec21}\n\n【89】通用删除5(英):<u>通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1:Table S1.

The plasma estradiol level of female rats increased and the plasma testosterone level of male rats decreased at the age of 9 weeks compared to the control group. At the age of 13 weeks, decreased body weight, food consumption, anogenital distance (AGD) and overy weight in female rats were observed. Also, the vaginal open time of female pups was earlier than control group. Histopathology showed that the cavity of uterus was larger than control group. Otherwise, treatment with genistein caused reduction in the plasma estradiol level of female rats and the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha in uterus. There were few changes of male rats' body weight, testicular descent, testes weight and histopathology except that the increased food consumption from 10-week-old and plasma testosterone level. Genistein exposure could effect on both sexes of young rats' development. The effects on female rats were much more than that on male rats and the effect of rats body weight and food consumption was mainly after their growing up.

Advantages and disadvantages of both techniques have been widely described in the literature, although limited attention has been paid to its impact on the sense of smell.Objective: The present study aims to quantify the effect of transnasal surgery on pituitary patients and examine olfactory outcomes.Methods: A prospective cohort study assessing the sense of smell of 20 patients (10 MET and 10 EET) pre-operatively. Olfactory function was re-assessed 6 months after surgery, using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (Sensonics Inc. Haddon Heights, NJ).Results: The UPSIT (Sensonics Inc.) results showed a median pre-operative score of 33 (IQR 31-37.5) (normosmia). The median post-operative result was 25 (IQR 19.5-32), consistent with moderate microsmia. Twenty percent of the patients had normal olfactory function post-operatively, all of whom were from the EET group. Twenty percent had mild microsmia, equally divided in MET and EET subgroups. Seven patients had severe microsmia. Four patients were completely anosmic at 6 months follow-up.Conclusions: Patients undergoing a transsphenoidal procedure are at risk of olfactory disturbance post-operatively, which may include loss of the sense of smell. This information is relevant to the patients' perioperative experience, and should be incorporated into counselling with regards to outcomes and expectations. Although the study size is small, the study results suggest the ETS technique may be less traumatic for the olfactory function.

While these models have proven highly valuable for studying immunity against rapidly progressing tumours, they nevertheless bypass the earliest developmental stages of cutaneous melanoma confined to the epidermis. In our recent study, we developed an epicutaneous melanoma model to study anti-cancer immune responses in situ within the uppermost layers of skin. This method of tumour inoculation initially prompts melanoma growth within the epidermis and dermis before infiltration of the subcutaneous layer and eventual metastasis to skin-draining lymph nodes, thereby approximating primary melanoma development in human patients. In contrast to the complete tumour penetrance observed after transfer of B16 melanoma cells via subcutaneous or intradermal routes, we found that only approximately 60% of mice inoculated epicutaneously went on to develop macroscopically detectable melanomas. Whereas subcutaneously inoculated tumours became uniformly palpable within one week of melanoma cell injection, epicutaneous tumours displayed far more variable growth kinetics and were usually not visible until 2-3 weeks after melanoma cell transfer. In some cases, epicutaneous melanoma growth was delayed even further and mice did not develop tumours until several weeks after inoculation. Importantly, approximately 40% of mice remained completely free of apparent melanoma disease for up to several months following epicutaneous inoculation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【2】!通用删除8(英):<u>[FIGURE 1: The route of inoculation determines tumour penetrance in transplantable models of cutaneous melanoma.\\\nIntradermal and subcutaneous inoculations of B16 melanoma cells (purple) result in complete tumour penetrance.

Of note, the majority of non-developer mice show signs of long-term persistence of melanoma cells (melanoma-immune equilibrium).]</u>(ces-03-162-g001){#fig1}\n\n【3】Closer inspection of the skin of these inoculated yet apparently 'tumour-free\\' mice using a variety of highly sensitive detection approaches, including bioluminescence imaging, low copy number PCR amplification or intravital 2-photon microscopy, revealed that many animals continued to harbour low numbers of viable melanoma cells in the epidermis for at least several weeks or months. These findings suggested that dormant melanoma cells could be maintained within the skin of epicutaneously inoculated mice for long periods of time without being completely eliminated (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We found that the control and long-term maintenance of these dormant melanoma cells was strictly dependent upon immune cells including T cells, as mice deficient in factors required for T cell development and/or survival were highly susceptible to epicutaneous melanoma formation by comparison with wild-type mice, and ultimately failed to establish tumour dormancy. These findings suggest that B16 melanoma inoculation via the epicutaneous route might provide a unique opportunity to study the immune interactions involved in the induction and maintenance of cancer-immune equilibrium -- a clinically relevant phenomenon that has typically proven difficult to study due to the paucity of murine transplantable tumour models in which tumour dormancy is observed.\n\n【4】!通用删除8(英):<u>[FIGURE 2: Tissue-resident memory T cells (T~RM~) suppress the outgrowth of persisting melanoma cells and promote a state of melanoma-immune equilibrium.\\\nThis mode of tumour control is highly localised and does not rely on recirculating T cells (T~CIRC~).

Adoptively transferred, tumour-specific CD8^+^ T cells were activated and recruited to the site of tumour inoculation and gave rise to T~RM~ cells expressing the canonical tissue-retentive molecules CD69 and CD103. In mice that developed progressively growing epicutaneous melanoma, tumour-specific T~RM~ cells congregated in the peritumoural skin directly adjacent to the invasive tumour margin in a similar fashion to T~RM~ cells localising to human melanomas. However, tumour-specific T~RM~ cells were far more abundant and more frequently identified in previously inoculated skin from macroscopically 'tumour-free\\' mice by comparison with mice developing tumours, suggesting that anti-tumour T~RM~ cell responses can develop spontaneously in mice and correlate with improved tumour protection. These findings are aligned with the recent identification of CD103^+^ T~RM~-like cells that associate with improved patient outcomes in a variety of solid human tumours including breast, ovarian, colon and lung cancers in addition to melanoma.\n\n【7】By ablating memory T cells from the circulation of mice, we showed that tumour-specific T~RM~ cells were sufficient to protect against epicutaneous melanoma development in a manner that depended upon cognate antigen recognition. Rather than completely killing or eliminating cancer cells, we found that T~RM~ cells could mediate melanoma protection by upholding a state of prolonged tumour-immune equilibrium within the epidermal layer of the skin. Fluorescently tagged and tumour-specific T~RM~ cells were identified within the epidermis of macroscopically 'tumour-free\\' mice where their ongoing interactions with dormant tumour cells could be visualised in real time using intravital 2-photon microscopy. Targeted depletion of T~RM~ cells from the skin of apparently 'tumour-free\\' mice several weeks after melanoma inoculation catalysed tumour outgrowth in a subset of animals, indicating that tumour-specific T~RM~ cells were integral to the establishment of tumour-immune equilibrium and the maintenance of tumour dormancy. Sustainment of this cancer-immune equilibrium appeared to depend more strongly on the cytokine TNFα than on other effector molecules typically produced by CD8^+^ T cells including IFNγ or perforin, although future work needs to establish the precise contribution of these and other putatively redundant effector pathways.\n\n【8】In summary, our work has revealed a novel mode of anti-tumour control employed by T~RM~ cells in skin, whereby these cells can prevent tumour outgrowth without completely eliminating cancerous cells by alternatively promoting a state of tumour-immune equilibrium (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This mechanism of tumour control mirrors that employed by T~RM~ cells poised to control reactivation of latent infections in barrier tissues where T~RM~ cells curb local pathogen replication to prevent symptomatic lesions as opposed to driving complete eradication. T~RM~ cells isolated from tumours can also highly express cytotoxic molecules and have been shown to kill autologous tumour cells in vitro but their ability to kill or eliminate tumour cells in vivo remains uncertain. Our findings raise the possibility that T~RM~ cells might also contribute to the initiation or control of tumour dormancy often observed in human cancer patients burdened with minimal residual disease following surgery or chemo- or immunotherapy. As such, our work suggests that enhancing T~RM~ cell responses using targeted immunotherapies might be a novel avenue through which to improve solid cancer treatments in patients.\n\n【9】S.L.P is a Cancer Council Victoria Postdoctoral Fellow, J.W. is a Cancer Council of Western Australia Fellow, and L.K.M and T.G. are Senior Medical Research Fellows supported by the Sylvia and Charles Viertel Charitable Foundation.\n\n【10】[^1]: Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【11】通用删除5(英):<u>[^2]: Please cite this article as: Simone L Park, Laura K Mackay, Jason Waithman and Thomas Gebhardt 通用删除7(英):<u>(2019)</u>.

Current information suggests that reactive intermediates of skin tumor initiators are mutagenic and bind convalently to DNA of epidermal stem cells (dark basal keratinocytes) leading to some irreversible alteration in the differentiation capacity of these cells. Inhibitors of skin tumor initiation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) decrease the level of the PAH diol-epoxide bound to specific DNA adducts. The tumor promoters have been shown to have many cellular and biochemical effects in the skin. Recent data suggests that free radicals may be important in skin tumor promotion. The first stage of promotion is partially irreversible and can be accomplished by a single treatment of a tumor promoter such as TPA or by non-promoting agents such as 4-0-methyl-TPA, calcium ionophore A23187, and hydrogen peroxide, as well as wounding. These agents increase the number of dark basal keratinocytes, which suggest that these cells are important in the first stage of promotion.

The percentage of myopic children also differed between the two countries with the proportion with myopic refractive error <or=-0.75 D and decimal VA <0.8 at primary school level being 14.1% and 28.9% in Stara Zagora and Heraklion respectively and 13.0% and 46.9% (95% CI 18.2-29.2%, p < 0.0001) at secondary school level. Among the myopic pupils only 35.8% used corrective spectacles in Stara Zagora, compared to 70.7% of the children in Heraklion. Finally, myopia appeared more prevalent in female adolescents with the effect being statistically significant only for Greek children (55% vs 40% of males, p = 0.015). The increased proportion of myopic children in Heraklion, compared to Stara Zagora, may arise from a number of environmental and socio-economic factors, which need to be further investigated in order to understand the differences observed among European populations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Acanthocephalan infections in gammarids are linked with decreased activity of the prophenoloxidase (ProPO) system, suggesting an active immunosuppression process. Nevertheless, experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking: whether these parasites affect several immune pathways is unknown and the consequences of such immune change have not been investigated. In particular, the consequences for other pathogens are not known; neither are the links with other parasite-induced manipulations of the host. Firstly, using experimental infections of Pomphorhynchus laevis we confirmed that the lower immune activity in parasitised Gammarus pulex is induced by the parasite infection. Second, using natural infections of three different parasites, P. laevis, Pomphorhynchus tereticollis and Polymorphus minutus, we showed that acanthocephalan infection was associated with reduction of the activity of the ProPO system and the haemocyte concentration (two major parameters of crustacean immunity) suggesting that immune depression is a phenomenon affecting several immunological activities. This was confirmed by the fact that acanthocephalan infection (whatever the parasite species) was linked to a lower efficiency to eliminate a bacterial infection. The result suggests a cost of parasite immune depression. Finally, acanthocephalans are also known to induce behavioural alterations in the intermediate host which favour their transmission to definitive hosts. We did not find any correlation between behavioural and immunological alterations in both experimentally and naturally-infected gammarids. Overall, this study suggests that whilst immune depression might be beneficial to acanthocephalan survival within the intermediate gammarid host, it might also be costly if it increases host mortality to additional infections before transmission of the parasite.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The speech stimuli were presented in an oddball paradigm and the cortical ERPs were recorded in both active and passive listening conditions for each stimulus intensity. Both ERP amplitudes and behavioral discrimination (d') scores were lower for listeners with sensorineural hearing loss than for those with normal hearing.

{"seq_id": "76eb9fd4-4bad-439a-b07a-35af4e67c9f5", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\n【1】Most cancer cells take up glucose at higher rates than normal cells, but use a smaller fraction of this glucose for oxidative phosphorylation^[@R1]--[@R9]^. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, increased glycolysis in cancer cells has been well accepted to be an important process to support malignant phenotypes^[@R6]^. The importance of this effect is further underscored by recent studies which reported that impaired mitochondrial function renders cancer cells resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy^[@R10],[@R11]^. Our recent studies also demonstrated that inhibiting glycolysis sensitizes cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel^[@R12]^ and ErbB2 targeting antibody trastuzumab^[@R13]^. This suggests that mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism play a critical role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.\n\n【2】ErbB2 (also known as Her2/neu) is an oncogene that is overexpressed in many types of cancers and is correlated with a poor prognosis^[@R14]^. We and others^[@R15]--[@R19]^ have previously demonstrated that ErbB2 increases the transformation and/or metastatic potential of human breast cancer. In addition, ErbB2 has been shown to activate signaling molecules which regulate bioenergetic metabolism^[@R17],[@R19],[@R20],[@R21],[@R22]^. Our previous study showed that ErbB2 promotes cancer cell growth and glycolysis through increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (LDH-A)^[@R23]^. However, it is unclear whether, in addition to the enhancement of glycolysis, ErbB2 also regulates cell metabolism through additional processes. It is well established that ErbB2 localizes to the plasma membrane where it phosphorylates downstream substrates on their tyrosine residues in response to extracellular stimulation. Recent studies also have shown that ErbB2 can translocate into the nucleus and putatively function as a transcription factor^[@R24]^. One study has shown that Heregulin β1 regulates cytochrome c oxidase subunit II in mammary epithelial cells^[@R25]^. Another report described that the blockade of the ErbB2 receptor induces cardiomyocyte death through mitochondria and reactive oxygen species-dependent pathways^[@R26]^. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of proteins in mitochondria have been reported through several important kinases and phosphatases, such as PKC and Abl^[@R27]^, Src^[@R28]^, MAPK^[@R29]^, and Shp-2^[@R30]^. In addition, EGFR, another member of the EGFR family proteins, has been reported to translocate into mitochondria^[@R31]^. These studies suggest that the subcellular localization of ErbB2 may define its signaling specificity and ErbB2 may regulate mitochondrial functions.\n\n【3】Results {#S2}\n=======\n\n【4】Localization of ErbB2 in Mitochondria of cancer cells {#S3}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】While investigating the role of ErbB2 in regulating cellular metabolism, we unexpectedly observed that ErbB2 also exists in the mitochondria of ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells. We analyzed the organelle fractions from multiple breast cancer cell lines and patient samples ([Supplementary Methods](#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). In addition to plasma membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, ErbB2 was present in mitochondrial fraction of two ErbB2 transfected cancer cell lines MCF7/ErbB2 and MDA-MB-231/ErbB2, and of two natural ErbB2-positive cancer cell lines BT474 and SKBR3, detected by Western blotting (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1A]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To eliminate the possibility that the bands of mtErbB2 were due to contamination from other organelles, the Western blots were probed for different cellular organelle markers. The results indicate that the mitochondrial fraction we prepared was of high purity. Similar results were obtained from tumor samples of ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients and the MCF7 breast cancer cells which express moderate levels of ErbB2 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1B]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We also observed that ErbB2 also localized in the mitochondria of the heart and liver tissues of normal mouse (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1B]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), suggesting that the mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 is not due to overexpression of ErbB2, which may lead to mislocalization.\n\n【6】To further verify these results, fluorescent microscopy was performed using the MCF-7/ErbB2 cells. The images showed that ErbB2 (red) was sporadically distributed in the cytoplasm in addition to the strong staining of the plasma membrane (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1C]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). After merging red (ErbB2) and green (Mitotracker), the image showed a yellow color, supporting that ErbB2 is present in mitochondria. Similar results were also detected in SKBR3 cells, which naturally overexpress endogenous ErbB2 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S1]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 was further confirmed by immuno-gold transmission electron microscopy in SKBR3 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S2]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n【7】To determine whether ErbB2 was inside of mitochondria, we conducted protease sensitivity experiments by incubation of mitochondria with proteinase K in the presence or absence of triton X-100. Without triton X-100, ErbB2 and Prohibitin (an inner membrane protein) were resistant to proteinase K, whereas Bcl-2, which is localized on the outer membrane, was degraded (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1D]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). When proteinase K was added to mitochondria in the presence of triton X-100, all of the proteins were degraded, indicating that like Prohibitin, ErbB2 exists inside of mitochondria.\n\n【8】Identification of the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence {#S4}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】We next studied whether ErbB2 has an endogenous mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and how ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria. An online mitochondrial localization prediction program showed that ErbB2 has a strong possibility of localizing in mitochondria (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Table S1]</u>(#SD1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), suggesting that ErbB2 may have an endogenous MTS. The juxtamembrane region of the ErbB2 contains basic amino acids, which are similar to other known mitochondrial proteins, such as Tom20. These proteins contain a MTS consisting of highly hydrophobic and basic amino acid-rich sequences in their transmembrane domains (TMD) and membrane flanking regions. To determine whether the juxtamembrane region of ErbB2 constitutes a functional MTS, expression plasmids encoding GFP-tagged ErbB2 trans- and juxtamembrane sequences were constructed (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2A]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The constructs included GFP alone, GFP plus the ErbB2 juxtamembrane region (aa 646--689), GFP fused with TMD (aa 623--645), and GFP plus transmembrane domain fused with juxtamembrane region (aa 623--689). These constructs were transfected into MCF7 cells. The location of GFP alone and the GFP-ErbB2 fusion proteins was determined by fluorescent microscopy. The results showed that the juxtamembrane (aa 646--689) domain contains a nuclear localization signal and the distribution of GFP was mostly in the nucleus. Transmembrane domain alone (aa 623--645) was insufficient to target GFP into mitochondria. However, the fused domains (aa 623--689) did target the GFP into mitochondria, indicating that this region is sufficient for ErbB2 localization to the mitochondria.\n\n【10】To determine whether the basic amino acid-rich sequence in the juxtamembrane and transmembrane region was required for ErbB2 translocation into mitochondria, expression plasmids encoding ErbB2 with an aa 623--689 deletion (ErbB2ΔMTS) were transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells. The mitochondrial fractions were isolated and the samples subjected to Western Blotting analysis. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2B]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows that ErbB2 with the aa 623--689 deletion could not translocate into mitochondria, defining a novel mitochondrial targeting function of this region in ErbB2. We also conducted confocal imaging analysis and the co-localization was analyzed by NIH ImageJ software in 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2Mito and 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells. Approximately 80% 231ErbB2Mito cells showed mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 and only 10% 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells showed mtErbB2 localization (data not shown). Together, these results clearly indicate that the transmembrane domain plus aa 646--689 of ErbB2 are both sufficient and necessary for mitochondrial localization of ErbB2.\n\n【11】mtHSP70-Dependent Translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria {#S5}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】To study how ErbB2 was translocated into mitochondria, immunoprecipitation with antibodies against ErbB2 was conducted using mitochondrial proteins extracted from ErbB2-positive SKBR3 cells to identify mitochondrial proteins that interact with ErbB2. An SDS-PAGE gel of the immunoprecipitated proteins was stained with Coomassie Blue. The proteins extracted from the gel were subjected to Mass Spectrometry. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S3]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} shows that among the candidate proteins that are associated with ErbB2, one protein has a molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa. This protein was identified as mtHSP70 by Mass Spectrometry. This is an interesting finding since mtHSP70 is a key player in the classic mitochondrial importation pathway^[@R32]^. To verify this result, immunoprecipitation using anti-ErbB2 antibody followed by Western blotting with mtHSP70, and reverse immunoprecipitation using anti-mtHSP70 antibody followed by Western blotting with ErbB2 were performed to determine whether ErbB2 associates with mtHSP70 in MDA-MB-231/ErbB2 cells, which express exogenous ErbB2 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2C]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). The results showed that both proteins can be detected by Western blotting when mitochondrial proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the other protein. Similar results were obtained with SKBR3 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2C]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower).\n\n【13】To further confirm that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through mtHSP70 pathway, we transfected a siRNA specific to mtHSP70 into SKBR3 cells to knockdown mtHSP70 and examined the distribution of ErbB2 in the cells by Western Blotting. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2D]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows that compared to that of the control scramble siRNA transfected cells, the amount of ErbB2 in mitochondria was decreased while a relatively larger amount of ErbB2 accumulated in cytoplasm was found in the mtHSP70 siRNA transfected cells. In contrast, the protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II in mitochondria were not affected by mtHSP70 knockdown, since this protein is encoded and synthesized in mitochondria and does not participate in the mitochondrial protein importation^[@R33]^. Similar results were observed when we transfected SKBR3 cells with another independent siRNA to mtHSP70 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S4]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Thus, these data clearly indicate that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through an mtHSP70 mediated mitochondrial importation pathway.\n\n【14】MtErbB2 switches cancer cell metabolism {#S6}\n---------------------------------------\n\n【15】To examine whether mtErbB2 modulates mitochondrial functions, we transfected the expression vectors containing wild-type ErbB2 (ErbB2WT) and ErbB2 fused to a MTS derived from the mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) complex IV (ErbB2Mito) into MDA-MB-231 cells. We also constructed the expression vector containing the aa 623--689 deletion of ErbB2 (ErbB2ΔMTS) and expressed the plasmids in MDA-MB-231 cells. While the expression of ErbB2 in the whole cell lysates are similar in 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2Mito and 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells, the mtErbB2 expression level in ErbB2Mito cells was much higher than that of in ErbB2WT cells (approximately 20 fold measured by protein band intensity quantitation), while there was no detectable ErbB2 found in the mitochondrial fraction of 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells, indicating that the MTS signal targets ErbB2 into mitochondria (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3A]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To exclude the possibility that transfection might affect mitochondrial integrity, we measured the protein expression of several components of the ETS complexes including complex I subunit NDUFB 8, complex II subunit I p (30 kD), complex III subunit core2, COX II (cytochrome c oxidase-II) and ATP Synthase F1α in these cells by immunoblotting. All these proteins were expressed in similar amounts in these cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S5A]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). In addition, the mitochondrial structure and mass of these transfectants were similar as shown by fluorescent microscopy (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S5B]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The amounts of mitochondrial DNA encoded genes ND1, COX 1, COX 2 and ATP Synthase also were similar in these cells measured by real time quantitative PCR (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S5C]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). These results indicate that mitochondrial integrity was not affected by transfection of the ErbB2 expression vectors.\n\n【16】To examine whether mtErbB2 affects the respiratory function of mitochondria, we first measured oxygen consumption which is a direct indicator of mitochondrial respiration. Oxygen consumption in 231ErbB2Mito cells was decreased compared to 231V and 231ErbB2WT cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3B]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}), while 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells and kinase defective mutant ErbB2 transfected cells (231ErbB2MitoKM) had no significant changes, indicating that the overall level of cellular respiration was suppressed by the mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 and the kinase activity of mtErbB2 is required for this. We next conducted assays to examine the enzyme activities of ETS complex I, II, IV, and V (ATP synthase). We found that although the proteins were expressed at similar levels (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S5A]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), the activities of complex I, II and IV were decreased by mtErbB2. However, the activity of complex V did not change (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3C]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We next examined the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which reflects the efficiency of pumping of hydrogen ions across the inner membrane during the process of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, by detecting the aggregation of JC-1 in these cells^[@R31]^. We found that the mitochondrial membrane potential of 231ErbB2WT was lower than 231V, while 231ErbB2Mito was the lowest and 231ErbB2ΔMTS and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells had no significant changes (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3D]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To test whether mitochondrial membrane potential changes resulted in cellular ATP level fluctuation, we measured ATP/ADP levels. The results showed that 231V, 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2ΔMTS and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells had a similar ATP/ADP ratio, while the ratio in 231ErbB2Mito cells was decreased (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3E]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These results clearly indicate that mitochondrial localization of kinase intact ErbB2 negatively regulates the mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation through suppressing the activities of ETS complexes.\n\n【17】As glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are linked processes^[@R34]^, we reasoned that mtErbB2 may increase glycolysis in these cells. To test this, we compared glucose uptake and lactate production, two hallmarks of glycolysis, in 231V, 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2Mito, 231ErbB2ΔMTS, and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells. We observed that 231ErbB2Mito cells show the highest rates of glucose uptake and lactate production among these cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3, F and G]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that mtErbB2 promotes glycolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that mtErbB2 switches cancer cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis.\n\n【18】MtErbB2 renders resistance to hypoxia and ETS inhibitors {#S7}\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】To evaluate whether mtErbB2 causes functional changes in response to cell stress, we treated the cells with specific inhibitors of mitochondrial ETS complexes and glycolysis. We found that mtErbB2 renders cancer cells resistant to the ETS inhibitor Oligomycin (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4, A and B]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), suggesting that 231ErbB2Mito cells are dependent less upon energy supplied by oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, 231ErbB2Mito cells were more sensitive to the glycolysis inhibitors 2-DG and Oxamate, indicating these cells are dependent more upon glycolysis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4, A and B]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). These findings are consistent with the results that mtErbB2 negatively regulates cancer cell mitochondrial respiratory functions and promotes glycolysis. We next mimicked a hypoxia environment with CoCl~2~ treatment and examined glycolysis indicators in these cells. The results showed that the oxygen consumption of 231V, 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2ΔMTS and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells decreased by about 15--30%, while 231ErbB2Mito cells were insensitive to hypoxia (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4C]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We also observed that under hypoxia the glucose uptake and lactate production of 231V, 231ErbB2ΔMTS and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells were sharply increased, approaching the levels of the 231ErbB2WT and 231ErbB2Mito cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4C]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that in a low oxygen environment mtErbB2 renders cancer cell dependent less upon the energy supplied by oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n【20】mtErbB2 increases cancer cell trastuzumab resistance {#S8}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which specifically targets the extracellular domain of ErbB2 and has shown a remarkable clinical efficacy in the treatment of ErbB2-positive cancer patients. However, many patients eventually develop resistance to trastuzumab after continuous treatment. The mechanisms of this resistance have been extensively studied, yet the precise mechanism remains elusive. It has been shown that treatment with trastuzumab induces ErbB2 internalization through endocytosis. However, not all the ErbB2 withdrawn from the plasma membrane enters into endosomes and lysosomes ready for degradation^[@R35]^. In addition, dysregulated cellular metabolism has been reported to cause cancer cell drug resistance^[@R12],[@R13]^. Thus we hypothesized that the treatment of trastuzumab would induce the translocation of the surface bound ErbB2 into mitochondria and alter cellular metabolism, which may provide a mechanism for trastuzumab resistance. Indeed, we observed a dramatic elevation of mtErbB2 in trastuzumab-resistant cells than that of parental BT474 cells by Western blotting (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5A]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Trastuzumab induced the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria in a time dependent manner in BT474 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5B]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} & 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S6A]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), while the total ErbB2 levels in the cells did not significantly change (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5B]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}, right). We next explored whether mtErbB2-overexpressing cells are more resistant to trastuzumab. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5C]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows that when the cells were treated with 100 ug/ml trastuzumab, 231ErbB2Mito cells were more resistant to trastuzumab compared to 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2ΔMTS, 231ErbB2MitoKM and 231ErbB2WT cells treated with siRNA to mtHSP70. Importantly, blocking ErbB2 translocation into mitochondria by the deletion of endogenous MTS renders 231ErbB2ΔMTS cells more sensitive to trastuzumab compared to 231ErbB2WT (P\\< 0.05) and 231ErbB2Mito cells (P\\<0.01), indicating that translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria leads to cancer cell resistant to trastuzumab. These results reveal a novel mechanism for trastuzumab resistance in ErbB2-positive cancer cells.\n\n【22】Translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria is kinase dependent {#S9}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Since ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase, we wondered whether the kinase activity of ErbB2 is responsible for the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria. We compared the mtErbB2 in multiple MDA-MB-435 variants that express ErbB2 mutants with different tyrosine kinase activities. The 435eb expresses wild type ErbB2 (435eb), 435V659E (435VE) mutant has an enhanced kinase activity of ErbB2 and 435K753M (435KM) has one amino acid mutation within the kinase domain, showing a defective kinase activity^[@R36]^. The results showed that the expression of mtErbB2 in 435VE cells was much higher than 435eb, while the amount of mtErbB2 in 435K753M was the lowest (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6A]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To further verify these results, we treated MCF7/ErbB2 cells with Heregulin β1 (HRG) which stimulates the dimerizaiton and activation of ErbB2 or the specific ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 which represses the kinase activity of ErbB2. Compared to those of untreated cells, MCF7/ErbB2 cells exhibited higher mtErbB2 levels when treated with HRG but decreased mtErbB2 when treated with AG825 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6B]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, upper). HRG indeed increased the phosphorylation of ErbB2 while the treatment with AG825 decreased the phosphorylation although the total amount of ErbB2 in the cells was similar (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6B]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, lower). Similar results were also obtained from MCF7 cell line which expresses a moderate ErbB2 level. Similarly, treatment of MCF7 cells with HRG also led to an increased translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6C]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We further confirmed the results by examining the activities of mtErbB2 upon trastuzumab (HCP) treatment on BT474 HCPR trastuzumab resistant cells. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary Fig. S7]</u>(#SD2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, in trastuzumab resistant BT474 HCPR cells, HRG induced phosphorylation of mtErbB2 was not significantly inhibited by trastuzumab. This result is consistent with our previous results that translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria is dependent on its kinase activity, which contributes to the function of mtErbB2 in regulating cellular metabolism.\n\n【24】We next explored mitochondrial proteins that may interact with mtErB2 and potential substrates of mtErbB2 tyrosine kinase. We isolated mitochondrial fractions from SKBR3 cells and performed immunoprecipitation with antibodies against ErbB2. An SDS-PAGE gel of the immunoprecipitated proteins was stained with Coomassie Blue. The proteins extracted from the gel were subjected to Mass Spectrometry (data not show). We found that cytochrome c oxidase II (Cox II) was among the putative binding partners of mtErbB2. To verify this result, immunoprecipitations using anti-ErbB2 antibody followed by Western blotting with Cox II, and reverse immunoprecipitations using anti-Cox II antibody followed by Western blotting with ErbB2 were performed to determine whether ErbB2 associates with Cox II in SKBR3 cells. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6D]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"} (left) shows that both proteins could be detected by Western blotting when mitochondrial proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibody against the other protein, indicating the interaction between mtErbB2 and Cox II. Moreover, we found that the phosphorylation of Cox II was inversely correlated with the kinase activity of mtErbB2 by comparing the phosphorylation levels on Cox II in different ErbB2 mutants transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 6D]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}, right), suggesting that mtErbB2 regulates the level of tyrosine phosphorylation on Cox II through an indirect mechanism. Since phosphorylation on Cox II activates cytochrome c oxidase which leads to cytochrome c oxidation and to be released from mitochondria to trigger apoptosis^[@R37],[@R11]^, we compared the cytochrome c oxidase activity among vector alone, erbB2WT, ErbB2Mito, and ErbB2MitoKM cells as previously described^[@R11]^. We found that mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 markedly decreased the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in an ErbB2 kinase dependent manner (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 6E]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To examine whether mitochondrial localization of ErbB2 antagonizes apoptosis of cancer cells, we measured cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytoplasm in these cell variants. 231V, 231ErbB2WT, 231ErbB2Mito and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells were treated with an apoptosis inducer paclitaxel (Taxol), followed by cellular organelle separation and Western Blotting. 231V and 231ErbB2MitoKM cells are sensitive to Taxol-induced apoptosis, indicated by a significant amount of cytochrome c released from mitochondria into cytoplasm. However, 231ErbB2Mito cells showed the strongest resistant to Taxol with the least releasing of cytochrome c into cytoplasm (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 6F]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that suppression of Cox II phosphorylation by mtErbB2, which subsequently leads to decreased activity of cytochrome c oxidase, reduced cytochrome c oxidation, and less cytochrome c release, contributes to the anti-apoptosis of cancer cells.\n\n【25】Discussion {#S10}\n==========\n\n【26】Recent studies demonstrate that receptor tyrosine kinases can transmit intracellular signals from endosomes and other intracellular compartments, and the precise subcellular location can define signaling specificity in a manner that is not yet understood^[@R38]^. Mitochondria have been considered not merely the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, but also a critical organelle with diverse cellular functions. Mitochondria have crucial roles in apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production, and numerous other metabolic processes. Here we report a novel localization of ErbB2 in mitochondria in ErbB2-positive cancer cells and patient samples. This intriguing discovery may open a new avenue for studying the normal and cancerous roles of ErbB2, which may lead to more effective therapeutics for cancer treatment. Moreover, we identified the endogenous mitochondrial targeting sequence of ErbB2 and the association of ErbB2 with mitochondrial transportation protein mtHSP70. Both deletion of the endogenous mitochondrial targeting sequence and downregulation of mtHSP70 blocked the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria, suggesting the translocation is physiologically relevant.\n\n【27】By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we validated the interaction of mtErbB2 with Cox II. We observed that the level of phosphorylation on Cox II was inversely correlated with the kinase activity of mtErbB2, suggesting that kinase active mtErbB may activate a phosphatase in mitochondria to de-phosphorylate Cox II. Alternatively, mtErbB2 may lead to de-association of Cox II from a tyrosine kinase that directly phosphorylates Cox II. These results indicate that mtErbB2 may regulate the components of ETS, thus leads to the alteration of mitochondrial function. However, our available data could not exclude the possibility that mtErbB2 regulates mitochondrial respiration through an indirect mechanism. Further investigations are needed on the precise mechanism for how mtErbB2 regulates cancer cell metabolism. It has been reported that EGFR increases glucose uptake independent of its kinase activity^[@R39]^. However, we observed that the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria is facilitated by ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activation, implying that mtErbB2 phosphorylates substrates in mitochondria to trigger signaling cascades and regulates mitochondrial function.\n\n【28】In our previous studies we found that in breast cancer cells, ErbB2 promotes glycolysis at least partially through the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)-mediated upregulation of LDH-A^[@R23]^. Moreover, trastuzumab inhibits glycolysis via downregulation of HSF1 and LDH-A in ErbB2-positive cancer cells; increased glycolysis contributes to trastuzumab resistance, and targeting glycolysis increases the sensibility of cancer cells to trastuzumab^[@R13]^. In the current study we found that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria and negatively regulates the respiration function. Collectively, these results suggest that ErbB2 not only promotes glycolysis by up-regulating glycolytic enzyme LDH-A, but also inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Both effects of ErbB2 on cellular metabolism drive ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells toward a Warburg Effect-like phenotype. This may explain ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cell's high capacity to adapt and survive stressful conditions.\n\n【29】In summary, our studies demonstrate that a significant amount of ErbB2 is located in mitochondria in cancer cells and patient samples. We found that the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria is through a classic mitochondria translocation pathway facilitated by mtHSP70. Moreover, we found that mtErbB2 regulates mitochondrial respiratory functions and switches the energy dependency of cancer cells from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Importantly, we have provided evidence to support that the translocation of ErbB2 into mitochondria is a novel mechanism for trastuzumab resistance. These findings raise important questions such as: What is the detailed mechanism of mtErbB2 regulating the respiratory function of mitochondria? What are the implications of mtErbB2 in cancer development and therapeutics? Answers to these questions will not only solve an intriguing problem for the field of cancer biology, but more importantly, they may lead to the discovery of a novel biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast and other cancers.\n\n【30】Methods {#S11}\n=======\n\n【31】Cell lines and cell cultures {#S12}\n----------------------------\n\n【32】Human breast cancer cells MCF7, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, BT474 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection; BT474 and its trastuzumab resistant variants were gifts from Dr. Rita Nahta from Emory University.

This active sampling is revealed by rapid changes in respiratory rate that influence the olfactory input. Yet the role of sniffing in shaping the neural responses to odorants has not been elucidated. In the olfactory bulb (OB), odorant-evoked gamma oscillations reflect the synchronous activity of mitral/tufted cells, a proposed mechanism for odorant representation. Here we examined the effect of sniffing frequency on the odorant-evoked gamma oscillations in the OB. We simultaneously recorded the respiratory rate and the local field potential while rats performed a lick/no-lick olfactory discrimination task with low odorant concentrations. High-frequency sniffing (HFS) augmented the power of gamma oscillations, suggesting an increase in the sensitivity to odorants. By contrast, coupling of the gamma oscillations to the sniff cycle and the amplitude of individual bursts were not modified by the respiratory rate. However, HFS prolonged the overall response to odorants and increased the frequency of the gamma oscillations, indicating that HFS reduces the adaptation to continuous odorant stimulation. Therefore, the increase in gamma power during HFS is the result of more frequent gamma bursts and the extended response to odorants. As odorant discrimination can be performed in a single sniff, a reduction in the adaptation mediated by HFS of novel odorants may facilitate odorant memory formation for subsequent odorant identification. Finally, these results corroborate that olfactory sampling should be integrated to the study of odorant coding in behaving animals.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Thus, Vα14 NKT cells serve as a front line defense against various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and intracytoplasmic parasites ([@bib5], [@bib6]).\n\n【3】Because Vα14 NKT cells are relatively abundant in the liver, the site of choice for islet transplantation, and because IFN-γ is believed to be an important factor in the destruction of islet β cells, we hypothesized that Vα14 NKT cells in the liver might be involved in islet graft failure. We demonstrate that, in mice, IFN-γ--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells and Vα14 NKT cells are major components of the early graft loss of transplanted islets and the low efficiency of pancreatic islet transplants. Our findings provide an approach to improve transplant efficiency through the modulation of Vα14 NKT cell function.\n\n【4】Results AND Discussion\n======================\n\n【5】Vα14 NKT cells are responsible for early islet graft loss\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】To test the possibility that Vα14 NKT cells are involved in islet graft failure, we attempted to establish an experimental system of islet transplantation. We first examined the minimum number of donor islets required to ameliorate hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. C57BL/6 mice became hyperglycemic and diabetic soon after the i.v. injection of STZ (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} A). In STZ-induced diabetic mice, 400 syngeneic islets transplanted into the liver were found to be sufficient to achieve normoglycemia (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} B, left), whereas normoglycemia could not be achieved by the transplantation of 200 syngeneic islets, the number of islets that can be isolated from a single mouse pancreas (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} C, left). In agreement with biochemical data, intact islets with well-granulated β cells were histologically seen in mice receiving 400 islets, whereas damaged islets with degranulated β cells were observed in mice receiving 200 islets (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1, B and C]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, right).\n\n【7】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Vα14 NKT cells are responsible for the early loss of syngeneic islet grafts.

All diabetic Jα281^−/−^ mice became normoglycemic by day 11 after transplantation of 200 or even 100 islets (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1, D and E]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, left). Histological examination also clearly demonstrated the existence of intact islet grafts with well-granulated β cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} D, right), suggesting that Vα14 NKT cells are responsible for graft rejection of transplanted islets.\n\n【9】To prove the deleterious effects of Vα14 NKT cells on grafted islets, 5 × 10^6^ liver mononuclear cells isolated from naive WT, Jα281^−/−^, or IFN-γ--deficient mice were injected at the time of transplantation into the portal vein of diabetic Jα281^−/−^ mice receiving 200 syngeneic islets. Diabetic Jα281^−/−^ mice injected with cells from WT mice remained hyperglycemic 60 d after transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"} F, left), whereas those with cells from Jα281^−/−^ or IFN-γ--deficient mice became normoglycemic (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1, G and H]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, left). Histological examination also proved the existence of intact islets in the recipients of cells from Jα281^−/−^ or IFN-γ--deficient mice, but not from WT mice (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1, F--H]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, right). The results suggest that Vα14 NKT cells and IFN-γ are essential components of early graft failure.\n\n【10】Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells induced by transplantation are effector cells for early graft loss\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】To elucidate cellular changes associated with islet graft failure, hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated periodically after islet transplantation and examined by FACS using α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)--loaded CD1d (α-GalCer--CD1d) tetramers. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of α-GalCer--CD1d tetramer^+^ Vα14 NKT cells initially decreased from 10.3% at 0 h to ∼5% at 6 h but then surged to 19.2% at 24 h after islet transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A, left). The findings indicate the activation of Vα14 NKT cells that down-modulate their receptor expression, resulting in the failure to detect Vα14 NKT cells by α-GalCer--CD1d tetramers, as reported previously ([@bib10]--[@bib12]). Furthermore, Vα14 NKT cells obtained at 2--6 h after transplantation produced inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-1β (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A), suggesting that Vα14 NKT cells are activated by transplantation. After the disappearance of Vα14 NKT cells, Vα14 NKT cells expand rapidly, as shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A (24 h) and as previously reported ([@bib10]--[@bib12]). Interestingly, the proportion of α-GalCer--CD1d tetramer^−^ cells producing high levels of INF-γ increased markedly from 0.5 to 14.3% at 6 h after islet transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A, left). The α-GalCer--CD1d tetramer^−^ cells were further gated, analyzed for Gr-1 and CD11b expression in relation to IFN-γ production, and determined to be Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} B). Gr-1^+^ CD11b^+^ cells were CD11c^−^, CD86^−^, MHC class II^−^, F4/80^+/−^, and CD68^+/−^ (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} C) and were neutrophils in morphology (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} D), indicating that these cells are neutrophils. The neutrophils that infiltrated the transplanted islet (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} D) are likely to be the effector cells, because the injection of antibodies against Gr-1 or CD11b prevented the rejection of islet transplants (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>(#fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【12】![INF-γ--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells generated after syngeneic islet transplantation. (A) Requirement of Vα14 NKT cells for induction of IFN-γ--producing cells. Liver mononuclear cells isolated from WT or Jα281^−/−^ mice 2, 6, and 24 h after the transplantation of 200 islets were examined by FACS with PE--α-GalCer--CD1d tetramers and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti--IFN-γ (left) or allophycocyanin-conjugated anti--IL-4 (right).

STZ-induced diabetic mice transplanted with 200 islets were injected intraportally with control antibody (A), anti--Gr-1 mAb (B), or anti-CD11b mAb (C).](20050448f3){#fig3}\n\n【14】In marked contrast to WT mice, the increase in IFN-γ--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells was not seen in Jα281^−/−^ mice (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A, left), suggesting that the activation of Vα14 NKT cells after islet transplantation triggers the induction of IFN-γ production by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells. Note that no increase in IL-4--producing cells was observed regardless of the presence or absence of Vα14 NKT cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} A, right).\n\n【15】It is well known that soon after activation with α-GalCer or IL-12, Vα14 NKT cells produce IFN-γ, which, in turn, stimulates IFN-γ secretion by other cells, such as NK cells or CD8 T cells ([@bib9], [@bib13], [@bib14]). In fact, a single injection of α-GalCer dramatically augmented IFN-γ production in Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} D), suggesting that Vα14 NKT cells indeed activate Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells to produce IFN-γ. It is thus likely that increased IFN-γ production by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells is a direct consequence of Vα14 NKT cell activation triggered by islet transplantation, although molecules responsible for the activation of Vα14 NKT cells remain to be determined.\n\n【16】Similar to IFN-γ--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells, IL-4--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells induced by aluminum hydroxide, when antigens precipitated by aluminum hydroxide are used for immunization, play an important role in B cell activation ([@bib15]). Despite the similarities in antigen independence and importance in the immune responses of these two populations, several apparent differences are noted, such as the fact that IL-4--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells are evident 6 d after immunization, whereas IFN-γ--producing Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells appear soon (6 h) after transplantation. The findings suggest functional diversity, although it is unclear whether the two populations are the same or different cells producing different cytokines at different time points.\n\n【17】Prevention of early graft loss by modulation of Vα14 NKT cell function\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】In agreement with previously reported data ([@bib16]), Vα14 NKT cells secreted large amounts of IFN-γ immediately after stimulation with α-GalCer but stopped producing IFN-γ after repeated α-GalCer stimulation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>(#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} A). Therefore, we hypothesized that repeated α-GalCer injections would modify IFN-γ production by Vα14 NKT cells and thus affect graft survival. To test this possibility, STZ-induced diabetic WT mice that had received 400 islets were treated once with vehicle at the time of transplantation; all mice became normoglycemic (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>(#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} B). When diabetic WT mice that had received 400 islets were treated with a single 100-μg/kg injection of α-GalCer, none of the mice became normoglycemic even 60 d after transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>(#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} C). In contrast, when WT mice were treated three times with 100 μg/kg α-GalCer on days 15, 11, and 7 before the induction of diabetes before islet transplantation, the transplantation of only 200 islets restored normoglycemia in all recipient mice within 10 d (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>(#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} E). Mice treated with vehicle instead of α-GalCer remained hyperglycemic (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 4]</u>(#fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"} D). In agreement with our prediction, the results demonstrated that repeated α-GalCer injections before islet transplantation resulted in the down-regulation of IFN-γ production, which positively affected islet engraftment.\n\n【19】![Prevention of syngeneic islet graft failure by repeated α-GalCer treatment.

FACS analysis revealed that Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells expanded rapidly after islet transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} B) compared with nontransplanted controls (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} A). The influx of Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells is independent of Vα14 NKT cells because increased numbers of Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells were detected in Jα281^−/−^ mice after islet transplantation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} C), suggesting that Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells are generated by transplantation. However, IFN-γ production by Gr-1^+^ CD11b^+^ cells was dramatically augmented by a single injection of α-GalCer (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} D) but diminished to a level equivalent to the vehicle-treated control (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} E) when repeated injections of α-GalCer were given (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 5]</u>(#fig5){ref-type=\"fig\"} F). Thus, IFN-γ production by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells is totally dependent on the activation status of Vα14 NKT cells. The findings on the protection of disease development by repeated α-GalCer injections were also reported in a type I diabetes model ([@bib17]). It has been reported that IFN-γ is an essential molecule in the destruction of islets, causing the development of diabetes in a mouse model of virus-induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ([@bib18]). Furthermore, IFN-γ has been shown to induce nitric oxide--mediated toxicity to islet β cells in vitro in combination with IL-1 ([@bib19]). It is thus likely that IFN-γ produced by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells might similarly affect islet β cells. Overall, our data suggest that the modulation of Vα14 NKT cell function by repeated α-GalCer stimulation in vivo manipulates IFN-γ production by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells and prevents immediate graft failure and the early loss of islet grafts, thus contributing to successful pancreatic islet transplantation.\n\n【22】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Effects of α-GalCer treatment on the production of IFN-γ by Gr-1^+^CD11b^+^ cells.

Similar to Vα14 NKT cells in mice, human Vα24 NKT cells also release large quantities of INF-γ on activation ([@bib20]), suggesting that the early graft loss of islets in humans is similarly mediated by Vα24 NKT cells. If this assumption is correct, treatment regimens aimed at the down-regulation of INF-γ production by human Vα24 NKT cells might help to prevent the early loss of islet grafts in clinical settings, even though Vα24 NKT cells are less frequent in the human liver ([@bib21]), and, thus, might help to increase the efficiency of pancreatic islet transplants.\n\n【25】MATERALS AND METHODS\n====================\n\n【26】Animals.\n--------\n\n【27】C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and C57BL/6 Jα281^−/−^ mice (10--15 wk old) raised in our facility were used ([@bib9]).

AA is naturally occurred in diverse foods such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and fruit beverages [@B002]. In addition, it is also added as a flavor enhancer in various beverages including soft drink and as a preservative in fruits and fish products [@B002]. AA provides a pleasant fruity aroma at low levels while it has an irritating odor note at high levels [@B002]. In fruits, it is produced as an intermediate in the respiration of higher plants, whereas, in alcoholic beverages, it is mainly formed by yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and the auto-oxidation of ethanol and phenolic compounds [@B003]. In addition, AA can be produced from alanine metabolism by some yeasts [@B004]. Its level can increase due to the chemical oxidation of ethanol during aging of spirits [@B005]. AA is also generated from Strecker degradation of alanine in the food systems [@B006],[@B007]. Furthermore, AA, a saturated aldehyde, can be formed as one of secondary products from the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids through chemical and/or enzymatic reactions in food systems [@B008]. AA is extremely reactive and binds readily to proteins, peptides, and amino acids [@B009]. AA is also able to cross-link to proteins, suggesting that it can react with DNA which may cause further biological changes, including mutagenesis and carcinogenesis [@B002]. In addition, AA can exacerbate the neurologic, hepatic, and cardiac complications of alcoholism and cause membrane damages and inhibition of several enzyme activities such as aldehyde dehydrogenase which causes metabolic strain to acetate [@B010]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified AA as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) and AA associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) [@B011].\n\n【2】FA is colorless, highly volatile, and flammable with a strong and irritating odor. It is readily soluble in water, alcohol, and other polar solvents. FA is commercially produced from methanol and used as a preservative, reducing agent, and a sterilizing agent in food industry [@B012]. It is naturally present as a product of normal metabolism in many foods including fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, crustacean, and dried mushrooms [@B012]. In some sea foods and crustaceans, FA is known to develop postmortem from the enzymatic reduction of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) in their bodies to FA and dimethylamine [@B013]. In this process, the level of FA is different among the species and between frozen and fresh seafood due to their different amount of TMAO from species to species and depending on bacterial activity [@B013]. FA is also generated from the oxidation of dietary methanol or methanol derived from aspartame, an artificial sweetener [@B014]. In addition, it can be formed from Strecker degradation of glycine in the presence of glyoxal in food system [@B015]. Furthermore, FA, a saturated aldehyde, is also derived from the lipid oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by chemical and enzymatic reactions in food systems [@B008]. FA has been related to the increased risks of leukemia and nasopharyngeal cancer in humans [@B016]. The classification of FA is carcinogenic to humans by IARC (Group 1) [@B017] and known to be a human carcinogen by the US National toxicology program (NTP) [@B018].\n\n【3】GC-electron capture detection (ECD), GC-mass spectrometry (MS), headspace (HS)-SPME GC system, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after derivatization are mostly used to determine AA and FA in foods [@B019]. Since both are highly volatile and reactive to carbonyl compounds, they are usually required to derivatize prior to analysis. The most common derivatization reagents include 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) [@B020],[@B021], PFBHA [@B022],[@B023], and 2-aminoethanethiol (cysteamine) [@B001],[@B024]. Regarding analytical methods for AA and FA, GC system has higher sensitivity and selectivity for both compounds compared to HPLC system [@B023].\n\n【4】AA in various foods was determined using HS-GC-FID after the extraction using simulated digestion, and the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0.01 mg/L and 0.04 mg/L, respectively [@B025]. In recent, AA in children foods including yogurt, purees, and milk products was analyzed using SPME-GC combined with time of flight (TOF)-MS after derivatization with PFBHA [@B026]. In addition, AA level in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages was also evaluated using GC-MS combined with SPME after PFBHA derivatization [@B027]. European Union (EU) has recommended that AA in alcoholic beverages such as spirits is analyzed using GC-flame ionization detection (FID) with a direct injection method [@B028]. The content of FA in various fish species was evaluated using SPME-GC-MS system based on derivatization with PFBHA with LOD of 17 µg/kg and LOQ of 28 µg/kg [@B013]. Its level in Korean traditional fermented foods including kimchi, soybean paste, and soy sauce was determined using HS-SPME-GC-MS after derivatization with 2,2,2,-trifluoroethylhydrazine (TFEH) [@B029]. There is little information available on the levels of AA and FA in a variety of foods since their determination has been reported in only very limited food products such as alcoholic beverages, fermented foods and fish products [@B021],[@B029],[@B030].\n\n【5】The objective of the current study was to determine the contents of both AA and FA in a variety of food groups consumed in Korea using SPME-GC-MS after derivatization with PFBHA.\n\n【6】MATERIALS AND METHOD\n====================\n\n【7】All chemicals used were of analytical grade. AA, FA, and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (an internal standard compound) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA, USA) and derivatizing agent PFBHA \\[O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro-benzyl)-hydroxylamine hydrochloride\\] was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n【8】Preparation of standard solutions and method validation. Stock standard solutions of AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ were prepared at 10,000 mg/L in deionized water. All standard solutions were stored at −5℃ before use. Validation was carried out in food matrices, such as peanut butter, beef, milk, 20% ethanol solution, rice porridge, orange juice, and corn oil. Calibration samples were prepared in the range of 5\\~10,000 ng/g using food matrices and standard solutions. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were defined as lowest concentration with signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios of 3.3 and 10, respectively.\n\n【9】Sample preparation and solid phase micro-extraction. All samples obtained were kept at −70℃ until being used for the experiments. Solid and semi-solid sample (1 g) were mixed with 9.950 mL of 30% NaCl solution and an internal standard \\[50 µL AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (10 µg/L, w/v)\\] and then sonicated at ambient temperature for 30 min. After the sample was centrifuged (3000 rpm) at 4℃ for 10 min and voltexed for 30 sec, supernatant (5 mL) was transferred to in 10-mL headspace vials with screw caps. Being mixed with 4.475 mL of 30% NaCl solution and an internal standard \\[25 µL AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ (10 µg/L, w/v)\\], liquid sample was sonicated at ambient temperature for 30 min. Then 100 mg potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) and 50 µL PFBHA (10 mg/mL) were added to 5 mL sample before voltexing for 30 sec and derivatizing at 45℃ for 40 min. SPME fiber coated with 65 µm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzebe (PDMS/DVB) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used to adsorb volatile compounds in the headspace at 45℃ for 15 min.\n\n【10】Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis was performed using a 7890A series gas chromatograph connected to a 5975C mass selective detector (MSD) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was run as a carrier gas at a constant column flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. In the case of SPME, the fiber was maintained in the splitless mode in GC injector at 220℃ for 5 min to desorb the adsorbed volatiles. GC oven temperature was held 50℃ for 2 min, raised to 120℃ at a rate 30℃/min and then held at 200℃ for 10 min. The other GC-MS conditions were as follow: The front inlet and detector transfer line temperatures were 220℃ and 250℃, respectively. Mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV through electron ionization (EI). Data were acquired in the selected-ion monitoring mode (SIM mode). AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~ derivatives were quantified at m/z-209, 195, and 211, respectively. Additionally, 181 at m/z was monitored for qualifier ion of AA, FA and AA 1,2-^13^C~2~.\n\n【11】RESULT AND DISCUSSION\n=====================\n\n【12】Method validation. An efficient method was developed to analyze the contents of AA and FA in various food matrices. Method validation included linearity, LOD, and repeatability of the present method using calibration samples spiked with authentic AA and FA compounds. Linearity (correlation efficient r) ranged from 0.949\\~0.9993 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#T001){ref-type=\"table\"}). LOD ranged from 5.74\\~175.03 ng/g. On the other hand, RSD (%) of precision ranged from 1.34\\~14.53, whereas recovery (%) was in the range of 68.37\\~128.22%. Our validation results showed that the method had an acceptable performance for their analytical method based on Guidelines for the Validation of Chemical Methods for the FDA Foods Program.\n\n【13】###### The equations and the correlation coefficients of aldehydes\n\n【14】  ------------------ ---------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------- -----------\n  Matrices           Calibration curve      Limit of detection (ng/g)   Calibration range (ng/g)   Linearity\n\n【15】  Acetaldehyde                                                                                 \n  Rice porridge      Y = 0.0031X − 0.7071   51.8                          50-10,000                0.0976\n  Orange juice       Y = 0.0029X + 0.2312   19.9                          50-10,000                0.9935\n  Corn oil           Y = 0.0022X + 0.2199   66.8                          50-10,000                0.9988\n  Peanut butter      Y = 0.0024X + 2.0043   175.03                      250-10,000                 0.9977\n  Beef               Y = 0.0025X + 0.426      25.08                     100-5,000                  0.9982\n  Milk               Y = 0.0023X − 0.0535       5.74                      50-10,000                0.9993\n  20% EtOH           Y = 0.0021X + 0.2879     12.57                       50-10,000                0.9973\n  Formaldehyde                                                                                 \n  Rice porridge      Y = 0.0038X − 0.2778   38.0                          50-10,000                0.9504\n  Orange juice       Y = 0.0029X − 0.0333   17.2                          50-10,000                0.9957\n  Corn oil           Y = 0.0073X − 0.7389   120.9                         50-10,000                0.949  \n  Peanut butter      Y = 0.0066X + 0.1529     15.05                       50-10,000                0.9921\n  Beef               Y = 0.0033X + 0.1611       7.80                    5-700                      0.9985\n  Milk               Y = 0.0056X + 0.0595     12.20                       5-1,000                  0.9974\n  20% EtOH           Y = 0.0027X + 0.0056     11.00                     10-1,000                   0.998  \n  ------------------ ---------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------- -----------\n\n【16】Aldehydes contents in food samples.

content of AA in fruits was in the range of 483.42\\~19,530.53 ng/g, whereas that of FA was in the range of 116.90\\~356.73 ng/g. There was a previous study on AA content in some fruits. AA content in apple, grape, kiwi, orange and pineapple was 320\\~2,390 ng/g, 910\\~3,230 ng/g, 730\\~810 ng/g, 5,560\\~8,370 ng/g, and 630 ng/g, respectively [@B025]. In the case of FA, its level was also different depending on fruits; 6,300\\~22,300 ng/g in apple, 22,400 ng/g in grape, and 9,200 ng/g in water melon [@B031]. The present results on AA content in apple and grape were similar to those of the previous studies [@B032]. However, in the case of kiwi, orange, and pineapple, higher content of AA was determined in this study compared to the previous ones. Also, AA content of canned pineapple was shown to be 483.42 ng/g, which was lower than that of raw pineapple. This result was consistent with that of a previous literature on the comparison of AA contents between canned and raw carrot samples [@B025]. In addition, FA contents of all fruits studied in this study were lower than those of the previous studies.\n\n【38】In dairy products, the overall content of AA was N.D\\~1,525.18 ng/g, whereas that of FA was 26.67\\~409.74 ng/g. A previous study showed that AA contents were 2,400\\~17,420 ng/g in yogurt, and 120\\~2,050 ng/g in cheeses, respectively [@B025]. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the content of naturally forming FA was about 13\\~57 ng/g, whereas some other studies demonstrated that it was in the range of 1,000\\~3,300 ng/g in milk, \\< 3,300 ng/g in cheese [@B031], and 164 ng/g in processed milk [@B033], respectively. Those results clearly indicated that the formation of FA can be increased by fermentation and thermal processing in dairy products. In the present study, the content of AA in yogurts and cheeses was similar to that those of previous researches. On the other hand, the content of FA in raw milk was shown to be 42.88\\~54.05 ng/g, which was in the range of natural FA content suggested by WHO. Also, the content of FA in processed milk was 43.50 ng/g, which was not increased compared to that of raw milk.\n\n【39】In alcohol-free beverages, the content of AA was N.D\\~20,061.48 ng/g, whereas that of FA was 125.28\\~1,522.46 ng/g. There have been some studies on the content of AA in various beverages. Different levels of AA were found depending on the types of beverages ; 1,350\\~9,860 ng/g (in teas), 930\\~1,630 ng/g (in fruit drinks), 280 ng/g (in soft drinks), 10\\~5,890 ng/g (in fresh fruit juices), and 150\\~16,300 ng/g (in processed juices). On the other hand, instant coffee and roasted coffee were shown to contain 31,200\\~35,510 ng/g and 1,150\\~40,140 ng/g of AA [@B025].\n\n【40】Also, a previous study on FA content in beverages reported that FA content of processed soft drinks such as cola, fruit/vegetable juices, instant coffee, and roasted coffee were 7,400\\~8,700 ng/g, 800,000 ng/g, 10,000\\~16,000 ng/g, and 3,400\\~4,500 ng/g, respectively [@B031]. FA in alcoholic beverage is thought to be mainly generated by bacteria that oxidize methanol [@B023]. Glycine is also converted to FA by Strecker degradation [@B034]. In the present study, AA content of tea was shown to be similar with those of previous studies whereas AA content of fruit drink was lower. We cannot detect AA in soft drinks, and previous studies also have reported lower AA concentration in soft drinks than other beverages.\n\n【41】In alcoholic beverages, the content of AA was 1,043.57\\~40,607.02 ng/g, whereas that of FA was determined to be 18.38\\~782.10 ng/g. Previous studies on AA contents in alcoholic beverages showed that AA contents of red wine, white wine, sparkling wine, champagne, beer, whiskey, Makgeolli, Soju (Korean distilled spirits), Sake, and liqueur were 6,818\\~55,800 ng/g, 6,818\\~67,000 ng/g, 123,000 ng/g, 2,355\\~8,460 ng/g, 76,900\\~15,263 ng/g, 9,561 ng/g, 805\\~13,371 ng/g, 10,368 ng/g, and 5,674\\~62,300 ng/g, respectively [@B023],[@B027]. On the other hand, FA contents of wine, beer, whiskey, Makgeolli, Soju, Sake and liqueur were 32 ng/g, 100\\~1,500 ng/g, 272 ng/g, 60 ng/g, 9\\~106 ng/g, 27 ng/g, and 228 ng/g, respectively [@B023],[@B033]. AA is a highly volatile aroma component found in most beverages and foods. It provides pleasant aroma as like fruity note at low concentrations, whereas it can be related to a harsh odor note at high concentrations [@B002]. Aldehydes, which are mainly produced by yeast during alcoholic fermentation, can be also generated by low-grade yeast and bacteria from non-fresh material during the manufacturing process of alcoholic beverage, affecting flavor characteristics of alcoholic beverages. AA is also very reactive, and can participate in binding with proteins via Schiff base. In particular, it can be easily lost by binding with amino groups of amino acids and peptides [@B002],[@B003].\n\n【42】AA in alcoholic beverage, which had been previously considered as a by-product of the alcoholic fermentation by yeast, was also reported to be generated by the glucose metabolism of lactic acid bacteria, natural oxidation of ethanol in the presence of phenolic components [@B003], and the metabolism of alanine by yeasts [@B004]. In the case of spirits, AA content was often increased by chemical oxidation of ethanol during aging and distillation processes [@B005]. On the other hand, fermentation conditions of alcoholic beverage, such as the type of yeast, fermentation temperature, CO~2~ level, and raw material have been known to be highly involved in the generation of AA [@B030],[@B033].\n\n【43】Analysis of AA content in alcoholic beverages showed that all samples, except for Magkeolli, contain lower level of AA, compared to that of previous studies. Since Makgeolli is not exposed to the filtration and sterilization process, AA content can be increased even after the ethanol fermentation by the continued metabolism of yeast. Particularly, AA content of Soju was lowest among alcoholic beverages studied. Most of fermentation by-products and flavor components are removed during the purification process (distillation). That purification process can be responsible for the lowest content of AA in Soju [@B023]. The present results on FA content of alcoholic beverage indicated that all samples, except for Sake and whiskey, contain lower level of FA, compared to those of previous studies.\n\n【44】This research was supported by a grant (13162KFDA049) from Korea Food and Drug Administration in 2013\\~2015.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

However, EMG activity appears in the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency when simultaneous vibration is applied at different frequencies. The sensations felt by the subjects were reproduced by the nonvibrated arm and recorded by a goniometer. The studies show that the velocity and the amplitude of the ilusory movement is related to the difference in vibration frequency applied to the two muscles. The direction of movement felt (flexion or extension) is that produced by shortening of the muscle being vibrated at the lower frequency. When the two vibration frequencies are the same, there is either no sensation of movement, or a sensation of very slow movement. These results support the notion that the sensation of movement at a joint may be derived from a central processing of the proprioceptive inflow data obtained from flexor and extensor muscles.

This method was developed in 1988 by Cotton et al. \\[[@B2]\\] and has been widely used in research and diagnosis of many inherited diseases. The technology is based on selective reactions of mismatched thymine and cytosine with KMnO~4~and hydroxylamine respectively \\[[@B2]-[@B5]\\]. The modified mismatched bases are subjected to piperidine cleavage reactions and the resulting fragments are separated and identified by gel-electrophoresis. The process is time-consuming, as the method requires purification of DNA by using the standard precipitation technique after each reaction step \\[[@B2],[@B4],[@B5]\\]. In our earlier work \\[[@B6]\\], attempts have been successfully made to attach biotinylated DNA samples onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads for solid-phase chemical modification and cleavage reactions. The desire to simplify this approach further by reducing the use of the cumbersome biotin dependent assay led us to the development of a new solid-phase chemical cleavage of mismatched DNA (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The method involves attachment of DNA on to the commercially available silica solid supports. The solid-bound DNA remained intact throughout the chemical reactions and the final product was removed from solid support by treatment with the piperidine cleavage solution at 90°C as described in our experimental section. This new version of the CCM method is simple, cost-effective and highly accurate by improving the quality of the cleavage fragments on sequencing gel traces.\n\n【2】Methods\n=======\n\n【3】Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company (Castle Hill, Australia).

The reaction mixture was gentlely mixed on shaker at 25°C for 2 h. The Eppendorf tube was centrifuged (2000 rpm) and supernatant was removed (by Pasteur pipette). The DNA bound solid supports were washed with Ultrawash solution (2 × 200 μl) and then treated with 30 μl of 1 mM KMnO~4~in 3 M TEAC solution. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for 10 min and the resulting DNA-bound beads were separated by centrifuge, washed with Ultrawash solution (2 × 200 μl). The beads were air-dried for 15 min and used for the next reaction step.\n\n【11】Solid-phase reaction of DNA with hydroxylamine\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】DNA-bound beads were prepared as described above (1 μl of homoduplex DNA for control or heteroduplex DNA for mismatch detection containing 0.1--0.2 μg DNA was incubated with 2.5 μl of Ultra-bind bead suspension in an Eppendorf tube). The DNA-bound beads were treated with 30 μl of 4.2 M hydroxylamine in 3 M TEAC solution. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 40 min and the resulting DNA bound beads were separated by centrifuge, washed with Ultra-wash solution (2 × 200 μl). The beads were air-dried for 15 min and used for the next step.\n\n【13】In the control experiments, the homoduplex DNA samples (wild type or mutant) were treated under identical reaction conditions.\n\n【14】Cleavage by piperidine\n----------------------\n\n【15】The DNA-bound beads obtained from the reactions with KMnO~4~or hydroxylamine were treated with 10 μl of cleavage-dye solution at 90°C for 30 min. The cleavage dye solution was made from 20 μl of piperidine, 66.6 μl of formamide and 13.4 μl of dye solution (5 % w/v blue dextran in H~2~O). The solid beads were separated by centrifuge and the supernatant was loaded on to a denaturing polyacrilamide gel (acrylamide: bisacrylamide, 19:1).

The method was based on the formation of heteroduplexes DNA containing a single base mismatch by mixing equal amounts of two homoduplexes (wild-type and mutant) DNA. At the mismatched site, nucleotide bases are extra-helical and susceptible to chemical modification reactions \\[[@B10]\\]. Therefore, KMnO~4~and hydroxylamine have been employed in the CCM method to modify the mismatched thymine and cytosine respectively. The resulting modified DNA is then treated with piperidine before being loaded on to a sequencing polyacrylamide gel for fragment analysis (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This process is time-consuming as the reactions are carried out in solution phases and the products require exhaustive purification procedures after each reaction step.\n\n【18】![Chemical Cleavage of Mismatch. \\ DNA strand was labeled with FAM or HEX at 5\\' and 3\\' ends respectively.

Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"} describes the new solid-phase version of CCM, in which DNA fragments are immobilised on silica (Ultra-bind) beads by the standard method. The DNA-attached beads are then treated with KMnO~4~or hydroxylamine as usual. After reactions, the beads are simply washed with the Ultra-wash solution and used for the next step without further purification. This solid-phase CCM protocol was successfully applied for detection of T.C & C.C mismatches on the previously published 547 bp DNA sequences \\[[@B6]\\]. In one typical example, the heteroduplex 2 containing T.C mismatch was formed (the location of a T.C mismatch was close to one end, ie. 82 bp from 5\\' end, Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and allowed to react with KMnO~4~and hydroxylamine on solid supports in two separate reactions.

The following results have been obtained: (i) The commercially available silica beads which was originally developed for DNA purification of small DNA fragments is now suitable for solid-phase chemical reactions. (ii) Typical reactions with KMnO~4~and hydroxylamine \\[[@B12],[@B13]\\] have been successfully demonstrated on DNA bound silica support. (iii) DNA bound silica support remains intact during reactions and purification steps. Cleavage of DNA product from silica can be done as per the instructions of the commercial silica product or our described conditions. As the solid-phase chemical cleavage reactions are very convenient in terms of manipulation and purity of the products, the silica solid support is highly recommended for any chemical modification reactions on DNA.\n\n【27】![Solid-phase chemical cleavage of mismatch.

Breast cancer is the most common female neoplasia and primary cause of death among women worldwide. The recognition of breast cancer as a complex and heterogeneous disease, comprising different molecular entities, was a landmark in our understanding of this malignancy. Valuing the impact of the molecular characteristics on tumor behavior enabled a better assessment of a patient's prognosis and increased the predictive power to therapeutic response and clinical outcome. Molecular heterogeneity is also prominent in the triple-negative breast cancer subtype, and is reflected by the distinct prognostic and patient's sensitivity to treatment, being chemotherapy the only systemic treatment currently available. From a therapeutic perspective, gene expression profiling of triple-negative tumors has notably contributed to the exploration of new druggable targets and brought to light the need to align these patients to the various therapies according to their triple-negative subtype. Additionally, the higher amount of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and the prevalence of an increased expression of PD-1 receptor and its ligand, PD-L1, in triple-negative tumors, created a new treatment opportunity with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This manuscript addresses the current knowledge on the molecular and immune profiles of breast cancer, and its impact on the development of targeted therapies, with a particular emphasis on the triple-negative subtype.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

These patients typically present with intrahepatic cholestasis in infancy or childhood. The course of the disease involves portal hypertension, liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma along with several extra hepatic manifestations. Three types of PFIC have been described: 1) PFIC type 1, caused by mutations in ATP8B1 gene (also called FIC1); 2) PFIC type 2, caused by mutations in ABCB11 gene (also called BSEP) and 3) PFIC type 3, caused by mutations in ABCB4 gene (also called MDR3).

fetoprotein.\n\n【6】PFIC Type 1\n===========\n\n【7】Genetics {#s1a}\n--------\n\n【8】PFIC1, an autosomal recessive disease is caused by the mutation in ATP8B1 gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase, located on human chromosome 18. It is found in several tissues such a small intestine, bladder, stomach, liver and pancreas. It is localized on the apical membrane of epithelial cells, including the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes \\[[@R04], [@R05]\\]. ATP8B1 is hypothesized to be an aminophospholipid flippase, translocating phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine from outer to the inner leaflet of plasma membrane \\[[@R06]\\]. Deficiency of ATP8B1 in the hepatocyte may result in loss of asymmetric distribution of the phospholipids in the canalicular membrane, thus reducing membrane stability and function of transmembrane transporters like ABCB11, impairing bile salt transport and decreasing hepatocyte resistance to bile salts, ultimately leading to reduced transport of bile salts in liver and gut resulting in cholestasis and watery diarrhea.\n\n【9】Clinical features {#s1b}\n-----------------\n\n【10】In newborns afflicted with type 1 PFIC is characterized by recurrent episodes of intrahepatic cholestasis, intractable pruritus, diarrhea and failure to thrive in first several months of life. It is generally progressive leading to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure in the first decade of life. Other features include short stature, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, malabsorption and occasionally hearing loss.\n\n【11】Diagnosis {#s1c}\n---------\n\n【12】The diagnostic features include elevated serum bile salts, normal serum GGT, electron microscopy showing coarse granular bile and light microscopy showing bland cholestasis. Genetic testing is the only reliable way to distinguish between PFIC 1 and PFIC 2.\n\n【13】Treatment {#s1d}\n---------\n\n【14】Pharmacological treatment includes ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to promote biliary flow \\[[@R07]\\], but its effect on disease progression is uncertain. Rifampin (accelerates hepatic detoxification and excretion of bilirubin and bile salts) and cholestyramine (a hydrophilic, water insoluble anion exchange resin that binds bile salts, preventing their reabsorption in enterohepatic circulation) ease pruritus. These patients may also need supplements of fat soluble vitamins.\n\n【15】Partial biliary diversion may be beneficial in some patients, significantly decreasing their symptoms \\[[@R08]\\]. It may even delay or interrupt hepatocyte injury if performed early in the course of the disease. Liver transplantation is the most effective form of treatment especially in those with progressive disease or established cirrhosis, usually within the first decade of life.\n\n【16】PFIC Type 2 {#s2}\n===========\n\n【17】Genetics {#s2a}\n--------\n\n【18】PFIC 2, an autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutation in ABCB11 gene on chromosome 2q24, which encodes the canalicular bile salt export protein (BSEP), a liver specific adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter \\[[@R9], [@R10]\\]. BSEP is a major exporter of primary bile acids against extreme concentration gradients. There are many mutations that have been identified, but the most common mutations are the missense mutations E297G and D482G. Defective BSEP can lead to impaired bile salt secretion, accumulation of bile salts in hepatocytes and subsequent hepatocellular injury, apoptosis or necrosis. Missense mutations cause less severe disease, whereas the risk of hepatobiliary malignancy is increased with trunacating mutations.\n\n【19】Clinical features {#s2b}\n-----------------\n\n【20】Patients usually present with cholestatic jaundice in neonatal period. Pruritus is usually the dominant feature. Clinical features and disease progression may be more severe in PFIC 2 than in PFIC 1. Other features may include growth failure, deficiency of fat soluble vitamins. These patients are at considerable risk of hepatobiliary malignancy, hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma , thus close surveillance is important in these patients \\[[@R11]\\].\n\n【21】Diagnosis {#s2c}\n---------\n\n【22】Diagnostic features include elevated bile salts, normal serum GGT, electron microscopy showing amorphous or filamentous bile. Light microscopy shows nonspecific giant cell hepatitis. Immunohistochemical staining for canalicular BSEP is negative in majority of patients.\n\n【23】Treatment {#s2d}\n---------\n\n【24】Patients with PFIC 2 have poor response to ursodeoxycholic acid. Partial external biliary diversion (PBED) (it interrupts the enterohepatic circulation by partially diverting bile from the gallbladder through a loop of jejunum connecting the gallbladder to abdominal skin) may be useful and if performed early enough may delay or interrupt hepatic injury. Histological changes may show some improvement.\n\n【25】Liver transplantation is usually successful in this group of patients although recurrence after transplantation has been reported \\[[@R12]\\]. This can be resolved with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【26】PFIC Type 3 {#s3}\n===========\n\n【27】Genetics {#s3a}\n--------\n\n【28】PFIC 3, an autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutations in ABCB4, which encodes the multidrug resistance-3 gene (MDR3), an ATP-binding cassette transporter. It is located on chromosome 7q21. It acts as a phospholipid translocator involved in biliary phospholipid (phosphatiylcholine) excretion. It is mainly expressed in the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. ABCB4 defects cause impaired excretion of phophatidycholine, which is an important component in formation of mixed micelles, which protect the membrane of cells facing biliary tree from the detergent activity of bile salts. Functional deficiency of ABCB4 causes the detergent action of bile salts to solubilize the cell membrane of the biliary epithelium inducing inflammation and cell death.\n\n【29】Several different types of mutation have been identified and those with missense mutation have less severe phenotype, with later onset of disease, slower progression and better response to treatment than those with trunacating mutations.\n\n【30】Heterozygous mutations in ABCB4 gene can cause conditions such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, cholesterol gall stone formation, drug induced cholestasis and adult biliary cirrhosis \\[[@R13]\\].\n\n【31】Clinical features {#s3b}\n-----------------\n\n【32】Patients with ABCB4 deficiency usually have jaundice, pale stools, hepatosplenomegaly or pruritus. Age at onset varies from infancy to adulthood. Adolescent and young adult patients are more likely to have cirrhotic symptoms owing to portal hypertension. No association with malignancy has been described in PFIC 3 patients \\[[@R14]\\].\n\n【33】Diagnosis {#s3c}\n---------\n\n【34】The diagnostic features include elevated serum bile salts, elevated serum GGT, electron microscopy showing presence of cholesterol crystals and loss of microvilli, light microscopy showing ductular proliferation and inflammatory infiltrate in early stages, portal and peri-portal fibrosis, cirrhosis and cholestasis which are seen in the later stages.\n\n【35】Treatment {#s3d}\n---------\n\n【36】UDCA is useful in almost half of the patients. It is more likely to work in those who have an MDR3 missense mutation as they have some residual protein activity. Those who do not respond to UDCA treatment are likely to have a truncated protein. In these patients, liver transplantation is the primary treatment.\n\n【37】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#T2){ref-type=\"table\"} lists the differential diagnosis of the three types of PFIC that an astute clinical should be mindful of.\n\n【38】###### Differential Diagnosis of PFIC\n\n【39】  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  A\\) Disorders of bile acid synthesis biosynthesis and conjugation\n    i) 3-oxo-4-steroid 5-reductase deficiency\n    ii) 3 -hydroxy-5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase deficiency\n    iii) Oxysterol 7-hydroxylase deficiency\n    iv) Bile acid-CoA: amino-acid N-acyltransferase deficiency (familial hypercholanemia)\n  B\\) Disorders of embryogenesis\n    i) Alagille syndrome (jagged 1 defect, syndromic bile duct paucity)\n    ii) Ductal plate malformation (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease, Caroli's disease)\n  C\\) Trafficking and canalicular targeting defects\n    i) Arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, cholestasis\n  D\\) Tight, junction defects\n    i) Neonatal ichthyosis sclerosing cholangitis\n    ii) Familial Amish hypercholanemia\n  E\\) Miscellaneous\n    i) Aagenaes syndrome ( hereditary cholestasis with lymphedema)\n    ii) North American Indian Childhood Cirrhosis\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Conclusion {#s4}\n==========\n\n【41】The review aims to summarize the genetics, clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the three types of PFIC.

Cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni infect their hosts by direct skin penetration, aided by secretions from acetabular and head glands. Both proteolytic and immunomodulatory properties have been ascribed to the released material, but to date only five isoforms of elastase and one putative anti-inflammatory protein (Sm16) have been cloned. We analyzed secretions from mechanically transformed cercariae by two-dimensional electrophoresis. An average gel image was created and compared with a separation of soluble larval extract, revealing a less complex spot pattern in the secretions with 60% of the spots matched to the larval extract. Subsequent tandem mass spectrometric analysis identified 48 spots from the released material, representing approximately 80% of its normalized volume. Twenty-nine of these are likely to originate in the vesicles, and 18 are likely to originate in the cytosol of the glands (the latter class being present due to holocrine secretion); one is unknown. The vesicular proteins were significantly more enriched than the cytosolic proteins in the released material when compared with the larval extract. A novel metalloproteinase (termed SmPepM8) was the second most abundant constituent after three isoforms of cercarial elastase.

Along with Sm16, four potential immunomodulators were identified, three with similarity to venom allergens (SmSCPa, b, and c) and one with homology to the potassium channel blockers in scorpion venom (SmKK7). Interrogation of the expressed sequence tag database found transcripts encoding the majority of vesicular proteins present solely in the intramolluscan stages of the life cycle.

Urban neighborhoods with a high incidence of childhood lead poisoning and high soil lead levels. Randomized controlled trial of the effects of lead-contaminated soil abatement on blood lead levels of children followed up for approximately 1 year after the intervention. A total of 152 children less than 4 years of age with venous blood lead levels of 0.34 to 1.16 mumol/L (7 to 24 micrograms/dL). Children were largely poor and had a mean age at baseline of 32 months, a mean blood lead level of 0.60 mumol/L (12.5 micrograms/dL), and a median surface soil lead level of 2075 ppm. Children were randomized to one of three groups: the study group, whose homes received soil and interior dust abatement and loose paint removal; comparison group A, whose homes received interior dust abatement and loose paint removal; and comparison group B, whose homes received only interior loose paint removal. Change in children's blood lead levels from preabatement levels to levels approximately 6 and 11 months after abatement.

The products demonstrated a ladder pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis and could also be detected visually according to turbidity, or by adding SYBR Green I and observing a color change from orange to green. The proposed method could specifically amplify MCDV-1 gene fragments. Sensitivity assay revealed that six copies of the viral genome could be detected by this method, which was 1000-fold more sensitive than that of conventional PCR using constructed plasmid as amplification template. At clinical sample level, sensitivity of LAMP was 100-fold higher than that of conventional PCR.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Over the past decades, mild HHcy, defined clinically as less than 30 μmol/L, has been recognized as an independent risk factor for a variety of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and chronic heart failure (Perry [@b38]; Zylberstein et al. [@b56]; Vizzardi et al. [@b50]).\n\n【2】Clinical evidence has shown that a number of complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have multiple causes, are also associated with elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) (Lopez-Quesada et al. [@b28]; Lindblad et al. [@b26]). Women with a history of these complications are at higher risk to repeat in subsequent pregnancies and higher risk of CVD in later life (Varvarigou [@b49]; Duckitt and Harrington [@b13]; Bellamy et al. [@b5]). Given the well documented correlation between mild HHcy (\\~ 10 μmol/L) and CVD, we hypothesize that mild HHcy contributes to the cardiac dysfunction in pregnancy-related complications such as PE, and may account for the increased risk of reoccurrence and CVD in later life.\n\n【3】Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulating: cardiac metabolic function; oxygen consumption; and substrate use during pregnancy (Williams et al. [@b52]). Reduced bioavailability of NO is thought to be one of the central factors common to myocardial ischemia, atherosclerotic disease, and heart failure (Cannon [@b8]; Trochu et al. [@b46]). NO bioavailability has been reported to be impaired by mild HHcy through increased oxidative stress, and one major source of the oxidative stress in cardiovascular system is superoxide (Kolling et al. [@b25]; Ungvari et al. [@b48]; Becker et al. [@b3]; Edirimanne et al. [@b14]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]). A more recent study has also suggested a link between NO inactivation and pregnancy-related disease, by showing that serum NO metabolites concentration is decreased in preeclamptic patients and endothelial cells. NAD(P)H oxidase subunit gp91^phox^ expression is increased by treatment with sera from preeclamptic patients (Matsubara et al. [@b30]). The possible long-term effect of mild HHcy on maternal heart with multiparity has received little attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term mild HHcy on cardiac metabolic function in multiparous rats, and to explore the possible role of NO and superoxide in pathogenesis.\n\n【4】Material and Methods\n====================\n\n【5】Animals and material preparations\n---------------------------------\n\n【6】Female Sprague--Dawley (SD) Rats (200--250 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Control male SD rats (250 g) were used for mating; each male was housed with two females in a new, clean cage. Female rats were pregnant 3--4 times. For the first two pregnancies, newborns were taken away immediately after birth. For the third or fourth pregnancy, after confirmation of pregnancy (Day 1; determined by presence of a plug on the morning after mating), the females were immediately removed from the males, and placed into new cages for the duration of the experiment. Drinking water with or without [l]{.smallcaps}-methonine (Sigma-Aldrich, 9 g/L) was supplied from day one of first pregnancy till sacrifice.\n\n【7】Animals were killed with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, ip) on day 19--21 of 3rd or 4th pregnancy. Blood was collected from the left ventricle (LV). The hearts were immediately harvested and weighed. Some fresh LV tissues were used for oxygen consumption and superoxide measurement. The rest of the tissues and plasma were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and were stored in −80°C until use.\n\n【8】The protocol of the study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York Medical College and followed the current guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and American Physiological Society for the use and care of laboratory animals.\n\n【9】Measurement of plasma total Hcy\n-------------------------------\n\n【10】Plasma total Hcy (tHcy) was measured using a microplate enzyme immunoassay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the signal was read at 450 nm by a Power Wave 200 spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek) as described previously (Becker et al. [@b3]).\n\n【11】Hemodynamic and cardiac structural measurements\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】At day 18/19 of the 3rd or 4th pregnancy, a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NIBP-8, Columbus Instruments) was used to assess conscious resting heart rate (HR) (Table通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tbl1){ref-type=\"table\"}) and blood pressure and cardiac structure was measure by transthoracic echocardiography performed with a 15-MHz linear transducer (Acuson) as described previously (Becker et al. [@b3]). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated as the product of stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (measured during echocardiography) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) was calculated as mean arterial pressure (MAP) divided by cardiac output.\n\n【13】###### \n\n【14】Hemodynamic data\n\n【15】                                Control multiparous pregnant rats (n = 6)   HHcy multiparous pregnant rats (n = 6)\n  ----------------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------\n  Weight at time of death, g    433.7 ± 4.8                                   422.8.3 ± 12.7\n  Heart weight, g               1.03 ± 0.01                                   1.14 ± 0.01通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Heart weight/body weight, %   0.24 ± 0.01                                   0.27 ± 0.01通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Left Ventricle weight, g      0.69 ± 0.03                                   0.78 ± 0.01通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Septum weight, g              0.19 ± 0.01                                   0.18 ± 0.01\n  Uterine weight, g             17.89 ± 1.08                                  14.58 ± 0.86通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Total Fetal weight, g         48.1 ± 16.5                                   34.0 ± 10.7通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Number of pups                15.6 ± 0.92                                   16.7 ± 0.97\n\n【16】                                                   n = 10       n = 9\n  ------------------------------------------------ -------------- ---------------------------------------------\n  Blood pressure monitor                                          \n   SBP, mmHg                                       114.9 ± 4.0    139.6 ± 4.4通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n   DBP, mmHg                                       89.2 ± 2.3     94.3 ± 4.3\n   MBP, mmHg                                       97.0 ± 2.8     108.0 ± 4.1通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n   Stroke volume, mL                               0.39 ± 0.03    0.31 ± 0.02\n   Heart rate, conscious, bpm                      446.1 ± 33.5   411.7 ± 21.9\n  Cardiac output, mLmin^−1^                        167.7 ± 12.5   132.0 ± 9.6通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n  Total peripheral resistance, mmHgmin^−1 ^m^−1^   0.64 ± 0.09    0.86 ± 0.20通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tf1-1){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}\n\n【17】Versus control P \\< 0.05.\n\n【18】In vitro myocardial oxygen consumption measurement\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO~2~) was measured and the role of NO determined as previously described (Adler et al.

The effects of 10^−3^ mol/L superoxide scavenger ascorbic acid (AA), 10^−4^ mol/L NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin (Apo), 10^−3^ mol/L SOD mimetic tempol, or 10^−3^ mol/L NOS inhibitor L-NAME on MVO~2~ were expressed as percent change of baseline.\n\n【20】Lucigenin-enhanced superoxide measurement\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【21】Superoxide generation detected by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6000IC) as previously described (Iesaki et al.

A total of 25 μmol/L EDTA-plasma were used and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm.\n\n【24】Western blot\n------------\n\n【25】The preparation of protein samples from myocardial tissues was performed as previously described (Becker et al. [@b3]). Antibodies to eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:250 dilution), phospho-eNOS (Ser 1177) (Cell Signal, 1:500 dilution), SOD-1(Calbiochem, 1:5000 dilution), SOD-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:10,000 dilution), SOD-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000 dilution), or one of the following subunits of NAD(P)H oxidase: p67^phox^ (Upstate, 1:1000 dilution), p22^phox^ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2000 dilution), gp91^phox^(BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000 dilution), p47^phox^ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution), phos-p47^phox^ (Upstate, 1:1000 dilution), p40^phox^ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:800 dilution), Rac-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000 dilution), and nitrotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000 dilution) were used.\n\n【26】RNA isolation and microarray analysis\n-------------------------------------\n\n【27】Total RNA was extracted from the control (n = 4) and Met-fed (n = 4) LV tissues as previously described (Ojaimi et al. [@b37]). RNA quality was assessed by electrophoresis with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif). cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 array. Determination of statistical significance for changes in gene expression was performed in GeneSpring with a t-test and with variance stabilization.\n\n【28】Statistical analysis\n--------------------\n\n【29】All data were presented as mean and SEM. A statistical significance of differences was determined with t-test. Changes are considered significant at P \\< 0.05.\n\n【30】Results\n=======\n\n【31】Measurement of total plasma Hcy\n-------------------------------\n\n【32】Total plasma Hcy level was significantly increased threefold in methionine-fed animals (10.5 ± 2.3 μmol/L) as compared to control animals (2.9 ± 0.3 μmol/L) (P \\< 0.05).\n\n【33】Hemodynamic measurements\n------------------------\n\n【34】All hemodynamic data and weights are shown in Table通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#tbl1){ref-type=\"table\"}. Heart weight (HW) and LV weight were significantly increased by 11% and 13% in HHcy rats as compared to control. When HW is normalized by body weight, there was also a significant increase in HHcy group, indicating cardiac hypertrophy.\n\n【35】Average systolic blood pressure increased from 114.9 ± 4.0 mmHg of control to 139.6 ± 4.4 mmHg. In the HHcy group, six of nine rats developed hypertension (SBP\\>140 mmHg). TPR was more than 30% higher in HHcy rats compared to control, suggesting an impairment of peripheral endothelial function.\n\n【36】High concentrations of plasma tHcy have been associated with a greater risk of IUGR in human (Pierantognetti et al. [@b39]). We (data unpublished) and others have previously found that methionine-diet-induced mild HHcy has a negative effect on fetal growth (Kassab et al. [@b23]). Consistent with those findings, in this study, while the number of offspring was similar between groups, the fetal weight was significantly smaller in HHcy group than control, suggesting an intrauterine growth restriction.\n\n【37】Superoxide measurements\n-----------------------\n\n【38】Increased oxidative stress has long been linked to mild HHcy pathogenesis. Previously we have found that superoxide was elevated in male dog and rat hearts (Becker et al. [@b3]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]) given methionine. In this study, we measured superoxide by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, and found a 2.6 ± 1.1-fold increase of signal in HHcy hearts as compared to control (Fig.通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#fig01){ref-type=\"fig\"}). AA or tiron were incubated with the tissues and each abolished the increased signal in HHcy heart, confirming the elevated signal was from increased superoxide production. NAD(P)H oxidase has been the most likely source of superoxide in cardiac tissue, and it is activated by mild HHcy in different species and tissues (Ungvari et al. [@b48]; Becker et al. [@b3]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]). So we hypothesized that the increased superoxide in the heart of multiparous mothers with mild HHcy was mainly derived from NAD(P)H oxidase. To test this, we incubated HHcy LV tissues with NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin. As expected, there was a suppression of the signal similar to when AA or tiron were used. So far, we have demonstrated that mild HHcy-induced NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide in multiparous rats hearts.\n\n【39】![Superoxide detected by Lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. Superoxide was significantly increased in HHcy hearts (H, black bar) as compared to control (C, open bar), and coincubation with AA (10^−3^ mol/L), tiron (10^−3^ mol/L), or Apo (10^−3^ mol/L) abolished the effect. n = 6 each group; \\versus control ≤ 0.05.](phy20003-e12292-f1){#fig01}\n\n【40】Effect of Hcy on MVO~2~ in tissues\n----------------------------------\n\n【41】NO rapidly reacts with superoxide at an almost diffusion-limited rate (Miles et al. [@b32]). It has been shown that change in NO and superoxide is always negatively correlated (Ungvari et al. [@b48]; Terman et al. [@b45]). We considered that the increase in superoxide would result in a decrease in NO bioactivity. It has been well established that NO inhibits cardiomyocyte oxygen consumption by binding to mitochondria cytochrome c oxidase, and the bioavailability of BK-stimulated endogenous NO can be experimentally measured (Wainio [@b51]; Carr and Ferguson [@b9]; Poderoso et al. [@b40]; Loke et al. [@b27]). In this study, we examined the ability of BK-induced NO to regulate MVO~2~.\n\n【42】BK stimulates eNOS causing the endogenous release of NO. As shown in Figure通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#fig02){ref-type=\"fig\"}, there was a dose-dependent decrease in MVO~2~ in both groups with cumulative doses of BK (10^−8^ to 10^−4^ mol/L) (Fig.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#fig02){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Cch stimulates NO production from eNOS through a different receptor (M1) and was used here to reinforce the effect of BK on eNOS. We found that the responses to Cch (10^−7^ to 10^−4^ mol/L) are similar to those of BK. As compared to control, the response was significantly suppressed in HHcy hearts, and the degree of suppression was of the same magnitude as L-NAME treated control tissues. In addition, L-NAME treatment did not shift the response curve any further to the right. These findings suggested that cardiac NO bioavailability is impaired by mild HHcy. Similar to L-NAME treated tissues, the response to BK and Cch in HHcy hearts were significantly suppressed (10.0 ± 3.9% and 7.2 ± 0.6%) (P \\< 0.05, n = 6) as compared to control, and further, adding L-NAME into the tissue bath did not cause any additional significant change. This suggests that NO bioavailability was markedly impaired in HHcy hearts. When NO donor SNAP was used, HHcy hearts responded similarly as control hearts, suggesting that mild HHcy did not impair the tissue sensitivity to NO.\n\n【43】![Changes in MVO~2~ in LV tissues. BK (bradykinin) (A) was used to stimulate the endogenous NO release. In control rats (♦), O~2~ consumption was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in response to accumulated doses of BK, and these effects were significantly attenuated in HHcy rats (■). Adding L-NAME in tissue bath attenuated the response in control rats (∆), but did not affect HHcy rats (▲) (n = 6 each); B, Cch had similar effect as BK; C, exogenous NO donor SNAP had similar effect on both groups; D, The ability of BK (10^−4^) to reduce MVO~2~ in mild HHcy group was restored after coincubation with AA (ascorbic acid) (10^−3^ mol/L), tempol (10^−3^ mol/L), or Apo (apocynin) (10^−3^ mol/L);](phy20003-e12292-f2){#fig02}\n\n【44】Effect of antioxidants on regulation of oxygen consumption\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】While the presence of antioxidants did not significantly alter MVO~2~ in control hearts in response to BK, the suppressed response in HHcy hearts was completely restored by co-incubation with ascorbic acid (19.2 ± 1.8%) and SOD mimetic tempol (21.9 ± 2.1%), suggesting that NO was impaired by increased superoxide. The ability of NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin to restore the MVO~2~ in HHcy hearts again suggested that NAD(P)H oxidase is the major source of superoxide (Fig.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#fig02){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【46】NOx measurement\n---------------\n\n【47】NOx (nitrate and nitrite) are the end products of NO metabolites, and reflect the endogenous production of NO. HHcy mothers had a similar level of plasma NOx (21.9 ± 0.2 μmol/L) as compared to control mothers (23.5 ± 0.5 μmol/L), suggesting that mild HHcy did not increase NO production.\n\n【48】Western blot analysis\n---------------------\n\n【49】Protein expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits was measured by Western blot.

Among them, 265 genes were more than ±1.5-fold changed, with 199 upregulated and 66 downregulated.\n\n【53】Table通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#tbl2){ref-type=\"table\"} listed some interesting genes that were significantly changed in HHcy animals. (All hybridization data have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus database with GEO Accession Numbers for series GSE30308.) At the transcriptional level, mRNA of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits was not changed. Most of the antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes genes, such as SODs, and glutathionine reductase, were not significantly changed. On the basis of their GO biological process annotations, we grouped the differentially expressed genes into nine functional categories as Cell Cycle/Proliferation, Development/Reproduction, Immune Response/Apoptosis, Metabolism, Protein/Protein Expression, Cell Signaling/Communication, Cell Structure/Motility, Proteolysis, and Unknown/Others. Among them, cell signaling/communication category has the largest number of genes changed (14%). For example, cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM) was downregulated by 1.9-fold, and G-protein-coupled receptor 34 and RAS-like family 11 were upregulated by 2.1- and 1.8-fold. Some structural genes such as tropomyosin 1 and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein were also differently regulated.

Although PE is more frequently seen in nulliparous women than in multiparous women, the risk of women who have PE in a first pregnancy is significantly higher in later pregnancies (Duckitt and Harrington [@b13]; Brown et al. [@b7]; Hernandez-Diaz et al. [@b18]). In our study, with mild HHcy starting from the first pregnancy (data not shown) and continuing until termination, overt hypertension occurred in six of nine HHcy multiparous rats, but none in control group developed hypertension. This suggests that HHcy can be a causal factor increasing the risk of PE in multiparous women with a history of PE. Experimental and clinical evidence support a correlation between plasma tHcy level and blood pressure (Brett et al. [@b6]; Khosrowbeygi and Ahmadvand [@b24]). Although some other experimental findings question the hypothesis that HHcy is a contributor to the elevation of blood pressure in PE (Chandler et al. [@b10]) in nulliparous rats, the possibility that the duration of exposure is an important determinant for hypertension to be induced by mild HHcy cannot be excluded. Increased oxidative stress leads to endothelial cells impairment. This is also supported by the findings that HHcy increases oxidative stress and impairs endothelial function. We also measured plasma angiotensin II level, but found no difference between groups (data not shown). It thus is more likely that the increased blood pressure is secondary to elevated oxidative stress.\n\n【60】As far as we know, the effect of mild HHcy on cardiac metabolic function in multiparous mothers has not been studied. Mild HHcy has been demonstrated to increase oxidative stress in many different organs such as brain, lung, kidney, blood vessel, and heart (Ungvari et al. [@b48]; Becker et al. [@b3]; Sachdev [@b42]; Yi et al. [@b54]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]; da Cunha et al. [@b11]). The increase in oxidative stress has been suggested as a link between HHcy and many CVD. We have reported that superoxide is elevated by HHcy in male rat heart and dog heart and our unpublished data on nulliparous rat heart showed the same change (Becker et al. [@b3]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]). In this study we found that superoxide was significantly elevated by mild HHcy in multiparous hearts as compared to the controls. As compared with xanthine oxidase, arachidonic acid, and mitochondrial oxidases, NAD(P)H oxidase has been demonstrated as the major source of ROS in cardiac cells (Mohazzab et al. [@b33]). Previously we have found that in male rat and dog heart and nulliparous rat heart the protein level of NAD(P)H oxidase is elevated by HHcy and by blocking the oxidase the increased superoxide level is restored to control level, suggesting NAD(P)H oxidase is a major source of elevated superoxide in HHcy maternal heart (Becker et al. [@b3]). In this study, after apocynin blocks NAD(P)H oxidase the increase in superoxide in cardiac tissue was abolished, demonstrating that mild HHcy also increases cardiac oxidative stress through NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide in pregnant rat heart. In fact, the evidence of HHcy increasing oxidative stress through NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide is not limited to cardiac tissue, but was also seen in coronary arteries(Ungvari et al. [@b48]), vascular smooth muscle, neutrophils, and endothelium (Zou et al. [@b55]; Bellamy et al. [@b4]; Alvarez-Maqueda et al. [@b2]).\n\n【61】The site of NAD(P)H oxidase regulation differs by treatments and disease. For example, in heart failure patient, the p47^phox^ translocation from cytosol to membrane is increased (Heymes et al. [@b19]). Angiotensin II-induced hypertensive rats have elevated p22^phox^ mRNA in aorta (Fukui et al. [@b17]); protein expression of p22^phox^, p47^phox^, and p67^phox^ is increased in placentas from PE patients (Dechend et al. [@b12]); HHcy increases protein expression of p22^phox^ in male rat heart and protein expression of Nox 2 in male dog heart (Becker et al. [@b3]; Suematsu et al. [@b44]). Unfortunately, so far the underlying pattern that determines which subunit(s) of the enzyme is regulated and whether the regulation occurs at transcriptional, translational or posttranslational level under different circumstances, has yet to be found. While the degree of phosphorylation of p47^phox^ subunit is enhanced in the heart of nulliparous mothers with mild HHcy (our data), we found an upregulation of p22^phox^ protein but not mRNA in the HHcy heart of multiparous mothers. The mechanisms of cardiac NAD(P)H oxidase activation in short-term HHcy exposure with single pregnancy may differ from long-term exposure with multiple pregnancies, and this might reflect a differentially regulated mechanism which contributes to the increased risk of CVD development in the future.\n\n【62】We further examined whether long-term mild HHcy has affected the antioxidant system in the multiparous heart. Our microarray showed no significant change in antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes genes, such as xanthine dehydrogenase, thioredoxin reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD isoforms. Protein level of SODs was also not different. It seems that the expression of major antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants were not significantly affected. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of antioxidant system due to the possible change of enzyme activity.\n\n【63】Another possible mechanism of lowering NO bioavailability is inhibiting its production. Thus, we measured plasma NOx concentration which represents endogenous NO production, and found NOx level similar between groups, suggesting an unchanged NO production. To further confirm it, the expression of NOS was also measured. A 43% elevation of eNOS protein expression was detected, but the active form (phospho-eNOS) was not changed. A number of inhibitory effects of HHcy on eNOS activity have been proposed, for example, phosphorylation of eNOS threonine 495 through protein kinase C pathway, and accumulation or activation of endogenous inhibitor of eNOS (Trochu et al. [@b46]; Jiang et al. [@b22]; Tyagi et al. [@b47]). Our microarray also revealed a downregulation of bradykinin type 2 receptor (B2R) by 1.5-fold (P = 0.05). Nonetheless, the NOx level was preserved to control level in HHcy animals, indicating that the impaired NO ability to regulate MVO~2~ is independent of NO production.\n\n【64】Superoxide reacts with NO rapidly and irreversibly to generate peroxynitrite, a reactive nitrogen species. Peroxynitrite can interact with tyrosine residues in proteins to form nitrotyrosine. Although increase in superoxide usually leads to increase of nitrotyrosine, in this study we found the level of nitrotyrosine did not differ between groups. This finding is consistent with a study performed on CBS knockout mice (Powers et al. [@b41]). While we may conclude an unlikely role for nitrotyrosine as the link between HHcy and CVD in multiparous hearts, exactly how nitrotyrosine remains unchanged remains unknown.\n\n【65】Long-term inhibition of NO synthesis by L-NAME causes cardiac hypertrophy that resembles pressure overload hypertrophy in normal male rats (Sladek et al. [@b43]). We have demonstrated in this study that NO bioavailability is impaired by increased superoxide in HHcy group. Thus, it is not surprising that the heart weight, LV weight, and HW/BW are all significantly increased as compared to control. In the dilated-hypertrophic heart during pregnancy (Hytten and Paintin [@b20]; Mabie et al. [@b29]), NO plays an important role in matching the oxygen supply and demand. Cardiac eNOS expression and NO production are enhanced to inhibit mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase in cardiomyocytes, resulting in a reduction of oxygen consumption with the same amount of work performed (Wainio [@b51]; Loke et al. [@b27]). It is conceivable that mild HHcy limiting the NO availability in the hypertrophic heart of multiparous rats will make the heart more vulnerable and prone to ischemic injury, and increase risk of heart disease later on.\n\n【66】NO can switch substrate utilization in the heart (Suematsu et al. [@b44]; Williams et al. [@b53]). It is not surprising that microarray revealed changes in certain metabolism genes, for example, glucokinase regulatory protein and glucokinase regulatory protein. Using large animals with direct access to the coronary circulation will address whether and how substrate utilization is affected in multiparous hearts. Another gene of interest is CREM (downregulated by 1.9-fold), which is an important component in the cAMP signaling network. Its ability to regulate cardiac function and activate NAD(P)H oxidase make it an interesting candidate gene for future study (Muller et al. [@b34],[@b35],[@b36]; Mehrhof et al. [@b31]; Espinosa et al. [@b15]; Fu et al. [@b16]).\n\n【67】In summary, this study for the first time demonstrates that long-term mild HHcy induces hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, and impairs the ability of NO to regulate cardiac MVO~2~ through NAD(P)H oxidase-derived superoxide production in multiparous mothers. We also provided evidence for how NAD(P)H oxidase is activated, but more specific regulating mechanism that links high tHcy level to the enzyme activation is still needed. Further clarifying the mechanism may have potential therapeutic implications. Microarray has also uncovered certain regulatory genes that might be of pathogenic importance. Mild HHcy alone is able to induce both cardiac functional and genetic changes in multiparous heart, making it vulnerable to any further pathogenetic disturbances. It is reasonable to deduce that mild HHcy is a risk factor for CVD development in pregnancy-related complications such as PE, and at least partially accounts for the increased risk of reoccurrence in later pregnancy.\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest\n====================</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None declared.</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>[^1]: Funding Information HL 43023\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Further, in the subsequent follow-up study, intensive therapy was found to have sustained beneficial effects on cardiovascular events and death rate in this population. Another clinical trial, China Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study, has recently reported that group-based lifestyle interventions over six years could prevent or delay the development of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The two famous intervention trials have demonstrated a consistent salutary effect of intensive therapy on the development and progression of diabetes and its complications. However, the exact mechanisms of the sustained beneficial effects remain to be elusive. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that type 2 diabetes is associated with a general activation of the innate immune system, in which there is a chronic, cytokine-mediated state of low-grade inflammation. Some diabetic treatment agents with anti-inflammatory properties may lower both acute-phase reactants which are components of the innate immune system independent of their anti-hyperglycemic actions or lipid-lowering effects. The immunomodulatory effects of regular exercise, and in particular resistance training, may have positive effects on innate immunity and so may provide benefits for the profile of type 2 diabetes in addition to improving strength and functional abilities. Therefore, we speculate that the effects on the innate immune system through pharmacologic therapy or lifestyle modification such as exercise training are able to account - at least amongst others - for carry-over beneficial effects of multifactorial intervention on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Consequently, it is difficult to predict how concurrent partnerships or short gaps may be related to the spread of STI and HIV in a particular epidemiologic context in empirical reality.

However, current techniques to realistically simulate muscle response when significant amounts of intentional coactivation is required are inadequate. This would include stiffening the neck or spine through muscle coactivation in preparation for perturbations or impacts. Muscle coactivation has been modeled previously in the neck and spine using optimization techniques that seek to maximize the joint stiffness by maximizing total muscle activation or muscle force. These approaches have not sought to replicate human response, but rather to explore the possible effects of active muscle. Coactivation remains a challenging feature to include in musculoskeletal models, and may be improved by extracting optimization objective functions from experimental data. However, the components of such an objective function must be known before fitting to experimental data. This study explores the effect of components in several objective functions, in order to recommend components to be used for fitting to experimental data. Four novel approaches to modeling coactivation through optimization techniques are presented, two of which produce greater levels of stiffness than previous techniques. Simulations were performed using OpenSim and MATLAB cooperatively. Results show that maximizing the moment generated by a particular muscle appears analogous to maximizing joint stiffness. The approach of optimizing for maximum moment generated by individual muscles may be a good candidate for developing objective functions that accurately simulate muscle coactivation in complex joints.

Moreover, the effects of intense exercise seem to be mediated by an activation of sympathetic nervous system activity that seems to be specific to skeletal muscle.

Introduction {#s1}\n================\n\n【1】The adult mammalian heart is generally considered a terminally differentiated organ due to the absence of a significant regenerative ability, following incidences such as ischaemic attack,^[@CVN105C1],[@CVN105C2]^ the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. It has been argued that the acquired specialization of the differentiated adult cardiomyocytes renders the majority of them incapable of proliferation, whereas a number of studies have demonstrated that the embryonic cardiomyocytes have considerable ability to divide.^[@CVN105C2]^ In the mammalian heart, this gradual developmental loss of cardiomyocyte proliferative capacity, leading to a transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, has been attributed to a block in the cell cycle with the majority of adult cardiomyocytes blocked in the G~0~/G~1~ phase of the cell cycle.^[@CVN105C3]^ It has been demonstrated that the expression of negative regulators of cell cycle, and in particular the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21^Cip1^ and p27^Kip1^ significantly increases during rat myocyte development.^[@CVN105C4],[@CVN105C5]^ Recently, it has become clear that CDKIs, while playing a crucial role in cell-cycle exit in multiple tissues of the developing organism, may also play addition roles in specification and differentiation, over and above their ability to regulate cell division.^[@CVN105C6]^ In particular, CDKIs have been shown to play roles beyond the cell cycle during neuronal differentiation.^[@CVN105C7],[@CVN105C8]^ A cell-cycle-independent role has been confirmed by studies of mammalian p27^Kip1^ in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. p27^Kip1^ promotes both differentiation and radial migration of cortical projection neurons and both these functions are independent of its ability to regulate the cell cycle.^[@CVN105C9]^ Although it is generally accepted that there is an inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation, and molecules that induce cell-cycle exit promote differentiation,^[@CVN105C10]^ the processes of cardiac differentiation and cell-cycle withdrawal have generally been investigated in isolation, and the links between these processes have not been fully elucidated. Thus, the identification of molecules that might play a pivotal role in the decision to proliferate or differentiate is crucial for a clearer understanding of cardiac development.\n\n【2】Here, we investigate the role of cell-cycle exit and CDKI function in the development of Xenopus embryonic heart, showing that by stage-29/30, when the heart can be distinguished morphologically, the vast majority of the cardiomyocytes have exited the cell cycle. However, a small proportion (∼1.5%) remains cycling even up to stage-41. By blocking cell division from the gastrula stage, we show that cell proliferation is not essential for differentiation of cardiomyocytes, and the resulting heart remains essentially normal in size, as determined by the expression of markers of cardiac differentiation. The CDKI Xic1 is expressed in the developing heart and while overexpression of Xic1 has little effect, depletion of Xic1 protein using antisense-morpholino- oligonucleotides (Mo) leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of markers of cardiac differentiation. This is due to decrease in the number of differentiated cardiomyocytes, resulting in a reduction in heart size, an effect that can be rescued by restoring Xic1 protein. We further demonstrate that Xic1 is required at later stages of cardiac differentiation. Significantly, the activity of Xic1 required for cardiac differentiation is localized within its N-terminus and is distinct from Xic1's CDK inhibitory activity.\n\n【3】2. Materials and methods {#s2}\n=========================\n\n【4】2.1. Xenopus embryos {#s2a}\n----------------------\n\n【5】Xenopus laevis embryos were injected by standard methods using either β-galactosidase mRNA (500 pg injected/embryo), or Biotin-Dextran (70 kDa, 10 ng injected/embryo) developed with ExtrAvidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and BCIP, as lineage tracers. Only embryos expressing the lineage tracers in the appropriately targeted regions were analysed further. The investigation conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health 通用删除1(英):<u>(NIH Publication No. 85--23, revised 1996)</u>.\n\n【6】2.2. mRNA injection and morpholinos {#s2b}\n-----------------------------------\n\n【7】Xic1 morpholino (Xic1Mo) previously showed to block Xic1 translation^[@CVN105C8]^ and a new control morpholino (CTRMo) with the five-nucleotide substitutions were used (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1A]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).

Reverse transcriptase--PCR {#s2c}\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】Total RNA was isolated from three whole embryos, per stage and condition, using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNaseI before reverse transcription using 100 ng of RNA/reaction (SuperscriptIII-RT, Invitrogen). Two microlitre of the synthesized cDNA was then used as a template in a 20 µL PCR reaction incorporating ^32^P-dATP.^[@CVN105C13]^ The optimum cycle number for each primer pair was determined as the cycle number at the linear range of a standard curve, constructed using a range of cDNA dilutions at different cycle numbers. xODC, 55°C, 20-cycles^[@CVN105C14]^ also used for qPCR; p27Xic1, 55°C, 22-cycles;^[@CVN105C8]^ cardiac Troponin I (TIc)-F: 5′-TCGGTCCTATGCCACAGAACCAC-3′; TIc-R: 5′-TTTTGAACTTGCCACGGAGG-3′; 63°C/28-cycles. xMHCα, 66°C/28-cycles and xNkx2.5, 59°C/30-cycles.^[@CVN105C15]^ xMLC1v-F: 5′-CCATGCTCCAACACATTTCCA-3′; xMLC1v-R: 5′-CAGCTCCCATTACCGTACCATT-3′; xMLC1v-Taqman™ probe: 5′-FAM-ACATACGAAGACTTTGTTGAAGGGCTGC-3′-BHQ1, extension/acquisition: 60°C/1 min.\n\n【10】2.4. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and antibody staining {#s2d}\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Linearized plasmids from xTIc (HindIII/T7), xNkx2.5 (EcoR1/T7), xNkx2.10 (Not1/T7), and p27^Xic1^ (BamH1/T7) were used to generate digoxigenin-11-UTP-labelled (Boehringer Mannheim) antisense RNA probes. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) was carried out as described previously^[@CVN105C16]^ with BM-purple substrate. Whole-mount antibody staining for α-phospho-histone H3 (phH3) (1:500, TCS Biologicals) was performed as described previously.^[@CVN105C16]^\n\n【12】2.5. Immunofluorescence {#s2e}\n-----------------------\n\n【13】Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 45 min and embedded in O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Tissue-Tek). Consecutive 10 µm cryostat sections were immunostained using standard methods with mouse α-Tropomyosin (CH1, 1:500; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), or α-phH3. Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 546-coupled α-mouse or Alexa Fluor 488-coupled α-rabbit.\n\n【14】All statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferonni t-test.\n\n【15】3. Results {#s3}\n===========\n\n【16】3.1. Terminally differentiated embryonic Xenopus cardiomyocytes maintain proliferative capacity {#s3a}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】To investigate proliferative capacity of Xenopus hearts during embryonic development, we determined the total number and percentage of cardiomyocytes that were proliferating by immunostaining embryo sections at various stages expressing Tropomyosin, a marker of heart differentiation along with a marker for mitotic cells, phosphorylated histone H3 (phH3) (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). The total number of cardiomyocytes in the heart gradually increased from stages-29/30 to -39 but no further significant change occurred from stages-39 to -41 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). Statistical analyses confirmed a significant increase in total number of myocytes when comparing stages-37/8 to -33/4 and all earlier stages (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B, P \\< 0.025) with a doubling in myocyte number between stage-32 (509 ± 45) and stage-37/8 (1164 ± 184). We observed a significant increase in myocyte number from stage-39, when compared to all earlier stages (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B, P \\< 0.05).\n\n【18】![Division of embryonic cardiomyocytes.

(C) Percentage of dividing cardiomyocytes (both phH3 and Tropomyosin positive) at increasing stages.](cvn10501){#CVN105F1}\n\n【19】Some Tropomyosin-expressing cells also expressed phH3 (e.g. Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A), indicating that the structural genes are expressed in Xenopus cardiomyocytes that have not stably exited the cell cycle. Indeed, at all stages of heart development studied, we observed a small percentage of cells co-expressing both phH3 and Tropomyosin (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C), with this increasing significantly at stages-31 (P \\< 0.04, Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Thus, while the vast majority of differentiated cardiomyocytes are not proliferating, a small percentage remains in cycle.\n\n【20】3.2. Xenopus cardiac differentiation can occur normally when the cell cycle is inhibited {#s3b}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Here we investigated the contribution of cell proliferation in determining the size of the linear heart-tube formed. In addition, we investigated the extent to which cells are able to respond to cardiac differentiation cues if cell cycling is prevented in post-gastrulating Xenopus embryos. It has previously been reported that blocking cell cycling in Xenopus embryos just post-gastrulation, using the DNA replication inhibitors, Hydroxyurea and Aphidicolin (HUA), results in no gross phenotypic abnormalities, although their cells are considerably larger.^[@CVN105C17]^ We incubated stage-13 embryos in HUA, and investigated the effects on formation and differentiation of the heart at both the cardiac plate and linear heart-tube stages (stages-29/30 and 33/4, respectively). phH3 staining was performed at stage-29/30 to confirm that HUA treatment was inhibiting cell-cycle progression (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A and B) and this resulted in a very substantial decrease (\\>50-fold, n = 5) in the number of mitotic cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--C). Moreover, phH3-expressing cells were substantially decreased even in internal embryonic tissues demonstrating penetration of the HUA (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D vs. E). phH3 cells in the linear heart-tube at stage-33/34, which were already at a low level (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C), were barely detectable in sections of HUA-treated embryos at stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D′ vs. E′).\n\n【22】![Cell division is not required for cardiomyocyte differentiation.

Heart-field size can vary somewhat both between batches of embryos and between embryos from the same batch of eggs so quantification of absolute heart size by area measurement does not allow statistically meaningful comparison between experiments. Hence, we adopted a blind-scoring method of 0 to 3, where 0 denotes no detectable heart and 3 denotes a heart of maximal size for that stage of development (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--D and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1D]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n【24】![Xic1 is required for heart formation.

Moreover, antibody staining of the linear heart tube at stage-33/34 showed that the expression of Tropomyosin was also generally minimally affected (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D′ vs. E′), indicating that later events up to linear heart-tube formation were not substantially perturbed. Therefore, in post gastrulation Xenopus embryos, cardiac differentiation can occur in the absence of cell-cycle progression.\n\n【26】3.3. Xic1 is expressed in the Xenopus embryonic heart {#s3c}\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【27】We first investigated whether the CDKI Xic1 is expressed at the right time and in the right place to be playing a role in cardiac development.

By stage-31, these swimming tadpoles are expressing Xic1 more intensely in the head, eye, and myotome region, and additionally in the ventral heart region just posterior to the cement gland^[@CVN105C7],[@CVN105C8]^ (data not shown).

Linear heart-tube formation in Xenopus is completed by stage-32^[@CVN105C18]^ and the tube can be dissected out as a discrete entity from stage-33/34 onwards. We dissected hearts from stage-33/4 to stage-42 embryos (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#CVN105F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}F) along with tailbud tissue, where Xic1 is strongly expressed^[@CVN105C8]^ as a positive control, and RT--PCR was performed to detect Xic1 expression. Xic1 message is clearly detectable in the heart and levels do not change dramatically from stages-33/4 to stage-42 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#CVN105F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}G). Therefore, Xic1 is expressed at the right time and in the right place to play a role in cell-cycle exit and differentiation of the Xenopus heart.\n\n【31】3.4. Xic1 depletion results in loss of differentiated heart {#s3d}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】To investigate the effect of Xic1 overexpression, we injected mRNA encoding either full-length Xic1 or deletion-constructs encompassing the N- or C-terminal regions, targeted to the developing heart region. Interestingly, injection of these constructs had no significant effect on heart formation (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S3]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n【33】As Xic1 is expressed in the developing heart, we also investigated the effect of Xic1 depletion on heart formation in Xenopus. Antisense morpholino-oligonucleotide (Mo) injection blocks translation of Xic1 mRNA in Xenopus embryos,^[@CVN105C8]^ resulting in undetectable levels of the protein (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1C]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Xic1Mo, or a specific CTRMo, was targeted to the heart region by injection into two dorsal-vegetal blastomeres at the 8-cell stage. Embryos were allowed to develop to stage-29/30, when the extent of cardiac differentiation in embryos was visualized as two symmetrical flat plates expressing TIc (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--D) and/or Nkx2.10 (not shown), either side of the ventral midline. The area of the cardiac plate was scored blindly on a scale of 0 to 3, as described earlier. Embryos were also observed at stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}E--H) when the linear heart-tube has formed but before morphological looping has commenced.\n\n【34】Targeted injection of Xic1Mo resulted in a significant decrease in the size of the differentiating heart, as indicated by expression of TIc, when compared to sibling-uninjected embryos (e.g. Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--C and E--G, and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1D]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Although differentiated heart tissue was clearly diminished in Xic1 depleted embryos, nevertheless myocardial wall closure commenced normally, since the linear heart-tube was clearly visible at stage-33/4 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1D]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Following injection of Xic1Mo, 39% of embryos exhibited a substantially reduced heart (0 or 1 based on TIc expression) whereas only 5% of CTRMo-injected embryos exhibited a similar phenotype (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}J). Interestingly, we observed no difference in the heart rate of stage-37/8 Xic1 depleted embryos (49.6 ± 4.8, n = 16), where hearts were visible, compared to stage matched uninjected (50.1 ± 3.9, n = 15) or CTRMo-injected (50.3 ± 4.0, n = 19) embryos. Thus, upon depletion of Xic1, late-stage embryos still generally retain a broadly functional, albeit smaller, hearts. However, we occasionally observed alive embryos without a detectable heart beat, presumably corresponding to embryos which exhibited no expression of cardiac differentiation markers in the ISH studies (scored as '0').\n\n【35】To demonstrate specificity for loss of Xic1 protein, we co-injected Xic1Mo with mRNA coding for Xic1, which could not be targeted by the morpholino (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1A and B]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Co-injection of CTRMo with this Xic1 RNA had only a very small effect on heart size similar to Xic1 mRNA on its own (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S3B]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), where hearts remained predominantly size 3 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}J). However, the reduction in heart size seen after Xic1Mo injection was significantly rescued by co-injection with Xic1 mRNA; the percentage of embryos with a severely reduced heart (score of 0 or 1) dropped by half, from 39 to 19%, while the number of size 3 hearts rose from 24 to 57% (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}J). Therefore, Xic1 is required for heart formation in Xenopus.\n\n【36】CTRMo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}K) or Xic1Mo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}L) injected embryos were sectioned, and stained for Tropomyosin and phH3. As we saw by ISH for TIc, we observed a range of phenotypes (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S4]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The majority of Xic1Mo injected embryos showed a marked reduction in the total number of differentiated cardiomyocytes when compared to CTRMo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}M). Indeed in some embryos, few if any, differentiated cardiomyocytes could be detected in any of the sections (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}L′). On average, we observed a 50% reduction in total number of cardiomyocytes in sections from Xic1Mo injected embryos (310 ± 175) when compared to sections from CTRMo injected embryos (639 ± 192) (n = 5, P = 0.022) (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}N). Depletion Xic1 did not result in a detectable induction of apoptosis, as no increase TUNEL positive nuclei following injection of Xic1Mo (16 ± 22, n = 5) was seen, compared to uninjected (30 ± 15, n = 5) or CTRMo injected (46 ± 13, n = 5) embryos.\n\n【37】Upon injection of Xic1Mo, we did not observe a significantly change in the number of phH3-expressing cells in the remaining Tropomyosin-positive tissue (1.4 ± 0.6%, percentage of phH3 positive cardiomyocytes, n = 5), when compared to sections from CTRMo injected embryos (1.9 ± 0.9%) (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}N), or in the surrounding area (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}L′ and data not shown). These results suggest that Xic1 is probably not the central regulator of cell-cycle exit in this tissue at this time, but it may be present to fulfil an alternative function in differentiation.\n\n【38】3.5. The cardiac differentiation function of Xic1 is located N-terminally but is distinct from its CDK kinase inhibitory activity {#s3e}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】It has previously been reported that Xic1 is required for differentiation of primary neurons and myotomal muscle, independent of its ability to arrest the cell cycle, and this function is localized to the N-terminus of Xic1.^[@CVN105C7],[@CVN105C8]^ Hence, we wished to determine whether it is the cell-cycle inhibitory function of Xic1 that is required for cardiac differentiation, or whether an additional function of Xic1 beyond cell-cycle regulation is required. To this end, we attempted rescue of the reduced cardiac phenotype seen after injection of Xic1Mo using Xic1 mutant constructs.\n\n【40】Embryos were injected with CTRMo or Xic1Mo, either with or without mRNA for non-targeted Xic1-FL (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1A and B]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) or truncation mutants of Xic1 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S2]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Following targeted injections, embryos were allowed to develop to the cardiac plate stage, stage-29/30, and Nkx2.10 and TIc expression was determined. As expected, the majority of embryos injected with Xic1Mo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}C, J, and P) demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of these markers of cardiac differentiation compared to uninjected (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}A and H) and CTRMo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}B and I) injected controls (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}T). This Xic1Mo-induced cardiac phenotype could be effectively rescued by co-injection with either FL-Xic1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}D, K, and Q) or NT-Xic1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}E and L), where the percentage of embryos with size 3 hearts rose from 14 to 54% and 41%, respectively (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}T). Interestingly, Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u>, which can inhibit overall CDK-kinase activity, has only a small rescuing ability (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}G, N, and T) while the C-terminus of Xic1 shows no rescuing ability (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}F, M, and T). These results indicate that requirement for Xic1 in heart formation goes beyond its ability to control cell-cycle progression since both the N-terminus and C-terminus are able to inhibit the cell cycle, yet only the N-terminus can rescue cardiac differentiation.\n\n【41】![The requirement for Xic1 in cardiomyocyte differentiation is distinct from its ability to arrest the cell cycle. Stage-29/30 embryos either uninjected (A and H) or injected with CTRMo (B and I), Xic1Mo (C, J, and P), or Xic1Mo plus FL-Xic1 (30 pg) (D, K, and Q), NT-Xic1 (15 pg) (E and L), CT-Xic1 (30 pg) (F and M), Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u> (30 pg) (G and N), Xic1^CK-^ (R), or CTRMo plus Xic1^CK-^ (S) detecting either Nkx2.10 (A--G) or TIc (H--S).

The residues within Xic1 which are critical for cyclin and CDK bindings have been previously identified by mutagenesis and a Xic1 construct with mutations within both the cyclin-binding domain (R33A and L35A) and CDK-binding domains (F65A and F67A) has been described, which is unable to bind to CDK2 and Cyclin E,^[@CVN105C19]^ the predominant CDK/cyclin pair at this stage in development. Hence, we constructed a Xic1 mutant, Xic1^CK-^, engineered to prevent targeting by Xic1Mo, and performed rescue experiments by co-injection with Xic1Mo (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S2]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Interestingly, this mutant still had the ability to rescue the loss of cardiac differentiation observed following injection of Xic1 Mo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}R and T).\n\n【43】3.6. Xic1 depletion inhibits later stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation {#s3f}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Our results indicate that Xic1 is required for cardiomyocyte differentiation and this effect is detectable by stage-29/30. However, we wished to determine whether Xic1 is required early in specification of cardiomyocytes or later, during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Thus, first we investigated the expression of Xic1 transcripts in the presumptive cardiac field during early stages of development and compared its expression to that of Nkx2.5.^[@CVN105C20]^ In our hands, Nkx2.5 is first detected at stage-15 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}A) and in agreement with previous reports, its expression, although somewhat diffuse, is localized to the ventral region of Xenopus embryos.^[@CVN105C20]^ In contrast, at the same stages of development, the expression of Xic1 transcript is predominantly localized dorsally although a low level of anterior-ventral expression can be seen (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}B, stage-16/7 and stage-18).\n\n【45】![Xic1 is required for late stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation.

After targeted injection of Xic1Mo or CTRMo, Nkx2.5 expression was not significantly altered, indicating that Xic1 is not required for formation of the cardiac field at early stages of development (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【47】Loss of Xic1 has a marked effect at later stages of development, resulting in defective cardiac differentiation (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To determine where in the cardiomyocyte differentiation program Xic1 is required, Xic1Mo or CTRMo-injected embryos were harvested at increasing stages of development. cDNA was prepared and assayed by semi-quantitative RT--PCR for expression of TIc and MHCα, late markers of cardiomyocyte differentiation. While at stages-24 and -26, the effect of Xic1Mo on TIc was unclear, by stage-27/28 the expression of TIc was reduced in the Xic1-depleted embryos and this persisted up to stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). MHCα was undetectable at earlier stages but by stage-27/28 when levels were increasing, MHCα expression was absent in embryos injected with Xic1Mo, through to stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}D). These results confirm that Xic1 is required at these later stages when cardiomyocyte differentiation occurs. xTIc and xMHCa are both expressed in the primary heart-tube, throughout the embryonic myocardium at later stages of development. In contrast, MLC1v is found in the primary heart-tube and later, only specifically in the ventricles but not in the atria.^[@CVN105C21]^ The quantitative-PCR analysis shows that MLC1v is also downregulated after Xic1 depletion (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}E), demonstrating that at least the primary heart field is affected by the loss of Xic1.\n\n【48】4. Discussion {#s4}\n==============\n\n【49】We aimed to determine the extent to which cell-cycle progression is required for either the specification of the presumptive cardiac field or for differentiation of Xenopus cardiomyocytes. We found mitotic phH3-expressing cells co-expressing the cardiac differentiation marker Tropomyosin (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A), suggesting that at least up to stage-41 of Xenopus embryonic development, differentiating cardiomyocytes can still undergo active cell division. These observations are in agreement with early reports of observed cytokinesis in dividing embryonic rat and mouse cardiomyocytes which are gradually diminished at early postnatal stage.^[@CVN105C2]^ We observed an increase in the total number of cardiomyocytes in the developing Xenopus heart resulting in a four-fold increase from stage-29/30 to stage 41 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). The total number of cardiomyocytes doubled from stage-32 to stage-37/8, consistent with a previous report in the same species by Goetz et al.^[@CVN105C15]^ and with the morphological changes that occur as the linear heart-tube undergoes right-hand looping. Indeed, a small percentage of cells remain in cycle even as late as stage-41 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Interestingly, at stages-31 and -32 we observed a statistically significant increase in the percentage cardiomyocytes that were mitotic (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). These findings are consistent with the reported increase in the length of linear heart-tube in Xenopus embryo, where proliferation may be a prerequisite for the looping to commence.^[@CVN105C18]^\n\n【50】It has been proposed that cardiomyocytes have an intrinsic program of cell division that dictates the number of cell cycles before differentiation can occur.^[@CVN105C22]^ However, it is not clear whether cell division per se is required for cardiac specification and differentiation, as is the case in other cell types such as cortical neurons.^[@CVN105C23]^ Neither is it clear whether, in Xenopus, cell division of cardiac precursors is actually required for formation of a cardiac plate of normal size. Therefore, we addressed these questions by looking at specification and differentiation of the cardiac plate after the cell cycle had been substantially inhibited by incubation of embryos in HUA. Since cell-fate determination and specification of cardiogenic precursor cells of the primary heart field is thought to occur during gastrulation,^[@CVN105C24]^ cell-cycle arrest in our embryos by incubation in HUA from stage-13 should not interfere with this process. Tropomyosin (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D and E), TIc (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}F and G), and Nkx2.10 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}H and J) expression was minimally affected by HUA treatment, indicating that the final cardiac plate area is not substantially determined by proliferation of a small number of committed cardiac progenitors post-gastrulation, and indeed cell proliferation beyond gastrulation is not absolutely required for specification or differentiation of cardiomyocytes in the cardiac plate (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Our results are consistent with observations in chick embryos, where Soufan et al.^[@CVN105C25]^ demonstrated that a four-fold increase in the length of the primary heart-tube had occurred when the tube hardly displayed any proliferative activity, as quantified by a very low phH3-labelling index. These authors demonstrated that the majority of the growth in the linear heart-tube was attributed to the 'recruitment' of precursor cells to the linear heart-tube.^[@CVN105C25]^\n\n【51】Although Xenopus has three CDKIs,^[@CVN105C12],[@CVN105C26]^ Xic1 is the predominant CDKI expressed at early developmental stages, sharing homology with all members of the mammalian CIP/KIP family.^[@CVN105C27]^ We see that Xic1 is expressed in developing heart (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#CVN105F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The timing of expression of Xic1 in cardiomyocytes at late tail-bud stages of development fits well with a role in controlling cardiomyocyte differentiation rather than a role in earlier specification. We explored this further. We investigated whether Xic1 is required for formation of the Xenopus heart, and if so, whether it acted at an early stage of specification or later stages in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Previous reports demonstrate that overexpression of Xic1 results in both an increase in the number of primary neurons and an expanded myotome.^[@CVN105C7],[@CVN105C8]^ However, we did not observe any substantial alteration in Xenopus heart size following overexpression of Xic1 or Xic1 mutants thereof (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S3B]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n【52】Why does overexpression of Xic1 expand the myotome but not the heart? Myotomal muscle can be induced by a single myogenic factor, MyoD. We have previously demonstrated that both MyoD and Xic1 must be above threshold levels to promote myotomal muscle differentiation.^[@CVN105C8]^ However, unlike the myotome, cardiomyocyte differentiation involves numerous cardiogenic transcription factors acting in concert. Therefore, even though Xic1 may be required for cardiomyocyte differentiation, elevation of Xic1 levels alone may be insufficient to promote further cardiogenesis, leading to a bigger heart.\n\n【53】To determine whether Xic1 is required for heart formation, we inhibited Xic1 using Xic1Mo. Loss of Xic1 resulted in a substantial decrease in the area of the cardiac plate expressing Nkx2.10 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}C), TIc (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}J and P), and also cardiac-actin and MHCα (not shown) at stage-29/30, with a corresponding decrease in the size of the heart- tube at stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}K and L, and 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1D]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Moreover, the depletion of Xic1 resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the number of differentiated cardiomyocytes expressing Tropomyosin at stage-33/34 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}M and N). The loss of differentiated cardiomyocytes was specifically due to loss of Xic1, as this phenotype could be rescued to a large extent by co-injection of Xic1 mRNA (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}J, 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}D, K, and T).\n\n【54】At neurula stages, Xic1 is not strongly expressed in the cardiac field (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}B), suggesting that Xic1 is unlikely to play a role in the early stages of cardiac development. However, its later expression in the anterio-ventral region of tailbud stage embryos where cardiac differentiation occurs (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#CVN105F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--E) indicates that Xic1 may function in later stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Loss of Xic1 had no effect on expression of Nkx2.5 at early stages, indicating that Xic1 levels do not influence the specification of the presumptive cardiac field (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). However, expression of later markers of cardiac differentiation were reduced by Xic1Mo (Figures 通用删除6(英):<u>[4--6]</u>(#CVN105F4 CVN105F5 CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). As Xic1 depletion also resulted in diminishing expression of xMLc1v, this suggests that Xic1 is needed for the differentiation of the primary heart-tube. It would be interesting to know if Xic1 also affects the differentiation of the artrioventricular canal, the atrium and/or the secondary heart field and septation of atrium which occurs at stages-44 and beyond in Xenopus. However, this may not be possible in Xenopus embryos using the same strategy, as these events occur at stages beyond those at which morpholinos are likely to be effective.\n\n【55】To determine whether Xic1's role in differentiation is solely to promote cell-cycle exit in cardiomyocytes, we rescued Xic1Mo-induced loss of cardiac differentiation with different Xic1 deletion constructs, which all have the ability to inhibit cell-cycle progression (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S3A]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) but by different mechanisms. FL-Xic1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}D, K, Q, and T) and NT-Xic1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}E, L, and T) both inhibit CDK-kinase activity and can rescue cardiomyocyte differentiation. In contrast CT-Xic1, which inhibits the cell cycle by binding PCNA, cannot rescue the loss of differentiated heart tissue seen with Xic1Mo (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}F, M, and T). Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u> can block the cell cycle and inhibit the majority of CDK kinase activity but it cannot promote neurogenesis or myogenesis in the early tadpole.^[@CVN105C7],[@CVN105C8]^ However, Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u> can partially rescue the loss of cardiomyocyte differentiation, albeit more weakly that FL-Xic1 and NT-Xic1 constructs (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}T).\n\n【56】Our results suggest that Xic1 is required for late stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Is this because it must drive cells to exit the cell cycle to terminally differentiate? Our evidence argues against this possibility: first, Xenopus cardiomyocytes can still divide even when expressing markers of terminal differentiation (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#CVN105F1){ref-type=\"fig\"} and Goetz et al.^[@CVN105C15]^), indicating that cell-cycle exit is not an absolute prerequisite for this process. Second, the C-terminus of Xic1 is able to inhibit the cell cycle (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S3A]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) yet it cannot rescue the loss of heart seen when endogenous Xic1 is lost (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#CVN105F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}F, M, and T). Third, we see no significant difference in the total number of phH3 expressing mitotic cardiomyocytes following injection of Xic1Mo (1.4 ± 0.6%), when compared to sections from CTRMo injected embryos (1.9 ± 0.9%) (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#CVN105F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}N), indicating that Xic1 does not regulate cell-cycle exit in this tissue.\n\n【57】However, our results did not rule out the possibility that the ability of Xic1 to promote cardiac differentiation might be due to the ability of Xic1 to bind to and inhibit Cyclin/CDK2 activity. FL-Xic1, NT-Xic1 and Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u> all share the ability to inhibit overall CDK2 kinase activity and all are able to restore heart differentiation to a greater or lesser extent when co-injected with Xic1Mo. Indeed, Xic1通用删除7(英):<u>(35--96)</u> produces a less efficient rescue that FL-Xic1 and NT-Xic1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}T), and this might be because it is fully able to inhibit Cyclin E/CDK2, the predominant CDK2 kinase at these stages, but it has a reduced ability to inhibit Cyclin A2/CDK2.^[@CVN105C28]^\n\n【58】Thus, to address this possibility, we performed rescue experiments using a Xic1 mutant (Xic1^CK-^) harbouring mutations within the cyclin (R33A, L35A) and CDK (F65A, F67A) binding domains (通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S2]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). It had previously been reported that these mutations abolish the binding ability of Xic1 to CDK2 and cyclin E.^[@CVN105C19]^ Xic1^CK-^ is effective at rescuing the loss of cardiac differentiation seen with Xic1Mo injection (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#CVN105F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}R, T). This indicates that inhibition of cyclin E/CDK2, the predominant cyclin/CDK pair at this stage, is not essential for Xic1's role in cardiac differentiation. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the Xic1^CK-^ mutant may retain some ability to bind to and inhibit the activity of cyclin A2/CDK2 or another cyclin/CDK pair, which regulates cardiomyocyte differentiation. However, we would note that cyclin A2 expression is essentially undetectable in the Xenopus heart up to stage-33/4 of development.^[@CVN105C29]^\n\n【59】Loss of the mammalian CDKI, p27^Kip1^, in mice leads to bigger organs, including the heart, demonstrated to be due to an increase in the total cell number.^[@CVN105C30]^ However, this may only occur in species where cell proliferation of precursors contributes substantially to growth of the heart, and this appears not to be the case in Xenopus (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#CVN105F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}D--K), and redundancy may allow other CDKIs to perform essential differentiation functions in mammals following knockout of a single CDKI.\n\n【60】So how is Xic1 playing a role in cardiac differentiation, if not via its cell-cycle regulatory function? Interestingly, the mammalian CDKI p57^Kip2^ has been shown to physically interact with the myogenic factor MyoD, further stabilizing and increasing its half-life.^[@CVN105C31]^ It is possible that Xic1 might be binding to one of the many transcription factors that drive cardiac differentiation, leading to its stabilization and thus further promoting cardiogenesis, although, we have been unable to demonstrate a physical interaction between in vitro translated Xic1 and either Nkx2.5, Tbx5, GATA4, or Myocardin proteins by immunoprecipitation (data not shown).\n\n【61】In summary, here we provide evidence that a CDKI plays an important role in cardiac differentiation beyond its ability to arrest the cell cycle. Currently, much is being learned about the multi-functionality of CDK inhibitors, and if we are to understand the versatility of these molecules, it will be important to investigate CDKI function in systems where effects on the cell cycling can be distinguished from other less obvious roles.\n\n【62】Supplementary material {#s5}\n======================\n\n【63】[Supplementary material is available at Cardiovascular Research online](#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}.\n\n【64】Funding {#s6}\n=======\n\n【65】This work was supported by British Heart Foundation project grant PG/03/068.\n\n【66】Supplementary Material\n======================\n\n【67】###### \n\n【68】Click here for additional data file.\n\n【69】We are indebted to Ruth Cosgrove who provided the data in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Supplementary material online, Figure S1C]</u>(#sup1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}, Tim Mohun, Branko Latinik, and Paul Krieg for reagents, Ian Horan for impeccable technical assistance and Tim Mohun, Peter Weissberg, Christelle Fiore-Heriche, Shinichi Ohnuma, Elizabeth Jones, and Toshiyaki Mochizuki for helpful discussions.

If untreated, this disease follows a typical course, from chronic phase (CP) toward an ill-defined accelerated phase (AP) to the final blast crisis (BC) within 3--5 years.\\[[@ref1][@ref2]\\] Majority of patients are diagnosed in CML-CP and median survival of these patients is 5--6 years in the absence of the treatment.\\[[@ref3]\\] If the CML patients are left untreated, their progression from the accelerated phase to blast crisis typically occurs within 2 to 15 months. Furthermore in these patients, median survival of the patients in blast crisis is 3-6 months in absence of treatment.\\[[@ref4]\\]\n\n【2】Over the years, many prognostic scoring models have been developed for risk stratification of CML. The three principal risk scores such as Sokal, Euro, and European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS) were established in different eras of CML therapy with implications for prognosis and disease outcome.\\[[@ref5][@ref6][@ref7][@ref8]\\] Sokal score was developed in the era of chemotherapy, while Euro score was proposed in the time of interferon-alpha administration and EUTOS score was projected in Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) era.

Hence, its validation is important for the clinical management of CML.

CML-CP was diagnosed according to the WHO 2008 criteria and diagnosis was performed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the Ph chromosome. These patients consisted of 166 males and 94 females with a median age of 35 years. All these patients were started on oral imatinib 400 mg/day (Novartis, Bale, Switzerland). The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n【7】Baseline characteristics of the patients including age, gender, spleen size, hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (percentage of myeloblasts, basophils, and eosinophils), and platelet count in peripheral blood were recorded.

Various baseline factors such as clonal chromosome abnormalities in Ph+ cells, specific multidrug resistance polymorphisms, and the detailed molecular analysis of the genome have been reported to influence the response to imatinib and OS in CML patients.\\[[@ref22][@ref23][@ref24]\\] However, due to requirement of technical expertise and cumbersome time taking techniques for the assessment of above-mentioned factors, these cannot be routinely investigated in daily clinical practice. Hence, on the basis of easily available clinical and hematological parameters, the various scoring models have been designed for prognostic evaluation at diagnosis. In the past three decades, risk stratification for CML patients primarily relied on Sokal and Euro scores which were developed in the year 1984 and 1988, respectively.\\[[@ref25][@ref26][@ref27]\\] Then Europeans designed EUTOS score during the TKI era in year 2011, which was based on more than 2000 CML-CP patients treated with imatinib.\\[[@ref7]\\]\n\n【28】Studies validating the role of these scores in prognostication of CML patients on imatinib have shown conflicting results. The reasons for the mixed observations with these scores are: first, the heterogeneity in the study population and second, the type or dose of the treatment in the form of TKIs as per various studies. Therefore, the aim of our study was to analyze the predictive values of all the three prognostic scoring systems in CML-CP patients on 400 mg/day imatinib. We found that both the Sokal and Euro scores were clinically effective prognostic indicators but not the EUTOS score. In contrast to the Sokal and Euro scores, which predicted the significant cumulative incidence of MMR, EFS, and OS, the EUTOS score was not able to predict the same.\n\n【29】Our patients had a median age of 35 years at presentation, which is in contrast to studies in Western population in which median age is between 40 and 50 years.\\[[@ref28]\\] This signifies the important finding of this study that the presentation of CML occurs in comparatively younger Indian population.\\[[@ref29]\\] Thus, it is really very important to assess the prognostic capability of these scores in predicting clinical outcome in this predominantly young adult population.\n\n【30】Using the Sokal score, 92 (35.38%), 125 (48.07%), and 43 (16.5%) patients were divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk score, respectively. As per Euro score, 102 (39.23%), 106 (40.76%), and 52 (20%) patients were divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk score, respectively. Our findings are in line with previous studies from European population and Western population.\\[[@ref5][@ref7][@ref14][@ref16]\\] According to the EUTOS score, 210 patients (80.7%) and 50 patients (19.2%) were in low-risk and high-risk score respectively, which is similar to the study from European population but in contrast to study from Chinese population by Tao et al.\\[[@ref10][@ref11][@ref12][@ref13]\\]\n\n【31】According to Sokal score, cumulative incidence of MMR was 87%, 76%, and 84% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk group, respectively (P = 0.016). As per Euro score, cumulative incidence of MMR was 93%, 85%, and 68% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk group, respectively (P = 0.001). Both EFS and OS were significantly correlated with Sokal score (P = 0.004 and P = 0.007) and Euro score (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001). Our findings are also confirmed by Yamamoto et al. Marin et al. and Jabbour et al. in Japanese, German, and Western population, respectively. These studies indicated the significance of Sokal and Euro score in forecasting the outcome in CML patients and also questioned the validity of the EUTOS scoring system.\\[[@ref14][@ref15][@ref16]\\] However, contradictory results were suggested by Hoffman et al. in German population.\\[[@ref12]\\]\n\n【32】As per EUTOS score, cumulative incidence of MMR for low- and high-risk group was 80% and 81%, respectively (P = 0.764). No significant correlation was observed for EFS and OS with EUTOS score (P = 0.581 and P = 0.927). There are conflicting opinions, regarding the use of EUTOS system for the prognostic evaluation of CML.\\[[@ref9][@ref10][@ref11][@ref12][@ref13][@ref14][@ref15][@ref16]\\] In contrast to study by Hoffman et al.and Tao et al. in German population and Chinese population, respectively, who revealed the significant correlation of EUTOS score with treatment outcome,\\[[@ref10][@ref12]\\] numerous studies from Japanese, German, and Western population did not find any significant association of this score with prognostication of the patients. Our findings are in line with the above-mentioned studies by Jabbour et al. Marin et al. and Yamamoto et al.\\[[@ref13][@ref14][@ref15]\\]\n\n【33】Conclusion {#sec1-5}\n==========\n\n【34】The present study highlighted the significant prognostic role of Sokal and Euro score in predicting the treatment outcome of the CML-CP patients. One of the possible reasons for parallel results in Sokal and euro scores may be due to the involvement of similar factors in their calculation such as age, platelet count, and blast cell count. The present study was not able to validate the effectiveness of the EUTOS score in predicting the clinical outcome. This difference in findings of the EUTOS score may be due to the following reasons; first, it is calculated by two parameters as used in calculating Sokal and Euro score, i.e. basophil count and splenomegaly, and second, there was the comparatively small proportion of the patients in the high-risk group. Hence, we recommend the routine application of Sokal and Euro score in prognostication of CML-CP patients on imatinib. Future projects involving the development of new prognostic models may open the window for prognostication of CML patients at presentation and will provide insight into selecting the most appropriate therapy for a better outcome in this modern era of TKIs therapy.\n\n【35】Financial support and sponsorship {#sec2-1}\n---------------------------------\n\n【36】The first author Sunita Chhikara acknowledges the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, for the research fellowship.\n\n【37】Conflicts of interest {#sec2-2}\n---------------------\n\n【38】There are no conflicts of interest.\n\n【39】Authors wish to acknowledge Mr. Rajender Chhokar and Mr. Arun Dalsus for their technical support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In 2008 to 2009, Consul, Cronos, and Tosca zucchini plants showed symptoms of leaf wilting, basal stem necrosis, and plant death. Incidences of dead plants were 20 to 30% and these plants were distributed in clusters. Phytophthora capsici Leonian was isolated from the basal stems of symptomatic plants, using PDA and cornmeal agar amended with a pimaricin, ampicillin, and rifampicin. Five resultant isolates (PCl-211, PCl-221, PCl-611, PCl-612, and PCl-811) on lima beans agar (LBA) produced white mycelia with lemon-shaped and papillate sporangia borne on long pedicels, but no oospores or chlamydospores. These isolates had an identical ribosomal DNA ITS sequence, matching with that of P. capsici in GenBank. The sequences of two representative isolates, PCl-211 and PCl-811, were deposited in GenBank with accession nos. KC662328 and KC688317, respectively.

Few physicians would doubt that the efficacy of a medication itself and patient compliance with the therapeutic regimen both influence the effectiveness of a treatment regimen.\n\n【3】In guidelines dealing with therapy of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, antihistamines or topical corticosteroids are recommended as the first-line treatment while AIT is only indicated when pharmacotherapy insufficiently controls symptoms.[@b2-ppa-8-1475] For asthma treatment, the current guidelines recommend AIT even more reluctant.[@b5-ppa-8-1475] It is generally assumed that pharmacotherapy shows an immediate onset of action, whereas AIT must be applied longer to achieve symptom relief. In contrast to that, new data based on meta-analyses evidenced indirectly but consistently that SCIT is at least as potent as pharmacotherapy such as antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, or leukotriene antagonists in controlling symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis as early as in the first treatment season.[@b6-ppa-8-1475] This effect is claimed as \"treatment of allergic symptoms\" by the Guideline on the clinical development of products for specific immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic diseases by the European Medicines Agency.[@b7-ppa-8-1475] Additional benefits of SCIT are its \"sustained effect\" (during 2 years or 3 years treatment)[@b8-ppa-8-1475]--[@b11-ppa-8-1475] and \"long-term and disease-modifying efficacy\" (eg, prevention of new sensitizations and asthma).[@b12-ppa-8-1475]--[@b14-ppa-8-1475] According to guidelines, a therapy of at least 3 consecutive years is required to achieve the latter effect.[@b4-ppa-8-1475] Lack of compliance is even a contraindication for AIT.[@b15-ppa-8-1475] Allergen-specific immunotherapy should be performed for at least 3 years but many patients stop it prematurely and are therefore noncompliant. The same problem applies to the treatment of other chronic diseases such as epilepsy (noncompliance 46%--88%), diabetes (66%--85%), hypertension (39%--93%), or asthma (37%--92%).[@b16-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【4】The aim of this sales data analysis was to investigate \"real life\" compliance to SCIT and SLIT in German patients receiving preparations from Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG, Reinbek, Germany.\n\n【5】Methods\n=======\n\n【6】For safety reasons, Allergopharma labels all AIT products in Germany with the patient's name independently of the product's registration status. Therefore, it can be exactly backtracked how many prescriptions each patient has received. Sales data from the Allergopharma enterprise resource planning system (ERP Blending) were analyzed for patients (children, adolescents, and adults) starting SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen (Allergovit^®^) or house dust mite preparations (Acaroid^®^), unmodified pollen or mite (house dust mites and storage mites) preparations (Novo-Helisen^®^ Depot), or SLIT with high-dose pollen preparations (AllerSlit^®^ forte) in Germany. We selected sales data for patients who received their first prescription for SCIT or SLIT in 2007, and we wanted to compare compliance of both administration routes. There was no selection with regard to patients' characteristics, specialization or size of practice of the prescribing physician, allergen(s) administered, or different parts of the country where physicians' budgets for medications may vary. To identify patients' compliance, the number of prescriptions per patient during a 5-year period 通用删除7(英):<u>(2007--2011)</u> was evaluated and based on this \"completed treatment years\" were determined. A \"completed treatment year\" was defined by the required number of prescribed packages according to the recommended dosage scheme of each preparation, as specified in the respective summary of product characteristics (SmPCs) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}). The high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparation Allergovit^®^ may be administered preseasonally (with seven injections within 6 weeks before the respective pollen season for 3 consecutive years) or perennially (updosing with the preseasonal scheme followed by maintenance therapy every 4--5 weeks for 3 consecutive years). A patient was defined as treated \"preseasonally\" when he/she received only initial treatment packages over the years. In this case, at least one initial treatment package was necessary per \"completed treatment year\" to be defined as compliant (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}). A patient was defined as \"perennially\" treated with Allergovit^®^ when additionally at least one later maintenance package was prescribed. SCIT with the high-dose hypoallergenic mite preparation Acaroid^®^ as well as SCIT with the unmodified pollen or mite preparation Novo-Helisen^®^ Depot are administered perennially. For perennial SCIT, a higher number of prescriptions were necessary per \"completed treatment year\" (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}); therefore, maintenance treatment sets containing two vials were counted as two units. High-dose pollen SLIT with AllerSlit^®^ forte is also administered perennially. As it is taken at home every day by the patient, the number of required prescriptions is highest (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【7】Patients' compliance was additionally evaluated for the three age groups: children (2--11 years), adolescents (12--17 years), and adults (18 years and older). The age groups were defined according to the ICH E11 guideline Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population.[@b17-ppa-8-1475] But there were no children under 5 years of age in our database, as children under 5 years of age are normally not considered as suitable candidates for AIT.[@b15-ppa-8-1475] This is in accordance with Article 45 of the Pediatric Regulation of the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures -- Human (CMDh).[@b18-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【8】Prescription data from 85,241 patients receiving SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic or unmodified pollen or mite preparations and 706 patients receiving SLIT with high-dose pollen preparations were included in this analysis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#t2-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【9】Results\n=======\n\n【10】通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#f1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows results for patients' compliance (%) described as \"completed treatment years\" (within 2007--2011) with SCIT or SLIT receiving pollen (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1A]</u>(#f1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}) or mite preparations (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1B]</u>(#f1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【11】Patients' compliance decreased from year to year independently of the preparation or dosage scheme. Patients under SCIT with the high-dose hypoallergenic mite preparation did seem to show slightly lower compliance rates than with the respective pollen preparation. For unmodified SCIT preparations, the compliance rates for at least 3 treatment years were 42% for pollen and 45% for mite preparations.\n\n【12】The compliance rate with pollen SLIT was the lowest: 47% of patients discontinued therapy within the first treatment year, 26% of patients were compliant for at least 2 years, and only 16% of patients received prescriptions for at least 3 treatment years, as recommended (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#f1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【13】Compliance with SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations was higher when administered perennially than preseasonally (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#f2-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【14】Comparing perennial application of pollen preparations (high-dose hypoallergenic SCIT, unmodified SCIT and SLIT) shows that compliance with SCIT was obviously twofold to nearly fourfold higher than with SLIT in the third treatment year (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#f3-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【15】We also investigated the aspect whether there are different compliance rates with different pollen allergens, eg, grass pollen (long pollination period from May to September) vs tree pollen (short pollination period from March to May) (data not shown). We could not find any difference between the groups.\n\n【16】Patients' age seemed to influence compliance with AIT. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#t3-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"} shows detailed results for compliance with the various preparations in three different age groups including children (5--11 years), adolescents (12--17 years), and adults (≥18 years). Children were always most compliant independent of the preparation and the treatment year, while adults showed lowest compliance rates. Nevertheless, patients' compliance in the three different age groups reflected the same pattern like in the total population: compliance with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen SCIT was higher when administered perennially than preseasonally; compliance with high-dose hypoallergenic mite or unmodified pollen and mite SCIT was slightly lower than with perennial high-dose hypoallergenic pollen SCIT; and compliance with SLIT was the lowest.\n\n【17】Moreover, the compliance in patients treated by pediatricians was higher compared to other physicians, with the same tendencies for SCIT vs SLIT (data not shown).\n\n【18】Discussion\n==========\n\n【19】Compliance is the degree of constancy and accuracy with which a patient follows a prescribed regimen.[@b19-ppa-8-1475] Patients' compliance is one critical aspect concerning the full benefit of medications that can be achieved only if patients follow prescribed treatment regimens reasonably closely.[@b19-ppa-8-1475] Noncompliance to treatment is a worldwide problem especially in long-term regimens.[@b20-ppa-8-1475],[@b21-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【20】Lack of compliance is one of the contraindications for AIT since treatment should be performed for 3 years.[@b15-ppa-8-1475] Though allergic symptoms and intake of rescue medication are already reduced in the first treatment year, only a full course of 3 years of AIT is able to induce increasing efficacy and long-term benefits, and to alter the natural course of allergic diseases. So it was shown that a second- and third-treatment year of grass pollen SCIT was able to increase efficacy[@b9-ppa-8-1475],[@b22-ppa-8-1475] and that the duration of efficacy after house dust mite SCIT depends upon the duration of therapy.[@b23-ppa-8-1475] Various trials showed long-term and disease-modifying effects after a 3 years' course of SCIT with reduced symptoms and medication need,[@b12-ppa-8-1475],[@b13-ppa-8-1475],[@b24-ppa-8-1475] reduced asthma prevalence,[@b14-ppa-8-1475] or reduced onset of new sensitizations[@b12-ppa-8-1475],[@b25-ppa-8-1475] for up to 12 years after terminating SCIT.\n\n【21】Since it was shown that greater perceived disease severity is associated with better compliance with medications,[@b26-ppa-8-1475] one problem might be that allergic diseases are often trivialized. Patients' expectations are dependent on their knowledge of allergic diseases and the relevant treatment options. Some European surveys showed that most patients with allergic rhinitis were unaware that they are suffering from a medical condition that could be treated successfully.[@b27-ppa-8-1475]--[@b29-ppa-8-1475] Only one-third has sought help from a health professional. The awareness of AIT was very low, and only 21% of patients were offered AIT in France.[@b27-ppa-8-1475] Moreover, most patients with allergic diseases consult primary care instead of allergy specialists.[@b30-ppa-8-1475] According to a large patient sample survey of allergic disorders in Germany, only 7% of patients with rhinitis and 5% of patients with allergic asthma received AIT, mostly performed by specialists.[@b31-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【22】There is still a controversial debate whether SCIT or SLIT might result in higher compliance. Some argue that SLIT with taking the medication at home might improve patients' compliance, while others assume that the regular visits at the physicians' practice for the injections of SCIT provides better compliance.[@b32-ppa-8-1475],[@b33-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【23】Compliance with treatment is known to be far better in randomized controlled trials than in \"real life\".[@b19-ppa-8-1475],[@b34-ppa-8-1475] Therefore, we used Allergopharma sales data to evaluate patients' compliance with AIT in the daily practice.\n\n【24】To our knowledge, this survey is the largest one investigating patients' compliance with AIT evaluating \"real life\" sales data of more than 85,000 patients. But as it only focuses on sales data, it has some limitations. The Allergopharma database is a prescription database that does not contain any information about patients' medical history and previous or additional medications. Thus, it is impossible to verify if the AIT groups were matched -- eg, for clinical characteristics -- when starting AIT. There were far more SCIT patients than SLIT patients in the evaluation because of the later market access of the SLIT preparation. Besides, no prescription implies that the patient really started and/or finished the respective prescribed package(s). There is a lack of definition in the group with application of high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations. For this group, it is stated that 100% of preseasonally and perennially treated patients completed at least 1 treatment year. A \"preseasonal patient\" is defined compliant for at least 1 year, when he/she gets at least one initial treatment package (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"table\"}). Preseasonal dropouts during the first year could not be detected as single injections could not be backtracked. Furthermore, patients who should be initially treated perennially, but stopped therapy after receiving one initial treatment package, were not reported as \"perennial dropouts\" during the first year, but as \"preseasonal compliant\" patients for at least 1 treatment year. So, the percentage of compliance in the first year might have been overestimated. Therefore, the first year's data of the high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations should not be directly compared with the other groups. For all other preparations, this lack of definition did not apply (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#f1-ppa-8-1475){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【25】The results on hand indicate that compliance with SCIT is higher than with SLIT independent of whether unmodified or high-dose hypoallergenic SCIT preparations were used, or SCIT was administered preseasonally or perennially. This is in accordance with other surveys conducted in Germany and the Netherlands based on real-life data comparing compliance with SCIT and SLIT.[@b34-ppa-8-1475],[@b35-ppa-8-1475] These and another survey in Italy even found an alarming rate of SLIT discontinuation, which was up to 90% at 3 years after prescription.[@b35-ppa-8-1475],[@b36-ppa-8-1475] In contrast, another German investigation based on a national prescription database (INSIGHT Health) showed higher compliance rates with grass pollen SLIT than with grass pollen SCIT over 3 years on a per-patient basis.[@b32-ppa-8-1475] This deviating result might be caused by a different compliance definition in that survey: patients were identified as \"persistent\" if they renewed their prescription at least once a year, which is not in accordance with the SmPC of the mentioned products. The survey on hand demanded clearly stricter criteria with an obviously higher number of necessary prescriptions per year. This aspect is of special importance if we consider that only the dosage scheme given in the SmPC is the one with proven efficacy in clinical studies.\n\n【26】In our survey with more than 13,500 patients starting mite SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic and unmodified preparations in 2007 compliance was 54% and 45%, respectively, for at least 3 treatment years. Comparable results based on sales data for SLIT with mite preparations in Italy were less than 30%[@b36-ppa-8-1475] confirming our results that compliance with SCIT is higher than with SLIT regardless of prescribing pollen or mite preparations.\n\n【27】A 2-year follow-up survey of children' compliance with SLIT showed that withdrawal rate decreased with the number of visits per year.[@b37-ppa-8-1475] Adequate compliance was reached only in patients called for visits four times per year. Therefore, the pivotal measure to enhance compliance seems to be the frequent control of allergic patients by the physician himself. Similarly, in the analysis on hand, compliance with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen SCIT was higher when administered perennially than preseasonally. This indicates that the perennial treatment schedule seems to allow an improved patient management and may therefore lead to improved patient compliance compared to the preseasonal treatment scheme. Additionally, perennial SCIT with the high-dose hypoallergenic grass pollen preparation Allergovit^®^ was recently shown to be more effective than the preseasonal application in a double-blind, double-dummy trial with reaching significance in the third treatment year.[@b38-ppa-8-1475] Therefore, perennial SCIT with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen preparations resulting in more frequent patient--doctor contacts seems to be favorable to achieve higher compliance with higher efficacy. Physicians have a key role in improving patients' compliance.\n\n【28】To our knowledge, this survey is the first comparing patients' compliance with AIT of children (5--11 years), adolescents (12--17 years), and adults (18 years and older). Interestingly, children' compliance was highest while that of adults was lowest. Good compliance among children and adolescents was also found in a smaller study.[@b39-ppa-8-1475] This is in contrast to results with other medication showing that compliance in general is lower among children and adolescents than in adults.[@b40-ppa-8-1475] It is well known that genetic factors influence development of allergic diseases, and a high proportion of parents of allergic children also suffer from allergic diseases.[@b2-ppa-8-1475] We therefore assume that parents' own experiences and disease burden might motivate them to ensure that their children are compliant with AIT. So, they care for that their children follow the prescribed dosage regimen with SLIT at home and they even accompany their child to every injection when receiving SCIT. In general, education of the patient on allergic disease management is essential. Such education and the resulting preferences of patients for certain treatment regimes, which should be respected if possible, are likely to maximize compliance and optimize treatment outcomes.[@b2-ppa-8-1475],[@b41-ppa-8-1475]\n\n【29】Based on Allergopharma sales data from the German market, we conclude that perennial treatment with high-dose hypoallergenic pollen SCIT seems to be the treatment scheme with the highest patient compliance rates. In addition, SCIT with hypoallergenic or unmodified preparations appears to be superior to SLIT application. Children aged 5--11 years showed the highest compliance rates independent of the preparation applied.\n\n【30】Disclosure\n\n【31】The authors are employees of Allergopharma GmbH & Co. KG.

{"seq_id": "18221401-fbc4-4b3a-a30f-c180d3d9a936", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction\n============\n\n【1】Dens invaginatus is a developmental condition affecting tooth structure prior to calcification of dentin matrix. This condition has also been termed as dens in dente, invaginated odontome, dilated gestant odontome, dentoid in dente and tooth inclusion \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\]. Several theories have been put forward for the etiology of dens invaginatus \\[[@B3], [@B4]\\]. These include the folding in of the enamel organ because of the adjacent tooth germ pressure and rapid formation of the internal enamel epithelium into the adjacent dental papilla during tooth development and presence of a small defect in the enamel epithelium that allows the adjacent epithelium to grow and develop continuously and absence of certain intercellular signal molecules causing dental anomalies and infection during tooth development \\[[@B1]-[@B4]\\]. Based on the review paper by Alani \\[[@B1]\\], genetic factor is the most likely cause of this anomaly. The prevalence of dens invaginatus in the general population has been reported from 0.04% to 10% \\[[@B5]\\]. Maxillary permanent lateral incisors are the most commonly affected teeth. However, any tooth, including supernumerary and primary teeth, could be affected. However, mandibular teeth are rarely affected \\[[@B6]\\]. Oehlers has classified dens invaginatus according to the extent of anomaly (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Type I is defined as an enamel-lined invagination limited to the coronal part of the tooth. Type II is presented as a lesion extending beyond cemento-enamel junction and ending in a blind sac. Type III is the most complicated type in which invagination has penetrated the root laterally and an apical foramen separate from the main tooth apex is formed which complicates the process of endodontic treatment\\[[@B1], [@B7], [@B8]\\]. Thus far, the treatment used in case reports has mostly been through an orthograde approach and the removal of the invagination in Oehlers\\' class II cases. In this case report, a new treatment approach is introduced that was planned following cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination of the tooth prior to treatment to determine the necessity of removing dens invaginatus during root canal treatment. Calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement apical plug and gutta-percha in warm vertical compaction technique were used in the treatment plan and the patient was followed up for 18, 24, and 36 months post treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report\n===========\n\n【3】A 19-year-old female patient was referred by a dentist to the Endodontic Department of the School of Dentistry, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran, with the chief complaint of infection and suppuration around the right anterior mandibular gingivae. The patient had noncontributory medical history. Intraoral clinical examinations revealed the involvement of tooth \\#28 and presence of an intraoral sinus tract. The tooth did not respond to electric pulp tester (Element Diagnostic Unit; SybronEndo, Glendora, CA, USA). The cold test was performed using a cold spray (Roeko Endo Frost; Roeko, Hangenav, Germany) which was sprayed on a cotton pellet and rapidly placed on the middle third of the buccal surface and hot stimulation was performed with warm gutta-percha (Ariadent, Tehran, Iran). However, the result of none of the tests was positive. The tooth was sensitive to the percussion test. The result of periodontal probing test with a Williams probe (Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co. LLC, UK) and mobility of the teeth were within normal ranges. A radiography was obtained and a radiolucent lesion was detected at the apical region of the tooth (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2A]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The sinus tract was traced with \\#25 gutta-percha and radiography was taken again (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2B]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In the tracing image, the gutta-percha entered the apical zone of tooth \\#28 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2C]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The tooth was diagnosed with pulpal necrosis and chronic apical abscess. CBCT and Planmeca Romexis dental Software (2.3.1.R, PlanmecaOY, Helsinki, Finland) were used to assess the extent of the lesion (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3A to P]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The CBCT three-dimensional reconstruction revealed buccal cortex perforation adjacent to the affected tooth and type II dens invaginatus.\n\n【4】![Classification of dens invaginatus by Oehlers](iej-12-390-g001){#F1}\n\n【5】![A) Preoperative periapical radiograph of the first mandibular premolar with chronic periapical pathosis; B) Periapical radiography of tracing of the sinus tract; C) Tracing of the sinus tract with \\#25 gutta-percha](iej-12-390-g002){#F2}\n\n【6】![A to O) Confirmation of the extent of dens invaginatus and the size of periapical pathosis using cone-beam computed tomography images; P) Cone-beam computed tomography images ‎3D reconstruction (Buccal cortex perforation was observed adjacent to the affected tooth](iej-12-390-g003){#F3}\n\n【7】![A) The ‎calcium enriched mixture ‎cement apical plug placement at the root canal and temporary restoration; B)‎ Calcium-enriched mixture ‎cement apical plug and coronal gutta-percha placement using vertical compaction technique; C) Follow-up radiograph of the tooth revealing a healing lucent lesion with diminished size 18 months after initial visit; D) Follow-up radiograph of the tooth revealing a healing lucent lesion with diminished size 24 months after initial visit; E) Periapical radiograph 36 months after the treatment](iej-12-390-g004){#F4}\n\n【8】For the treatment procedure, non-surgical endodontic treatment with CEM cement (Bionque Dent; YektazistDandan Co. Tehran, Iran) without the removal of the dens invaginatus was chosen because CBCT evaluation showed no communication from the dens invaginatus with PDL. In addition, removing dens invaginatus may dramatically influence tooth structure.\n\n【9】During the first appointment, using a side-loading cartridge aspirating syringe (Dena Instruments, Forgeman Instruments Co. Sialkot, Pakistan) and a 27-G 31-mm needle (Nik Rahnama Kar Co. Tehran, Iran), mental nerve block was conducted with 2% lidocaine containing 1:80000 epinephrine (Persocaine; DaruPakhsh, Tehran, Iran). The affected tooth was isolated with a rubber dam and access cavity preparation was performed with a diamond fissure bur (Diatech Dental, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). For root canal measurement, first, using \\#2 Gates Glidden drills (Mani, Tochigi, Japan), the coronal third of all root canals were expanded. Then, using a Root ZX apex locator (J. Morita Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and \\#15 K-file (Mani, Tochigi, Japan), the root canal length was measured. The working length was confirmed through radiographic imaging. After confirmation of the working length, root canal instrumentation was completed using a stainless steel K-file of up to size \\#80 (Mani, Tochigi, Japan) through crown down instrumentation technique. The root canal space was irrigated with NaOCl (5.25%). Calcium hydroxide powder (Golchai, Tehran, Iran) was mixed with saline and was placed as intracanal medicament for a week and the tooth was temporarily restored with Cavisol (Golchai, Tehran, Iran).\n\n【10】On the second visit, clinical examination revealed healing of the sinus tract. After local anesthesia and isolation with rubber dam, temporary restoration was removed. The calcium hydroxide dressing was removed with saline and alternating irrigation with 5.25% NaOCl and 17% ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) (Ariadent, Tehran, Iran) solutions. Subsequently, the canal was dried with paper points (Ariadent, Tehran, Iran). CEM cement powder and liquid were mixed according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. The mixture was inserted in to the dried canals using a sterile amalgam carrier. Then, it was gently adapted to the apical portion of the root canals using pre-fitted root canal pluggers (M-series, Dentsply Sirona Endodontics, Tulsa, OK, USA) to place an apical plug with the thickness of 3-4mm. Next, a moist cotton pellet was placed over the plug and again the tooth was restored temporarily. Correct placement and the CEM cement plug thickness was assessed radiographically (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4A]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【11】At the third and final visit, first, local anesthesia was administered and the tooth was isolated with a rubber dam. Next, temporary restoration was removed, and after irrigation, CEM cement setting was evaluated. Then, the root canal was filled with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer (Dentsply Sirona Endodontics, Tulsa, OK, USA) using warm vertical compaction technique. The tooth was restored with resin composite (Z100, 3M ESPE, Premier, Norristown, PA, USA) and bonding (Single Bond, 3M ESPE, Premier, Norristown, PA, USA) as the final restoration (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4B]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In order to prevent future coronal leakagevia dens invaginatus, a coronal cavity was prepared at the pit of the invaginatus and was restored with the composite resin.\n\n【12】The patient was followed up for 18, 24, and 36 months thereafter and the healing of the lesion was radiographically evaluated (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4C, D and E]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The lesion healed during the follow-up period.\n\n【13】Discussion\n==========\n\n【14】In this case report, the successful conservative treatment of a premolar tooth with dens invaginatus without removing the anomaly has been presented. In most cases, dens invaginatus is accidentally discovered in radiographs, since, it usually develops in to pulpal necrosis without any significant symptoms. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of dens invaginatus is necessary in order to prevent further pulp necrosis \\[[@B9]\\]. Different methods are used to treat dens invaginatus, such as fissure sealant and conservative restorations at early stages, root canal therapy, and surgical endodontic treatment. Recommended endodontic interventions for dens invaginatus are root canal treatment, apical surgery, intentional replantation, and extraction \\[[@B10], [@B11]\\]. The latter is only recommended when other treatment modalities have failed or supernumerary teeth are involved \\[[@B12]\\]. Most endodontists prefer nonsurgical approaches (orthograde) toward the treatment of dens invaginatus. In the present case, the orthograde treatment which was placement of CEM cement apical plug was chosen for treating the infected tooth.\n\n【15】Teeth with dens invaginatus are susceptible to caries and endodontic treatment is usually necessary for these teeth \\[[@B13]\\]. Teeth with dens invaginatus have many pits with defective or even absent enamel which lead to the colonization of microorganisms and further development of caries and pulp involvement which eventually necessitates endodontic treatment \\[[@B14]\\]. In this case report, in order to prevent future microorganism invasion through the anomaly, the coronal pit was restored with composite resin.\n\n【16】CBCT can be a useful imaging technique. However, there are some concerns regarding the x-ray dosage. Both the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) and European Society of Endodontology (ESE) have recommended the use of CBCT for detection of complex root canal anatomy \\[[@B15], [@B16]\\]. Agrawal et al.\\[[@B17]\\] have noted that diagnostic and treatment planning can be improved through the use of CBCT imaging in suspected cases of dens invaginatus. They have also noted that it provides greater understanding of the complex radicular configurations of teeth with dens invaginatus \\[[@B17]\\]. However, before performing CBCT, the consideration of risk versus benefit should be taken into account \\[[@B17]\\]. In this case study, CBCT revealed the exact root canal anatomy, extent of the invagination, and size of the periradicular lesion. With the use of CBCT imaging, it was possible to determine suitable treatment plans and prevent complications.\n\n【17】The present case was a type II invagination based on Oehlers' classification with no evident apical perforation of the sac, and it was not related to the apical pathosis. In the current case, CBCT imaging was used and it improved diagnostic and treatment planning capabilities for the anomaly as well as root canal configurations. Based on the image, non-surgical treatment without the removal or filling of the dens invaginatus was performed. In previously published case reports, the authors have discussed conservative protocols of dens invaginatus management using a minimally invasive nonsurgical treatment option; however, the invagination was removed or filled with root canal filling materials \\[[@B17]-[@B20]\\].\n\n【18】While performing root canal treatment, the removal of all debris from the root canal system and obturation of the root canal space with a biocompatible material is essential. Er et al.\\[[@B12]\\] successfully treated a mandibular premolar with type II dens invaginatus using gutta-percha and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) at the apical third of the tooth. Maintaining the invagination intact might result in some challenges in root canal instrumentation and shaping because of inaccessible areas on root canal walls. Therefore, 5.25% NaOCl solution was used for disinfection and intracanal irrigation because of its characteristics such as tissue dissolution capacity \\[[@B21]\\], smear layer removal potential during endodontic treatment \\[[@B22]\\] and effectiveness in killing Enterococcus faecalis after a 2-min contact time \\[[@B23]\\]. Calcium hydroxide was also used as intracanal dressing, because it is the most commonly used intracanal treatment in cases diagnosed with necrotic pulps and there is clinical evidence of its use in teeth with apical pathosis prior to definitive root canal filling \\[[@B24]\\].\n\n【19】Pace et al.\\[[@B25]\\] and Witherspoon et al.\\[[@B26]\\] reported high success rates in clinical and radiographic evaluation of MTA apical plug techniques in one or two visits. MTA is a kind of bioactive endodontic cement which is suitable for the artificial apical barrier technique because of its superior sealing ability and biocompatibility \\[[@B27], [@B28]\\]. However, some previous studies have shown that the sealing ability of white MTA apical plugs is adversely affected by calcium hydroxide use as intracanal medicament \\[[@B29]\\]. Nevertheless, in an in vitro study, it was reported that the insertion of calcium hydroxide between treatment sessions would not negatively affect the marginal adaptation of MTA or CEM cement as apical plug \\[[@B30]\\]. This finding was inconsistent with that of the present study on CEM cement.\n\n【20】In another study, it was reported that irrigation with NaOCl and EDTA, alternatively, resulted in complete calcium hydroxide removal from dentinal walls \\[[@B31]\\]. Thus, this method of irrigation was used on the second appointment to completely remove calcium hydroxide. Due to its previous successful applications as an artificial apical barrier, bioactive endodontic cement (CEM cement) was used in the current study as apical plug \\[[@B32], [@B33]\\]. The coronal part of the canal was filled with gutta-percha and restored with resin composite.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【22】The present case reported a non-surgical root canal treatment with CEM cement as an apical plug without the removal of dens invaginatus. CBCT imaging was a useful aid for the practitioner assisting in understanding morphology and in decision making and treatment planning.\n\n【23】The authors of this article wish to thank the patient.\n\n【24】Conflict of Interest:\n=====================\n\n【25】'None declared'.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Our results indicate that the combination of sheets of MSC and PRF increases bone regeneration in critical-size calvarial defects in rabbits, and provides a new way to improve skeletal healing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A retrospective chart review of women referred for ESBC to The Moncton Hospital between 2005 and 2010 evaluated patient and disease characteristics, adjuvant chemotherapy receipt, G-CSF usage, FN incidence, hospital admission rates, and length of stay. Association of variables with FN was examined, and exploratory multivariable logistic regression modeling examined the impact of baseline variables on risk of FN. Of 520 patients enrolled in the database, 251 (48.3 %) received adjuvant chemotherapy for ESBC. Most (66.9 %) received FEC-D. Overall, 55 (21.9 %) patients developed FN. Forty-four (26.2 %) patients on FEC-D developed FN. Forty of 129 (31.0 %) FEC-D patients who did not receive primary G-CSF prophylaxis developed FN, versus 4 of 39 (10.3 %) receiving G-CSF. Receipt of FEC-D or TC (docetaxel 75 mg/m通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> every 3 weeks for four or six cycles) was associated with odds ratios of 6.5 or 6.77, respectively, for the development of FN. Receipt of trastuzumab with chemotherapy was associated with an odds ratio of 3.48 for developing FN versus no trastuzumab. Primary G-CSF prophylaxis led to a 63 % reduction in the odds ratio of developing FN. Incidence of FN with FEC-D treatment is considerably higher in clinical practice than reported in phase III trials. Consistent with ASCO guidelines, prophylactic G-CSF should be considered for all ESBC patients receiving adjuvant FEC-D.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Rabbit antibodies raised against Ricinus communis agglutinin were used to identify nascent agglutinin chains. In contrast to the authentic agglutinin polypeptides with molecular weights of 31000 (A chains) and 37000 (glycosylated B chains), immunoreactive translational products of Mr 33500 and 59000 were observed. The inclusion of canine pancreatic microsomes in the translational system resulted in the cotranslational segregation of these immunoreactive products into the lumen of the vesicles and their modification, to molecular weights of 32000 and 66000--69000 respectively. These cotranslational size modifications resulted from the cleavage of leader sequences and, in the case of the larger product, concomittant core glycosylation, 32000-Mr and 66000--69000-Mr proteins were also observed amongst the immunoreactive products initially formed during the labelling of intact endosperm tissue in vivo, together with 37000-Mr and 39000-Mr proteins. Pulse-chase experiments showed that 66000--69000-Mr proteins slowly disappeared while the smaller proteins were further cleaved to chains of Mr 31000 (authentic A chain), 34000 and 37000 (authentic glycosylated B chains). It was concluded that R. communis agglutinin polypeptides were synthesized in precursor form, possibly as a 'giant' precursor in the case of the B chain, on membrane-bound polysomes. Cotranslational translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane was accompanied by proteolysis to remove leader sequences and, where appropriate, core glycosylation. Even after cotranslational processing agglutinin polypeptides were still in precursor form.

Introduced species can affect native species through competition, predation, herbivory, habitat alteration, disease or hybridization [@pone.0040622-Pimentel1], [@pone.0040622-Davis1], [@pone.0040622-Gurevitch1]. These impacts can lead to changes in population dynamics of native species, altered community structure, and altered ecosystem services [@pone.0040622-Pimentel1], [@pone.0040622-Manchester1], [@pone.0040622-Vitousek1], [@pone.0040622-Wilcove1], [@pone.0040622-Crooks1].\n\n【2】The magnitude of impacts of an introduced species can be variable. Some have a devastating impact while others are relatively benign [@pone.0040622-Davis2], [@pone.0040622-Shine1]. For example, the invasive marine alga Caulerpa taxifolia spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean Sea, with devastating impacts on other algal species, seagrasses and sessile invertebrates [@pone.0040622-Meinesz1]. Conversely, Davis at al. [@pone.0040622-Davis2] describes the long-term eradication program of the tamarisk shrub (Tamarix spp.). This species was introduced to the United States in the 1930s and its management currently costs an estimated \\$US 80 million annually. The impact of tamarisk is poorly understood and evidence suggests it assists riverbank stabilisation and provides nesting sites for threatened native birds [@pone.0040622-Davis2].\n\n【3】Understanding the impact of an introduced species is essential for effective management [@pone.0040622-Simberloff1]. Due to limited resources, management prioritization should be given to introduced species that have the greatest undesirable impact [@pone.0040622-Davis2], [@pone.0040622-Simberloff1]. The traditional belief that all introduced species have a negative impact can lead to wasteful allocation of resources  [@pone.0040622-Davis2]. Understanding a species impact facilitates targeted management to ameliorate impacts [@pone.0040622-Davis2], [@pone.0040622-Simberloff1], [@pone.0040622-Townsend1], [@pone.0040622-Bradshaw1], [@pone.0040622-Brown1], [@pone.0040622-Parker1].\n\n【4】Empirical evidence of the impact of an introduced species can be very difficult to obtain for three key reasons:\n\n【5】1.  A lack of long-term data prior to, and then after, invasion [@pone.0040622-Cooper1];\n\n【6】2.  Environmental change occurring alongside species introductions, making it hard to distinguish species impacts from the impacts of environmental change (eg habitat clearing, climate change) [@pone.0040622-Cooper1], [@pone.0040622-MacDougall1], [@pone.0040622-Didham1]; and\n\n【7】3.  A poor understanding of the mechanisms of impact (eg competition vs. predation) [@pone.0040622-Brown1], [@pone.0040622-Kolar1], [@pone.0040622-Ricciardi1].\n\n【8】Particular difficulties arise when trying to obtain empirical evidence of impact due to competition [@pone.0040622-Cooper1]. This is because changes in species abundance due to competition may be slow [@pone.0040622-Davis1], [@pone.0040622-Sax1], and frequently occur in combination with other environmental impacts (eg native habitat clearing) [@pone.0040622-MacDougall1], [@pone.0040622-Didham1]. The impacts of competition often occur more slowly than, for example, predation where a predator immediately kills their prey [@pone.0040622-Davis1]. Observations of negative encounters between species are useful for determining the mechanisms of impact [@pone.0040622-Brown1], [@pone.0040622-Kolar1], [@pone.0040622-Ricciardi1]. However, long-term changes in the abundance of affected species provide much stronger evidence of impact and competition [@pone.0040622-Newton1].\n\n【9】A good example of the difficulties associated with obtaining empirical evidence of impact due to competition is the Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis). Concern has been raised that the Common Myna affects native birds in three ways: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> competition for food; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> competition for cavity-nesting sites; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> competition for territories [@pone.0040622-Tindall1], [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Pell1], [@pone.0040622-Harper1]. Research from around the world has investigated competition between the Common Myna and native bird species [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Dhami1]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has provided empirical evidence of the species impact on the long-term abundance of native bird species .\n\n【10】The Common Myna is listed in the top 100 of the world's worst invaders, despite a lack of empirical evidence of negative impacts on native species [@pone.0040622-Lowe1]. Is the lack of evidence for Common Myna impact due to the difficulty in obtaining evidence of impact (especially due to competition)? Or, has the Common Myna fallen victim to the traditional belief that all introduced species have a negative impact [@pone.0040622-Davis2]?\n\n【11】In this paper, we assess the impact of Common Myna establishment on long-term bird abundance. We investigated the abundance of 20 bird species in Canberra in south-east Australia, pre and post Common Myna establishment. These bird species included seven cavity-nesting, ten small (\\<25 cm head to tail) and five large (\\>30 cm head to tail) species of bird (Table1,2,3).\n\n【12】10.1371/journal.pone.0040622.t001\n\n【13】###### Cavity-nesting species autoregressive

table.\n\n【31】Earlier studies indicated that the Common Myna may affect cavity-nesting species through competition for nest sites, reducing the breeding success of these species [@pone.0040622-Pell1], [@pone.0040622-Harper1]. Therefore, at the outset of our investigation, we postulated that Common Myna establishment would negatively affect the abundance of cavity-nesting species. Earlier studies also indicated that the Common Myna is a territorial species actively defending an area of one to three hectares . Territorial exclusion by another species of bird, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala), an Australian native species, is known to primarily affect other small insectivorous bird species [@pone.0040622-Grey1] and research on the Common Myna suggests a similar pattern [@pone.0040622-Tindall1]. Therefore, we postulated that Common Myna establishment would negatively affect the abundance of small bird species, but not large bird species. We discuss the implications of our findings and the complexities associated with the management prioritisation of one species over another.\n\n【32】Materials and Methods {#s2}\n=====================\n\n【33】Study Species {#s2a}\n-------------\n\n【34】The Common Myna is from the Sturnidae family and is a sedentary bird measuring 23--25 cm in length [@pone.0040622-Feare1]. The species is a highly adaptable generalist omnivore, foraging within 1--3 km of a communal roost [@pone.0040622-Tracey1], [@pone.0040622-Counsilman1]. The Common Myna forms lifelong monogamous breeding pairs that aggressively defend the same territory each nesting season [@pone.0040622-Counsilman2], [@pone.0040622-Wilson1]. The species is primarily a cavity-nesting species throughout its introduced range, laying between two to seven eggs per clutch [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Dhami1]. The Common Myna thrives in human-modified environments, reaching high densities of more than 200 birds per km^2^ in cities and towns [@pone.0040622-Dhami1]. The species is also found along roadsides, in coastal mangroves, and in open forest habitats [@pone.0040622-Feare1]. The Common Myna tends to avoid dense forest but landscape fragmentation can lead to increases in its abundance [@pone.0040622-Tracey1].\n\n【35】The Common Myna originates from India and central and southern Asia [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Martin1]. It has been introduced all over the world and has become established on all continents except Antarctica [@pone.0040622-Feare1]. The species was introduced primarily to control insect pests in agriculture [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Tracey1], [@pone.0040622-Long1].\n\n【36】The Common Myna [@pone.0040622-Martin1] was first brought to Australia in 1862 to control insects in market gardens in the city of Melbourne [@pone.0040622-Hone1]. The species quickly established in Melbourne and that population became a source population for other introductions within Australia [@pone.0040622-Hone1]. The Common Myna is now well established in many cities and towns along the east coast of Australia [@pone.0040622-Pizzey1].\n\n【37】The first published record of the Common Myna in our study area of Canberra (a city of 370 000 people) was of a pair of birds in 1968 [@pone.0040622-GregorySmith1]. Since then, Common Myna numbers in Canberra have steadily increased [@pone.0040622-Veerman1].\n\n【38】Long-term Data {#s2b}\n--------------\n\n【39】We used long-term survey data gathered by the Canberra Ornithologists Group (COG) to document bird abundance over 29 years in Canberra. COG established the Canberra Garden Bird Survey (GBS) in 1981 (COG, 2010). The GBS volunteers survey birds in and around the city of Canberra. Observers survey an area of 3.1 ha. Surveys are conducted fortnightly for a 20-minute period. A total of 74 492 surveys was undertaken in the survey area over 29 years. Further detail on survey procedures are provided by [@pone.0040622-Veerman1].\n\n【40】Target Species Abundance Analysis {#s2c}\n---------------------------------\n\n【41】We determined the abundance of 20 bird species in Canberra over 29 years using data from the COG GBS, comprising seven cavity-nesting (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), eight small species (\\<25 cm head to tail) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}) and five large species (\\>30 cm head to tail)(通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#pone-0040622-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). We used ArcGIS 10® [@pone.0040622-ESRI1] to define four geographic regions in Canberra (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This enabled grouping of survey sites to ensure continuity of survey effort over each region and year. We based regions primarily on geographic location and development history of the city. There was a total of 352 survey sites, with 71 in Region 1, 107 in Region 2, 133 in Region 3 and 41 in Region 4. The mean number of surveys undertaken each year was 496±33 in Region 1, 873±28 in Region 2, 898±32 in Region 3 and 259±15 in Region 4.\n\n【42】![Location of the four Regions in Canberra, South East Australia.](pone.0040622.g001){#pone-0040622-g001}\n\n【43】We split years into two seasons: breeding (September to February) and non-breeding seasons (March to August). For each species, we used GenStat 14® [@pone.0040622-VSN1] to fit hierarchical generalized linear models [@pone.0040622-Lee1] to raw counts of individuals using a quasi-Poisson model with a logarithmic link function. We treated region, year, season, and their interactions as fixed effects. We treated sites as a random effect with a log-gamma distribution. For each combination of region, year and season, we estimated the average number of birds per site, thus reducing the data from the results of 74 492 individual surveys to 232 estimates. Each site covered an area of 3.142 ha, and we converted the estimates to abundance per km^2^ by multiplying by (100/3.142). Using this method, we calculated the bi-annual abundance of each target species per km^2^ per region and graphed the results (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#pone-0040622-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#pone-0040622-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【44】![The bi-annual abundance (birds per km^2^) of cavity-nesting species across four Regions in the rural city of Canberra, South East Australia (Region 1: solid grey line, Region 2: dotted grey line, Region 3: solid black line, Region 4: dotted black line).](pone.0040622.g002){#pone-0040622-g002}\n\n【45】![The bi-annual abundance (birds per km^2^) of small bird species (\\<25 cm head to tail) across four regions in the rural city of Canberra, South East Australia (Region 1: solid grey line, Region 2: dotted grey line, Region 3: solid black line, Region 4: dotted black line).](pone.0040622.g003){#pone-0040622-g003}\n\n【46】![The bi-annual abundance (birds per km^2^) of large bird species (\\>30 cm head to tail) across four regions in the rural city of Canberra, South East Australia (Region 1: solid grey line, Region 2: dotted grey line, Region 3: solid black line, Region 4: dotted black line).](pone.0040622.g004){#pone-0040622-g004}\n\n【47】Target Species Autoregressive Analysis {#s2d}\n--------------------------------------\n\n【48】We fitted autoregressive models in GenStat 14® [@pone.0040622-VSN1] to investigate the impact of the Common Myna on our 20 target species (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). We fitted autoregressive models for each of our 20 target species using their bi-annual abundance as the response variable in the model. The candidate fixed variables included in the modeling were season, urban development (dwellings per km^2^, population per km^2^) and vegetation type (native grassland, dry forest, modified urban grassland, woodland, tree cover). We also included the fixed variables of year, and years after Common Myna establishment, in the model. The random model was set to region and time and we used autoregressive models of order one (AR1) and two (AR2), and Wald tests for dropping individual terms from the full fixed model. We sequentially removed the least significant explanatory variable from the model, continuing this process until only significant (\\<0.05) explanatory variables remained (with the exception of the variables year and years after Common Myna establishment, which were included in all models) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#pone-0040622-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). We used a table of effects to predict the impact of each significant variable (±SE).\n\n【49】We defined Common Myna establishment for each region to have occurred when there was an estimated mean of two (±SE) individuals of the Common Myna per km^2^. The years after Common Myna establishment had a zero value in the years proceeding (and including the year of) Common Myna establishment. The years after Common Myna establishment were numbered sequentially. We used establishment of the Common Myna rather than Common Myna density to investigate impact as this enabled us to investigate species abundance prior to, and following, the presence of the Common Myna in Canberra. The Common Myna has the potential to affect the abundance of other species even when it occurs at low densities. The Common Myna exhibits territorial behavior, feeds within an area of up to two km from a communal roost [@pone.0040622-Feare1], [@pone.0040622-Dhami1], [@pone.0040622-Counsilman1], [@pone.0040622-Counsilman2], [@pone.0040622-Wilson1], and builds multiple nests that may deter other cavity-nesting species [@pone.0040622-Pell1], [@pone.0040622-Harper1].\n\n【50】We sourced data on the number of dwellings and human population density from the Australian Bureau of Statistics [@pone.0040622-ABS1]. Data were available for six intervals throughout the survey period for each suburb in Canberra 通用删除7(英):<u>(1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006)</u>. We determined the average dwelling density and human population density by calculating the mean of all suburbs within each region. We calculated vegetation variables (native grassland, dry forest, modified urban grassland, woodland) using ArcGIS layer from the ACT Department of Lands [@pone.0040622-ACT1]. Numerous features were available on the ArcGIS layer from the ACT Department of Lands (e.g 'urban area'). However, where possible, we used data that were updated throughout the survey period. For example, we used data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on dwelling density (updated six times over the 29 year period) instead of 'urban area' from the ArcGIS layer from the ACT Department of Lands. We also determined percent tree cover from Landsat satellite imagery updated 11 times throughout the survey period 通用删除7(英):<u>(1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)</u> [@pone.0040622-NationalCarbonAccounting1].\n\n【51】For each of our 20 target species, we compared the AR1 with AR2 models to ensure estimates for years after Common Myna establishment reported similar values (eg a positive or negative impact, of a similar magnitude). The AR1 model compares a species abundance with the previous seasons abundance. More specifically, it looks at the relationship between a species breeding season abundance and the preceding non-breeding season abundance. The AR2 model compares a species abundance with the previous season of the same type. For example it compares the abundance of a species in the breeding season to the abundance of the species in the breading season one year prior. We report AR1 models throughout our results for all species, after comparison between the two models revealed that estimates for Common Myna impact were consistent between models and the AR2 coefficients were rarely significant.\n\n【52】We were able to distinguish between the impacts of the Common Myna and other causal factors through the inclusion of urban development and vegetation variables. More specifically, we could avoid incorrectly identifying the Common Myna as having an impact if a common-causal variable was responsible for the decline. For example, urban development may negatively affect some species [@pone.0040622-Crossman1], and attributing that negative impact to the Common Myna would be erroneous.\n\n【53】Results {#s3}\n=======\n\n【54】Our analysis of GBS records indicated that the Common Myna became established in Region 1 in 1991, Region 2 in 1993 and Region 4 in 1989. The Common Myna was already established in Region 3 prior to the commencement of GBS surveys. After establishment, the abundance of the Common Myna increased each year by an estimated 6.4 (±2.5) birds per km^2^ each year (F~1,40~ = 6.6, P = 0.014). On average, the abundance of the Common Myna increased throughout the survey period by an estimated 0.8 (±2.4) birds per km^2^ each year although this was not statistically significant (F~1,57~ = 0.1, P = 0.723). We found significant positive relationships between the abundance of the Common Myna and dry forest (F~1,12~ = 10.8, P = 0.007), modified grassland (F~1,26~ = 7.6, P = 0.010), and tree cover (F~1,75~ = 6.7, P = 0.012).\n\n【55】Impacts on Cavity-nesting Species {#s3a}\n---------------------------------\n\n【56】We found a significant negative relationship between the establishment of the Common Myna and the abundance of the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (F~1,77~ = 6.9, P = 0.010), the Crimson Rosella (F~1,33~ = 135, P\\<0.001) and the Laughing Kookaburra (F~1,52~ = 5.0, P = 0.030). Sulphur-crested Cockatoo abundance increased throughout the survey period by an estimated 10.3 (±0.8) birds per km^2^ each year. However, after Common Myna establishment, growth in abundance reduced by an estimated 2.0 (±0.7) birds per km^2^ each year. Crimson Rosella abundance increased throughout the survey period by an estimated 5.9 (±0.3) birds per km^2^ each year. However, after Common Myna establishment, growth in abundance declined by an estimated 3.5 (±0.3) birds per km^2^ each year. Laughing Kookaburra abundance was relatively stable throughout the survey period. However, after Common Myna establishment, abundance reduced by an estimated 0.4 (±0.2) birds per km^2^ each year.\n\n【57】We found no significant negative relationships between Common Myna establishment and the abundance of the Galah, Australian King-Parrot, Eastern Rosella or Common Starling. The abundance of the Galah increased over the 29-year study with growth in abundance declining after Common Myna establishment, but this change was not statistically significant (F~1,52~ = 1.2, P = 0.284) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). The abundance of the Australian King-Parrot, Eastern Rosella and Common Starling appeared to increase after Common Myna establishment (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【58】Impacts on Small Bird Species {#s3b}\n-----------------------------\n\n【59】We found a significant negative relationship between Common Myna establishment and the abundance of seven of the eight small bird species we examined (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). The abundance of the Superb Fairy-wren, Striated Pardalote, Willie Wagtail, Grey Fantail, Magpie Lark, Silvereye and Common Blackbird increased throughout the survey period (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#pone-0040622-g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, after Common Myna establishment, growth in abundance of these bird species declined significantly (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). House Sparrow abundance declined throughout the survey period by an estimated 6.6 (±1.7) birds per km^2^ each year. After Common Myna establishment, abundance continued to decline by an estimated 1.6 (±1.7) birds per km^2^ each year, although this was not statistically significant (F~1,20~ = 0.9, P = 0.348)(通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【60】Impacts on Large Species {#s3c}\n------------------------\n\n【61】We found no negative relationships between Common Myna establishment and the abundance of all of the five large bird species we analysed: Red Wattlebird, Noisy Friarbird, Australian Magpie, Pied Currawong and Australian Raven (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#pone-0040622-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). Red Wattlebird, Australian Magpie and Australian Raven abundance increased over 29 years (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#pone-0040622-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}). Noisy Friarbird abundance declined over the study period by an estimated 0.9 (±0.2) birds per km^2^ each year (F~1,50~ = 85.7, P\\<0.001). Pied Currawong abundance did not differ significantly over the study period (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#pone-0040622-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【62】Discussion {#s4}\n==========\n\n【63】Previous attempts to investigate Common Myna impact have relied on short-term data (from one to three years) [@pone.0040622-Tindall1], [@pone.0040622-Pell1], [@pone.0040622-Lowe2] with limited success. Our long-term data and integrated approach provided a unique opportunity to present the strongest evidence to date for the impact of the Common Myna on native bird species. Incorporating variables for environmental change in our model enabled us to obtain a better understanding of the impact of Common Myna establishment on bird abundance. Our model was designed to incorporate changes in species abundance due to habitat modification, thus enabling an understanding of the impact of the Common Myna in a changing environment.\n\n【64】Our analysis suggests that the Common Myna had a negative impact on the long-term abundance of some cavity-nesting bird species and some small bird species. These species include Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Crimson Rosella, Laughing Kookaburra, Superb Fairy-wren, Striated Pardalote, Willie Wagtail, Grey Fantail, Magpie-lark, Silvereye and Common Blackbird. To the best of our knowledge, this finding for the Common Myna has never previously been demonstrated at the population level.\n\n【65】Cavity-nesting Species {#s4a}\n----------------------\n\n【66】At the outset of this study, we postulated that Common Myna establishment would negatively affect the abundance of cavity-nesting species. This was supported by our data for the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Crimson Rosella and Laughing Kookaburra (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). It was not supported by our data for the Galah, Australian King-Parrot, Eastern Rosella or Common Starling (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone-0040622-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). The negative impact of Common Myna establishment on Crimson Rosella abundance is consistent with a previous study that quantified nest-cavity competition between these two species [@pone.0040622-Pell1]. The negative impact of Common Myna establishment on the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo and the Laughing Kookaburra is especially interesting as they are larger than the Common Myna (44--51 cm and 41--47 cm respectively). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Common Myna is capable of displacing large bird species and even mammals from cavity-nesting sites [@pone.0040622-Markula1].\n\n【67】We found no significant negative relationships between Common Myna establishment and Common Starling abundance. This finding was unexpected, as several studies have observed intense nest-cavity competition between these two species, concluding that the Common Myna is responsible for a decline in Common Starling numbers [@pone.0040622-Tindall1], [@pone.0040622-Wilson1]. Common Starling abundance declined throughout the survey period (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#pone-0040622-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Declining Common Starling numbers also have been reported in South-eastern Australia [@pone.0040622-Lindenmayer1]. The declining abundance of the Common Starling may have reduced our ability to detect an impact from the Common Myna.\n\n【68】Small Bird Species (\\<25 cm) {#s4b}\n----------------------------\n\n【69】Our postulate that Common Myna establishment would negatively affect the abundance of small bird species was supported by our data for the Superb Fairy-wren, Striated Pardalote, Willie Wagtail, Grey Fantail, Magpie-lark, Silvereye and Common Blackbird. This result was broadly consistent with earlier studies reporting that the Common Myna aggressively forces birds out of an area [@pone.0040622-Tindall1], [@pone.0040622-Dhami1], [@pone.0040622-Wilson1].\n\n【70】Large Bird Species (\\>30 cm) {#s4c}\n----------------------------\n\n【71】Our postulate that Common Myna establishment would not negatively affect the abundance of large bird species was supported for all of the species we analysed including the Red Wattlebird, Noisy Friarbird, Australian Magpie, Pied Currawong and Australian Raven.\n\n【72】Is it Benign or is it a Pariah? Implications for Management {#s4d}\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【73】Our results highlighted the extent to which the Common Myna influences both cavity-nesting and small bird species. We conclude that the effect of the Common Myna on native bird species in the Canberra area is not benign. However, there are still questions regarding the seriousness of this impact and the type of management (if any) that is warranted. In Sydney, the Common Myna is believed to have little impact on native bird species, with anthropogenic habitat modification believed to be the main driver of native species decline [@pone.0040622-Lowe2], [@pone.0040622-Parsons1]. Due to limited resources for management and increasing numbers and types of introduced species, the appropriate management response for the Common Myna remains a contentious issue.\n\n【74】The bird species we investigated in this study were neither rare nor threatened (three are introduced). These mechanisms of impact (competition for nest-cavities and territory) also may influence threatened species. However, we were unable to demonstrate the impact of the Common Myna on threatened species such as the Superb Parrot (Polytelis swainsonii) because limited observations of such species.\n\n【75】Regardless of its impact, the Common Myna is considered by the public to be a pariah. In Australia in 2005, the species was voted as the 'most significant pest', 'the pest problem seen to be increasing most' and the top 'pest problem that needs more control' [@pone.0040622-ABC1]. Community concern about the Common Myna was greater than devastating species such as the Cane Toad (Rhinella marina), Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Feral Cat (Felis catus) and European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Perhaps this is partly due to the Common Myna being abundant and visible in urban areas. Although this community passion for Common Myna management is positive, we must not let it cloud rational scientific judgment and the strategic allocation of pest management resources [@pone.0040622-Davis2], [@pone.0040622-Simberloff1], [@pone.0040622-Townsend1], [@pone.0040622-Bradshaw1], [@pone.0040622-Brown1], [@pone.0040622-Parker1].\n\n【76】In Australia, native birds are also negatively affected by two native bird species, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala) and Bell Miner (Manorina melanophrys) [@pone.0040622-Grey1]. Research suggests that land use practices, such as habitat clearing can lead to increases in Noisy Miner and Bell Miner abundance, which then territorially exclude native bird species [@pone.0040622-Grey1], [@pone.0040622-Clarke1], [@pone.0040622-Kemmerer1], [@pone.0040622-Maron1], [@pone.0040622-MontagueDrake1], [@pone.0040622-Taylor1]. Some researchers suggest Noisy Miner populations should be culled in certain areas of Australia [@pone.0040622-Grey2]. Prioritisation of management must not be influenced by the origins of the species [@pone.0040622-Davis2].\n\n【77】Prioritization of Introduced Species Management {#s4e}\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【78】Understanding a species impact is vital for effective management and the prioritization of limited resources [@pone.0040622-Davis2], [@pone.0040622-Simberloff1]. Prioritization of introduced species management has been recognised by numerous studies that attempt to rank the impacts of introduced species [@pone.0040622-Nentwig1], [@pone.0040622-Pyek1], [@pone.0040622-Kumschick1], [@pone.0040622-Strubbe1]. Such studies have focused on plants [@pone.0040622-Pyek1], mammals [@pone.0040622-Nentwig1], and more recently bird species [@pone.0040622-Kumschick1], [@pone.0040622-Strubbe1]. Debate over the accuracy of prioritization assessments exists primarily due to a lack of scientific evidence for species impact [@pone.0040622-Kumschick2], [@pone.0040622-Strubbe2]. Lack of evidence for a species impact causes risk assessments to be based on hypotheses or anecdotal observations of impact, creating significant variation between assessments (eg [@pone.0040622-Strubbe1] vs. [@pone.0040622-Kumschick1]).\n\n【79】As outlined in this paper, empirical evidence of the impact of introduced species can be difficult to obtain. As a result, impacts of introduced species are poorly documented, especially when the impact is through competition [@pone.0040622-Davis1]. For example, a review of the impacts of introduced bird species concluded that there is currently little evidence that introduced birds strongly influence native species through competition or predation [@pone.0040622-Blackburn1]. More recently, an assessment of the impact of introduced bird species in Europe concluded that knowledge on the ecology and impact of introduced birds was poor [@pone.0040622-Strubbe1].\n\n【80】Different mechanisms of introduced species impact further add to the complexity management prioritization. The impacts of a predator can be severe and immediate, especially when compared to competition that can take many years to affect species abundance, as seen in our study [@pone.0040622-Davis1], [@pone.0040622-Gurevitch1], [@pone.0040622-Sax2]. Due to limited resources and short funding cycles, management prioritization may focus on a species with clear and immediate impacts, rather than a species that slowly reduce the abundance of a native species.\n\n【81】The difficulties associated with the prioritization of species management highlight the importance of studies like ours that attempt to obtain empirical evidence of a species impact. Our case study on the Common Myna provides us with six key findings. These being:\n\n【82】1.  Long-term datasets pre and post species invasion provide important resources for evaluating species impact.\n\n【83】2.  Incorporating environmental change into species impact analysis is essential to enable discrimination between the species impact and other forms of impact (eg habitat clearing).\n\n【84】3.  There is a heightened difficulty of documenting impact on species with low or fluctuating abundance due to limited data and thus a reduced ability to detect temporal shifts in their abundance.\n\n【85】4.  Prior scientific observations on the mechanisms of species impact are essential to provide firm reasoning for observed changes in native species abundance.\n\n【86】5.  Empirical evidence of a species' impact is critical for the prioritisation of introduced species management.\n\n【87】6.  Even with empirical evidence of a specie's impact, the prioritisation of introduced species management may remain a contentious issue, due to variability in impact severity and the different time periods over which impacts occur.\n\n【88】We thank the Canberra Ornithologist Group for providing data from the Garden Birds Survey, especially M.

The method is based on polynomial regression of area values on section number and simulation of systematic sectioning. The measurement function is modelled as a quadratic polynomial, with an error term superimposed. The relative influence of the trend and the error component is estimated by techniques of analysis of variance. This predictor was compared with two established short-cut estimators of the CE based on transitive theory. First, all predictors were applied to data sets from six deterministic models with analytically known CE. For these models, the CE was best predicted by the older short-cut estimator and by the computer-intensive approach, if the measurement function had finite jumps. The best prediction was provided by the newer short-cut estimator when the measurement function was continuous. The predictors were also applied to published empirical datasets.

Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic HNSCC between 2000 and 2010 were identified from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program to form the analytic cohort. We estimated cumulative incident function (CIF) of cancer-specific mortality and competing mortality. Nomograms for predicting probability of death were built with proportional subdistribution hazard models. The study cohort included 23,494 patients with HNSCC. The 5-year CIF for cancer-specific death and competing death were 26.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 26-27.3 %) and 12.7 % (95 % CI 12.2-13.3 %), respectively; 10-year CIF were 32.8 % (95 % CI 31.9-33.6 %) and 23 % (95 % CI 22.1-24 %), respectively.

Immunization with a complex multimeric glycoprotein, gp600, comprising four subunits gp330, gp140, gp110, and gp70 has been shown to induce the complete form of the disease including proteinuria. Examination of three different batches of heterologous anti-gp600 antisera by immunoblot technique showed that the reactivity toward gp70 was dominant and common to all three antisera. gp70 was isolated from Triton X-100-solubilized Fx1A by lectin Lens culinaris affinity chromatography, and the purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Ten rats were actively immunized with 200 micrograms of gp70. All 10 animals developed circulating brush border antibody and typical granular IgG deposits in the glomerulus but only 1/10 animals developed abnormal proteinuria. A potent antiserum against gp70 was prepared in the rabbit. It reacted strongly to the glomerular capillary wall and the proximal tubular brush border by immunofluorescence. By Protein A immunogold technique using anti-gp70, gold particles were found associated with the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)-endothelial region. By immunoblot analysis of rat GBM using the same anti-gp70 antiserum, a 70-kDa cross-reactive antigen was demonstrated in GBM preparations. These results show that the smallest subunit, gp70 of the complete HN antigen, gp600/Fx1A can independently induce the lesion of HN, but without proteinuria. The presence of gp70 on the endothelial side of the GBM is consistent with a role for in situ antigen-antibody reactions at sites other than the subepithelial region in the pathogenesis of HN.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

These radiopharmaceuticals bind to their targets with high affinity and specificity and therefore have excellent diagnostic potential for imaging of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. One of the key cytokines involved in the process of inflammation is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). With the introduction of anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies over the past decade, treatment of inflammatory diseases has evolved, which allowed remarkable advances in controlling signs and symptoms of inflammation and in slowing destruction. However, drugs may lose efficacy over time in patients or induce adverse events. Using immediately the right medication tailored to the patient's molecular status avoids unnecessary costs and side effects. Significant differences in mechanisms of action and in therapy outcome, depending on the disease to be treated, exist among the different TNFα antagonists. Labelling these agents may help to find out if TNFα is present in the inflammatory process and will therefore help in therapy prediction and stratification in the individual patient. This review describes the role of cytokines and in particular of TNFα in the process of inflammation as well as the influence of TNFα in some well-known and common inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, psoriasis and sarcoidosis. The main focus of this article is to review the role of molecular imaging with radiolabelled anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies for diagnostic purposes, and in therapy precision, decision-making and evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The replicative tachyzoite stage is thought to be responsible for acute/active infection and expresses immunodominant antigens thereby inducing a strong cellular immune response, which vice versa triggers the differentiation process into dormant and immunologically weak cyst stages. The immunodominance of tachyzoites is also responsible for the induction of a strong humoral immune response leading to the formation of antibodies specifically directed against tachyzoite antigens. In contrast, the bradyzoite stage which is associated with inactive/chronic infection, seems not to be a strong inducer of specific antibodies. However, since the humoral antibody response is also directed against antigens that are expressed in both stages, serodiagnosis cannot always adequately discriminate between active and inactive/chronic infection. This short review focuses on the impact of stage differentiation and discusses the potential of stage-specifically expressed antigens that might be useful in a recombinant form in order to improve future serodiagnostical approaches.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

They reported that arterial stiffness assessed using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was a significant predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death for 62 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after adjustment for the established coronary risk factor. The present report strengthened the significance of CAVI as a predictor for MACE and cardiovascular death.\n\n【2】The significance of the independency of CAVI from blood pressure is sometimes misunderstood. In most epidemiologic studies, CAVI is correlated with blood pressure. On the basis of this, some people sometimes claimed that CAVI is dependent on blood pressure. This claim is completely misunderstanding. The independency of CAVI from blood pressure is merely from blood pressure at the time of measurement. It is clear that hypertension for long term enhances arteriosclerosis and increases CAVI.\n\n【3】From the other aspect, a criticism regarding the independency of CAVI from blood pressure was raised by Sproncks et al.^[@bib2])^. They claimed that CAVI was theoretically dependent on blood pressure, and they proposed a variant equation named CAVI~0~. The editors of Journal of Hypertension supported them^[@bib3])^. Sproncks et al.\\'s equation apparently appeared good on paper, but did not actually work. The refutation was published in JAT^[@bib4])^. In short, using the VaSera system to measure pulse wave velocity from the origin of the aorta to the ankle, CAVI~0~ brought unreasonable results, in which CAVI~0~ of young hypertensive women was lower than that of normal women. The reason was high dependency of CAVI~0~ on diastolic pressure. This argument was nearly settled. The independency of CAVI from blood pressure at the time of measurement became more certain after various discussions.\n\n【4】CAVI is composed of organic stiffness and functional stiffness^[@bib5])^, and the latter function is regulated by vasoactive compounds^[@bib6])^. High CAVI was decreased during the improvement of congestive heart failure in a relatively short time, suggesting the involvement of CAVI in the formation of cardiac dysfunction as a vascular function^[@bib7])^. A new field of vascular function cooperating with cardiac function could be developed using CAVI.

Chromosomal anomalies, genetic polymorphisms, genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported to be included in the tumorigenesis and progression of bladder cancer \\[[@B1]\\]. Recently, the applications of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers and therapy targets have been widely investigated in many kinds of cancers.\n\n【2】MiRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNA molecules functioning in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have documented that miRNAs act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in a variety types of cancer, such as lung, breast, hepatic, and pancreatic cancer \\[[@B2]\\]--\\[[@B7]\\]. Currently, the aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in bladder cancer and several miRNAs have been reported to play important roles in bladder cancer tumorigenesis and progression. For example, miR-582-5p and miR-582-3p are decreased in high-grade bladder cancer clinical samples, and synthetic miR-582 molecule can suppress bladder tumor growth and metastasis in animal model \\[[@B8]\\]. miR-125b was reported to suppress bladder cancer development by down-regulating oncogene SIRT7 and oncogenic long noncoding RNA MALAT1 \\[[@B9]\\]. Down-regulation of miR-99a/100 in bladder cancer tissues and their tumor suppressor roles in bladder cancer cells was also reported \\[[@B10]\\]. In addition, some preliminary experiments suggested that miR-23b, miR-16, miR-124-3p and miR-26a might function as tumor suppressors in bladder cancer \\[[@B11]\\]--\\[[@B14]\\]. Meanwhile, miR-21 was reported to be up-regulated in high-grade bladder cancer and can suppress p53 function \\[[@B10]\\]. Several oncogenic miRNAs including miR-144, miR-10b, miR-200c and so on were reported to be involved in bladder cancer progression \\[[@B15]\\],\\[[@B16]\\].

High serum levels of miR-19a are also associated with poor outcome in metastatic inflammatory breast cancer \\[[@B19]\\]. The up-regulation of miR-19a in baldder cancer has been reported by deep sequencing in nine bladder urothelial carcinoma patients \\[[@B20]\\]. However, the expression pattern and the exact role of miR-19a in bladder cancer have not been elucidated.\n\n【4】In this study, we used Taqman probe stem-loop real-time PCR to accurately measure the levels of miR-19a in 100 pairs of bladder cancer tissues and the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. We found that miR-19a was significantly up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues. Enforced expression of miR-19a can promote the proliferation of bladder cancer cells, whereas repression of endogenous miR-19a led to the suppression of cell growth of bladder cancer cells. In addition, we improved that miR-19a acted its oncogenic role in bladder cancer partially through targeting PTEN. Furthermore, investigation of miR-19a expression in the plasma of bladder cancer patients showed that miR-19a was also increased in plasma of bladder cancer patients which strongly supported miR-19a could be developed as potential diagnostic marker of bladder cancer.\n\n【5】Methods\n=======\n\n【6】Cell culture and transfections\n------------------------------\n\n【7】The human bladder cancer cell lines (J82, HT1376, RT4, T24 and TCCSUP) and immortalized human bladder epithelium (HCV29 and HU609) cells were propagated in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37°C in 5% CO~2~ cell culture incubator. miR-19a mimics, inhibitors and scramble control were obtained from Dharmacon and transfected with DharmFECT1 (Dharmacon) at a final concentration of 50 nM.

Collectively, the data indicated that miR-19a was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues and might play important roles in bladder carcinogenesis as an oncogenic miRNA.\n\n【29】###### \n\n【30】Clinicopathological features of bladder cancer patients\n\n【31】  Variables                       Patients, n   \n  ----------------------------------- ----------------- ----\n  Histology                                          \n  TCC                                 83                32\n  TCC with aberrant differentiation   17                23\n  Gender                                             \n  Male                                75                39\n  Female                              25                16\n  Age                                                \n  ≥60                                 62                37\n  \\<60                                38                18\n  Stage                                              \n  Ta                                  34                15\n  T1                                  25                11\n  T2                                  18                12\n  T3                                  13                10\n  T4                                  10                7\n  Grade                                              \n  1                                   25                7\n  2                                   40                19\n  3                                   35                29\n  Progression                                        \n  Yes                                 33                20\n  No                                  67                35\n\n【32】Enforced expression of miR-19a promotes bladder cancer cell growth and colony formation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】To investigate the role of miR-19a in bladder carcinogenesis, we overexpressed miR-19a in the two bladder cancer cell lines RT4 and TCCSUP which had lower expression of miR-19a than the other bladder cancer cell lines. Successful overexpression of miR-19a in the two bladder cancer cell lines was confirmed by q-PCR. miR-19a was overexpressed about 28 folds and 15 folds than the scramble control or untreated RT4 and TCCSUP cells respectively (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}A, C). Consistent with its up-regulation in bladder cancer, the overexpression of miR-19a in both of the two cell lines can promote bladder cancer cell proliferation significantly as demonstrated by CCK-8 assay. The scramble control had no effect on cell proliferation compared with the untreated cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}B, D). We also detected the effect of miR-19a on the colony formation ability of bladder cancer cells. The mimic-transfected cells were replated at low density and maintained for 7 days. The overexpression of miR-19a significantly increased the colony number of RT4 and TCCSUP cells, whereas the scramble control had little effect on the colony number compared with the untreated cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}E, F). The results proved that miR-19a acted as an oncogenic miRNA in bladder cancer and the up-regulation of miR-19a in bladder tissues would lead to unlimited cell proliferation.\n\n【34】![Enforced expression of miR-19a promotes bladder cancer cell growth and colony formation.

Successful repression of miR-19a in the two bladder cancer cell lines was confirmed by q-PCR (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}A, C).

As demonstrated by the colony formation assay, repression of miR-19a also significantly decreased the colony number of J82 and HT1376 cells, whereas the scramble control had little effect on the colony number compared with the untreated cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}E, F).

PTEN has been verified as a functional target of miR-19a/b in regulating multidrug resistance in gastric cancer and breast cancer. PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor gene through its phosphatase protein product in a variety of cancers. However, it was still unknown whether miR-19a played its oncogenic roles through targeting PTEN in bladder cancer. So we detected the PTEN protein level in RT4 and TCCSUP cells transfected with miR-19a mimics and also in J82 and HT1376 cells transfected with miR-19a inhibitors. As expected, the PTEN protein level was decreased evidently in presence of miR-19a mimics compared to scramble control in both of RT4 and TCCSUP cells. Conversely, PTEN was increased in presence of miR-19a inhibitors compared to scramble control in both of J82 and HT1376 cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}A, B). These results indicated that miR-19a down-regulated PTEN protein in bladder cancer cells.\n\n【40】![miR-19a plays its oncogenic role in bladder cancer through targeting PTEN.

A decrease in PTEN after treatment with miR-19a mimics confirmed the regulatory role of miR-19a on the expression of the target. The addition of PTEN expression plasmid led to further up-regulation of PTEN based on the previously described down-regulation in both of RT4 and TCCSUP cells (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}C, D). Consistent with the restored expression of PTEN protein, promotion of cell growth by miR-19a mimics was rescued by the addition of PTEN expression plasmid (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}C, D). These data confirmed the regulatory role of miR-19a in bladder cancer cells was through targeting PTEN.\n\n【42】miR-19a is also up-regulated in the plasma of patients with bladder cancer\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】To explore the diagnostic potential of miR-19a in bladder cancer, we detected the expression of miR-19a in the plasma of 50 patients with bladder cancer and 50 healthy individuals. The data demonstrated that the average level of miR-19a in the bladder cancer patients was significantly higher than that in the healthy individuals which was consistent with its up-regulation in bladder cancer tissues (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). The results suggested that miR-19a could be released from the bladder epithelium to the blood and increased miR-19a in the bladder cancer tissues caused its up-regulation in the plasma. The high-level expression of miR-19a in the plasma of bladder cancer patients was also significantly associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). The increased expression of miR-19a in the plasma of bladder cancer patients suggested that miR-19a can be developed as a potential diagnostic marker which can be combined with other miRNAs' expression to detect bladder cancer.\n\n【44】![Expression of miR-19a in the plasma of patients with bladder cancer.

The miRNA cluster produces a single primary transcript yielding the six mature miRNAs: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92a. miR-19 has been identified as the key member responsible for the oncogenic activity \\[[@B25]\\],\\[[@B26]\\]. However, the role of miR-19 in bladder cancer remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-19a in a great deal of patients with bladder cancer and dissected the roles and mechanisms of miR-19a in bladder cancer carcinogenesis. We found that miR-19a was significantly up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and the high expression of miR-19a was associated with the more aggressive phenotypes of bladder cancer. Gain or loss of function of miR-19a in bladder cancer cells also indicated that miR-19a can promote cell growth which was consistent with its role in other cancer types. The important role of miR-19a in regulating bladder cancer cell invasion, migration and in vivo carcinogenesis needs to be further confirmed. In case anti-miRs of miR-19a can suppress tumor growth in vivo significantly, miR-19a can be further developed as new target for bladder cancer therapy as miRNAs has advantages of being small and easy to delivery, safer than other gene therapy methods \\[[@B27]\\],\\[[@B28]\\].\n\n【47】To further dissect the mechanism by which miR-19a functioned as an oncogenic miRNA in bladder cancer, we analyzed the relationship of miR-19a and PTEN in bladder cancer and found that the regulatory role of miR-19a in bladder cancer cells was dependent on targeting PTEN. PTEN is identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway \\[[@B29]\\]--\\[[@B31]\\]. AKT/PKB signaling pathways answer to growth factors and other extracellular stimuli to regulate several cellular functions including nutrient metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis and survival. miR-19a may repress the expression of PTEN which further lead to the unlimited cell proliferation of bladder cancer cells. The correlation of expression level of miR-19a and PTEN in patients with bladder cancer will be investigated further to confirm that PTEN was a direct target of miR-19a in bladder cancer.\n\n【48】Earlier studies discovered that extracellular miRNAs circulated in the bloodstream and the circulating miRNAs were remarkably stable. Detection of elevated levels of tumor associated miRNAs in serum of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \\[[@B32]\\] leads to widely investigation of circulating miRNAs in many human cancers, including breast cancer \\[[@B33]\\], lung cancer \\[[@B34]\\], prostate cancer \\[[@B35]\\], and renal cell carcinoma \\[[@B36]\\] and so on. The expression profile of miRNAs in serum/plasma of the patients with bladder cancer was also investigated and some important circulating miRNAs in bladder cancer had been identified \\[[@B37]\\],\\[[@B38]\\]. These studies support the use of serum/plasma miRNAs as noninvasive means of bladder cancer detection. Serum miR-19a expression has been reported to correlate with worse prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer \\[[@B39]\\]. We detected the level of miR-19a in plasma of patients with bladder cancer and found that miR-19a was also increased which was consistent with its high level in the cancer tissues. The up-regulation of miR-19a in the plasma might origin from the tumor cells which needs to be improved further. MiRNAs can be detected easily in small amount samples and are stable against degradation and can be detectable in bodily fluids including serum, plasma, saliva, urine and tears \\[[@B40]\\],\\[[@B41]\\]. The innate properties of miRNAs make them attractive as potential biomarkers. So miR-19a can be developed as a new diagnostic marker for bladder cancer detection. Further analysis of the correlation of miR-19a expression level with clinical outcome will offer important information about the relationship of miR-19a levels with the clinical diagnosis, therapy and outcome, which will be useful for individualized therapies. In consideration of the possible secretion of miR-19a from the tumor cells to the plasma, the level of miR-19a in urine samples of the patients will be examined. Voided urine can be noninvasively obtained, be designed not only for diagnosis, but also for monitoring disease recurrence and response to therapy \\[[@B42]\\],\\[[@B43]\\]. So development of miR-19a as a novel urinary biomarker for bladder cancer will be urgently required for early detection of cancer and individualized therapies.\n\n【49】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【50】In summary, we determined the high expression of miR-19a in the cancer tissues and plasma of patients with bladder cancer and also indicated the oncogenic roles of miR19a in bladder cancer which was dependent on targeting PTEN. Our data provided the potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles of miR-19a in bladder cancer firstly.\n\n【51】Competing interests\n===================\n\n【52】The authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\n【53】Authors' contributions\n======================\n\n【54】Y-GF conceived the project; designed the experiments and carried out the majority of the experiments; JL conducted the bioinformatics analysis; Y-MK, YH and BL helped to collect clinical samples.

However, serum mineral data have only been collected since 2012. In 2013, there were 59,918 dialysis patients registered by the Korean Society of Nephrology (hemodialysis, 52,378; peritoneal dialysis, 7,540). Mean serum phosphorus levels were 4.94±1.63 and 5.05±1.56mg/dL in patients with hemodialysis (n=15,457) and peritoneal dialysis (n=880), respectively. Serum calcium concentrations were 8.87±0.89 and 8.74±0.91mg/dL in hemodialysis (n=15,450) and peritoneal dialysis (n=880), respectively. The mean values of calcium and phosphorus appear acceptable in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, but the standard deviations, especially of phosphorus, were quite large[@B1] (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【2】The term \\'chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders\\' (CKD-MBD) is a new term that, in contrast to the old term \\'renal osteodystrophy\\', implies a systemic syndrome associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality[@B2]. Previous studies have shown that elevated serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as well as all-cause mortality[@B3]. In order to improve outcomes in patients with CKD-MBD, many countries have developed clinical practice guidelines. Globally, the Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines are the most commonly used[@B4],[@B5]. However, whether those global guidelines can be successfully implemented at the local level remains to be examined. As a regional guide, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (JSDT) recently updated its clinical practice guidelines for the management of CKD-MBD[@B6].\n\n【3】Serum mineral targets in KDOQI and KDIGO guidelines\n===================================================\n\n【4】In CKD stages 5 and 5D, the KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommend that serum phosphorus be maintained at 3.5-5.5mg/dL[@B4]. This target corresponds to a level slightly higher than the normal reference limit. The KDIGO通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> guidelines suggest lowering phosphorus levels toward the reference range in CKD stage 5D[@B5]. Notably, both guidelines had low levels of evidence supporting this guideline.\n\n【5】According to Western textbooks, normal serum phosphorus ranges from 2.5 to 4.5mg/dL[@B7]. In this study we sought to determine if these guidelines could be applied to Korean patients. Excluding those who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\<60mL/min/1.73m^2^ calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, we analyzed serum phosphorus concentrations from 6,131 adults (male 3,163; female 2,968) participating in a health check-up at our hospital in 2011. The mean age and eGFR were 45±11 years and 92±14 mL/min/1.73m^2^, respectively. The serum phosphorus distribution is shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 2]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}. Based on the mean and standard deviation data, the normal serum phosphorus concentration in this patient population ranged from 2.4 to 4.5 mg/dL. This data indicates there are no differences in the normal levels of serum phosphorus between Korean and Western patients. In the United States, a high serum phosphorus concentration was associated with a low socioeconomic status irrespective of race[@B8].\n\n【6】The KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommend that serum corrected calcium be maintained at 8.4-9.5mg/dL in CKD stages 5 and 5D[@B4]. This range corresponds to the lower end of the reference range. The KDIGO通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> guidelines suggested maintaining serum calcium levels in the reference range in CKD stages 3 - 5D[@B5]. The Ca×P product was previously considered an important biomarker[@B9], and the KDOQI 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> guidelines recommended Ca×P be \\<55mg^2^/dL^2^. However, individual serum calcium and phosphorus values are currently used as the primary determinants for target serum ranges.\n\n【7】Hemodialysis quality monitoring by HIRAS in Korea\n=================================================\n\n【8】In Korea, the national government or Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRAS) assesses hemodialysis quality on an annual basis. Every hemodialysis facility should test serum phosphorus and calcium monthly in all patients. From this data, the Ca×P product is calculated and evaluated as an outcome variable, and HIRAS requires the product to be below 55mg^2^/dL^2^, consistent with the KDOQI guidelines. The value of Ca×P product is currently an important criterion for the assessment of national health insurance coverage in Korea when calcium-free phosphate binders are prescribed.\n\n【9】Gaps between global guidelines and local practices for management of CKD-MBD\n============================================================================\n\n【10】A few years ago, serum mineral data were collected from 1,018 maintenance hemodialysis patients at 17 centers in Korea[@B10]. When classified by the ranges recommended by the KDOQI guidelines, only about half of the patients were considered within the guideline range for serum Ca and P. Uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia and a Ca×P product greater than or equal to 55mg^2^/dL^2^ were noted in about 40% and 30% of patients, respectively. Approximately 30% of patients were within the guideline range for PTH, with a greater proportion of patients falling in the lower PTH range, revealing a gap between guidelines and practice.\n\n【11】Our data were similar to those from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS). Although there were some differences between countries, approximately half of the patients had uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia \\>5.5mg/dL. It is notable that almost every country showed that phosphorus tended to decrease slowly over the study period. On the other hand, PTH levels were steady throughout the 3 phases of DOPPS. About half of the patients appeared to have PTH levels within the target range [@B11].\n\n【12】A regional, but not global, guide from Japan\n============================================\n\n【13】Patients in different countries are affected by different medical and social circumstances[@B12]. The Japanese CKD-MBD guidelines were updated last year and had an impact on the care of Korean dialysis patients. They proposed a simplified diagram illustrating what medications can be adjusted according to serum phosphorus and corrected calcium levels, in which the serum phosphorus target was 3.5 to 6.0mg/dL[@B6].\n\n【14】In the Japanese epidemiological data from hemodialysis patients, those with serum phosphorus near 5mg/dL, calcium near 9mg/dL, and PTH near 180 pg/mL showed the best survival rate[@B13]. Based on these results, the Japanese guidelines suggest higher target levels of serum phosphorus (6mg/dL) and calcium(10mg/dL), respectively[@B6].\n\n【15】Gaps between guidelines\n=======================\n\n【16】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#T1){ref-type=\"table\"} summarizes the recommended serum phosphorus, corrected calcium, and PTH levels in patients undergoing dialysis according to different professional organizations. As shown in the table, differences exist among the international guidelines. Although KDIGO is updating CKD-MBD guidelines through Controversies Conferences [@B14], the serum mineral targets will not be changed until data from randomized controlled clinical trials supports such changes.\n\n【17】Many nephrologists around the world use these guidelines when they manage patients with CKD-MBD. Accordingly, more hemodialysis facilities in the United States adopted a high PTH target after the KDIGO guidelines were introduced[@B15], and the serum calcium target subsequently increased. The serum phosphorus target did not change, and most facilities currently adhere to a target level of 5.5mg/dL. In contrast to the upward trend of PTH target in the United States, many Korean dialysis patients have low PTH levels[@B1], and approximately 20% of the patients were medicated with vitamin D receptor agonists or cinacalcet (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig. 3]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}).\n\n【18】In our study population, the utility of the Japanese PTH target range is appreciated. PTH levels were proposed to range from 60 to 240 pg/mL[@B6] based upon the odds ratios for achieving the Japanese calcium and phosphorus targets[@B13]. The underlying idea was that appropriate PTH regulation could be maintained by optimal control of serum phosphorus and calcium levels.\n\n【19】Relative importance of hyperphosphatemia control\n================================================\n\n【20】The Japanese hemodialysis cohort study evaluated the relative importance of calcium, phosphorus, and PTH control[@B13]. Patient survival was higher when phosphorus was well controlled as compared with calcium and PTH. PTH had a weak influence upon mortality compared with phosphorus and calcium.\n\n【21】We found that, in our hemodialysis population, PTH levels were significantly associated with phosphorus and calcium levels[@B10]. In patients with a high PTH level, both phosphorus and calcium were poorly controlled.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【23】There are gaps between global guidelines and local practices. Many dialysis patients are not within the recommended range of serum phosphorus, calcium, and PTH. Among the 3 mineral values, serum phosphorus may be most influential on mortality outcomes. However, global or international CKD-MBD practice guidelines suggest different target levels for serum phosphorus. The serum phosphorus target associated with the best outcomes should be determined for each local area, and further study on Korean populations is needed to support dialysis management guidelines.\n\n【24】The author has served on an advisory panel for AbbVie and received a speaker\\'s fee from Sanofi.\n\n【25】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations from the Korean ESRD Registry 2013.

These glycosphingolipid inclusions can be found within a variety of renal cells. Light microscopic examination usually shows enlarged podocytes with abundant, finely vacuolated cytoplasm due to lipid inclusions. Although podocytes are affected predominantly, accumulation of globotriasylceramide can also occur in glomerular or vascular endothelium, mesangial cells, tubular epithelium, interstitial foam cells or in vascular myocytes. The ultrastructural appearance of the inclusions is of whorled layers of alternating dense and pale material ('zebra bodies' or myelin figures) that are highly characteristic of Fabry disease \\[[@SFT089C2]\\] Although heterozygous females were previously thought to be clinically unaffected, subclinical or fully symptomatic forms can occur due to differential X-chromosomal inactivation \\[[@SFT089C3]\\].\n\n【2】Various drugs including amiodarone, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mimic phospholipidosis of Fabry disease. In previous years, case reports have been published that have drawn attention to chloroquine, causing histomorphologic changes similar to those of Fabry nephropathy. In all cases, the almost identical inclusions led to misdiagnosis until a complete history was available, followed by confirmation of normal enzymatic activity or absence of α-galactosidase A gene mutation \\[[@SFT089C2], [@SFT089C4]--[@SFT089C6]\\].\n\n【3】Recent reports \\[[@SFT089C5], [@SFT089C6]\\] with ultrastructural analyses of chloroquine-induced phospholipidosis found a unique feature never reported in Fabry disease. Curvilinear inclusion bodies were first described by Müller-Höcker et al. \\[[@SFT089C4]\\] as an intermingled twisted microtubular substructure found in vascular smooth muscle cells and podocytes. More recently, Ferluga \\[[@SFT089C7]\\] demonstrated similar curvilinear bodies (CLB) in renal biopsies in a small case series of chloroquine-induced iatrogenic phospholipidosis.\n\n【4】We report a 31-year-old systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient on hydroxychloroquine therapy who underwent a kidney biopsy that revealed findings typical of Fabry disease.\n\n【5】Case report {#s2}\n===========\n\n【6】A 31-year-old female was diagnosed with SLE in 1998 when she presented with arthritis, anaemia and skin lesions (lupus discoid). Blood analysis showed hypocomplementaemia and positive antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Therapy was commenced with steroids and methotrexate. She had been on hydroxychloroquine since 2009 (150 mg/day, cumulative dose, 219 g) and developed proteinuria (600 mg/day) over the 3-year observation period. The serum creatinine was normal at 81 µmol/L (0.9 mg/dL). As the skin lesions worsened in 2010, steroids were increased (0.5 mg/kg/day with subsequent tapering to 7.5 mg/day after a 6-month period), and azathioprine was commenced (later switched to mycophenolate mofetil). This treatment regimen brought about only partial improvement. A kidney biopsy was performed in February 2012 for evaluation of renal histology to facilitate the decision of giving belimumab therapy.\n\n【7】Kidney biopsy {#s3}\n=============\n\n【8】Light microscopic examination (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#SFT089F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) of paraffin-embedded sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and periodic acid--Schiff stain showed renal cortex containing 23 glomeruli, 2 of which were sclerosed. Glomerular visceral epithelial cells were diffusely enlarged with fine uniform vacuolations. Mesangial matrix and cellularity were slightly increased throughout. There was no inflammation, segmental sclerosis, adhesions or crescents. Minimal interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were observed. Arterioles showed only mild sclerosis. Fig. 1.Visceral epithelial cells showing finely vacuolated cytoplasm (\\). Diffuse increase in mesangial matrix and cellularity (Periodic acid--schiff stain, ×400).\n\n【9】Immunofluorescence showed mild mesangial staining for IgA, IgG, IgM and complement factor C3. Immunostaining for complement factors C4 and C1q, κ and λ light chains, and fibrinogen was negative.\n\n【10】Methylene blue-stained thin sections cut at 1 µm were prepared for electron microscopy and contained one glomerulus and arteriole. Ultrastructural examination of glomerular visceral epithelial cells demonstrated prominent membrane-bound electron-dense bodies with a multilamellar appearance, with changes characteristic of myelin figures or zebra bodies (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#SFT089F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Similar structures were also present, although to a far lesser degree, within glomerular endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. Few lamellated bodies were present in tubules, with predominance of proteinaceous material in the tubular lysosomes. CLB, expressing twisted microtubular structure, were found in glomerular visceral epithelial and arteriolar endothelial cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figures 3]</u>(#SFT089F3){ref-type=\"fig\"} and 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#SFT089F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Foot processes of overlying epithelial cells showed patchy effacement. Expansion of mesangial matrix was observed and immune-type electron-dense deposits were present within the mesangium and focally in subendothelium.

Fig. 4.Curvilinear and myeloid cytoplasmic inclusions in an arteriolar smooth muscle cell (electron micrograph, original magnification ×3500--15 000).\n\n【11】The biopsy specimen showed features of lupus nephritis Class II (ISN/RPS 2004), with superimposed intracytoplasmatic inclusions characteristic of Fabry disease.\n\n【12】Clinical follow-up {#s4}\n==================\n\n【13】The patient had no clinical signs or familiar history suggestive of Fabry disease. Leucocyte α-galactosidase A enzyme activity was normal at 8.18 nmol/mL/h (normal 2.1--13.6 nmol/mL/h) and mutation analysis showed no abnormalities in the patient's α-galactosidase A gene.\n\n【14】Ophthalmologic examination revealed periocular eczema (related to SLE) and discrete bilateral corneal subepithelial opacities with normal campimetry. Skin biopsy ultrastructural analysis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>(#SFT089F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}) showed difuse intralysosomal electron-dense deposits and larger inclusions with typical CLB. Since Fabry disease was excluded, these findings were attributed to hydroxychloroquine toxicity and it was discontinued. Fig. 5.Skin biopsy (electron microscopy, ×12 000), showing intracellular CLB and electron-dense intralysosomal inclusions.\n\n【15】Improvement in skin lesions was observed 6 months after stopping hydroxychloroquine and bilateral corneal subepithelial opacities disappeared. Renal function remained stable (serum creatinine 81 µmol/L (0.9 mg/dL) with proteinuria 400 mg/24 h) while the patient remained on azathioprine and low-dose steroids.\n\n【16】Discussion {#s5}\n==========\n\n【17】It was a surprise to find features of classic Fabry disease on kidney biopsy of this patient. However, lack of symptoms, a negative family history of Fabry disease, combined with normal enzyme activity, and absence of genetic mutations excluded this diagnosis.\n\n【18】The unique findings on kidney biopsy used to establish diagnosis of Fabry disease have been questioned in recent years. There are few case reports to support this, and they describe inclusions similar to Fabry nephropathy in patients with long-term therapy with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine \\[[@SFT089C2], [@SFT089C4]--[@SFT089C6]\\]. These drugs have been shown to become sequestered in tissues (the liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys). This extensive distribution has been attributed to its amphiphilic nature, which allows for lysosomal trapping and inhibition of key lysosomal enzymes, including α-galactosidase \\[[@SFT089C8]\\]. Accordingly, renal phospholipidosis, similar to that observed in Fabry nephropathy, has been associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity. In these cases, ultrastructural analysis has variously shown small dense cytoplasmic bodies, larger concentrically lamellated myeloid bodies and straight parallel-arranged lamellated zebra bodies, resembling Fabry disease. Even the distribution within renal cells is similar, with a dominant involvement of podocytes and endothelial cells and, to a lesser extent, smooth muscle cells of the vessel walls. Therefore, in such cases, exclusion of Fabry disease is only possible by demonstrating normal α-galactosidase activity and/or absence of genetic mutations.\n\n【19】Ferluga \\[[@SFT089C7]\\] reported a small series of 25 patients (21 males and 4 females) who were on long-term treatment with chloroquine, most with a diagnosis of SLE with a clinically low activity or lupus-like mixed connective tissue disease. The presence of proteinuria or renal failure was not referred to in this study. In six female patients (24%), histopathologic and ultrastructural intracytoplasmatic inclusions similar to Fabry disease were found, with quantity and type of distribution resembling a female heterozygous mild form of Fabry nephropathy. In these patients, kidney biopsy also showed milder forms of lupus nephritis and occasional focal sclerosing lesions. They had been on chloroquine for a period ranging from 11 days to 5 years. One year after stopping chloroquine, total remission of myeloid inclusion bodies in the kidney biopsy was seen in one patient and partial resolution in two patients.\n\n【20】In the six cases declared as chloroquine-induced phospholipidosis, four expressed CLB (three in vascular smooth muscle cells and two within podocytes and cytoplasm of distal tubular epithelial cells). They were described as inclusion bodies surrounded by single membrane and in lamellated and twisted microtubular substructure. Typically found in ceroid lipofuscinosis, CLB are also an ultrastructural feature of chloroquine toxicity found in myocytes and cardiomyocytes \\[[@SFT089C9]\\]. Despite the fact that the first description of CLB in chloroquine-induced phospholipidosis in the kidney biopsy was described in a case report by Müller-Höcker et al. \\[[@SFT089C4]\\], this finding was not observed in other published cases. The presence of CLB does not seem to be a uniform finding in renal biopsy specimens, but this small series published by Ferluga \\[[@SFT089C7]\\] suggests that it may be frequently found. Therefore, the presence of CLB may be an ultrastructural clue that allows differentiation between Fabry and chloroquine-induced nephropathy.\n\n【21】Conflict of interest statement {#s6}\n==============================\n\n【22】None declared.\n\n【23】The authors thank M.J.

One of the most widely studied associations is the symbiotic defensive mutualism between Pööideae grasses and endophytic fungi of the genus um Epichloë, due to their significant impacts on insect and mammalian herbivores, particularly in agricultural pastoral systems [@pone.0101331-Saikkonen1]--[@pone.0101331-Rudgers1], [@pone.0101331-Clay2]--[@pone.0101331-Leuchtmann1]. In exchange for shelter, nutrition and transmission via host seeds, the endophytes may increase host growth and reproduction, stress tolerance and herbivore and pathogen resistance (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Clay1], [@pone.0101331-Hartley1]). Moreover, they may also have community-wide impacts by affecting secondary consumers and altering interplant competition [@pone.0101331-Rudgers1], [@pone.0101331-Omacini1]--[@pone.0101331-DeSassi1].\n\n【3】The endophyte-conferred herbivore resistance is often attributed to the direct induction of biologically active alkaloids by the endophyte, which may adversely affect herbivore performance [@pone.0101331-Hartley1], [@pone.0101331-Wilkinson1]--[@pone.0101331-Saikkonen3]. However, the alkaloid profiles and concentrations may vary considerably among grass-endophyte systems and environmental conditions, leading to no effects, or even positive effects, on herbivores [@pone.0101331-Mller1], [@pone.0101331-Schardl1]--[@pone.0101331-Afkhami1]. These variable effects indicate that apart from endophyte-conferred alkaloid defence, additional as-yet-undiscovered mechanisms such as endophyte-mediated changes in host defence chemistry are likely to be implicated in complex endophyte-host-insect interactions. In plant-microbe interactions some beneficial microbes (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria) have been shown to affect herbivore performance by inducing their host plant\\'s own defences [@pone.0101331-Estrada1], [@pone.0101331-Stout1]. Yet, this has been largely disregarded in previous studies concerning grass-endophyte symbioses [@pone.0101331-Saikkonen3], [@pone.0101331-Simons1].\n\n【4】Among the multitude of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli is the release of complex blends of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that consist mainly of terpenoids, fatty acid derivatives and phenylpropanoids. Plant VOCs play an important ecological role in shaping the assemblage of, and interactions between, organisms within a plant\\'s community [@pone.0101331-Dicke1]--[@pone.0101331-Li1]. For example, herbivorous insects rely, to varying extents, on plant VOCs as olfactory cues to recognize host plants and avoid non-host plants [@pone.0101331-Dicke1], [@pone.0101331-Hare1]. On the other hand, herbivore attack elicits both local and systemic emission of plant VOCs, which in turn may protect plants from further damage either directly through deterring or repelling herbivores or indirectly through attracting natural enemies of herbivores [@pone.0101331-Hare1], [@pone.0101331-Kessler1]. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has revealed that colonization by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can also modify constitutive or herbivore-induced VOC emissions of colonized plants and thereby alter VOC-mediated multitrophic interactions [@pone.0101331-Guerrieri1]--[@pone.0101331-Pineda1], although often in unpredictable ways.\n\n【5】Little is known about the effects of fungal endophytes on VOC emissions of host plants and the cascading effects on the behaviour of insects at different trophic levels. The few studies on endophyte-induced alteration of VOC blends have found that VOC emissions may be enhanced [@pone.0101331-Mucciarelli1], reduced [@pone.0101331-Jallow1], or unchanged by endophyte presence [@pone.0101331-Estrada1] depending on plant and endophyte species. However, these studies mainly involve horizontally transmitted fungal endophytes and constitutive VOC emissions. In contrast to horizontally transmitted endophytes, vertically transmitted fungal Epichloë endophytes form a life-long and heritable symbiosis with their host grasses (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Clay1], [@pone.0101331-Hartley1]), and hence may alter the host\\'s chemistry differently. Furthermore, systemic endophytes have long dominated the literature presumably because of their agronomic impact (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Saikkonen1], [@pone.0101331-Hartley1]), but their effects on constitutive and herbivore-induced VOC emissions have been poorly explored. The only information on this comes from an early study of Epichloë coenophiala---infected tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) [@pone.0101331-Yue1] and a very recent study of Epichloë festucae var. lolii-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) [@pone.0101331-Paka1], both demonstrating the potential effect of Epichloë endophytes on host\\'s VOC release but failing to determine the impact of herbivory. Regardless of which group they belong to, elucidating the endophyte effects on both constitutive and herbivore-induced VOC emissions in endophyte-grass interactions would not only help to understand the variable endophyte effects on herbivory, but also to evaluate the potential of endophytes as biological control tools.\n\n【6】We investigated whether and how Epichloë endophytes altered constitutive and herbivore-induced VOC emissions in two fescue species, tall fescue (symbiotic with Epichloë coenophiala) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis, symbiotic with Epichloë uncinata). To examine herbivore-induced VOC emissions, we used a generalist aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi (bird cherry-oat aphid), a common pest of grasses that has been extensively used as a model phloem feeder in grass endophyte research (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Hartley1]). Specifically, we addressed the following questions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Does aphid feeding induce VOC emissions in grasses? 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Does Epichloë infection modify VOC emissions by its host? 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> Is there any variation in these responses of the two grass species? We discuss how VOC emissions by the host could interact with endophyte-conferred defence.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods {#s2}\n=====================\n\n【8】Ethics statement {#s2a}\n----------------\n\n【9】This study was conducted in the laboratory and did not involve any endangered or protected species; the insect species used in this study is a serious cereal pest worldwide, including Finland. Hence, no specific ethical approval was required for this study.\n\n【10】Plants, endophytes and Insects {#s2b}\n------------------------------\n\n【11】Seeds of naturally endophyte infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) cultivar 'Kentucky 31′ and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) cultivar 'Kasper' were collected from experimental fields in the University of Turku Ruissalo Botanical Garden. For tall fescue, in addition to E+ and E- plants, manipulatively endophyte-free (ME-) plants, which were obtained from E+ plant using heat treatment, were included to separate the effects of endophyte infection from plant responses. Because host plants of different endophyte status are from a single cultivar, genetic variation and its impact on plant defence response might be limited compared to wild plants. The infection status of the plants was verified by growing out the fungus from surface sterilized grass leaf cuttings plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes [@pone.0101331-Clement1], [@pone.0101331-Wli1]. Plants were grown individually in 12-cm-diameter plastic pots filled with a standard potting soil in a greenhouse \\[photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at canopy level ca. 300 µmol m^−2^ s^−1^\\]. Approximately 60 days after seedling transplantation, plants were transferred to a climate-controlled room (18--24°C, 70% RH, L16:D8 photoperiod, and ca. 250 µmol m^−2^ s^−1^ PAR) in the laboratory, where all experiments were conducted.\n\n【12】Rhopalosiphum padi were obtained from a colony at the Department of Ecology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden, and were reared on barley in a climate-controlled room (16L:8D, 18--24°C, and 70% RH).\n\n【13】Plant treatment {#s2c}\n---------------\n\n【14】Experiments for both fescue species followed a full-factorial experimental design with two factors, endophyte infection and damage inflicted either by aphid infestation or mechanical wounding. Before the start of the experiments, a total of 18 plants without visible damage were selected from each endophyte status (E-, ME- and E+ for tall fescue; E- and E+ for meadow fescue) and divided into six groups according to plant size, with plants in each group characterized by similar size. The three plants within each group were then randomly subjected to the following three treatments: 1) aphid infestation (A): plants were infested by placing five barley leaf segments containing a total of 50 mixed-instar nymphs and apterae between tillers and removing these segments after all aphids had moved onto the plants; 2) wounding (W): plants were mechanically damaged by first cutting ca. 4 cm off every leaf tip with scissors and then squeezing the remaining leaf blade eight times with forceps; and 3) control (C): control plants received no damage. Mechanical wounding was meant to mimic the damage caused by animal grazing and trampling. In total, there were nine and six endophyte × damage treatments for tall and meadow fescue, respectively, each containing six plants. To avoid aphids moving to neighbouring plants, all plants including those without aphids were placed in screened cages with cage positions rotated daily to control for any differences in light or temperature conditions.\n\n【15】VOCs from wounded and aphid-infested plants were collected at different times following treatment. Mechanical damage typically elicits rapid release of VOCs, particularly green leaf volatiles (GLVs; e.g. [@pone.0101331-Mithfer1]). Consistent with this, we found in a preliminary study with red fescue (Festuca rubra) that 40 min after mechanical wounding similar to that in this study, GLV emissions were several hundred-fold higher compared to pre-damage emissions (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S1]</u>(#pone.0101331.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). After one day, GLV emissions remained substantially higher than pre-damage emissions; however, an induction of few terpenoids (e.g. β-ocimene) manifested itself. Therefore, we collected VOCs from mechanically wounded plants one day after wounding to capture responses of both GLV and terpenoids compounds. For meadow fescue, VOC collection was also performed at six days post-wounding. However, since VOC responses induced by phloem feeders -- which inflict minimal tissue damage -- proceeds slowly with a delay of several days [@pone.0101331-Babikova1], [@pone.0101331-Blande1], we collected VOCs from aphid-infested plants at 6 and 12 days after infestation. This timing was chosen according to the time courses of aphid-induced VOC induction reported in the literature [@pone.0101331-Babikova1], [@pone.0101331-Blande1].\n\n【16】After the last VOC sampling, the aboveground plant parts, which had been enclosed during VOC collection, were harvested, oven-dried and weighed. Owing to high numbers of aphid offspring on infested plants, in particularly on infested E- plants, total dry weight of aphids per plant (including dead ones present on the plants) rather than aphid number was determined and used as a proxy for aphid propagation and growth to assess the endophyte effects on aphid performance.\n\n【17】VOC collection and analysis {#s2d}\n---------------------------\n\n【18】VOC collection was conducted as in Li et al. [@pone.0101331-Li1]. In brief, the pots plus soil were carefully wrapped with aluminium foil to prevent contamination with soil-derived volatiles. The aerial part of each potted plant was then enclosed in a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bag and sealed with a plastic-coated wire. Charcoal filter purified air was pushed through Teflon tubing into each bag (230 ml min^−1^) and pulled out by a vacuum pump (200 ml min^−1^) through a stainless steel trap packed with 150 mg of Tenax TA and 150 mg of Carbopack B (Markes International, Llantrisant, RCT, UK). VOCs were collected for 1 h and simultaneously from plants of different treatments; periodic collections of VOCs from empty PET bags were also made. Aphids were kept on infested plants during collection since the presence of aphids has been shown to contribute little if anything to the VOC blends emitted by the plant-aphid complex [@pone.0101331-Babikova1], [@pone.0101331-Blande1]. Furthermore, it is likely that removing aphids from plants will result in a degree of mechanical damage to the plant and may result in aphids emitting their alarm pheromones.\n\n【19】VOC samples were analyzed by GC-MS (Hewlett-Packard GC 6890; MSD 5973; Wilmington, DE, USA). Trapped volatiles were desorbed with a thermal desorption unit (ATD400; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 250°C for 10 min, focused at −10°C on a cold trap and transferred onto an HP-5 capillary column (50 m×0.2 mm; film thickness 0.5 µm) with helium as the carrier gas (1.2 ml min^−1^). The column temperature was initially held at 40°C for 1 min, then ramped to 210°C at 5°C min^−1^, and finally to 250°C at 20°C min^−1^. Individual VOCs were tentatively identified by comparing mass spectra with those in NIST and Wiley spectral libraries and verified by chromatography with authentic standards when available. Although over 50 prominent peaks could be detected, only those that were found consistently higher in the samples than in the blanks were considered in further analyses, allowing identification of 17 compounds in both grass species. For quantification, peak areas of characteristic quantifier ions were integrated and the amount of each compound was calculated based on external calibration curves generated with authentic standards. For compounds whose reference standards were not available, quantification was assessed relative to the external standard 1-chlorooctane. Emission rates were presented in nanograms per gram dry weight per hour (ng g^−1^DW h^−1^).\n\n【20】Statistical analysis {#s2e}\n--------------------\n\n【21】To analyse the main effects of endophyte (E- versus E+), aphid (C versus A), sampling date (6 days versus 12 days post-infestation) and their interaction on emissions of total and single VOCs, we used a linear mixed model (LMM) for each grass species, with endophyte and aphid as the between-subjects factors and time as the within-subjects factor. Since R. padi aphids performed badly on E+ plants relative to E- plants (see '[Results](#s3){ref-type=\"sec\"}'), E+ plants may experience less leaf damage over the infestation period. To account for any potential effects of differential aphid damage on VOC emissions, we used the total aphid dry weight per plant as an indicator of the extent of plant damage, and re-analyzed aphid-induced VOCs by including aphid dry weight as a covariate in the LMM. In this model, endophyte, sampling date and their interaction were fixed factors. To examine endophyte by wounding effects, we performed two-way ANOVA. Effects of endophyte on aphid dry weight and effects of endophyte by aphid on plant dry mass were analysed by one-way and two-way ANOVA, respectively. Data were log transformed \\[log(X+1)\\] to meet normality and homoscedasticity. All analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS 19.0 for windows.\n\n【22】To visualize differences in VOC blends of differently treated plants, data were also analysed with Partial Least Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) (SIMCA-P11.0; Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). To preprocess data, emission rates of individual VOCs were normalized \\[log(X+1)\\], mean-centred and scaled to unit variance. The number of significant PLS components was determined by cross validation [@pone.0101331-Eriksson1]. This method allows not only for visualization of high dimensional data in score plots, but also for identification of variables (i.e. volatile compounds) that are important for the differences in complex VOC blends among treatments. In general, variables with the Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) scores larger than 1 are considered most influential for the model.\n\n【23】Results {#s3}\n=======\n\n【24】VOC emissions by tall fescue {#s3a}\n----------------------------\n\n【25】There was no significant effect of endophytes (LMM; F ~(2,\\ 59.99)~  = 0.68, P = 0.512) and aphids (F ~(1,\\ 59.99)~  = 2.23, P = 0.155) on total VOC emissions, though aphid-infested E+ plants appeared to increase total emissions after 12 days of feeding (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1a]</u>(#pone-0101331-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Tables 1]</u>(#pone-0101331-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}, [S1](#pone.0101331.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} and [S2](#pone.0101331.s007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Regarding individual compounds, endophyte presence decreased emissions of (Z)-β-ocimene (P = 0.059) and (E)-β-caryophyllene (P = 0.005) irrespective of feeding treatment, whereas endophyte removal increased emissions of α-pinene (P\\<0.001), an unknown monoterpene (P = 0.010) and methyl salicylate (P = 0.043). After controlling for possible effects of differential levels of leaf damage, similar results were observed for the effects of endophyte presence on VOC emissions from aphid-infested plants (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S3]</u>(#pone.0101331.s008){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Aphid feeding induced differential responses of several compounds depending on endophyte status and feeding duration. At 12 days post-feeding, for example, infested E+ plants emitted higher amounts of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (P = 0.073) and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate (P = 0.093) than control E+ plants, while infested E- plants emitted substantially more linalool (P = 0.016), (E)-β-caryophyllene (P = 0.088) and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (P = 0.038) than control E- plants (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#pone-0101331-g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>(#pone.0101331.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). The most notable aphid effect was the de novo induction of 1-octen-3-ol (P\\<0.001), which was released exclusively from infested plants independently of endophyte status and in significantly higher amounts at 12 days after aphid addition than at 6 days (P\\<0.001).

In contrast, in meadow fescue a clear distinction between VOC blends of E- and E+ plants could be depicted at all three sampling days although a small overlap was seen (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figures 4]</u>(#pone-0101331-g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}, [S2](#pone.0101331.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} and [S3](#pone.0101331.s003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).

For tall fescue (upper panel), a clear separation was seen between control and infested plants, which clustered mainly on the right and left side of the plot, respectively, whereas plants of different endophyte status within each damage treatment largely overlapped. For meadow fescue (lower panel), E- and E+ plants grouped separately while overlapping somewhat, with the strongest separation occurring between infested E- plants and any other treatment. Statistical details concerning compounds responsible for the clustering are given in [tables S1](#pone.0101331.s006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"} and [S5](#pone.0101331.s010){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}.](pone.0101331.g004){#pone-0101331-g004}\n\n【46】In both species, the compounds that contributed most strongly to the differences among VOC blends of differently treated plants were found to be the same compounds that had been demonstrated above to be significantly induced by endophytes, aphids and/or their interaction (通用删除8(英):<u>[Tables 1]</u>(#pone-0101331-t001){ref-type=\"table\"} and 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#pone-0101331-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). Among them, 1-octen-3-ol had the strongest discriminatory power in differentiating infested and control plants.\n\n【47】Aphid and plant growth {#s3d}\n----------------------\n\n【48】Endophyte presence reduced aphid performance as aphid colonies grown on E+ plants had much lower dry weights than on E- plants for both tall (F ~(2,\\ 18)~  = 12.19, P\\<0.001) and meadow fescue (F ~(1,\\ 12)~  = 52.37, P\\<0.001; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S4]</u>(#pone.0101331.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Interestingly, in tall fescue aphids performed better on ME- plants than on E+ plants but not as well as on E- plants, and ME- plants had lower dry mass than both E- and E+ plants (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S5]</u>(#pone.0101331.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). This suggests that either endophyte removal or heat treatment to remove endophytes or both may hinder plant growth and aphid performance. Additionally, short-term aphid infestation did not influence plant growth for either tall (F ~(2,\\ 54)~  = 0.92, P = 0.406) or meadow fescue (F ~(2,\\ 36)~  = 0.05, P = 0.955; 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure S5]</u>(#pone.0101331.s005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}).\n\n【49】Discussion {#s4}\n==========\n\n【50】Our results reveal that feeding by the generalist aphid R. padi induces VOC emissions in tall and meadow fescue that are known to serve in plant direct and indirect defences against herbivore attack. Most importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that Epichloë endophytes are capable of modifying both constitutive and aphid-induced VOC emissions of host grasses. Moreover, the two studied fescues differ substantially in VOC emission patterns in response to aphid infestation and endophyte infection.\n\n【51】Although intensively characterized in a range of plant species (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Hare1]), VOC profiles have rarely been studied in Festuca, particularly in response to herbivory. The only relevant study involves induced VOC emissions by tall fescue upon exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) [@pone.0101331-Yue1], a phytohormone widely used to mimic induced defence responses to leaf-chewing herbivores. Our results therefore expand upon previous findings, showing clear induction of VOC emissions from tall fescue, and also from meadow fescue, in response to the phloem-sucking herbivore R. padi. Compared to JA treatment, which increased amounts of several constitutive VOCs [@pone.0101331-Yue1], we found that aphid feeding on tall fescue enhanced emissions of fewer components. This comes as no surprise given that leaf-chewers (or JA application) and phloem-suckers activate JA and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways, respectively and that these two pathways often antagonize each other and elicit emissions of a different set of volatile compounds [@pone.0101331-Saikkonen3], [@pone.0101331-Ali1]. Additionally, phloem-suckers, which usually cause limited cell damage, do not elicit volatile responses as strongly as leaf-chewers [@pone.0101331-Babikova1], [@pone.0101331-Blande1]. Several compounds, including two β-ocimene isomers, were induced by aphid feeding in meadow fescue but not in tall fescue, suggesting that meadow fescue is more responsive than tall fescue when challenged by aphids. However, there was some commonality in the induced VOCs, most notably 1-octen-3-ol, which was the only de novo synthesized compound induced by aphid feeding and positively related to aphid density. 1-octen-3-ol is emitted by squash plants infected with powdery mildew (Podosphaera sp.), and is a particular component of 'mouldy odour' and attractive to mycophagous twenty-spotted ladybird beetles (Psyllobora vigintimaculata) [@pone.0101331-Tabata1]. This compound is also an induced volatile of Trifolium pratense after damage by Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars [@pone.0101331-Kigathi1]. Therefore, 1-octen-3-ol may serve as a component of multiple indirect defence responses.\n\n【52】Unlike herbivory, mechanical damage inflicted by single wounding events often triggers rapid VOC release, which then drops to the pretreatment level within a few hours (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Mithfer1]). However, in some cases VOC responses induced by mechanical damage may require days to appear [@pone.0101331-Karban1]. In line with these findings, our preliminary study with red fescue revealed a rapid rise and prolonged emission. Unexpectedly, in this study we did not detect induced VOC emissions in either tall or meadow fescue one day after mechanical wounding. However, we may have missed a rapid VOC response by providing a one-day recovery period following wounding before collecting VOCs. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that the speed and duration of VOC responses induced by mechanical damage may differ among plant species.\n\n【53】Interestingly, our study reveals that Epichloë endophytes affect both constitutive and aphid-induced VOC emissions of host grasses. In the absence of aphids, E. uncinata-infected meadow fescue had significant lower emission rates than uninfected counterparts, whereas E. coenophiala-infected tall fescue did not differ from uninfected plants. When subjected to aphid attack, endophyte-infected meadow fescue still released significantly lower amounts of VOCs, but infected tall fescue tended to increase VOC emissions after 12 days of continuous feeding. In particular, endophytes and aphids appeared to act synergistically to suppress production of the two dominant compounds (Z)-hexen-1-ol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate in meadow fescue but promote their release in tall fescue. The differences in aphid-induced VOC release between endophyte-free and infected plants remained pronounced even after accounting for potential effects of different extents of damage, suggesting that endophyte-mediated changes in host VOC release might occur regardless of intensity of herbivory. One caveat of our study is that even though single cultivars were used (Kentucky 31 of tall fescue; Kasper of meadow fescue), host genotype was not strictly controlled and may have influenced VOC emissions alone or interactively with endophytes.\n\n【54】In line with our findings, an early study with tall fescue has shown that E. coenophiala- infected plants did not differ in constitutive VOC emissions from uninfected counterparts, but doubled (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate emission in response to JA treatment while decreasing emissions of a few terpenoids such as (E)-β-ocimene [@pone.0101331-Yue1]. However, a recent study of perennial ryegrass has found greater quantities of both constitutive and pathogen-elicited VOC emissions emitted by E. festucae var. lolii-infected plants than uninfected counterparts [@pone.0101331-Paka1]. Together, all these studies suggest that endophyte-mediated adjustment of host VOC production may vary with the identity of Epichloë-grass symbiosis and the type of biotic stress.\n\n【55】Volatile compounds may act as plant defensive semiochemicals that disturb herbivore settlement and proliferation and/or recruit herbivores\\' natural enemies [@pone.0101331-Dicke1]--. For example, studies on plant-aphid-parasitoid interactions have revealed that 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate, (E)-β-caryophyllene and (E)-β-ocimene [@pone.0101331-Du1]--[@pone.0101331-Sasso1] can attract aphid parasitoids and linalool can directly repel aphids [@pone.0101331-Aharoni1], [@pone.0101331-Halbert1], while methyl salicylate seemingly acts in both ways [@pone.0101331-Sasso1], [@pone.0101331-Glinwood1], [@pone.0101331-Zhu1]. In previous and current studies, grass hosts have been found to change emission patterns of some of these compounds in response to Epichloë infection either alone or in conjunction with biotic stress. Therefore, it is likely that the altered volatile profiles may modify VOC-mediated multitrophic interactions. This hypothesis needs to be tested in future studies to disclose the ecological consequences of Epichloë-mediated change in host VOC emissions for herbivores, natural enemies, and thus plant fitness.\n\n【56】While our results show that Epichloë-mediated host VOC responses depend on endophyte and host species, the ecological and evolutionary processes that lead to such variation remain unclear and merit future study. As with the expression of constitutive and inducible plant defences, harbouring endophytes is costly because endophytes must procure all of their nutrients from the host, including precursors in the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids (e.g. [@pone.0101331-Clay1], [@pone.0101331-Saikkonen1]). Thus, evolutionary trade-offs may occur in Epichloë--grass symbioses. In other words, Epichloë-grass symbioses which have developed high levels of endophyte-derived resistance under natural or artificial selection may have evolved low levels of host defence, and vice versa. Our observation of Epichloë species related differences in host VOC responses partially support this idea. Specifically, the meadow fescue--E. uncinata symbiosis which has high endophyte-conferred constitutive defence [@pone.0101331-Wilkinson1], [@pone.0101331-Sullivan1], [@pone.0101331-Bultman1], [@pone.0101331-Sullivan2] released low amounts of VOCs by the host grass regardless of herbivore presence. By comparison, in the tall fescue--E. coenophiala symbiosis where E. coenophiala provides relatively low constitutive defence [@pone.0101331-Wilkinson1], [@pone.0101331-Sullivan1], [@pone.0101331-Bultman1], [@pone.0101331-Sullivan2], the host grass exhibited induced VOC responses in the presence of high aphid density.\n\n【57】In conclusion, our study has shown that Epichloë endophytes may modulate VOC responses of host grasses, with the sign and strength of such responses depending on the identity of the Epichloë--grass symbiosis. Our results illustrates the importance of assessing host plant volatiles and their impacts on herbivore host-searching behaviour to investigate alternative mechanistic links between Epichloë endophytes and herbivore responses. Given that both Epichloë endophytes and herbivores can manipulate their shared hosts in diverse ways and that endophyte-provided resistance to herbivores varies considerably among Epichloë--grass associations, Epichloë--mediated host VOC responses and their impacts on multitrophic interactions should be variable. Further studies with different Epichloë--grass associations would shed more light on endophyte-provided defence and its interaction with the host\\' own defence.\n\n【58】Supporting Information {#s5}\n======================\n\n【59】###### \n\n【60】Kinetics of VOC emissions from red fescue ( Festuca rubra ) following mechanical wounding.

Introduction {#sec1-jcm-08-01366}\n===============\n\n【1】Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity \\[[@B1-jcm-08-01366]\\]. It is now recognized as the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood \\[[@B2-jcm-08-01366]\\], and the prevalence of ADHD among school-age children may be as high as 5--10% \\[[@B3-jcm-08-01366]\\]. The identification of biomarkers for ADHD may assist in objective diagnosis, the monitoring of response to treatment and the prediction of outcomes \\[[@B4-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Neurotransmitters in the noradrenergic system or neurotrophin substrates have been proposed as potential biomarkers of ADHD \\[[@B5-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Notably, sex differences in clinical characteristics have been well established \\[[@B6-jcm-08-01366]\\], but whether biomarkers have sex-specific effects on susceptibility to ADHD remains unclear.\n\n【2】Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has an important role in neuronal survival and growth, serving a neurotransmitter modulator \\[[@B7-jcm-08-01366]\\]. BDNF is an important neurotrophin in the central nervous system, and is associated with neuronal plasticity, which is critical for learning and memory \\[[@B8-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Higher peripheral levels of BDNF have been linked to fewer behavioral problems and clinical symptoms in preschool children with neuro-developmental disorders \\[[@B9-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Both animal models and human studies suggest that BDNF Val66Met genotype is associated with ADHD \\[[@B10-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Studies suggest that dysfunctional BDNF is a possible contributor to the pathology and symptoms of ADHD \\[[@B11-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Nonetheless, the findings about whether peripheral levels of BDNF can serve as reliable ADHD biomarkers were inconsistent among studies \\[[@B12-jcm-08-01366],[@B13-jcm-08-01366],[@B14-jcm-08-01366],[@B15-jcm-08-01366],[@B16-jcm-08-01366]\\]. One possible explanation for this inconsistency is the moderating effect that gender has on the relationship between BDNF and ADHD. An animal study has established that only male rats, but not female ones, exhibit falling BDNF expression in the postnatal cerebellum \\[[@B17-jcm-08-01366]\\]. A recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that BDNF levels are significantly higher in males with ADHD than in male controls \\[[@B14-jcm-08-01366]\\], but the same difference was not observed in girls. Sex-related hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors interact with BDNF signaling at various levels and in complex ways between genders \\[[@B18-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Therefore, we supposed that the relationship between BDNF levels and ADHD characteristics may differ between boys and girls.\n\n【3】Contactin-1, also known as CNTN1, is a protein that is encoded by the CNTN1 gene. The CNTN1 gene is a member of the subfamily of neural immunoglobulin (Ig) and is involved in the formation of axon connections in the developing nervous system \\[[@B19-jcm-08-01366]\\]. CNTN1 is a novel adhesion protein involved in neuronal migration that regulates the process formation of newborn cortical neurons \\[[@B20-jcm-08-01366]\\]. BDNF also has a role in regulating synaptic functions, by enhancing neuronal excitability through GABAergic neurons \\[[@B21-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Therefore, CNTN1 and BDNF both facilitate neuron axons guidance \\[[@B22-jcm-08-01366]\\], and may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Other members of the Ig subfamily, contactin-4, -5, and -6 (CNTN4, -5, and -6), participate in pathways that are important for brain development \\[[@B23-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Recent genetic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders have identified CNTN4, -5, and -6 as candidate genes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and ADHD \\[[@B24-jcm-08-01366]\\]. However, whether peripheral levels of CNTN1 are associated with ADHD had yet not been examined.\n\n【4】We hypothesize that BDNF and CNTN1 are involved in ADHD susceptibility, and patients with ADHD may exhibit lower BDNF/CNTN1 levels than control subjects. Furthermore, we have reasoned that the relationship of BDNF/CNTN1 levels and ADHD characteristics may differ between boys and girls. To elucidate the role of BDNF and CNTN1 in susceptibility to ADHD, a cross-sectional study was carried out to examine whether levels of BDNF and CNTN1 differ between ADHD patients and healthy controls. Additionally, whether the relationships among BDNF, CNTN1, and ADHD characteristics differ between genders.\n\n【5】2. Material and Methods {#sec2-jcm-08-01366}\n=======================\n\n【6】2.1. Study Participants {#sec2dot1-jcm-08-01366}\n-----------------------\n\n【7】The Institutional Review Board at Chang Gung Hospital in Taiwan approved the research protocol. Patients with ADHD being treated in the outpatient Department of Child Psychiatry at Chang Gung Children's Hospital in Taiwan were recruited for this cross-sectional study and informed consent was obtained in writing from all participants or their guardians. The inclusion criteria were as follows; (a) clinical diagnosis of ADHD by a senior child psychiatrist based on the DSM-IV-TR through structured interviews using the Chinese epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-E) \\[[@B25-jcm-08-01366]\\]; (b) between the ages of six and 16 years old; and (c) a drug-naïve patient or a patient with a diagnosis who had not taken an ADHD medication for at least six months. Any patient with a history of comorbid autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, epilepsy, or brain injury was excluded.\n\n【8】The healthy control subjects were recruited from the school in the same catchment areas through advertising or were the healthy classmates of ADHD patients. The control group included children without ADHD or other psychiatric disorders (such as intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorders, major depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, substance dependence, epilepsy, or severe head trauma) from the same catchment area as the non-control patients to serve as healthy controls. Overall, a total of 136 patients with ADHD (108 boys and 28 girls) and 71 healthy controls (45 boys and 26 girls) were recruited for this investigation.\n\n【9】2.2. Laboratory Testing to Determine BDNF and CNTN1 Levels {#sec2dot2-jcm-08-01366}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Blood samples were collected at 8:00 a.m. from participants who had fasted overnight. The BDNF and CNTN1 levels in plasma samples were obtained using the Human Magnetic Luminex Assay (LXSAHM; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The assays were conducted according to the protocol that was provided by R&D Systems. Briefly, a 96-well filter-bottom microplate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was blocked for 10 min with assay buffer (R&D Systems). To generate standard curves, four-fold serial dilutions of standards were prepared in serum diluent (R&D Systems). 50 μL of standards and plasma samples (1:2 dilution) were added to the wells, which contained 50 μL of the immunobead mixture. The microplate was incubated for 40 min at room temperature in the dark and then washed three times with washing buffer (R&D Systems) using a vacuum manifold. A mixture of biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (R&D Systems) was added. After 40 min of incubation and three washes, streptavidin-phycoerythrin (R&D Systems) was added. After 10 min, the immunobeads were washed three times, resuspended in 50 μL assay buffer, and analyzed using the Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\n【11】2.3. Clinical Measurements {#sec2dot3-jcm-08-01366}\n--------------------------\n\n【12】A senior psychiatrist interviewed the ADHD patients and healthy control subjects using the K-SADS-E diagnostic tool. An experienced child psychologist conducted a neurocognitive assessment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV Scale (SNAP-IV) parent form and SNAP-IV teacher form were completed by each patient's parents and teacher of both ADHD patients and controls, respectively.\n\n【13】The WISC-IV is an individually administered and norm-referenced tool for determining the intelligence of children from 6 to 16 years old \\[[@B26-jcm-08-01366]\\]. The WISC-IV comprises ten core and five supplemental subtests. The core subtests address the following four factor indices; Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), and Processing Speed Index (PSI). The Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) is obtained using the 10 core subtests. Both the factor indices and the FSIQ have a population mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 \\[[@B27-jcm-08-01366]\\].\n\n【14】The SNAP-IV is a 26-item questionnaire that is completed by parents or teachers and used to evaluate ADHD symptoms and severity \\[[@B28-jcm-08-01366]\\]. The 26 items comprise 18 that are related to ADHD symptoms (nine concerning inattention and nine concerning hyperactivity/impulsivity) and eight for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, as defined by the DSM-IV. Each item is scored from zero to three on a Likert scale.\n\n【15】The CPT is a 14-minute computerized test that primarily assesses attention and impulse control \\[[@B29-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Briefly, participants are required to respond to stimuli on a computer screen by pressing a space bar in response to every letter except the letter 'X'. Of the various dependent measures, omissions, commissions, hit reaction time, and detectability were the most commonly used indexes and have been used in previous studies \\[[@B30-jcm-08-01366]\\]. A lower T-score in the CPT indicates better performance, and this score is commonly used in analysis. The Confidence Index (percentile) incorporates all relevant CPT data and is a numerical value up to 100 that specifies the probability that a significant attention problem exists \\[[@B31-jcm-08-01366]\\].\n\n【16】2.4. Statistical Analysis {#sec2dot4-jcm-08-01366}\n-------------------------\n\n【17】Data were analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS, version 21.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and variables are presented as either mean (with standard deviation) or frequency. Categorical variables were compared between ADHD patients and healthy controls using either the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, depending on the number of cases. Continuous variables were shown as mean (standard deviation), median, and first- and third-quartiles. Mann--Whitney U test was used to determine the differences in BDNF and CNTN1 levels. The Spearman's correlation was used to analyze the relationships between BDNF and CNTN1 levels, clinical symptoms and neuropsychological functions. Two-tailed p values of \\< 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing in the correlation matrix.\n\n【18】3. Results {#sec3-jcm-08-01366}\n==========\n\n【19】The study sample comprised 136 patients with ADHD (79.4% were boys, mean age: 8.8 years) and 71 healthy controls (77.6% were boys, mean age: 9.6 years). In the sex-stratified analysis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#jcm-08-01366-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), the girls with ADHD formed the youngest group, and the healthy control girls were the oldest group. The boys and girls with ADHD had lower scores on all WISC-IV indices than the control boys and girls, respectively. The ADHD group exhibited more severe clinical ADHD symptoms (based on parent-rated and teacher-rated inattention scores, hyperactivity/impulsivity scores, and oppositional SNAP-IV scores) and performed worse in the CPT, median and first (25%) and third quartiles (75%) of demographic data (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table S1]</u>(#app1-jcm-08-01366){ref-type=\"app\"}).\n\n【20】The plasma levels of BDNF and CNTN1 in all ADHD patients did not differ significantly from those in the control group (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#jcm-08-01366-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, the boys with ADHD had higher BDNF levels than the healthy controls boys (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#jcm-08-01366-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}A) (ADHD: 4.57 ± 4.43 ng/mL vs. Controls: 3.17 ± 3.84 ng/mL, p = 0.027, Standardized Test Statistic = 2.210) and the girls with ADHD had lower BDNF levels than the healthy control girls (ADHD: 3.01 ± 2.99 ng/mL vs. Controls: 4.69 ± 4.36 ng/mL, p = 0.014, Standardized Test Statistic = 2.458). The gender-stratified analysis revealed no significant differences in CNTN1 levels (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#jcm-08-01366-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}B) between patients and controls.\n\n【21】通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#jcm-08-01366-t002){ref-type=\"table\"} presents the correlation between BDNF and CNTN1 levels and ADHD clinical symptoms in boys (N = 153) and girls (n = 54), separately. In boys, BDNF levels were negatively correlated with FSIQ (r = −0.197, p = 0.015) and VCI (r = −0.255, p = 0.002), and positively correlated with ODD symptoms as rated by parents (r = 0.167, p = 0.041) and teachers (r = 0.213, p = 0.011). In girls, BDNF levels negatively correlated with inattention symptoms rated by parents (r = −0.322, p = 0.019) and omission score in the CPT (r = −0.356, p = 0.008). Among both boys and girls, levels of CNTN1 were not significantly related with either ADHD clinical symptoms or neuropsychological functions. However, if we used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing in the correlation matrix, none of the results maintained their significance.\n\n【22】4. Discussion {#sec4-jcm-08-01366}\n=============\n\n【23】The main finding in this study is that BDNF levels in ADHD boys exceeded those in control boys, but BDNF levels in ADHD girls were lower than those in control girls. CNTN1 levels did not significantly differ between patients and controls, whether they were boys or girls. BDNF levels were negatively correlated with intelligence in boys, but negatively correlated with the omission errors of girls in the CPT.\n\n【24】Several case-control studies have indicated that the peripheral BDNF levels in both serum and plasma do not differ significantly between patients with ADHD and controls \\[[@B13-jcm-08-01366],[@B15-jcm-08-01366],[@B16-jcm-08-01366]\\]. A recent meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between peripheral BDNF levels in ADHD patients and control groups \\[[@B14-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Our findings are therefore consistent with earlier investigations. However, Zhang et al. showed that according to a sex-stratified analysis, BDNF levels are significantly higher in males with ADHD than in controls \\[[@B14-jcm-08-01366]\\]. The findings herein support that result of Zhang et al. Furthermore, the potential relationship between BDNF, neuropsychological function, and behavioral symptoms was analyzed in the present study. We found that children with greater oppositional defiant symptoms had higher BDNF levels. One possible explanation for the positive correlation between BDNF levels and ADHD severity among boys is that BDNF plays an important role in neuronal growth and plasticity, which is crucial for learning and memory \\[[@B7-jcm-08-01366]\\]. A previous brain imaging study revealed that ADHD patients that also had comorbid oppositional defiant disorder were related to volumetric reductions in the frontal lobes \\[[@B32-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Therefore, we hypothesize that BDNF may be compensatorily elevated to facilitate neurodevelopment among boys whose brain development is relatively immature. However, the mechanisms that underlie this role remain undetermined in this study and warrant further investigation.\n\n【25】The data herein reveal that BDNF levels in girls with ADHD were lower than in healthy controls. Among girls, BDNF levels were negatively correlated with omission errors associated with neuropsychological performance and showed a negative correlation between inattention symptoms. This finding demonstrates that BDNF may serve as a protective factor against ADHD among girls whereas the opposite is true for boys. The reasons for the contrary effects of BDNF on the risks of ADHD in boys and girls remain unclear. Sex-related hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors interact with BDNF signaling at various levels and in complex ways between genders \\[[@B18-jcm-08-01366]\\]. The results herein support a sex-specific relationship between peripheral blood BDNF levels and ADHD. Previous epidemiological studies have conclusively established that ADHD is a male-dominant neurodevelopmental disorder (The ratio of boys to girls with this disorder is in the range 2:1 to 9:1) \\[[@B6-jcm-08-01366]\\]. This sex-specific association is consistent with numerous other studies, which have suggested that many ADHD risk genes had sexually dimorphic effects \\[[@B33-jcm-08-01366]\\]. Previous investigations have suggested that the gene expression and activity of BDNF may be affected by the different hormonal environments of males and females, which would thus explain the sexually dimorphic effects of BDNF \\[[@B34-jcm-08-01366]\\].\n\n【26】CNTN1 is involved in the formation of axon connections in the developing nervous system \\[[@B21-jcm-08-01366]\\], and enhances neuronal excitability through GABAergic neurons \\[[@B22-jcm-08-01366]\\]. CNTN1, a cell adhesion molecule expressed in developing nervous systems, is vital for the neuronal developmental process formation of newborn cortical neurons, including neural cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and myelination \\[[@B20-jcm-08-01366]\\]. This study is the first to address the relationship between CNTN1 level and ADHD and hypothesize that CNTN1 may serve as a protective factor of ADHD. Nevertheless, we observed no significant relationship between CNTN1 level and ADHD in either boys or girls. This negative finding with regard to CNTN1 may be related to this study's low statistical power or the lack of the direct relationship between peripheral CNTN1 levels and ADHD phenotypes.\n\n【27】This study has limitations. First, it is a cross-sectional study. Although a relationship was found between peripheral BDNF levels and ADHD, causality cannot be determined. Second, our sample size was small, particularly with respect to females. As a result, the negative findings with regard to the female group may be related to low statistical power. In general, girls with ADHD are diagnosed slightly later than boys \\[[@B35-jcm-08-01366]\\]. However, in this study, the girls with ADHD had the youngest age among the four groups, which may indicate that the ADHD girls in our study may not be representative of the overall population. Third, the ages of the ADHD and control groups of both boys and girls were not perfectly matched. However, we did not have information about parental education, family socioeconomic status, year in school, and exercise. Although ANCOVA was used to eliminate the confounding effect of age, the results herein may be confounded by the characteristics of patient groups. Fourth, the BDNF and CNTN1 levels were measured in peripheral blood and the peripheral levels do not necessarily reflect the levels in CNS. Moreover, the polymorphisms of BDNF and CNTN1 genes may influence the effects of BDNF and CNTN1 levels. For example, several studies have implicated BDNF as a genetic risk factor for ADHD \\[[@B36-jcm-08-01366],[@B37-jcm-08-01366]\\]. A sex-specific relationship between the BDNF Val66Met genotype and plasma BDNF levels has also been observed in a Han-Chinese sample \\[[@B38-jcm-08-01366]\\]. However, we did not identify the genotypes of BDNF and CNTN1 genes in this study. Finally, if we adjusted for multiple testing in the correlation matrix with Bonferroni correction or if only ADHD patients were considered in the analyses, none of the significant results remained. The robustness of the relationships between BDNF levels and ADHD characteristics needs to be further investigated.\n\n【28】5. Conclusions {#sec5-jcm-08-01366}\n==============\n\n【29】The results herein suggest that BDNF may be involved in sex-specific susceptibility to ADHD. However, CNTN1 was not associated with ADHD pathophysiology. Whether peripheral BDNF levels serve as a potential biomarker for ADHD warrants further investigation in the future. A longitudinal study with a larger sample or an experimental study is required to elucidate the mechanism of the sex-specific relationship between BDNF and ADHD.\n\n【30】The authors would like to thank Wei-Tsun Soong for granting us the use of the Chinese version of the K-SADS and Shur-Fen Gau for granting our use of the Chinese version of the SNAP-IV.\n\n【31】The following are available online at <https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/9/1366/s1>, Table S1.

The immobilized preparation with 1280 U· g-1 used here was obtained by a method of purification and in situ immobilization where the crude intracellular lipase (cell homogenate) was subjected to partial purification by an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) consisting of 12% (w/w) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 13% (w/w) potassium phosphate (K2HPO4) and then in situ immobilization directly on diatomite from the top PEG-rich phase of ATPS. In this multi-step process, the ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) produced by lipase-mediated one-pot two-step chemo-enzymatic oxidation of cyclohexanone was directly subjected to in situ ring-opening polymerization (ROP) started by adding highly hydrophobic solvents. It is necessary to note that ε-CL synthesis and its subsequent ROP were catalyzed by the same lipase. The impact of various reaction parameters, e.g. solvent, cyclohexanone: hydrogen peroxide molar ratio, hydrogen peroxide forms and reaction temperature were investigated. Toluene was selected as a preferred solvent due to supporting the highest molecular weight (Mn = 2168) and moderate ε-CL conversion (65.42%). Through the optimization of reaction conditions, PCL was produced with a Mn of 2283 at 50 °C for 24 h. These results reveal that this lipase-mediated direct ring-opening polymerization of in situ formed ε-CL is an alternative route to the conventional synthesis of PCL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

As recently as 1950, urban areas were occupied by just 30% of the world's population. Today, 55% of people live in urban areas, with the proportion of people living in cities projected to be as high as 68% by 2050 \\[[@pone.0215485.ref001]\\]. In some regions, nearly all urban dwellers live in relatively high-density cities. But in others, a large proportion of human homes are at the margins of cities, in suburbs. Suburban development is the fastest growing anthropogenic land-use in the United States, expanding approximately seven- to ten-fold from 1950--2000 \\[[@pone.0215485.ref002]\\]. In line with national trends, this phenomenon is rapidly changing the southeastern United States, and models predict a continued growth in urban and suburban land-use of 101% to 192% over the next 50 years \\[[@pone.0215485.ref003]\\]. This land-use change due to anthropogenic development simultaneously disfavors species dependent on wild forests and grasslands, and favors species associated with urban areas, with suburban areas having the potential to act as an ecotone between urban and natural areas or to be completely distinct from natural areas. Among the species suburban and urban development may favor are arthropod species able to vector human pathogens \\[[@pone.0215485.ref004]\\].\n\n【3】Vector-borne diseases are serious public health threats, affecting more than one billion people yearly \\[[@pone.0215485.ref005]\\] and causing significant health impacts and economic burdens. Globally, mosquitoes are the arthropod disease vectors of greatest importance, transmitting pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality such as malaria, dengue virus, the recently emerging Zika virus, and filarial parasites \\[[@pone.0215485.ref006]\\]. In recent years, the geographic ranges of many vector-borne diseases have been expanding, increasing their already significant public health and economic impacts. Many factors are potentially contributing to the expansion of vector-borne disease ranges, such as human travel, transport of products, and global climate change, but also anthropogenic land-use changes, including urbanization \\[[@pone.0215485.ref007]\\]. Land use changes are of particular interest because of their ability to affect entire species assemblages. Changes in species assemblage can significantly affect the diversity and composition of mosquito species and their relative abundance, all of which have important implications for the spread of vector-borne diseases \\[[@pone.0215485.ref008]--[@pone.0215485.ref010]\\].\n\n【4】When natural landscapes are converted to suburban development, the accompanying land clearing and construction acts as a large disturbance event in the environment, impacting species assemblages. Some ecological studies suggests that intermediate levels of disturbance will result in increased diversity, both because disturbance introduces habitat heterogeneity and because disturbance can reduce the abundance of dominant species, increasing potential for invasion \\[[@pone.0215485.ref011]\\]. Within the urban setting, this equates to a theoretical diversity peak at intermediate levels of development, when the biotic limitations of rural areas and the physical limitations of urban areas are both alleviated \\[[@pone.0215485.ref012]\\]. Bird diversity in Twin Cities, Minnesota and Chicago, Illinois, for instance, is highest in moderately disturbed areas and then subsequently declines in highly urban areas \\[[@pone.0215485.ref013],[@pone.0215485.ref014]\\]. Similarly, butterfly diversity in an area of former oak woodlands in Palo Alto, California is lowest in the most urbanized areas, but in this case, even moderate levels of land development are detrimental to the natural species assemblage despite the overall intermediate disturbance diversity peak \\[[@pone.0215485.ref012]\\]. It is currently unclear whether the fine-scale heterogeneity in land-use associated with suburban development may lead to increases in mosquito biodiversity compared to that in natural woodlands or grasslands, as is seen with other species \\[[@pone.0215485.ref015]--[@pone.0215485.ref017]\\].\n\n【5】While understudied, the issue of mosquito species diversity in disturbed areas is important when considering the spread of vector-borne diseases. Vector competence for a given pathogen varies between species, leading to obvious implications for disease risk after community-level changes. Changes in the diversity or evenness of a community could affect vector-borne disease transmission if the species assemblage is shifted toward one dominated by mosquitoes with greater vectorial capacity. This is particularly relevant in suburban areas, as these disturbed environments place vector mosquitoes in close proximity and routine contact with hosts, including humans and their companion animals, which may increase risk for disease spread \\[[@pone.0215485.ref004],[@pone.0215485.ref018]\\].\n\n【6】Despite the rise in urbanization and its potential effects on mosquito communities, and a rapid increase in the number of studies of the effects of urbanization, few studies have considered the ways in which urbanization in general, and suburbanization in particular, influence the overall composition of mosquito communities (通用删除8(英):<u>[S1 Fig]</u>(#pone.0215485.s001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Where the influence of habitat on mosquito communities has been studied, it is most often in the context of exclusively natural habitats. For example, studies investigating the species assemblages present at wooded sites when compared to pasture or grassland sites have shown, perhaps unsurprisingly, that these habitats tend to sustain different mosquito species \\[[@pone.0215485.ref008],[@pone.0215485.ref019],[@pone.0215485.ref020]\\]. These links between mosquito species and habitat can arise because of adaptation to certain habitats through specificity in breeding sites or selectivity of use by adult mosquitoes, with fine scale (\\< 20m) variation in flying, host-seeking, and adult distribution \\[[@pone.0215485.ref021]\\]. In contrast to the amount of studies on mosquito assemblages in natural areas, those investigating similar questions in urbanized areas are less common. The studies that have considered primarily anthropogenic landscapes have tended to focus on species-specific distributions rather than communities as a whole (e.g. \\[[@pone.0215485.ref022]--[@pone.0215485.ref024]\\]). The few studies that have approached questions of community-level effects have had study sites that are vastly different from suburban areas in the United States (e.g. \\[[@pone.0215485.ref009],[@pone.0215485.ref025]\\]), leaving a gap in knowledge as to the effects of suburbanization on mosquito assemblages. Given that suburban areas are heterogeneous landscapes composed of grass, shrubs, trees, man-made structures, and perhaps surrounded by undeveloped natural areas, it is unclear whether mosquito assemblages present in these areas are more like those in fields, woodlots, or something unique to the suburban landscape.\n\n【7】Here we sought to characterize the changes to mosquito assemblages that occur after human driven land-use change in the context of suburban development, and, if such changes exist, the rate at which these changes occur post-development. We hypothesize that 1) suburban species assemblages are distinct from those in either undeveloped fields or undeveloped woodlots, and 2) the mosquito assemblage changes rapidly after the initial disturbance, approaching a suburban climax community through time. We tested these a priori predictions by establishing a chronosequence of suburban developments in which to sample mosquitoes, and comparing these species assemblages to those present in uncultivated field and woodlot areas.\n\n【8】Methods {#sec002}\n=======\n\n【9】Study overview {#sec003}\n--------------\n\n【10】We conducted this research in Wake County, North Carolina, USA. Wake County has a temperate climate and consists of a major urban center, Raleigh, and extensive suburbs, making it North Carolina's second most populous county with around 1 million residents \\[[@pone.0215485.ref026]\\]. To characterize the changes in mosquito assemblage that occur after human driven land-use change, we sampled mosquitoes in neighborhoods that were previously woodlots before development as well as neighborhoods that were fields prior to development, based upon historical aerial photos in Google Earth \\[[@pone.0215485.ref027]\\]. To compare the community assemblages to those in natural areas, we also sampled mosquitoes in natural woodlots and natural fields and grasslands as controls. To define the rate at which any changes to the mosquito assemblage occur after suburban development, we established a chronosequence by sampling in neighborhoods of various ages. This approach allowed us to determine the effects of approximate time scales within a two-year study.\n\n【11】Site selection and owner permission {#sec004}\n-----------------------------------\n\n【12】We identified candidate suburban neighborhoods using Google Earth current and historical imagery. We defined suburban neighborhoods as those consisting of detached single-family homes not located on a city block. Based on historical images, we categorized candidate neighborhoods in Wake County, NC by age and then classified them as previously fields or previously woodlots before development. To ensure that neighborhoods of various ages were being represented in the study, we created age categories to guide neighborhood selection: developed before 1993, between 1993 and 2002, between 2003 and 2007, between 2008 and 2012, and from 2013 to present. As changes in mosquito assemblage were predicted to happen fairly quickly after the initial disturbance, age category intervals were designed to be shorter when neighborhood development was closer to the present time, and longer when development was further removed. This allowed us to better capture periods of predicted rapid change in our chronosequence, while reducing sampling efforts in periods of less rapid change. Within the age categories, we selected neighborhoods from each previous land use (i.e. fields or woodlot). To ensure even sampling throughout Wake County, we split the county into geographical quadrants and selected neighborhoods across all quadrants in a haphazard manner. Because of the stringent requirements of neighborhood age, previous land use, and the necessity for homeowner permission for trapping, site selection was fairly limited, but each geographical quadrant had at least one site representative of each age category and previous land use. Overall, we selected 30 neighborhoods in 2015 that spanned the age categories and previous uses from across Wake County (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 1]</u>(#pone.0215485.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Within each neighborhood, we selected a single house for trap placement based on homeowner approval. We verified that the homeowner did not intend to perform any mosquito pesticide applications during the course of the study. Location of the trap within the yard was based entirely on homeowner preference, although the majority of homeowners elected to have the trap placed in their backyard near the property edge.\n\n【13】![Trapping sites within Wake County, North Carolina.\\\nAll 2015 sites denoted by a circle were also sampled in 2016, with the addition of 6 older suburban sites that were sampled exclusively in 2016, denoted by a triangle. Map created using public domain data from Wake County Government's Wake County GIS \\[[@pone.0215485.ref028]\\] and the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 TIGER/Line Shapefiles \\[[@pone.0215485.ref029]\\].](pone.0215485.g001){#pone.0215485.g001}\n\n【14】We also sampled undeveloped field and woodlot habitats as controls. We used three natural habitat sites: Schenck Memorial Forest at North Carolina State University (NC State), NC State's Equine Educational Unit, and NC State's Lake Wheeler Beef Unit. Each of these natural sites featured both field habitat and woodland habitat, and we placed traps at least 100m away from a habitat edge, consistent with previous findings of mosquito habitat fidelity \\[[@pone.0215485.ref021]\\]. As large undisturbed wild areas are not especially common around Raleigh, NC, we also sampled at smaller parcels of land consisting of natural woodlots and natural fields as control sites. Each of these smaller control sites had at least a 100m radius of non-developed natural land around the trap, again consistent with previous findings of mosquito habitat fidelity \\[[@pone.0215485.ref021]\\]. We sampled at six of these smaller wooded control sites and five smaller field control sites, giving us an overall total of 9 woodlot control sites and 8 field control sites.\n\n【15】We repeated the study in 2016, trapping at all of the same control sites and at different houses within the same neighborhoods that were sampled in 2015. Given that the oldest neighborhood that we sampled in 2015 was 40 years old, we also added six additional older neighborhoods that were developed between 50 and 102 years prior in 2016, resulting in a total of 36 neighborhoods sampled (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 1]</u>(#pone.0215485.g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and giving us an even broader time scale for chronosequence analysis.\n\n【16】Trapping {#sec005}\n--------\n\n【17】We used CDC light traps (JW Hock Co. Gainesville, FL) to sample mosquitoes throughout the course of the study. We removed the lights from the CDC light traps to reduce by-catch, and baited the traps with a small cooler containing 1kg of dry ice (solid CO~2~) to attract host-seeking mosquitoes. We set traps at each of the neighborhood and control sites for approximately 16 hours overnight biweekly from June through mid-October in 2015 and June through the end of October 2016.\n\n【18】Specimen identification {#sec006}\n-----------------------\n\n【19】We enumerated and identified all collected mosquitoes to species using Burkett-Cadena's Mosquitoes of the Southeastern United States \\[[@pone.0215485.ref030]\\] and Darsie and Ward's Mosquitoes of North America \\[[@pone.0215485.ref031]\\] dichotomous keys. We then preserved the mosquitoes in 95% ethanol for future reference.\n\n【20】Land-use classification {#sec007}\n-----------------------\n\n【21】We characterized site habitats by their current land use and vegetative structure within 100m radius of the trap. In the geographic information system (GIS) software ArcMap \\[[@pone.0215485.ref032]\\], we hand digitized the landscape using contemporary imagery and classified the resultant polygons as one of 9 categories: deciduous forests and evergreen forests (coarse vegetation), scrub/shrub (medium vegetation), grassland (fine vegetation), barren land (bare soil), buildings and pavement (impervious surfaces), cultivated crops, and water. We considered cultivated crops and grassland as field components and classified deciduous and evergreen forests as woodlot components. In the data analysis, we used field components, woodlot components, scrub/shrub, buildings, and pavement as predictor variables and the remaining land-use categories as covariables that were not of immediate interest.\n\n【22】Statistical analyses {#sec008}\n--------------------\n\n【23】As we sampled at the same neighborhoods and control sites in both years with the addition of six unique older neighborhoods in 2016, we chose to treat the two years separately rather than combining into a single dataset. This allowed us to avoid pseudoreplication of the overlapping neighborhoods between years, verify findings from the first year of trapping, and assess for the effects of adding in neighborhoods greater than 40 years old in the second year of trapping.\n\n【24】All statistical analyses were completed using the Vegan package in R 3.2.2 statistical software \\[[@pone.0215485.ref033]\\]. Species accumulation curves were performed to validate that there were enough trapping sites to ensure sufficient mosquito sampling. Recognizing that each technique for measuring diversity has limitations, we approached our analysis of mosquito diversity at each site holistically by measuring rarefied species richness, Pielou's evenness index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. We chose the Shannon-Wiener index due to its widespread use in comparable published studies, as well as its recognition as a valid expression of species diversity \\[[@pone.0215485.ref034]\\]. We calculated rarefied species richness, Pielou's evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index and compared these diversity measures between control woodlots, control field sites, and neighborhood age categories via ANOVA to test the hypothesis that natural sites differ from suburban sites with regard to their mosquito diversity. We performed linear regressions modeling the effects of neighborhood age, housing density, home price, and median household income on rarefied species richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Although we are primarily interested in the effects of neighborhood age, housing density and socioeconomic factors could also affect mosquito diversity and covary with neighborhood age. For housing density measurements, we simply counted the number of houses within 100m radius of the trapping site. To approach socioeconomic status, we acquired median household income data by census tract from the 2013 American Community Survey via the United States Census Bureau's Census Explorer tool \\[[@pone.0215485.ref035]\\]. Recognizing that census tracts are much larger than a given neighborhood, we also approached socioeconomic status at the neighborhood scale by calculating the average estimated home price of the trapping site and its two nearest neighbors using Zillow \\[[@pone.0215485.ref036]\\], then normalized all values to the average home price in Wake County \\[[@pone.0215485.ref037]\\]. We calculated variance inflation factors to assess for collinearity between neighborhood age, housing density, and both measures of socioeconomic status.\n\n【25】We also performed Partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis (PCCA) in R to investigate the relationship between land-use classification and mosquito assemblages for a given site. PCCA is a method for exploring relationships between two multivariate sets of variables measured on the same individual \\[[@pone.0215485.ref038]\\]. Here, the individual on which we are measuring our variables is trapping site, and the two multivariate sets of variables are the mosquito species assemblages and the GIS habitat classifications of the land use and vegetative structure around the trapping site. This approach allows us to summarize the relationships between these factors using a lesser number of statistics while preserving the main facets of the relationship. Utilizing the GIS land use classifications described above, we used field components, wood components, scrub/shrub, buildings, and pavement as predictor variables in the PCCA analysis, given our a priori assumptions of their effects on mosquito habitats. We controlled for the barren land and permanent water components by treating them as covariates, as their effects were presumed to be minimal when compared to the other land use classification categories. We plotted the CCA axis values against neighborhood age for each of the suburban sites to visualize the effect of neighborhood age in conjunction with the site's land-use structure and mosquito species assemblage. To complement the PCCA, we also performed analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity to compare the community composition between suburban, field control, and wood control sites. Finally, we utilized similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) to evaluate the contribution of individual species to the overall Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.\n\n【26】Results {#sec009}\n=======\n\n【27】The species accumulation curves appeared to reach an asymptote for both years, indicating that our trapping sites were adequate to sufficiently sample mosquitoes in this area (通用删除8(英):<u>[S2 Fig]</u>(#pone.0215485.s002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). In total, we trapped 22 species of mosquitoes (out of 28 known to be historically present in Wake County, NC \\[B. Byrd, personal communication, February 8, 2019\\]) and a total of more than 10,000 individuals. In 2015, we trapped a total of 20 species and 4269 individual mosquitoes, 47.1% of which were the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, an invasive species in the U.S. Similar numbers were seen in 2016, with 19 total species and 5975 total individuals, 38.1% of which were our most commonly trapped species, Ae. albopictus.\n\n【28】Two trapping sites in 2015, one suburban site and one field control site, were subjectively different from the other sites. The suburban site's trap had been placed close to the home's HVAC unit at the owner's request, deviating from the typical back-of-yard placement at other suburban sites. The field site was agricultural land as opposed to the other field controls, which were pasture or unused land. In 2016, one field control site suffered from loss of the land owner's trapping permission after a single trap night. These three sites yielded fewer than 10 total individuals across the entire summer's trapping efforts. All of the aforementioned factors could have resulted in lower mosquito yields and made the sites sufficiently different for exclusion, so the three sites were excluded from further analysis.\n\n【29】Rarefied species richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity all differed significantly when comparing the natural sites to the suburban sites grouped according to their age categories in 2015 and in 2016. In 2015, the suburban neighborhood age categories differed only among themselves with regard to all diversity measures, and were not significantly different from either of the natural categories (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 2]</u>(#pone.0215485.g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The overall model for rarefied richness was significant (p = 0.013, df = 6, F = 3.156), with the oldest suburban neighborhoods being significantly different from the two youngest age categories. No significant differences found between suburban neighborhoods and control sites. Despite the overall model being significant (p = 0.032, df = 6, F = 2.614), none of the categories were significantly different in their evenness after multiple comparison correction. The two oldest suburban age categories significantly differed from the youngest suburban category with regard to Shannon-Wiener diversity (overall model p = 0.007, df = 6, F = 3.561). Again, no significant differences were found between suburban neighborhoods and control sites. However, in 2016, the oldest neighborhood age category (pre-1993 development) significantly differed from both the natural field and the natural woodlots with regard to all three diversity measures (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 3]</u>(#pone.0215485.g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Various suburban age categories differed when compared with other suburban age categories with their rarefied richness, but of interest is the significant difference between the oldest suburban age category and both the field and wooded control sites (overall model p \\< 0.001, df = 6, F = 8.173). As with rarefied richness, evenness significantly differed between the oldest suburban sites and both of the control categories, as well as between various of the suburban age categories (overall model p \\< 0.001, df = 6, F = 5.25). Similar trends were seen with Shannon-Wiener diversity, with the oldest suburban sites significantly differing from both of the control categories being the comparison of interest (overall model p \\< 0.001, df = 6, F = 8.655).\n\n【30】![Comparison of diversity measures between control sites and suburban sites by age category in 2015.\\\nFor all boxplots, the median is represented by the thick black line.

As neighborhoods age, they become less species rich, less diverse, and species are less evenly distributed. Since Ae. albopictus made up a significant portion of the collected mosquitoes in both years, we performed a linear regression of Ae. albopictus abundance versus the primary determinant of diversity changes, neighborhood age. Aedes albopictus abundance increased as neighborhoods got older, with neighborhood age explaining 34.6% of variation in Ae. albopictus abundance in 2015 and 48.4% of variation in 2016 (p \\< 0.001, 通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 4]</u>(#pone.0215485.g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

ANOSIM confirmed that the mosquito assemblage significantly differed between suburban sites, field control sites, and wooded control sites in 2015 (p = 0.001, R = 0.3061) and in 2016 (p = 0.003, R = 0.2449). Aedes albopictus was the most influential species, contributing 30% to 45.8% of the overall community dissimilarity in 2015 and 27.6% to 34.9% in 2016, depending on the site comparison (suburban vs. wood, suburban vs. field, or wood vs. field).\n\n【47】Discussion {#sec010}\n==========\n\n【48】In comparing suburban neighborhoods with wooded and field sites, we found that the oldest neighborhoods have mosquito communities that are less species rich, less even, and less diverse when compared with either of the natural habitats. This decline in all diversity metrics as suburban neighborhoods age is concordant with a shift in species assemblage to a seemingly distinct suburban assemblage. The suburban assemblage is well correlated with the presence of impervious surfaces like pavement and buildings. Dominant among this suburban mosquito assemblage is the invasive species Aedes albopictus, whose abundance is positively correlated with neighborhood age.\n\n【49】Comparing diversity measures between control sites and suburban sites by their neighborhood age category did not yield significant differences between natural and suburban sites in 2015 (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 2]</u>(#pone.0215485.g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, when incorporating older neighborhoods with the 2016 data, significant differences were found between the oldest neighborhood age category and both field and woodlot control sites in terms of rarefied richness, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 3]</u>(#pone.0215485.g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This shows that mosquito diversity in suburban neighborhoods becomes fundamentally different from that in undeveloped natural sites over time. Additionally, we performed linear regressions to assess the effect of neighborhood age, housing density, home price, and income on our three diversity measures. Variance inflation factors were less than 1.5 for all predictors across both years, indicating that there is not significant concern for collinearity among neighborhood age, housing density, home price, and median household income in the current study. Analysis of linear regressions revealed that neighborhood age was the only significant variable across both years for any diversity measure (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#pone.0215485.t001){ref-type=\"table\"}), indicating that neighborhood age is the primary driver of mosquito diversity changes among suburban sites. However, a more appropriate way to analyze the changes that occur after suburban development is in looking beyond just diversity measures and instead to changes in species composition, which we accomplished with the PCCAs.\n\n【50】PCCA of the 2015 mosquito assemblage data shows that the mosquitoes collected at field control sites cluster together and are well defined by the field environment, with similar trends seen with the wooded control sites. In contrast, the mosquitoes collected at suburban control sites are best defined by pavement, buildings, and scrub/shrub environmental variables, suggesting that there is a distinct mosquito assemblage created as a result of common anthropogenic landscape components (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 5A]</u>(#pone.0215485.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Similar results are seen in the PCCA of the 2016 mosquito assemblage data. The wooded and field sites are similar in their mosquito assemblages and separate out well based on their distinctive environments, while the mosquito assemblages at the suburban sites are best defined by the buildings, pavement, and scrub/shrub environmental variables on the opposite CCA axis (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 5B]</u>(#pone.0215485.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}). When plotting CCA values against neighborhood age to explicitly investigate the effect of neighborhood age on mosquito communities, both CCA1 and CCA2 values for suburban sites in 2015 increased with neighborhood age toward a maximum value in the climax community (通用删除8(英):<u>[S4A and S4B Fig]</u>(#pone.0215485.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Taken together, these plots show that the oldest neighborhoods are in the upper right quadrant of the PCCA (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 5A]</u>(#pone.0215485.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}), correlating with the woods environmental variable on the CCA1 axis, and the pavement, buildings, and scrub/shrub variables on the CCA2 axis. For 2016, CCA1 values decreased with neighborhood age, while CCA2 values increased with neighborhood age (通用删除8(英):<u>[S4C and S4D Fig]</u>(#pone.0215485.s004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). This shows that the oldest neighborhoods in 2016 fall into the upper left quadrant of the PCCA (通用删除8(英):<u>[Fig 5B]</u>(#pone.0215485.g005){ref-type=\"fig\"}), again correlating with woods on the CCA1 axis, and suburban environmental factors on the CCA2 axis.\n\n【51】Overall, we found that as neighborhoods age, their mosquito assemblages shift somewhat from species associated with fields to those associated with woods. However, despite the potential shift from fine vegetation to coarse vegetation as a possible mechanism for this slight shift in mosquito assemblage as a neighborhood matures, pavement and buildings remain extremely important in determining suburban mosquito species assemblages with increasing neighborhood age. Indeed, the oldest neighborhoods did not recover their mosquito diversity and revert to a wooded species assemblage, but instead became increasingly uneven and less diverse, suggesting the suburban assemblage is different from that present in either natural habitat. A recent study has shown that urbanization caused not only functional diversity loss in bird communities, but also a loss of phylogenetic diversity, where evolutionary distinctiveness of species is lessened in urban areas \\[[@pone.0215485.ref039]\\]. It is hard to assess whether this holds for mosquito communities as mosquito phylogenies are currently greatly debated, but future work could investigate the potential for evolutionary impacts created by shifts to a suburban mosquito assemblage.\n\n【52】The most commonly encountered species in our study was Ae. albopictus, an invasive peridomestic species that thrives in artificial containers associated with anthropogenic land use \\[[@pone.0215485.ref040],[@pone.0215485.ref041]\\], particularly in suburban habitats. The differences in mosquito assemblages seen when transitioning from natural habitats to suburban habitats are primarily driven by changes in the abundance of Ae. albopictus. While Cx. erraticus abundance was also significantly correlated with neighborhood age across both of the years in this study, Ae. albopictus more profoundly affected the suburban mosquito assemblage, as evidenced by the large difference between the two species in numbers of individuals caught as well as the individual contributions by Ae. albopictus of 27.6% to 45.8% to the overall community dissimilarity between site types detected in the SIMPER analysis. In general, the most conspicuous pattern seen throughout the study is that as neighborhoods age, their mosquito communities become less species rich, less even, less diverse, and more dominated by the introduced species Ae. albopictus.\n\n【53】A possible mechanism for the abundance of Ae. albopictus in suburban areas is the increased availability of container larval habitat when compared to rural counterparts. Mosquitoes as a whole utilize a wide variety of larval habitats, with each individual species best adapted to a specific type of larval habitat. These aquatic habitats can include both permanent and temporary bodies of water such as ephemeral rainwater pools in fields and woodlands, tree holes, floodwater pools, ditches, ponds and marshes, sluggish streams and stream overflow pools, and man-made containers \\[[@pone.0215485.ref030]\\]. With the exception of man-made containers, most of these larval habitat types are likely decreasing in availability as land-use shifts from undeveloped to highly suburbanized. A recent study \\[[@pone.0215485.ref042]\\] found significant increases in 3^rd^ to 4^th^ instar Ae. albopictus larvae in suburban areas, and, given significant differences in container availability between urban and rural areas, the study concluded that urbanization generally increases larval habitats for Ae. albopictus. This could, however, be complicated by socioeconomic factors, as Ae. albopictus prevalence varies by level of abandonment, with poor neighborhoods having more of this species than wealthier neighborhoods even within highly urbanized city centers \\[[@pone.0215485.ref043]\\]. While neither home price nor median household income as proxies for socioeconomic status significantly affected mosquito communities in the present study, larval habitat may be a key factor in the abundance of Ae. albopictus that was observed in suburban areas \\[[@pone.0215485.ref042]\\]. Further research is warranted to categorize the differences in container larval habitat in developed areas versus natural areas, as this may help guide land development policies or homeowner behavior to benefit vector management.\n\n【54】Aside from their ability to easily exploit artificial containers, previous work has also shown that Ae. albopictus is an edge species, flourishing at ecotones between field and wooded habitats in natural areas \\[[@pone.0215485.ref021]\\]. Given that suburban areas are fragmented, heterogeneous landscapes where small plots of grasslands (lawns) are interspersed with trees and other medium to coarse vegetation, it is possible that suburban neighborhoods are functioning as large spaces of contiguous edge habitats, allowing edge species such as Ae. albopictus to thrive. This trend for an abundance of edge species in suburban areas has previously been documented in ants \\[[@pone.0215485.ref044]\\]. In that study, the authors found an increase in ant species diversity in suburban areas, which they attributed to the presence of forest species that are rare in fully open areas, but likely to be present at ecotones, which the suburban landscape created. Despite similar attribution of suburbia as an edge habitat causing changes in species diversity, results from the ant study \\[[@pone.0215485.ref044]\\] do not agree with the current study's findings of decreased overall diversity, likely because of the presence and dominance of the invasive Ae. albopictus. Previous studies in bird communities have found that as neighborhoods age, species diversity decreases and the community composition shifts from primarily native species to heightened dominance of invasive species \\[[@pone.0215485.ref014]\\]. This aligns with the prediction that in areas of anthropogenic disturbance, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis only holds when native species are considered, as invasive species thrive in disturbed areas \\[[@pone.0215485.ref045]\\]. Our findings also support this prediction, as demonstrated by the increasing dominance of Ae. albopictus as suburban neighborhoods age.\n\n【55】Our study was potentially limited by the choice to sample exclusively with a dry ice baited CDC light trap with the light removed. Each trapping method has its own biases, and one of the most prominent criticisms against the CDC light trap is its underrepresentation of Ae. albopictus \\[[@pone.0215485.ref046]\\]. Despite this bias against Ae. albopictus, it was our most abundant collected species. As traps were left overnight for approximately 16 hours, the 1kg of dry ice did not last throughout the entire trapping period. However, since traps were placed in the late afternoon, it is reasonable to assume that day-biting, crepuscular, and nocturnal mosquitoes were all potentially sampled for at least part of their host-seeking period before the dry ice sublimated. Removing the light had the benefit of decreasing bycatch, but it likely decreased the attractive range of the trap, particularly for light-attractive species. Since the attractive range of the CO~2~ baited CDC light trap is less than 15m even with the light intact \\[[@pone.0215485.ref047]\\], we anticipated our attractive power to be at a short range. Active attractive range of the CDC light trap is limited, but common mosquitoes in our study areas have been shown to disperse 300m to 1km \\[[@pone.0215485.ref048]\\], with Ae. albopictus having a daily mean distance traveled of 119m \\[[@pone.0215485.ref049]\\]. Housing density within 100m of a trap, and therefore within the average daily distance traveled by mosquitoes, ranged from 1 (in an area of active new construction) to 59 houses (in an extremely dense area with very small yards), with an average of about 20 houses per 100m across both years of trapping. This indicates that our adult trapping could have sampled from mosquitoes produced in larval habitats in many of the neighboring yards and surrounding areas, despite trapping at a single house per neighborhood. Although the limitations of trap choice and sampling scheme were not prohibitive in this study, future research could use varied mosquito sampling techniques and increased intra-neighborhood replication to further investigate questions of suburban succession of mosquito communities.\n\n【56】Previous studies have shown that mosquito assemblages in low diversity urban areas tend to be dominated by vector species of concern for human diseases \\[[@pone.0215485.ref050]\\]. Our results suggest that with steadily increasing land-use change and the particular fervor of suburban development, mosquito species assemblages will be altered and Ae. albopictus, a known vector, will become more common. These community level changes can significantly alter vector-borne disease risk for many pathosystems. Aedes albopictus readily bites humans, and is a competent vector of myriad pathogens of global human health concern, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus \\[[@pone.0215485.ref041],[@pone.0215485.ref051]\\], as well as pathogens of focal concern in North Carolina, including La Crosse virus \\[[@pone.0215485.ref052],[@pone.0215485.ref053]\\]. The overall community simplification and increasing abundance of Ae. albopictus in highly suburbanized areas make human-vector interactions more likely, heightening the potential for transmission of these concerning vector-borne diseases through both greater vector population size alone, and an increase in host biting rate due to proximity for contact \\[[@pone.0215485.ref054]\\]. In light of the overwhelming success of Ae. albopictus in established suburban areas, further research is warranted to elucidate how to mitigate the potentially devastating effects of suburban development favoring competent vector species.\n\n【57】Supporting information {#sec011}\n======================\n\n【58】###### Trends in research on mosquito diversity changes during urbanization.\n\n【59】Number of peer-reviewed publications by year on topics \"urbanization\" and \"diversity,\" \"urbanization\" and \"mosquito,\" as well as \"urbanization\" and \"mosquito\" and \"diversity.\" Citation reports accessed from Web of Science Core Collection on September 3, 2018.\n\n【60】(TIF)\n\n【61】###### \n\n【62】Click here for additional data file.\n\n【63】###### Species accumulation curves based on random sampling.\n\n【64】Species accumulation curves for (A) the 2015 data and (B) the 2016 data.

{"seq_id": "87cbf1ca-7d79-4079-8247-e56378172704", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\n【1】Over the past 15 years extensive literature has described a relationship between grip strength and various functional, clinical, psychological or psychosocial parameters in different populations, particularly in elderly people \\[[@CR1]\\]. Measurement of maximal grip strength (MGS) is an essential element to follow people during growth, aging, injury, rehabilitation, training or therapeutic trials. Its measurement is performed using dynamometers, which estimate the muscle strength primarily generated by the flexor muscles of the hand and the forearm. Different types of dynamometers are available, with such devices classified as hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical and electronic \\[[@CR2]\\]. These dynamometers vary in terms of their mechanism, performance, display mode and energy supply.\n\n【2】The Jamar dynamometer is the most widely reported device used to measure grip strength \\[[@CR3]--[@CR10]\\]. Eighty percent of occupational therapy schools and clinics in the United States use the Jamar dynamometer as their usual instrument to assess grip strength \\[[@CR2]\\]. The Jamar has many useful features for routine screening as well as in the evaluation of hand trauma and disease. The Jamar displays grip force in both pounds and kilograms, with a maximum of 200 lb (90 kg). It has a peak-hold needle that automatically retains the highest reading until reset. The Jamar test is isometric, with no perceptible motion of the handle, regardless of the grip strength applied. The handle can be adjusted for different size in order to fit for individual use. The Jamar dynamometer presents good inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability \\[[@CR11]\\]. The American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT) has recommended the Jamar dynamometer as the gold standard, leading to its widespread use in clinical practice and research \\[[@CR12]\\].\n\n【3】However, the Jamar \\\"may not be the most appropriate for all patient populations\\\" \\[[@CR13]\\]. This instrument is not consistent for use in people with weak strength and the resolution of the Jamar is too large to detect small changes in strength \\[[@CR14]\\]. Massy-Westropp et al. \\[[@CR15]\\] observed that 18 of their subjects (representing nearly 15 % of 121 patients tested) could not be assessed by the Jamar, but their grip strength was detectable by a digital device (Grippit). Still, for very weak people, a reliable dynamometer was required. This was the reason for developing the MyoGrip, an innovative dynamometer presenting high metrological performances.\n\n【4】The objectives of this study were 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to validate an innovative hand grip dynamometer from a metrological point of view, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to establish normative data for grip strength using this dynamometer, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> to assess the reliability of measurements, 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> to compare the results with those of the Jamar as a \\\"gold-standard\\\", and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> to establish predictive equations for MGS from a population of healthy subjects.\n\n【5】Methods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n【6】Participants {#Sec3}\n------------\n\n【7】Healthy subjects, male and female, aged from 5 to 80 years old were recruited by advertisements in newspapers, websites, and posters. Exclusion criteria were any neurological, neuromuscular or other disorders that could affect muscle strength, any history of injury, disease, pain or discomfort involving the upper limbs in the last two years, and practice of a sport at a national level. Subjects were informed about the terms of the experimental protocol and procedures before giving their written consent. The protocol (namely MyoTools) was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (CPP-Ile de France VI) and aimed to assess muscle strength in several muscle functions (hand grip, wrist extension and flexion, ankle flexion and extension). All subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the measurement sessions.\n\n【8】Anthropometric measurements {#Sec4}\n---------------------------\n\n【9】The height and weight of the subjects were recorded as well as an estimation of the percentage of body fat mass using an impedance metric scale (Tanita TBF-543). Anthropometric hand data were measured by the experimenter using a standard 1000-mm tape measure. The circumference of the forearm was defined as the perimeter of the largest part of the forearm, located over the bulk of the brachioradialis muscle, at the proximal quarter of the whole forearm length (Fig. [1a](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The circumference of the hand (C~hand~) was measured as the perimeter of the middle part of hand, located at the two major transverse palmar creases (\\\"heart line\\\" and \\\"head line\\\") (Fig. [1b](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Hand length was defined as the distance from the tip of the middle finger to the midline of the distal wrist crease (Fig. [1c](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). All anthropometric data were measured to the nearest millimetre with the forearm and hand in an outstretched and supinated position. Dominant side was defined as the hand with which the subject writes.Fig. 1Measurements of anthropometric characteristics of hand and forearm including forearm circumference (a), hand circumference (b) and hand length (c). The measurements were performed to the nearest millimeter by means of a supple tape measure. Strict anatomical landmarks were used to correctly position the tape\n\n【10】Dynamometer description {#Sec5}\n-----------------------\n\n【11】The Myogrip dynamometer (Ateliers Laumonier, France) is an isometric electronic device specifically developed for measuring grip strength in weak patients (Fig. [2a](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). It can directly display strength on its screen or be connected to a computer either by wireless, RS232 or BNC connections. Handle size is adjustable in a continuous way. It measures force in kg. It is calibrated on consecutive linear segments to compensate possible non-linear behaviour on the full nominal scale (90 kg). The resulting accuracy reaches 50 g on the whole measurement range with a 10 g resolution. To the best of our knowledge, the metrological performances of this innovative dynamometer are unique.Fig. 2MyoGrip dynamometer (a) and measurement positioning (b). The evaluator maintained the wrist of the subject to control possible compensatory movements\n\n【12】Calibration quality control {#Sec6}\n---------------------------\n\n【13】Devices were checked using standardized operating procedures for accuracy, hysteresis and repeatability. The procedure was adapted from the ISO 17025 norm. Twelve weights using M3 class masses were used for checking the calibration (0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 30, 50 kg). Six MyoGrip devices and two Jamar devices were checked for calibration using this procedure. The devices were suspended to a bracket and the masses were directly applied on the handle. The Jamar was unable to accurately detect forces below 5 kg.\n\n【14】Experimental procedure {#Sec7}\n----------------------\n\n【15】The subjects were seated on a height-adjustable plinth in order to obtain a right angle at the hip, knee and ankle joints with the legs being vertical and feet flat on the ground (Fig. [2b](#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The subjects had their shoulders adducted and their testing arm close to their body, with their elbow in full extension.\n\n【16】Subjects were verbally encouraged to produce their maximal grip strength (MGS). Two trials were first recorded, consisting of a 2-4-second maximal contraction, with a 30-second rest period between each trial. If the relative difference between these two MGS was within 10 %, no additional trial was required. If not, additional trials were proposed until two reproducible MGS were obtained. The maximal value of the two reproducible trials was retained for analyses. The contralateral side was then tested according to the same procedure. The first tested side (i.e. right or left) was random.\n\n【17】A subgroup of subjects agreed to return to retest their grip strength. The experimental conditions were the same as in the first session. The evaluator was either the same or another evaluator trained in the experimental procedures. Three evaluators performed the measurements for reliability assessment. The retest session was performed at least one day after the first session or planned within the next 3 months (mean: 31 days).\n\n【18】Jamar and Myogrip devices were checked for calibration before the recording period.\n\n【19】Statistical analyses {#Sec8}\n--------------------\n\n【20】Norms were established in kg by age group categories of five years for younger subjects up to 20 years old and then by age groups of 10 years. In order to decide whether norms should be established according to the side tested or to the dominant side, the MGS values between the right and left sides were compared taking into account the dominance effect. The MGS values between the dominant and non-dominant sides in both right-handed and left-handed groups were compared by means of a paired Student t-test.\n\n【21】The difference between test and retest sessions was evaluated by taking into account the rater effect and the side effect for each function using a repeated measurements analysis of variance. The standard error of measurement, the coefficient of variation (CVar) and the limits of agreement according to Bland and Altman \\[[@CR16]\\] were calculated. Correlation between MGS obtained by the MyoGrip and the Jamar dynamometers was tested using a correlation analysis (Pearson). To assess reliability within and between dynamometers, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC~2,1~) was computed as a single measure ICC with a two-way random-effect model (absolute agreement). The ability of the device to discriminate between two measurements was computed as the smallest detectable difference (SDD) according to Beckerman et al. \\[[@CR17]\\]. The agreement between dynamometers was also studied using Bland & Altman plots.\n\n【22】Predictive analyses were performed only on the subjects aged less than 60 to avoid the influence of aging on the model. Indeed, according to norms (e.g. \\[[@CR18]\\]) and functional studies (e.g. \\[[@CR19]\\]), dynapenia becomes significant and accelerates after the age of 60. Stepwise linear regressions were performed to detect the best predicting variables for MGS. Variables tested were height, weight, age, sex, body mass index, percentage of body fat, hand circumference, hand length and forearm circumference. Since hand circumference was found to be the best variable in explaining inter-individual variance, various models using this variable alone were tested to define the best one in terms of explained variance. Predictive equations were applied to the subjects to compute predicted strength values. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (v19.0). The limit of significance for all tests was set at p \\< 0.05.\n\n【23】Results {#Sec9}\n=======\n\n【24】Subjects {#Sec10}\n--------\n\n【25】Three hundred and forty six subjects were evaluated: 58 children under 18 years (29 boys, 29 girls) and 288 adults (119 men, 169 women). Their main characteristics are presented in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}; 9.5 % of the subjects were left-handed.

A stepwise regression was first performed using the following variables: gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, fat mass percentage, hand length, hand circumference and forearm circumference. For both the MyoGrip and the Jamar dynamometers, the first variable chosen by the regression process was hand circumference as the main explanatory variable (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#Tab5){ref-type=\"table\"}). Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#Fig6){ref-type=\"fig\"} illustrates the clear link between hand grip strength and hand circumference. Adding other variables did not add significant improvement to the regression-based model. Thus, hand circumference was used as a single variable and several models were tested (linear, quadratic, power, growth, exponential) in order to decide which was the best one. The best curve fit was obtained using a power equation.Table 5Results of the stepwise multiple regression (MyoGrip dynamometer) and simple correlations between maximal grip strength and variablesVariables in modelCorrelationFCorrelationp Intercept974.9 Hand circumference0.8852080.80.884\\<0.001Variables not in modelPartial correlationF Sex0.25038.4NA Age−0.17919.10.373\\<0.001 Weight−0.0320.60.744\\<0.001 Height0.19121.90.805\\<0.001 BMI−0.18019.40.464\\<0.001 % fat mass−0.33070.3−0.188\\<0.001 Forearm circumference0.1147.50.804\\<0.001 Hand length0.16516.20.834\\<0.001Fig. 6Relationship between grip strength and hand circumference.

A single regression-based predictive equation can be used for men and women and for children and adults. This may be highly useful when comparing individuals. The reasons and applications of such a relationship have already been discussed previously \\[[@CR20]\\].\n\n【43】The development of a new dynamometer was motivated by the fact that none of the hand grip dynamometers on the market were adapted to very weak patients. Thus patients suffering from some disabling disorders such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) or Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) could not be reliably be evaluated as devices were not adapted to their weakness. Moreover, according to our own experience, the calibration of certain devices is not reliable and may be detrimental to the accuracy of the measure.\n\n【44】With regards to the Jamar dynamometer, MGS expressed by age range observed in the present study were consistent with the normative values observed in previous studies either in adults \\[[@CR18], [@CR21]--[@CR24]\\] or in children \\[[@CR25], [@CR26]\\]. The right-handed subjects were significantly stronger on their right side, while no difference between sides could be detected in left-handed subjects. Brown et al. \\[[@CR27]\\] already observed that left-handers were stronger on their right side. This can be interpreted for left-handers as an adaptation to an environment that is generally conceived by and for right-handers, since preference and performance may not be correlated \\[[@CR27]\\]. As a limitation of the present norms, the age ranges are rather broad for children and adolescents as major changes may occur with increasing age and maturity. Unfortunately the number of participants was not statistically sufficient to further separate the subjects in smaller age ranges. Nonetheless predictive equations are a good replacement for norms.\n\n【45】These normative data have been obtained with an extended elbow position since Li et al. \\[[@CR28]\\] have shown that elbow position (flexed at 90° or extended) has no influence on MGS estimation. Also according to physiotherapist involved in clinical trials in our centre, the extended position of the elbow allows less compensatory movements and better detection of compensations. However the extended elbow position cannot always be reached, for example in patients presenting with contractures such as in DMD.\n\n【46】Reliability of MGS measurement was very good with standard error of measurement approximately 6.5 % for the MyoGrip and 7.5 % for the Jamar. According to our experience, maximal isometric grip strength is one of the muscle functions that presents with lower coefficients of variation compared to other muscle functions, probably due to the fact that the effort is easily understandable, even in children.\n\n【47】An excellent correlation was observed between the values measured by the two dynamometers. However, MGS estimates were statistically lower when measured by the MyoGrip compared to the Jamar. The mean difference was about 14 %. Comparing the Grippit to the Jamar, Massy-Westropp et al. \\[[@CR15]\\] observed that the Jamar yielded higher MGS by 22 N compared to the Grippit. Svantesson et al. \\[[@CR29]\\] were not able to observe similar divergences. In the present study, the Jamar produced higher MGS estimate of 4.1 kg on average compared to the MyoGrip. Both dynamometers were calibrated before evaluations using static weights, whilst a MGS measure is rather an explosive application of force. Thus one explanation of the overestimation of force could be that the needle of the Jamar goes a bit higher than the actual strength due to its inertia.\n\n【48】MGS can be used as a good predictor of total muscle strength in healthy children, adolescents and young adults \\[[@CR30]\\] and may be used as an overall health indicator in elderly people \\[[@CR31]\\]. However an absolute strength estimate is meaningless without considering individual stature. For ageing application, this is particularly true due to the intergenerational stature difference illustrated by smaller body dimensions including hand. If not taken into account, one may tend to overestimate the muscle strength loss with age. Thus an absolute measure of strength is difficult to interpret solely because the stature of the subject greatly influences muscle strength \\[[@CR32]\\]. Strength is roughly directly proportional to muscle mass and more specifically to the number of muscle fibres acting in parallel. In the absence of a reliable measure of muscle physiological cross-sectional area, an indicator of stature may be helpful to estimate what should be achieved with respect to the subject stature.\n\n【49】Relative values of MGS, expressed relatively to an index of stature, may help in better assessing the true loss of muscle quantity and/or quality. In the present study, hand circumference was found, as in a previous study in young adults \\[[@CR20]\\], the best predictor of MGS. Indeed, various measurements of hand size have already been shown to be excellent indices of the whole body stature (for instance hand length \\[[@CR33]\\]). Hand circumference seems to be a very good indicator of body stature, hence a good estimate of physical capacities. Hand size can be estimated using hand circumference (or hand width). Expressing MGS relative to an indicator of stature, such as hand circumference, may help in better situating individuals by minimizing the effect of their physical development as a confounding variable. It should be noted that the equations found in the present study are very close to those already described in a young adult population \\[[@CR20]\\].\n\n【50】Assessing weakness using predictive models may by very practical in use in an aging population or in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Other applications are widespread such as rehabilitation, return to work or sport, surgical success as well as in monitoring the effects of training. Again, using relative grip strength estimates is a more robust method to assess muscle weakness; an absolute strength value is less meaningful because it obviously depends on the subject\\'s stature.\n\n【51】Conclusions {#Sec17}\n===========\n\n【52】The MyoGrip is an innovative tool that has been designed for the assessment of very weak patients. Several studies have proved its usefulness and validity in DMD \\[[@CR34], [@CR35]\\] and SMA \\[[@CR36]\\]. The present article proposes norms for this particular dynamometer, demonstrates its validity compared to the gold-standard and proves its reliability. Using hand circumference only, a single predictive equation for men and women, adults and children can be used to compute the predicted theoretical maximal grip strength. According to our knowledge, the metrological features of the MyoGrip dynamometer are currently unique. Such a device is useful for the detection of MGS when high precision and accuracy are required.\n\n【53】MGS\n\n【54】:   Maximal grip strength\n\n【55】CVar\n\n【56】:   Coefficient of variation\n\n【57】ICC\n\n【58】:   Intraclass correlation coefficient\n\n【59】SDD\n\n【60】:   Smallest detectable difference\n\n【61】SEM\n\n【62】:   Standard error of measurement\n\n【63】Competing interests\n\n【64】JYH is the inventor of the MyoGrip device (patent pending).\n\n【65】Author\\'s contributions\n\n【66】JYH was the principal investigator of this study, designed and performed the experiments, analysed the data and drafted the manuscript.\n\n【67】This work was supported in part by the Association Française contre les Myopathies.

In addition, we examined the development of two different classes of transmembrane receptor proteins, the Trk family of tyrosine kinases and neurotrophin receptor p75 immunoreactivities. GAP-43-positive nerves were first detected in the bladder at embryonic day (E) 16. They were growing rapidly to the bladder dome and covered the whole bladder by E18. The density of GAP-43-containing nerves increased in the muscle layer by postnatal day (P) 0. Both Trk receptor-positive and p75 neurotrophin receptor-positive fibers were also first seen at E16. The number of Trk immunoreactive nerves reached a peak at E18, and then decreased over the following days. In contrast, p75-labeled fibers were abundant at E18-P14. There were few GAP-43 or neurotrophin receptor-positive fibers in the adult. GAP-43 immunohistochemistry provided us with a picture of innervation in the developing rat bladder. Furthermore, the demonstration of neurotrophin receptors positive fibers in the prenatal and early postnatal bladders suggests that neurotrophins may contribute to the development of the peripheral nervous system in the urinary bladder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The outcome of participants was assessed through clinic registers at the end of the study.\n\n【7】Results and discussion {#Sec3}\n======================\n\n【8】Baseline characteristics of the 129 included subjects are shown in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}. Two (1.6 %) patients were CrAg-positive. The first case was a 38-year old woman (CD4 cell count 171 cells/μL) who presented with headache, cough, dyspnoea, constitutional symptoms and neck stiffness. Lumbar puncture showed meningitis with detectable CrAg. Despite fluconazole treatment she died 17 days after diagnosis. The second case was a 38-year old man (CD4 cell count 250 cells/μL); at the time of testing he did not show any clinical symptoms or signs compatible with cryptococcosis.Table 1Baseline characteristics of included participantsTotal (n = 129)Age, median (IQR)35 通用删除7(英):<u>(28--39)</u>Female gender83 通用删除7(英):<u>(64)</u>Pregnant, n (% of females)1 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>Rural residence18 通用删除7(英):<u>(11)</u>BMI---kg/m^2^, median (IQR)20 通用删除7(英):<u>(18--22)</u>MUAC---cm, median (IQR)23 通用删除7(英):<u>(21--26)</u>CD4 cell count---cells/μL, median (IQR)210 通用删除7(英):<u>(110--309)</u>CD4 cell count \\<100 cells/μL29 通用删除7(英):<u>(23)</u>CD4 cell count \\<200 cells/μL57 通用删除7(英):<u>(45)</u>Hemoglobin---g/dL, median (IQR)12 通用删除7(英):<u>(11--13)</u>Study nurse investigations Currently diagnosed with TB6 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> WHO HIV disease stage 1--258 通用删除7(英):<u>(47)</u> 360 通用删除7(英):<u>(48)</u> 46 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> Neck stiffness4 (3.2) Neurologic deficit0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u> Confusion0 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u>Self-reported symptoms Fever48 (37.5) Night sweat41 (32.3) Weight loss58 (45.0) Fatigue50 (40.3) Cough33 (25.6) Diarrhea19 (14.7) Headache64 (49.6)IQR interquartile range, BMI body-mass index, MUAC mid-upper arm circumferenceData presented as n (%), if not stated otherwise\n\n【9】None of the participants were diagnosed with cryptococcosis during follow-up. At the end of the study, 96 (74.4 %) of participants remained in care. One (0.8 %) death was reported; 6 (4.7 %) patients had been transferred to other health facilities, whereas 26 (20.2 %) were lost to follow-up.\n\n【10】Management of common and severe opportunistic infections is a critical component of HIV care. CI screening in subjects starting ART may improve treatment outcome, but the indication for screening depends on the prevalence of CI in different settings. In our study population the prevalence of CI was low. In particular, only one case of asymptomatic CI was detected; the other CrAg-positive subject had clinically apparent meningitis at presentation.\n\n【11】Our findings differ from those presented in two recent reports from Ethiopia \\[[@CR6], [@CR7]\\], one of which was based in the same uptake area as our investigation \\[[@CR7]\\]. In contrast to ours, both these studies included large proportions of patients receiving ART (271/369 \\[74 %\\] and 127/254 \\[50 %\\], respectively, \\[[@CR6], [@CR7]\\]). Furthermore, we performed CrAg testing using the lateral flow assay. Although both latex agglutination and lateral flow assays have high specificity, the lateral flow assay has higher sensitivity, and is preferred for field use since it is cheaper, requires less equipment and does not require refrigeration \\[[@CR5], [@CR8]\\]. Compared to the agglutination assay, which was used in the previous Ethiopian studies, the lateral flow assay can be performed as a point-of-care test. Evaluations of the lateral flow assay show excellent performance \\[[@CR9]\\]. Therefore we consider false-negative reactions unlikely; this is further supported by the absence of incident cases of cryptococcal disease following ART initiation in our participants. Apart from differences with regard to ART status and degree of immunosuppression, geographical and health facility factors could explain the discordant rates of CI found in these three Ethiopian studies. Interestingly, Alemu et al. noted significantly higher prevalence of CI in one of two study sites in the Addis Ababa area \\[[@CR6]\\], suggesting that the rate of CI can vary greatly even within the same region. The two cases of CI that occurred in our population were found in persons with CD4 cell counts \\> 100 cells/µL. This finding supports the results reported by Beyene et al. \\[[@CR7]\\], illustrating that CI can occur also in persons with CD4 cell counts above the threshold level in current screening recommendations.\n\n【12】Our study does not corroborate previous reports of high rates of CI in Ethiopian HIV-infected adults. Although CI screening has been shown to be cost-effective in regions with CI prevalence above 3 % \\[[@CR3]\\], each decision to implement any simple screening procedure in HIV programs in resource-limited settings may cause other initiatives not to be undertaken. Therefore, it is crucial that decisions on management guidelines are based on broad and well-documented basis. In our opinion, larger studies of treatment-naïve persons from different geographical regions of Ethiopia, and with comparison of diagnostic methods, are required before definite guidelines on testing and management of CI can be issued.\n\n【13】All authors participated in the design of the study.

The nephrotoxic potential of anti-GBM antibodies has been demonstrated in animal experiments. We questioned whether high avidity leads to persistent deposition of anti-GBM antibodies, thereby perpetuating inflammation and renal damage. To address the hypothesis, sera from 32 patients and serial samples from 11 patients with anti-GBM disease were collected. Purified bovine alpha chain non-collagen 1 domains of type IV collagen [alpha(IV)NC1] were employed to exam avidity of anti-GBM antibodies using antigen-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The amount of alpha(IV)NC1 needed for 50% inhibition of antibody binding was compared among patients with different clinical and pathological parameters. After the sera were diluted to give equivalent concentration of anti-GBM antibodies, the amount of alpha(IV)NC1 used for 50% inhibition was prominently different among patients, from 0.02 microg to 20 microg, with an average at 0.666 microg. A significant correlation was observed between the amount of alpha(IV)NC1 used and the percentage of glomeruli which had crescents (P=0.001). Higher avidity of anti-GBM antibodies predicted higher percentage of glomerular crescents (R2=0.58, P<0.001). No obvious change of avidity was observed in the serial samples. The results suggested that affinity maturation might have been completed by the time that patients presented with anti-GBM disease. The avidity of anti-GBM antibodies was associated with the degree of renal damage and might play a key role in the pathogenesis of anti-GBM disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "4caeda96-8771-4d12-b1b7-36ae8f071776", "title": "", "text": "【0】Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\n【1】The patient safety literature traditionally draws on incidents \\[[@CR1]\\] such as adverse events \\[[@CR2]\\], which have \"root causes\" embedded in the safety culture of an organisation \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. In a synthesis of the literature on patient safety in primary care, a distinction was drawn between \"preventable adverse events\" (such as \"incorrect drug administration\") and \"process errors\" (such as errors in clinical judgement) \\[[@CR4]\\]. However, there are a variety of definitions of medical \"error\" and the nature of uncertain outcomes in primary care means an error may sometimes only become visible with the benefit of hindsight \\[[@CR5]\\]. Further, \"everyday\" errors (such as missing test results) may not be conceived of as errors at all \\[[@CR5]\\].\n\n【2】In primary care the elements of safety are as much embedded in communication issues as they are in the technological or administrative aspects of care \\[[@CR6]\\]. However, a qualitative study of US-based family physicians found that most medical errors \"arose from healthcare systems dysfunction\" \\[[@CR7]\\]. From the patient perspective, \"safety\" appears as a subjective feeling that is \"fluid\" and \"negotiated\" according to ongoing interactions with health services \\[[@CR8]\\]. In this context, patients with clinical multimorbidity \\[[@CR9]\\] are of interest as they are more likely to have a large number of interactions with medical services \\[[@CR10]\\] and prescribed medicines, putting them at increased risk of safety failures \\[[@CR11]\\].\n\n【3】Thus, safety in primary care appears as a potentially nebulous concept \\[[@CR12]\\] although the relevant factors involved can be attributed to patients, doctors and healthcare systems \\[[@CR13]\\]. From our perspective safety incorporates a range of processes or events and can include, variously, serious adverse events, medical errors (e.g. in diagnosis or prescription), technical problems (e.g. failure to access the medical record) and issues in communication and inter-personal relationships involving a patient and the carers around them \\[[@CR13]\\]. Through a lens focused on both doctor and patient, we were interested to see whether we could identify discernible failures and link these to precursor events or the surrounding clinical and social context.\n\n【4】In order to explore patient safety in primary care, we selected to study patients with multimorbidity (\"the co-existence of two or more chronic conditions, where one is not necessarily more central than the others\"), as they are known to be at increased risk of poor care outcomes \\[[@CR14]\\]. Broadly, the ultimate objective of the wider study was to identify areas in which patients could become more active agents in their own safety management \\[[@CR15]\\]. We have previously reported baseline findings which showed that patients appeared to feel that their safety was threatened \"when they felt their needs were ignored, or when they perceived responses as inappropriate or insensitive\" \\[[@CR16]\\].\n\n【5】Adverse consequences for patients with multimorbidity may arise in relation to care continuity \\[[@CR17], [@CR18]\\], care transitions \\[[@CR16]\\] and polypharmacy \\[[@CR19]\\]. Complexities of care can create self-management challenges for patients \\[[@CR20]\\] including \"treatment burdens\" \\[[@CR21]\\], such as dealing with polypharmacy \\[[@CR21]\\] and interpreting sometimes contradictory advice received from different professionals \\[[@CR22]\\]. The consequences of multimorbidity in primary care are influenced by contemporary workloads for general practitioners (GPs), which are seen as \"unsustainable\" \\[[@CR23]\\]. A report by the UK King's Fund, highlighted the additional workload challenges posed by the rising numbers of people living with multimorbidity \\[[@CR24]\\]. It has been argued that consultation times should be \"substantially enhanced\" beyond 9.2 min in consequence \\[[@CR24]\\].\n\n【6】Patients with multimorbidity complicate clinical decision-making \\[[@CR25], [@CR26]\\]. A qualitative study of primary care health professionals' views on these issues found a tendency to deal with patients' needs in order of priority \"until consultation resources were exhausted, when further management was deferred\" \\[[@CR27]\\]. A study of Dutch GPs' views on the clinical management of multimorbidity found that a \"personal doctor-patient relationship was considered a major facilitator\" whereas \"presence of mental health problems was regarded as a complicating factor\" \\[[@CR28]\\]. A review and synthesis of related studies pointed to GPs feeling isolated in relation to clinical decision-making and a perceived need for \"bidirectional communication\" between care providers \\[[@CR29]\\]. Similar issues were evident in a recent Scandinavian study \\[[@CR30]\\]. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the clinical management of multimorbidity recommended better co-ordination and tailoring of patient care \\[[@CR31]\\].\n\n【7】\"Treatment burden\" in multimorbidity has received increasing attention. Gallacher et al. describe the work faced by patients which coalesces around care continuity, communication, access to services, polypharmacy and \"fragmented and poorly organized care\" \\[[@CR32]\\]. The consequences of treatment burden include poor health outcomes, lack of adherence to prescribed treatments, \"avoidable resource use\" and a consequential burden for informal carers \\[[@CR33]\\]. Treatment burden varies according to an individual's ability to cope \\[[@CR34]\\] and the personal or social resources available, including \"resilience\" \\[[@CR35]\\]. May et al. make clear that a patient's \"relational networks will often include healthcare and other professionals\" \\[[@CR36]\\] although subsequent studies have tended to focus on treatment burden for patients, sometimes with the aim of informing a \"minimally disruptive medicine\" \\[[@CR37]\\] or in efforts to mobilise patient resources to access health services and enact self-care \\[[@CR38]\\]. A meta-analysis of \"active\" patient safety incidents (i.e. adverse events) and their precursors (e.g. prescription or diagnostic errors) concluded that \"multimorbidity involving mental health may be a key driver of safety incidents\" \\[[@CR39]\\].\n\n【8】To date, studies into multimorbidity and safety have focused on polypharmacy \\[[@CR40], [@CR41]\\]. In a thematic analysis of primary care patient safety incident reports in older adults, most unsafe care was related to dispensing and prescription errors, failures in the transfer of information between sites of care and errors in clinical decision-making \\[[@CR42]\\]. Although such errors are important, a meta-synthesis of published studies pointed to patient safety in primary care as a subjective feeling or moral framework as opposed to more tangible or recordable medical errors or adverse events \\[[@CR13]\\]. With notable exceptions \\[[@CR43]\\], previous qualitative studies of patient safety in primary care have tended to adopt a cross-sectional approach and limit data collection methods to individual or group interviews \\[[@CR13]\\]. Although useful, such studies may lack a detailed assessment of the wider context in which problems occur, and cannot explore how problems develop and are managed over time.\n\n【9】The aims of the study were to describe the safety issues identified in a cohort of primary care patients with multimorbidity; and, to explore the clinical and social context in which patient safety concerns arise and play out. These objectives were addressed via a longitudinal, multi-method qualitative study in the form of a focused ethnography \\[[@CR44]\\]. The principle aim of the analysis was to construct a line of argument concerning the circumstances under which patient agency in safety monitoring might be bolstered.\n\n【10】Methods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n【11】The study methods are detailed elsewhere \\[[@CR15]\\]. Twenty-six patients were purposefully recruited following identification by participating GPs in Greater Manchester and enrolled for 24 months. Attempts were made to interview patients face-to-face every 12 months and after primary care consultations. On occasion, informal carers were also present at these interviews or were interviewed separately. Patient's GPs and/or practice nurses were interviewed at year 1 and year 2. We aimed to observe at least two primary care consultations each year with each participant. Some participating patients completed a health care diary. Data were extracted from practice electronic health records for each participant at study months 0,12 and 24. Where possible, interviews and observations were audio recorded; with informed consent to use a recorder verbalised at the start of each interview or observation by each participant present. Where one or more participants did not consent to the use of an audio recorder, notes were taken by hand. The fieldworkers (RH, GD-W SC), who were experienced qualitative health researchers, recorded their own impressions and observations as field notes. During the course of the study, one patient dropped out (data excluded) and three died (data retained).\n\n【12】For the purposes of the thematic analysis of interview, observation and diary material, all data were read several times by the first author and selected data which fit our a priori framework \\[[@CR15]\\] was extracted and further organised and analysed by the wider study team with the aid of Quirkos software 通用删除1(英):<u>(通用删除8(英):<u>[www.quirkos.com]</u>)</u>. The framework was based on the findings of three previous qualitative studies of patient safety in primary care \\[[@CR45]--[@CR47]\\]. We coded inductively from a subset of interview and observation material (from all participants) that was directly pertinent to patient safety as it fit a taxonomy based on these international studies. We included any surrounding context. We have not shown our working here, as referees pointed out that this data does not add anything to what is already known in the literature. These situations and events could also be used to more easily identify patient and GP participants.\n\n【13】For the case study \\[[@CR48]\\] analysis, we began by comparing information on medical conditions, prescribed medicines and allergies or drug sensitivities as described by patients or found in EHRs. The primary purpose of this exercise was not to discern whether \"errors of fact\" lay either with the patient or with the system, but rather to identify cases where more detailed analysis could provide context around identified patient safety concerns. A deviant case \\[[@CR49]\\] -- where there were no discrepancies between information divulged by patient and practice -- was also selected -- for comparison, although our analytical approach is primarily descriptive.\n\n【14】For the six cases identified, we analysed all of the data collected for each individual, i.e. EHRs, paper prescriptions (where available), transcripts and field notes from participant interviews and observations of clinical consultations. All data were anonymised at, or immediately following data collection and all participant identifiers are pseudonyms. Ethical approval was obtained. Informed consent was obtained from all participant GPs, patients and carers. Ongoing assent was verbalised in subsequent interviews or observation sessions. Certain unique clinical features of individual cases have been redacted or blurred (e.g. described in less specific terms) and the original datasets are not shown in order to protect participant anonymity.\n\n【15】Results I -- Health records analysis {#Sec3}\n====================================\n\n【16】Of 26 patients recruited at baseline (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}), 3 died during the course of the study and one withdrew following concerns that the study would saddle them with additional burden. Comparing information on active health conditions, prescribed medicines and allergies or drug sensitivities found discrepancies for all patient participants, bar one. Thirteen (52% of 25) patients did not mention drug allergies or sensitivities as recorded in their EHR and there were 4 instances where drug allergies mentioned by the patient were not found in the EHR. Sixteen (64% of 25) participating patients did not mention some of the active health conditions recorded in the EHR. However, this was perhaps to be expected in a group of people who had been deliberately selected as having multiple health problems. It was also unsurprising that 4 elderly male participants chose not to disclose to a younger, female researcher that they had erectile dysfunction problems or were in receipt of sildenafil prescriptions.Table 1Participant characteristics.

In another case, a suspected TIA was mentioned by the patient but not seen in the EHR. Two patients did not mention a diagnosis of hypertension. Three did not mention a CKD diagnosis, although this could have been asymptomatic in the two participants with CKD Stage 3A. In three cases, it appeared as though some of the patient's principal health concerns were not recorded in the EHR as they did not have a definitive diagnostic label or could not be treated effectively, as in a woman with recurrent skin infections, another with \"age spots\" and a man with a \"lazy eye.\"\n\n【18】On the basis of the above exercise, 6 cases were selected for more detailed consideration as they seemed to highlight potential areas where safety issues would arise or were seen to have arisen. Kathleen was seen at an Urgent Care Centre following a fall in year one and the GP had put a Personalised Care Plan in place which included \"admissions avoidance care.\" Pamela's son was concerned about her medication compliance and the GP suspected cognitive impairment. Deborah was selected primarily because she told the researcher about memory changes which she had withheld from her GP. However, from the GP's perspective, the main safety considerations in her care related to the possible risks of hospital admission resulting from specialised medication that she was taking. Alan was admitted to hospital after collapsing at an event in year 2. This, along with further episodes of \"feeling faint,\" he associated with a statin prescription (although \"feeling faint\" is not a reported side effect of statins \\[[@CR50]\\]) which was subsequently stopped. Helen was taking more prescribed medicines than any other case considered in detail, and as with Deborah, there were concerns about the possibility of \"stomach bleeding or kidney problems\" and \"ending up in hospital\" as a result. Finally, Victoria was selected as she was the only participating patient where no discrepancies were found between medical information collected from herself versus that found in the EHR. She only had three active health conditions, including heart failure and diverticular disease. Further description of each of these cases is considered below.\n\n【19】Comparison of numbers of primary care consultations for the included cases during the 2 year study period mainly underlined the low number of primary care appointments seen in Victoria (the \"deviant case\") when compared with others. Victoria only had 6 consultations in 24 months (data missing for one month) whereas the remaining participant cases were usually seen in primary care at least once a month. Deborah seemed to have a more overall pattern of regular and consistent use when compared with the others, although she had 3 consultations in month 20. The remaining cases revealed episodes involving periods of large numbers of consultations. Thus, Pamela had 12 consultations in 4 months (months 8--11), Alan had 6 consultations in one month (month 19) and Helen had 23 consultations during months 16--22 inclusive (an average of 3 per month).\n\n【20】Across the study period, participating patients were being prescribed between 7 and 18 items in primary care. Victoria, the \"control\" was in the lowest position in this regard. Data on secondary care appointments showed that Victoria and Pamela were the only participants not seen in secondary or specialist care for the duration of the study. Alan had only one incident involving secondary care -- an emergency admission. Three participants: Kathleen, Deborah and Helen were usually visiting hospitals or specialist clinics every month and each of them had two emergency or urgent care admissions during the course of the study. Combining data on total primary and secondary care appointments over the 24 months of data collection shows that Victoria, the control, had a total of 8 appointments, whereas Kathleen, Pamela and Deborah had between 59 and 67. Helen was also likely in this latter category (with a total of 52 appointments), although data on her secondary care appointments was missing for 5 straight months. On the basis of the included figures, these latter four participants had a mean of 60 total health appointments, or 2.5 per calendar month.\n\n【21】Results II - Case studies {#Sec4}\n=========================\n\n【22】Kathleen {#Sec5}\n--------\n\n【23】In month 9 of the study Kathleen had a fall and was seen at an urgent care centre. Following this incident, her GP instigated a Personalised Care Plan, including \"admission avoidance care.\" In month 16, Kathleen presented at the surgery feeling \"dizzy and wobbly\" with \"lots\" of pain in her back. As part of the examination, the attending GP notes, \"I found it very difficult to pinpoint history today\" and \"I'm not exactly sure how to help.\"\n\n【24】Katheleen was originally due to go on a list for surgery \\[details removed\\] in month 4 but this was put off by the hospital due to the \"unpredictability\" of surgical loads in the winter months. Whilst Kathleen faced the worry \\[of whether she would have the operation she needed soon enough\\], she also reported that a consultant had \"said '\\[details removed\\] with all its dangers,' so I believe there's some danger in what he's going to do, but there's danger in everything isn't there?\" (diary entry, month 15).\n\n【25】Pamela {#Sec6}\n------\n\n【26】During month 8, Pamela attended surgery seemingly at the instigation of her son who felt that she was not taking her medicines as prescribed. The attending GP recorded the suspicion that Pamela was \"cognitively impaired\" and the consultation led the GP to the view that she was \"possibly concealing her symptoms.\" On the son's insistence, Pamela showed the GP \\[details removed\\] \"which she wasn't going to show or mention.\" The following month, Pamela presented with memory loss for the first time. An interview with her GP highlighted concerns around whether Pamela was taking her prescribed medicines in light of these memory changes, although a dosette box was being use to facilitate compliance.\n\n【27】Deborah {#Sec7}\n-------\n\n【28】Deborah's main problems involved rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis, although when describing her symptoms at initial interview she said that \"everyday \\[brings\\] something different.\" She lived with her husband who was doing \"whatever is needed\" domestically. Arthritis had a significant impact on multiple joints. At initial interview she spoke of a bone in her leg which was \"wearing away\" and \"there's not a lot they can do.\" This view was confirmed during a GP interview, \"That's why she comes in all the time . we can't help her properly, we can't cure the problem.\" This situation had led her to consult a range of alternative practitioners, including a faith healer who \"didn't do any good.\" Deborah further reported that \"something had ruptured\" in her shoulder but complained that she had not been sent for a scan. In addition to three other health problems, she also reported recent \"memory changes\" to the interviewer, about which she had \"not spoken to anyone\" and hoped \"it's not Alzheimer's.\" Deborah was being seen in secondary care for \\[details removed\\].\n\n【29】The main safety issue for Deborah concerned the medicines she was taking, which, as her GP put it during an annual interview, could cause \"stomach bleeding or kidney problems . that's why she's having these blood tests every month.\" The root of the safety risks for this participant appeared to be the additional workload created for both patient and primary care physician in relation to the management and monitoring of specialised \\[details removed\\] medication which was not licensed for use in primary care. There is an unfortunate irony that these risks were created against a background where none of the specialist medication was perceived to be having much of an effect.\n\n【30】This clinical background led Deborah's GP to conceive of her as a \"demanding\" patient: \"So it seems like the woman is here every week.\" But the GP added (in annual interview): \"even though she's been here only 4 or 5 times in the winter.\" Data gathered for the 24 month period of the study showed she was actually attending once or twice a month. The EHR also revealed some procedural confusion around a prescription for a specialised medication and associated blood monitoring tests.\n\n【31】Alan {#Sec8}\n----\n\n【32】At recruitment, Alan's main contact with health services consisted of 3 monthly blood tests for diabetes with the practise nurse; a condition which he believed he no longer had. The EHR revealed contradictory information around a statin prescription and a few appointment cancellations.\n\n【33】In month 15, Alan was admitted to hospital by ambulance after collapsing at an event. He put this down to commencing statins two weeks previously. Following further episodes of feeling faint, he stopped taking the statin and mentioned this to his GP at a subsequent appointment, who marks the medical record \"not for further lipid modifying medication.\" This decision was confirmed by doctor and patient at a subsequent consultation 4 weeks later. In month 19, another prescription was stopped, which, unlike statins does list dizziness and fainting as potential side-effects.\n\n【34】Of all the cases, Alan appeared least engaged with his health problems, although the work of managing his conditions -- whether through eating a healthy diet -- or organizing the medications he was taking daily, seemed to fall largely to his wife. However, his symptomology (such as in respect of pain) seemed far less than in the other cases on an everyday basis. When asked what all of his tablets were for during his initial interview, he said, \"I don't know you'd have to ask a doctor.\"\n\n【35】Helen {#Sec9}\n-----\n\n【36】Helen had a large number of active health conditions and was the biggest user of medications in the case subset. At recruitment she reported, among other conditions, a history of asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems. She described herself as \"prone to DVTs,\" and had previously had a stroke.\n\n【37】In Helen's case, a large number of \"main symptoms\" and health conditions were identified by both patient and doctor (including hypertension, asthma, and diabetes), although at baseline the patient did not mention CKD, \\[details of three medical conditions removed\\] or chest pain. During the course of the study, Helen was also seen in \\[four hospital departments and one community service -- details removed\\]. She presented at A&E during months 4 (with chest pain) and 14 \\[details removed\\]. In month 6, paramedics attend her house concerning \\[details removed\\].\n\n【38】By month 12, a more focused trio of symptoms had emerged in the general panoply of ill health, including an ulcer. In the EHR, reference to a lymphoedema first appears at a consultation in month 12. In months 16 and 17 there are face-to-face consultations about her swollen legs. By month 20 (in a long consultation observed by a researcher), the problem has worsened (appearing as \"possible DVT\" in the EHR) and a referral (with some access problems) is eventually made to an ambulatory care unit. When asked in interview, the GP said, \"We don't have an answer,\" following the investigations on her leg, presenting a \"diagnostic dilemma\" and \"no solution\". In remarking that the patient \"likes answers, so does \\[her partner\\],\" however, the GP appears to focus the problematics of this state of affairs onto the patient and partner experiencing the \"anxiety that comes with not knowing what's going on.\"\n\n【39】In safety terms, prescribed medicines were an ever present risk. Helen was previously taken off \\[a medication which had adverse effects\\]. She was taking \\[prescription drug name removed\\], which can interact with other medications which has to be accounted for in prescribing. In discussing potential safety concerns around Helen's care, her GP referred to a high chance of her going into chronic kidney failure if she was medicated with diuretics. If she were to use Ace Inhibitors for her CKD, blood tests would need to be undertaken every 2 or 3 days to assess kidney functioning. At the end of the day, there was a danger of her \"ending up in hospital.\"\n\n【40】Victoria {#Sec10}\n--------\n\n【41】Victoria appeared as a comparatively low user of primary care services with only one episode of hospital care in 24 months (outpatients). At recruitment she reported three health conditions including heart failure. The EHR notes \"moderate\" diverticular disease which the patient discusses, but not with this precise diagnostic label. Only two potential safety issues were evident. Firstly, the GP mentioned that aspirin had not been requested from the patient for a period of time, although it was suggested that Victoria may have been buying it over the counter. Secondly, the GP referred to an incident involving an infection where it was suggested that \"rather than waiting until you need to go to A&E,\" she could have approached primary care sooner for an antibiotic prescription; thereby avoiding a hospital admission.\n\n【42】Results III -- Thematic analysis {#Sec11}\n================================\n\n【43】Instances of potential contributions to patient safety failures {#Sec12}\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Characteristics of participating patients at baseline are detailed in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}. We found examples of most potential contributors to patient safety failures according to the framework described in the study protocol \\[[@CR15]\\]. For access breakdowns \\[[@CR47]\\], all contributory factors from the taxonomy of events were seen. In the case of communication breakdowns \\[[@CR45]\\], all issues were encountered except for the patient side factors \"Inarticulateness\" \\[[@CR47]\\] and \"lack of confidence\" \\[[@CR47]\\] and the staff side factor \"failure to respond to adverse drug reactions or painful symptoms\" \\[[@CR46]\\]. However, we found additional factors that did not seem to fit the taxonomy: \"GP doesn't interact with patient but focuses on computer screen,\" \"health professional approach seen as patronising\" and \"health professional has 'bad attitude.'\" So far as errors of coordination and management continuity \\[[@CR46]\\] were concerned, all factors were found except for the patient contributory factor \"comprehension errors\" \\[[@CR47]\\] and the staff/system error \"wrong chart used for patient\" \\[[@CR45]\\]. We found additional factors here, mainly related to the intersection between pressures on GP workload, problems arising from seeing different GPs and the ways in which systematised annual review appointments can lack patient-centredness. In the case of relationship breakdowns \\[[@CR45]\\], there was a very good fit between the taxonomy and the data we gathered, with only the patient contributory factor \"selfishness\" \\[[@CR47]\\] absent. This descriptive analysis highlights how, in a relatively small sample of patients followed over 2 years, contributors to patient safety failures were both frequent and very varied.\n\n【45】Subsequently, we analysed the data extracted via the framework as a whole and in thematic fashion. As well as those themes that derived from our framework (e.g. access, communication), we encountered additional themes, such as \"over or under consultation\" and \"safety problems inherent in health conditions or treatments.\" The broad findings coalesced around three main factors, with \"work\" (for patients) or \"workload\" (for health workers) as underlying issues: relational tensions in primary care consultations, system constraints in the organisation of care and issues in care continuity.\n\n【46】Relational tensions and 'under' or 'over' consultation {#Sec13}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Pressure on GPs' time, and difficulties in securing timely (and lengthy enough) appointments appeared to create anxieties for patients and doctors alike. Some patients avoided seeking help, perhaps believing that their problems were not serious enough (\"under consulters\"). Other patients, perhaps understood by GPs as being over anxious about their health (\"over consulters\"), sought repeated appointments, as their complex needs for care and/or emotional support could not be met in a brief appointment slot:\"\". if we don't make . regular appointments then they start ringing in and they'll see perhaps a locum doctor and then another chest x-ray will be done, you know, when one was done three months ago and another.so .and that's where continuity comes in, you know. I think that's where sometimes reviewing patients who are very anxious about their health, on a pre-planned basis, can be helpful because it saves them sort of seeking multiple . people and getting different opinions, which actually sometimes really worsens her anxiety.\" (Irene, GP interview, year 2)\"When people brought wider concerns from their lives into the consultation room, this could create additional work for GPs, who are \"sitting behind a desk rattling through tons and tons and tons of patients in your surgery\":\"\"I find it difficult to know what her priorities are . I think that she verbalises problems with her brother, whether it's her brother's health or their relationship. So I think she takes on a lot of his problems as well. And then puts a lot of her problems to one side. She's quite a busy person. That's her personality and then she becomes busy in the consultation, and it's difficult to control.\" (\\[Anonymised\\], GP interview, year 2)\"Prioritisation of conditions is well recognised in multimorbidity \\[[@CR51]\\] However, the above extract appears to point to a tension, or disconnect, between organisational or system \"needs\" (10 min appointment slots, prioritisation) and what a patient needs, wants or expects from the consultation.\n\n【48】An elderly woman was understood to be \"coping well at home\" despite having heart failure. When she died during the course of the study, her death was seen as \"unexpected\" and her case was referred to the Coroner's Office. But the fact that she did not consult meant that she was not on the practice \"radar\" and was on reflection seen as an under consulter:\"\"She doesn't consult at all. She consulted with \\[GP\\], he saw her at home to, sort of; transfer the care of her heart failure to Primary Care. \\[Another GP\\] arranged with her to see her every three months and to have her blood checked. Then we have not seen her, there was a telephone consultation with \\[a different GP\\] because her bloods showed that she was slightly low on folic acid and \\[a different GP\\] just talked to her about her diet and gave her some vitamins and then she passed away.\"\"\"She was somebody who from our point of view seemed to, despite her heart failure, coping well at home. Although despite her age and her heart failure perhaps an unexpected death, so I think she was referred to the Coroner's Officer, so not on our radar really because she wasn\\'t consulting.\" (Martha, GP interview, year 2)\"In an earlier interview with Martha, it was noteworthy that from the patient's viewpoint one reason why she was consulting infrequently was that she found it difficult to attend the surgery. Furthermore, she had received a letter from the practice regarding a blood pressure reading, which she did not believe had been taken:\"\"I don't go to the surgery, they're supposed to come here, a nurse came to take my blood pressure, two days later got a letter from \\[my GP\\] saying, 'Pleased your blood pressure has gone down.' Got another letter two weeks later, saying the same thing, but I hadn't had another test. Then I got another letter from \\[my GP\\] saying pleased and she would take your blood pressure next time you come in. I doubt I could get in, would have to take a taxi, don't think I'd manage the stairs.\" (Martha, health care diary, year 1)\"\n\n【49】System constraints {#Sec14}\n------------------\n\n【50】Whilst some threats to patient safety follow from the knowledge, behaviour and inter-personal aspects of human actors, others rather follow from protocols, policies and the ways that systems are organised to provide and deliver care \\[[@CR13]\\]. For example, appointments are difficult to organise; especially when arranged at the last minute. Many GPs work part-time and the increasing use of locum GPs can be seen to have an adverse impact on continuity of care \\[[@CR52]\\]. One GP participant pointed to the value in seeing the same practitioner:\"GP: It\\'s far easier to judge the progress of a condition and how the patient\\'s coping with a condition if the same person sees them every time. Sometimes a fresh pair of eyes is good. But mostly having the same doctor can help move things along. I suppose, as I mentioned before, having a clear plan of actions, with timescales. And after that timescale, decision points when it\\'s decided what to do next, is what we\\'re doing working, or if it\\'s not, do we need secondary care? (Larry, GP interview, year 2)\"Under these circumstances, the onus can fall on the patient to instigate their own clinical monitoring, rather than relying on system generated recall:\"\"We rely on her to come back for the blood tests, so if you\\'re not really careful and there\\'s a bigger practice and many doctors or locums come in, probably sometimes you'll not realise that she hasn't been for two months for the blood tests, prescribe the next month, and then any side effect or danger in protein loss or the kidneys would then go unnoticed till it\\'s probably further advanced.\" (Deborah, GP interview, year 1)\"Another case pointed to a failure to undertake a repeat of an \"abnormal\" blood test, although it was unclear whether this was a \"systems\" issue, an oversight by an individual member of staff, confusion over whose role it was to recall the patient, or some combination of all of these factors:\"GP: .from the blood tests in February, we have advised that it should be repeated in three months and she has not re-attended.\"\"Interviewer: Would she have been sent a reminder?\"\"GP: She hasn't been sent a reminder, actually, and given that she attended with issues about her memory that is a failing on our part, isn't it. \\[Later\\] . And so, perhaps both me and our administrator had not picked up on the fact that her blood tests are due. \\[Later\\] . they have not flagged it, we have got a template that flags it up so that they are pulled up by an administrator. So, there is a bit of a systems failure going on there. (\\[Anonymised\\], GP interview, year 2)\"During the observation of one consultation, an interaction concerning the results of a laboratory test appeared to point to a presumption of failure in the transfer of test results, with the GP suggesting that attempting to locate the test result was not worth the work involved:\"Patient: How did my urine sample go on?\"\"GP: Never got it, so I'm really unsure of what's happened. As you said, you were better, I didn't see any point in chasing this up with the lab, because they're just going to say I can't find it, is that all right? (\\[Anonymised\\], observation of consultation, year 2)\"This appears as an example of navigating the challenge between maximising the clinical utility of a test whilst minimising the potential for further workload and treatment burden (i.e. redoing a test that may be unnecessary).\n\n【51】Issues in work or workload associated with care continuity {#Sec15}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】Below, a GP reports about a participating patient's recent referral for expert opinion:\"GP: . they saw her that day, which is great. I had no correspondence for that. She phoned me a week later and they said they will do a scan and I've not heard, we didn't receive any correspondence. So . so I phoned up \\[the\\] unit and said, 'This lady has had a scan, this was an admission avoidance, when is the scan going to be?' They go, 'We don't know, we don't have the records.' So then I had to phone back a week later, they said they'd look into it, then she phoned back saying, 'I've still not heard,' so there's this yoyo that was going around for the best part of two or three weeks, her \\[removed\\] were no worse in that time, I did have to see her that once just to reassure myself that nothing had changed. (\\[Anonymised\\], GP interview, year 2)\"The nature of this scenario creates work and increased workload for the patient, her carers (including health service staff) and suggests \"ambiguity and workarounds\" \\[[@CR53]\\] between care sectors. Anxiety around clinical decision making in people with multimorbidity or other complexities entails work, and systems constraints exacerbate the work or effort required to resolve the clinical uncertainty.\n\n【53】Another issue related to care transitions was that some specialist medication is not licensed for use in general practice. This was seen to create work for a patient who found it difficult to attend a hospital for screening appointments. This appeared as a potential safety concern:\"\". I think the patient probably finds it more difficult to go back to the hospital for the check-ups, which probably in the beginning might be sometimes weekly, so it\\'s a lot of hassle for her but we can\\'t help her there really because it\\'s the licencing and we don't know. And it is a lot of workload involved there, so we sort of. general practice shies away from that a little bit. \\[Later\\] . Again, if some of those tablets, let's say, causes stomach bleeding and she\\'s got severe indigestion and thinks, oh, I don't want to go to the doctor again, and then suddenly a vessel bursts in the stomach and then she\\'s got real problems.\" (Deborah, GP interview, year 1)\"Informal carers, typically patients' family members commonly acted as advocates in health service consultations as well as helping out with aspects of home care and management of patient's conditions at home. However, on occasion they were not willing to take on certain tasks expected of them by the formal health service. For example, whilst Michael's's partner had been trained to give a glucose injection should he suffer a diabetic hypo, Helen's partner was not happy to take on what he saw as a strictly medical role. The work required in managing chronic conditions is again highlighted, here with the added consideration of determining who has the capacity to fulfil the required functions related to the management of care.\n\n【54】In the particular context of workload, one GP noted---and seemingly not ironically---that patients who \"under consult\" are preferable from a workload viewpoint:\"Interviewer: And what is it like, having a patient like \\[removed\\], whom you don't see very often?\"\"GP: It's great, because you don't see them, so they don't cause you any workload, if I'm being absolutely bloody honest with you. I think it's unsettling when you come to look at their records, and you think, goodness, she has these \\[removed\\] conditions and she's not needed to see us. (\\[Anonymised\\], GP interview, year 1)\"This patient is seen as \"great\" because they \"don't cause you any workload\" and attend \"appropriately\" \"for monitoring.\" Although questions are raised around tensions between managing workload whilst maintaining effective and safe care.\n\n【55】Results IV -- Synthesis of research findings {#Sec16}\n============================================\n\n【56】Overall, the findings pointed to various areas of tension impacting on safety. The first of these was around managing underlying anxieties and uncertainties in interactions, both from a patient and a professional perspective. For example, and as expanded in the discussion , there was evidence of a clash between patient expectations to \"do something\" (as in repeating investigations) and, from the clinical perspective, the risk of that \"something\" leading to worse outcomes or even harm.\n\n【57】From a patient safety perspective, managing this inherent tension appears as a potentially key element of clinical practice. That requires more work for clinicians, and even more work when dealing with multimorbidity. Handling this tension can lead to real or perceived 'over' consultation -- (as exemplified by Irene, cited above). More investigations generate more results which leads to a need for further consultations.\n\n【58】Borderline test results may generate further anxieties, in a kind of negative feedback loop to where we began. This assertion, whilst speculative, brings is to the second area of tension, which involves maximising clinical utility whilst minimising treatment burden. To the ethnographic observer, Helen appeared as someone whose full-time job was organising and attending health appointments. And none of this appeared to address her symptoms or the questions she had about her various conditions. A non-clinician might wonder whether all of this contact with the health service was making her better or worse, with some medications apparently necessary to keep her alive and others which appeared to present the risk of causing her to end up in hospital in their own right.\n\n【59】Systems of care are not necessarily designed to account and effectively reduce the work required to deal with these tensions, and by extension----make things safer. Whether it is possible to effectively deal with the work required to address these tensions in a time bounded routine consultation (and a resource constrained health system) is unclear. Further, our findings show how the current organisation of medical care might exacerbate these constraints. The atypical example in the data of 'under' consultation, illuminated a system run so as to reduce the sense of demand and clinician workload, but this can be at the expense of necessary care. GP participant accounts pointed to a sense of relief in less workload, but with an accompanying realisation that the patient's needs were not necessarily met. Could this be a potential precursor of clinician burn out?\n\n【60】Discussion {#Sec17}\n==========\n\n【61】Patient safety work involves further burdens on top of existing workload for both clinicians and patients. In this conceptualisation, safety work seemingly forms a negative feedback loop with patient safety itself. A line of argument drawn from the triangulation of findings from different sources, points to a tension between the desirability of a minimally disruptive medicine versus safety risks associated with the way that services are set up, organised and delivered.\n\n【62】What is the potential agency of doctors versus patients in ameliorating clinical iatrogenesis against a background of clinical uncertainty? {#Sec18}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【63】By incorporating medical records data and an approach focussed on the detail of purposefully selected cases, we had hoped to reveal discrete safety incidents which we might then link back to precursor events. However, on the rare occasions on which we found an observable and identifiable \"safety incident,\" such as Alan fainting, it is not clear how that might have linked to other safety concerns which had arisen in his case, such as possible antipathy about his state of health, denial of medical diagnosis or cancelling medical appointments. And none of these concerns explain why he linked this incident to a statin prescription; nor why the GP was happy to go along with his view. Although this may have been to appease the patient. Later, another medication was stopped. Perhaps that was the culprit? This example does however underline the reactive nature of the medical system in general terms; and uncertainties around ascribing causes to adverse outcomes, even with the benefit of hindsight. The patient has agency here, and is another factor to be weighed up against clinical guidelines or recommended treatments. Regular diabetes monitoring can prevent serious complications, but Alan believed he did not have the condition; which he felt was temporarily brought on through over consumption of a popular sugary drink when it was on special offer. \"Fainting\" could be a symptom of diabetes, and if Alan had attended these check-ups more regularly, perhaps he could have avoided blacking out?\n\n【64】For the majority of patients who were more engaged with medicine (even to the point of alleged overuse where anxiety was a compounding clinical feature), there appeared a tension between patient expectations that their GP will \"do something,\" versus GP concerns that \"something else\" could lead to harm (e.g. kidney injury) or risk hospital admission with the attendant risks. And thus the nub of the matter appears to be a palpable tension for GPs between meeting patient expectations (via patient-centred care) and preventing adverse events. For patients, feeling safe appears to incorporate elements of feeling satisfied with the quality of the clinical relationship and care, which are intrinsically linked to their expectations and previous experience of services \\[[@CR16]\\]. An essential problem here appears to be that patients and GPs are using different conceptualisations of safety (or satisfaction) which might play off against each other. Interesting questions that emerge from this line of argument are firstly whether patients really expect the kinds of \"over treatment\" that could increase the risk of adverse events that we have implied from our interpretation of the study data? Secondly, how do GPs manage the tightrope walk between meeting patient expectations to \"do something\" (which could constitute over treatment and investigation) and \"doing no harm,\" as in offsetting the potential risks of adding more medicines or repeating investigations?\n\n【65】In a time and resource constrained system, could a focus on risk management be compromising patient safety? {#Sec19}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】Having considered some cases in detail, one gets the sense of an ever present backdrop of risks, appearing largely as tasks for GPs as in \"avoid hospital admission,\" \"monitor kidney functioning,\" or perhaps \"be careful about what you prescribe.\" There are different risks for patients perhaps, e.g. of not getting a diagnosis, of the treatment not working or of the GP overlooking or mis-ascribing something. Plus the risk of not getting a sympathetic hearing, the risk of not being taken seriously or the risk of being blamed for the problem or failure to treat it.\n\n【67】The sense then is that both GP and patient have to be on constant alert to a plethora of risks but that when something does go wrong the reasons for it may be uncertain or difficult to pin down. \"Let's stop this drug and see if that helps,\" perhaps. Within a time constrained and reactive system, however, the context of multimorbidity can mean that all the available time is spent on reacting to the latest crisis, whilst avoiding serious harm through clinical iatrogenesis. In this scenario, there is no time left to address basic patient needs (e.g. \"Why isn't this drug working? Where's my test result?\") and it could be said that both clinician and patient appear to be in perpetual workaround; or dancing to a system generated script.\n\n【68】One feature or narrative concerning contemporary medical systems is \"information chaos\": \"comprised of various combinations of information overload, information underload, information scatter, information conflict, and erroneous information\" \\[[@CR54]\\]. Increased workload, including additional working around \"chaotic,\" complex and inter-twined systems would be expected to increase the likelihood of an error occurring. Data from Primary Care are sparse although a US study of hospital paediatric nurses found that \"being rushed\" was associated with both medication errors and \"burnout.\" \\[[@CR55]\\]\n\n【69】In circumstances where increasing clinical workload is a driver of safety failures, more work in monitoring or preparing for a possible adverse reaction or serious adverse event (on top of a focus on reacting to the latest medical problem) seemingly forms part of a negative feedback loop whereby the situation becomes less safe. The more people engage with medicine, whether willingly or unwillingly, the more necessarily they are put at risk of potential harm. Given especially the problematics of conditions and syndromes which are either hard to treat or difficult to define clinically and where existing drug lists might prevent the prescription of usual treatments.\n\n【70】The emergence of under or over consultation as a potential driver of patient safety failures highlights a tension between the meta-organisation of health care and the communicative, legalistic or performative aspects of medical consultations in the context of patient centred care {#Sec20}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【71】A finding which added to our a priori framework concerning patient safety in primary care highlights the contribution of perceived over or under consulting as having a role in precipitating adverse events. There are highly socialised notions about when it is appropriate to use NHS services \\[[@CR56]\\] and such considerations formed a part of the narrative when participants discussed their own patterns of service use. Avoiding the label of \"timewaster\" can be a moral imperative for patients \\[[@CR57]\\] and the notion of candidacy is useful in explaining health service utilisation where services are seen as being in short supply \\[[@CR58]\\]. On the other hand, whilst it might suit practitioners if patients don't over consult, this can lead to problems as identified in our findings. Over or under consultation compounds both the discursive aspects of the consultation (where there may be confusion on either side as to the medical reasons for consulting in the first place) and system demands on when patients are seen (as in periodic reviews for patients with, e.g. diabetes or heart disease, which may be viewed as a waste of time by some -- results not shown).\n\n【72】Our main findings point to multimorbidity as a magnifier of tensions in the delivery of health services and quality care in general practice. Within this context, older patients with complex and varied healthcare needs encounter almost all potential contributors to patient safety failure, as they negotiate the tensions and limitations of system demands. For GPs, patients and carers, these tensions create additional work which they can struggle to manage and often find frustrating. When the quality of interactions between doctors and their patients begin to fail, or technical problems arise, this can make a bad situation worse in the context of limited consultation times and the perceived scarce or 'rationed' nature of medical resources.\n\n【73】These findings fit with the model of \"cumulative complexity\" whereby factors \"accumulate and interact to complicate patient care\" \\[[@CR59]\\]. This model is principally concerned with the balance between the workload created by the demands of care and an individual's capacity to deal with it \\[[@CR59]\\]. The model has previously found to be relevant for people living with multiple chronic conditions \\[[@CR60]\\]. In the introduction, the tendency for a theoretical and empirical focus on patient workload or burdens was noted and a similar preoccupation is evident in the literature concerning patient \"capacity\" within a framework that is concerned with enabling patients to help themselves more \\[[@CR61]\\]. In this study, whilst we found both patient and staff or system-side threats to safety, \"workload\" appeared at least as important a patient safety issue when referring to staff as it did to patients. Whilst another strand of health research has illuminated the ways in which health professionals form a part of patients' relational networks \\[[@CR62]\\], the general tendency can rather be to separate out issues for health service staff from those facing patients. The findings of this study point to a need to consider the ways in which care work and clinical responsibilities are allocated, and the consequences for safety when \"overworked\" health care staff and patients can seemingly attempt to shift care roles or tasks onto one another. Despite repeated calls for patient-centred care, findings point to the possible limits of patient-centredness \\[[@CR63]\\] when safety is at stake.\n\n【74】Implications and future work {#Sec21}\n----------------------------\n\n【75】A focus on multimorbidity has magnified some of the inherent tensions underpinning everyday interactions in primary health care and the examples of over and under consultation have shone a light on some key system issues that need consideration, particularly when trying to improve the delivery of care for people living with complex health and social care needs. The main learning from the study is very much, how can systems work better for everyone concerned and shift away from a focus on professional (or patient) behaviour. In future work we shall be exploring ways in which patients can take a more active role in reducing harm, such as in knowing how to better communicate with their doctors or having a better knowledge of their own medical records. Such efforts will have to be set against the knowledge that any intervention which is experienced as a burden, or does not fit the patient's self-prioritised needs, is unlikely to succeed.\n\n【76】In relation to potential areas for improving \"safety,\" one route would seem to involve patient education around acceptance of medical risk, which can seemingly cause some considerable anxiety, dissatisfaction and increased service utilisation. From the practitioner perspective, as well as potentially decreasing patient anxieties, such interventions could have the added benefit of reducing GP workload, which appears as a more tangible threat to safety. Particular results concerning doctor-patient communication in memory loss further underline the importance of creating a climate and space in which patients feel free to discuss concerns around their health. A broader research agenda appears concerning the extent to which entrenched systems of top-down medical care can ever fit with contemporary idealised notions of patient-centred care.\n\n【77】Strengths and weaknesses {#Sec22}\n------------------------\n\n【78】Traditionally, patient safety research has attempted to explain safety failures by identifying incidents and then historically examining the circumstances that led to failure, as in a study of falls in hospital \\[[@CR64]\\]. We adopted a different tack by following patients over time to discern whether and how adverse events occurred and any precursor, precipitatory or contextual factors. The principal strength of our approach is the longitudinal aspect and the triangulation or comparison of data from different sources. Whilst qualitative research cannot discern frequencies or the probability of events occurring in a given population, it is useful for uncovering context and highlighting areas for further research. The principal weakness of our approach probably concerns observer bias, i.e. the presence of researchers in some consultations may have influenced the behaviour of participating patients or health care workers. Further, people with mental health problems were under represented in the sample and previous research has shown they may be at increased risk of patient safety events \\[[@CR39]\\], e.g. related to polypharmacy or medication adherence.\n\n【79】Conclusion {#Sec23}\n==========\n\n【80】Multimorbidity creates work for patients, carers and health professionals. The way that the primary care system is currently set up can lead GPs to feel potentially relieved when workload is minimised. However, a focus on managing workload runs the risk of patient safety failures, e.g. when a patient is not seen much by primary care staff. This is potentially relevant for all patients but appears more so for patients living with complex health and social care needs.\n\n【81】Multimorbidity creates burdens for both patients and their doctors which can be seen to create circumstances in which safety can be threatened. The mechanisms by which differential take up of, or access to, primary care consultations may precipitate different types of medical errors or iatrogenic adverse events requires further investigation. Efforts to improve safety in primary care need to tread carefully when intervening in complex clinical management plans, as those which create extra workload for doctors or their patients may cause unintended consequences.\n\n【82】Patient advisory input to the study was provided by Wendy Barlow and Brian Minor.

If the study is limited to breast cancer risk, it has been suggested that the increase in sex steroid formation that occurs in postmenopausal women plays a role. Obesity is known to be associated with chronic low grade inflammation, but no reason for this association has been offered in the past. The gut microbiome, while known to be enormous, has not in the past been considered as a metabolic role player in the body. This is now recognized to be the case. Recent studies have found the obesity is correlated with an alteration in the gut microbiome. In obese individual there is a change in the relative proportions of the two major classes of bacteria - bacteroides and firmacutes - with the latter dominant in obesity and resulting in the formation of increased amounts of metabolic endotoxins like deoxycholic acid and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Obese individuals show a decrease in the concentration of Akkermansia muciniphila in the mucus that lines the intestinal wall, resulting in thinner mucus and a weakened intestinal lining and permitting metabolic endotoxins formed by other bacterial flora like LPS to enter the blood steam and cause the chronic inflammation associated with obesity. The change in the microbiome profile results in increases in bacterial strains that are more efficient at generating energy, leading to increased obesity. In mice, it has been shown that introducing gut bacterial flora from the cecum of obese mice into germ-free mice results in increased obesity with lesser food consumption while the reverse, introducing bacterial flora from lean mice results in a loss in weight. This raises the attractive possibility that manipulating the gut microbiome could facilitate weight loss or prevent obesity in humans.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

However, knowledge of adaptive evolutionary patterns in Mollusca is very scarce, especially for oysters. Such information would help clarify how oysters adapt to pathogen-rich and dynamically changing intertidal environments. In this study, we characterized the patterns of adaptive evolution in the Crassostrea gigas genome, using population diversity analysis and congeneric comparison. Our analysis revealed that gene expression patterns were positively associated with adaptive evolution rates, which suggested that positive selection played an important role in gene evolution. The genes with more exons and alternative splicing events had higher adaptive evolution rates. The rates of adaptive evolution in immune-related and stress-response genes were higher than those in other genes, suggesting that these groups of genes experienced strong positive selection. This study represents the first analysis of adaptive evolution rates in oysters and the first comprehensive study of a Mollusca species. These results provide a system-level investigation of association between adaptive evolution rates with some intrinsic genetic factors.

Introduction {#sec1-antioxidants-08-00082}\n===============\n\n【1】Although adequate levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules that are essential for cell growth and proliferation, the increased production of ROS can cause oxidative damage to cells \\[[@B1-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B2-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Because mitochondria are one of the major intracellular organelles of ROS production and are the most vulnerable targets of ROS, an inadequate accumulation of ROS due to oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the mechanisms leading to apoptosis following DNA damage associated with mitochondrial dysfunction \\[[@B3-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B4-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B5-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. The increase in ROS levels is due to changes in the intracellular redox balance of cells, and the failure of antioxidant mechanisms to eliminate ROS production can promote this \\[[@B6-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Moreover, the accumulation of ROS beyond the antioxidant function of cells could reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), an index of the electron transport chain performance, resulting in a compromised adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production \\[[@B4-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B7-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Subsequently, apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c are released into the cytoplasm from the mitochondrial intermembrane space due to the loss of MMP, and the caspase cascade is activated, which could eventually trigger apoptosis. Ultimately, intracellular ATP levels can also be used as an important index for assessing the homeostasis of the mitochondrial energy metabolism associated with oxidative stress \\[[@B8-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B9-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Although cells have various endogenous antioxidant protection systems to protect against the harmful effects of ROS, these enzymes cannot effectively eliminate excessive ROS generation. Therefore, a supplementation of antioxidants has been proposed as a strategy to prevent free radical accumulation through the activity of the signal pathway corresponding to the ROS production.\n\n【2】Glutathione (GSH) is a ubiquitous thiol-containing tripeptide that consists of L-cysteine, L-glutamic acid, and glycine, and it is one of the most studied cell antioxidants currently being researched \\[[@B10-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B11-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B12-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B13-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Many antioxidants used to block oxidative stress are chemically converted into oxidation products that react with glutathione to form glutathione adducts during the protection against free radicals \\[[@B14-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B15-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. These antioxidant defense effects of glutathione seem to play an important role in regulating cell proliferation and cell death through the mediation of the main redox regulatory signaling pathway in the cell \\[[@B10-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B16-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Previous studies have also shown that the supply of glutathione prevents cell damage due to oxidative stress, while the loss of the glutathione-dependent enzyme pathway due to reduced glutathione levels contributes to the onset and progression of many diseases \\[[@B15-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B17-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. In humans, GSH is the most abundant non-protein intracellular thiol present in 1-10 mM concentrations. However, a number of different pathological conditions are also associated with dysregulated GSH synthesis or alterations in its concentration, which can have potential applications as a marker for human disease \\[[@B18-antioxidants-08-00082]\\].\n\n【3】Recently, the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a leucine zipper redox-sensitive transcriptional regulator, has been reported to be involved in mitigating cellular damage induced by oxidative stress \\[[@B19-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Upon exposure to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it results in the transcriptional activation of antioxidant and detoxification genes. Since Nrf2 must be dissociated from kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1) in order to migrate to the nucleus, Keap1 acts as an inhibitor of Nrf2, which retains the Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm and prevents the transcription of downstream target genes \\[[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B21-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. As one of the Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective enzymes, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) acts as an important rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic conversion of heme to the bile pigments, such as biliverdin and bilirubin, and thus constitutes a major intracellular source of iron and carbon monoxide. This enzyme is also activated in response to various oxidative signals and provides adaptive and beneficial cellular responses to oxidative damage \\[[@B21-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B22-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. The fact that HO-1 acts as a cytoprotective enzyme has been suggested by observing that the increased expression of HO-1 can inhibit the formation of ROS due to oxidative stress \\[[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B21-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B22-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Therefore, HO-1 provides an adaptive cellular response to oxidative damage and is not limited to the degradation of toxic heme released by hemoproteins. In addition, HO-1 has been shown to further support the cellular protective role of this gene by inhibiting a variety of inflammatory responses including endotoxin shock \\[[@B21-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B22-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B23-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Although there is diverse evidence that Nrf2/HO-1 signaling protects against cell death by preventing excessive ROS generation under various oxidative stress conditions, evidence that its signaling is involved in overcoming oxidative stress by glutathione has not been well researched to date. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether glutathione ameliorates oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, H~2~O~2~)-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and whether the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway is involved in this process in RAW 264.7 macrophages.\n\n【4】2. Materials and Methods {#sec2-antioxidants-08-00082}\n========================\n\n【5】2.1. Cell Culture and Glutathione Treatment {#sec2dot1-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【6】RAW 264.7 cells were purchased from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Republic of Korea). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (all from WelGENE Inc. Daegu, Republic of Korea) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO~2~ atmosphere. Glutathione (reduced) was purchased from Daehan New Pharm Co. (Hwasung, Republic of Korea), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (pH 7.4, DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO, USA) and, prior to use in the experiments, diluted with a cell culture medium to adjust the final treatment concentrations (final concentration of DMSO, \\<0.05%). DMSO (\\<0.05%) alone did not have any effect on the parameters measured.\n\n【7】2.2. Cell Viability Assay {#sec2dot2-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-------------------------\n\n【8】For the cell viability study, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 200 μL in a 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 10^3^ cells per well. After a 24 h incubation, the cells were incubated with the control medium (0.05% DMSO) or different concentrations of H~2~O~2~ for another 24 h or pre-incubated with various concentrations of glutathione for 1 h before a 500 μM H~2~O~2~ treatment for 24 h. The cells were also treated with 10 μM zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.), a well-established HO-1 inhibitor, for 1 h in the presence or absence of H~2~O~2~. Subsequently, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) solution (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well incubated at 37°C for 3 h. After removing the medium, 200 µL of DMSO were added to each well to dissolve the formazan for 10 min. The effect for cell viability was assessed by measuring the optical density at a wavelength of 560 nm with a microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA). The experiment was repeated in triplicate and the cell viability was determined by dividing the absorbance values of the treated cells to that of untreated (control) cells.\n\n【9】2.3. Apoptosis Assay Using a Fluorescence Microscope {#sec2dot3-antioxidants-08-00082}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】In order to evaluate the induction of apoptosis by observing the morphological changes of nuclei, the cells were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min and stained with a solution of 1.0 mg/mL 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark, before being washed twice with PBS. The morphology changes in the nucleus were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 488 nm.\n\n【11】2.4. Apoptosis Analysis using a Flow Cytometer {#sec2dot4-antioxidants-08-00082}\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The extent of apoptosis was determined with a flow cytometer using annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining. In brief, the cells were resuspended in the supplied binding buffer and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) at room temperature for 20 min without light, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fluorescent intensities of the cells were detected with a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), and the acquisition was performed using Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). A schematic plot was used to display the results: the lower left quadrant represents live cells; the lower right and upper right quadrants represent early and late apoptotic cells, respectively; and the upper left quadrant represents necrotic cells. Apoptosis refers to the sum of early and late apoptotic cells.\n\n【13】2.5. Colony Formation Assay {#sec2dot5-antioxidants-08-00082}\n---------------------------\n\n【14】After the treatment with H~2~O~2~ for 24 h in the presence or absence of glutathione, a total of 500 cells per well were seeded in a 6-well plate in triplicate and maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO~2~ at 37 °C. After being cultured for two weeks, the colonies were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with 0.1% purple-violet solution (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) for 10 min. After washing by PBS, the colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted and photographed under an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss).\n\n【15】2.6. HO-1 Activity Assay {#sec2dot6-antioxidants-08-00082}\n------------------------\n\n【16】In order to measure the HO-1 enzyme activity, lysates of cells were prepared according to a previous study \\[[@B24-antioxidants-08-00082]\\], and homogenates containing biliverdin reductase were obtained from rat liver. The lysates and the homogenates were treated with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and hemin for 1 h, while blank samples contained only hemin. The concentration of bilirubin degraded by HO-1 from hemin was determined as the difference in absorbance at 464 and 530 nm using a microplate reader. The HO-1 activity was expressed as picomoles of bilirubin per milligram of protein.\n\n【17】2.7. Measurement of ROS Level {#sec2dot7-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】To measure the formation of intracellular ROS, RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates with a density of 3 × 10^5^ cells per well for 24 h and treated with or without glutathione for 1 h before adding H~2~O~2~ for a further 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in PBS, and stained with 10 μM of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) for 20 min at 37 °C, away from light. The relative fluorescent intensity of the cell suspensions was measured with a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For the image analysis of the intracellular ROS production, the cells were seeded on coverslip-loaded 6-well plates. After 24 h of plating, the cells were treated with glutathione, and 1 h later, H~2~O~2~ was added to the plate for 1 h. After washing with PBS, 10 μM DCF-DA was loaded into the wells and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 20 min. The stained cells were washed and mounted on a microscope slide using a mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.), and the images were visualized using a fluorescence microscope at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm.\n\n【19】2.8. Western Blot Analysis {#sec2dot8-antioxidants-08-00082}\n--------------------------\n\n【20】After being subjected to the necessary experimental treatments, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed with a lysis buffer for 30 min to extract whole-cell proteins, as described in the previous study \\[[@B25-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. The cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted using an NE-PER™ Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the extracted proteins were quantified using a Bio-Rad protein analysis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of each protein (40 μg) were separated by sodium-dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) for 1 h in a mixture of Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies against Nrf2, Keap1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 and lamin B were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA). The antibody for phosphor (p)-Nrf2 was obtained from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, UK). The primary antibodies against the histone variant H2A.X (ãH2A.X) and p-ãH2A.X were purchased from Cell signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Anti-HO-1 and anti-actin antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co. (San Diego, CA, USA) and Bioworld Technology, Inc. (St Louis Park, MN, USA), respectively. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 2 h at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS. The protein bands were visualized by incubating the membranes in an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Westborough, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n【21】2.9. Determination of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) {#sec2dot9-antioxidants-08-00082}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】The BIOXYTECH^®^ 8-OHdG-EIA™ kit (OXIS Health Products Inc. Portland, OR, USA) was used for the quantitative measurement of the oxidative DNA damage. Briefly, after the necessary experimental treatment, the cellular DNA was isolated using a DNA extraction kit (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc. Sungnam, Republic of Korea), following the manufacturer's protocol, and quantified. The quantity of 8-OHdG, a deoxyriboside form of 8-oxoguanine, in the DNA, was determined by a calculation on a standard curve measured at 450 nm absorbance using a microplate reader, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n【23】2.10. Comet Assay for DNA Damage {#sec2dot10-antioxidants-08-00082}\n--------------------------------\n\n【24】The alkaline comet assay was performed to assess the oxidative DNA damage in individual cells, as previously described \\[[@B25-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. After the respective treatments, the cells were detached from the culture surface, mixed with 0.75% low-melting agarose (LMA) and dropped gently onto a microscope slide precoated with a layer of 0.75% normal-melting agarose. After the gel was formed, the cover slip was removed and the cell suspension was mixed with the LMA. The slides were then immersed in a lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mM Tris, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% DMSO, pH 10) for 1 h at 4 °C and electrophoresed in an alkaline electrophoresis solution (300 mM NaOH, 10 mM Na-EDTA, pH 10) for 20 min at 4 °C to allow DNA unwinding under alkaline/neutral conditions by incubating for 20 min. Thereafter, electrophoresis was carried out in the same buffer for 20 min at 4 °C to draw the negatively-charged DNA toward the anode. After electrophoresis, the slides were rinsed gently three times with a neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min at 25 °C. The slides were stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr, 40 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) and were observed under a fluorescence microscope, at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. All of the above steps were conducted under yellow light to prevent additional DNA damage.\n\n【25】2.11. Measurement of MMP (Δψm) {#sec2dot11-antioxidants-08-00082}\n------------------------------\n\n【26】To measure the loss of MMP, the cells were collected and incubated in media containing 10 μM of 5,5′6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-imidacarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.), which is a mitochondria-specific fluorescent dye, for 20 min at room temperature in darkness. After washing twice with PBS to remove unbound dye, the green (JC-1 monomers) and red (JC-1 aggregates) fluorescence ratio that monitored the proportion of mitochondrial depolarization was immediately acquired on a flow cytometer by following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n【27】2.12. Detection of ATP Levels {#sec2dot12-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-----------------------------\n\n【28】The levels of intracellular ATP were determined using a firefly-luciferase-based ATP bioluminescence assay kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells cultured under various conditions were lysed with the provided lysis buffer, and the collected supernatants were mixed with an equal amount of luciferase agent, which catalyzed the light production from the ATP and luciferin. The emitted light was immediately measured using a microplate luminometer, and the ATP level was calculated according to the ATP standard curve. The intracellular ATP levels were calculated as a percentage of the untreated control.\n\n【29】2.13. Colorimetric Assay of Caspase-3 Activity {#sec2dot13-antioxidants-08-00082}\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【30】Caspase-3 activities were assessed using a colorimetric assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Briefly, collected cells were lysed after treatments, and equal amounts of proteins (150 μg) were incubated with the supplied reaction buffer, which contained the caspase-3 substrates dithiothreitol and tetrapeptides \\[Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD)-p-nitroaniline (pNA)\\], for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark. Changes in absorbance at 405 nm were determined using a microplate luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results are presented as multiples of untreated control cell values.\n\n【31】2.14.

Results {#sec3-antioxidants-08-00082}\n==========\n\n【34】3.1. Glutathione Inhibits H~2~O~2~-Induced Cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot1-antioxidants-08-00082}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】To establish the experimental conditions, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with various concentrations of H~2~O~2~ for 24 h, and the MTT assay was performed. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}A, RAW 264.7 cells treated with concentrations of 200 μM or more showed a significant decrease in cell viability, but there was no significant change to the glutathione treatment up to 1 mg/mL compared with the control group (data not shown). Therefore, the H~2~O~2~ concentration for inducing oxidative stress was selected to be 500 μM, which showed a survival rate of about 60% compared with the untreated control cells. To evaluate the protective effect of glutathione on cytotoxicity induced by H~2~O~2~, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 0.8 mM, 1.6 mM, and 3.2 mM glutathione for 1 h before a treatment with 500 μM H~2~O~2,~ after which the cells were cultured for 24 h. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}B, the pretreatment with glutathione significantly restored the cell viability, as compared to H~2~O~2~ alone, in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\n【36】3.2. Glutathione Suppresses H~2~O~2~-Induced Apoptosis in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot2-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】DAPI staining and flow cytometry analyses were performed to investigate whether the cytoprotective effect of glutathione against H~2~O~2~ on RAW 264.7 cells was related to the suppression of apoptosis. The fluorescent images in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}A reveal that the control cells had intact nuclei, while the H~2~O~2~-treated cells showed significant chromatin condensation . However, morphological changes were markedly attenuated in the cells pretreated with glutathione before the treatment with H~2~O~2~. The results of the annexin V/PI double staining also showed that the pretreatment with glutathione significantly decreased the frequency of apoptosis in H~2~O~2~-stimulated cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). In addition, in cells treated with glutathione prior to H~2~O~2~ stimulation, the H~2~O~2~-induced colony formation was markedly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}C).\n\n【38】3.3. Glutathione Activates the Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in H~2~O~2~-Treated RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot3-antioxidants-08-00082}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】To investigate whether the anti-apoptotic activity of glutathione correlated with the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, the effect of glutathione on the expression of Nrf2 and its regulated gene HO-1 was determined. Our immunoblotting results showed that the expression of the HO-1 protein was not increased in the group treated with only glutathione at 1 mg/mL, but that it was slightly increased in the H~2~O~2~ only treatment group (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). However, the expression of HO-1 in H~2~O~2~-treated cells was significantly increased by the treatment with glutathione compared to the cells treated with H~2~O~2~ alone (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}A), and its enzymatic activity was also significantly increased (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). In addition, the enhanced expression and activity of HO-1 by glutathione was associated with an increase in the total protein expression of Nrf2 and its phosphorylation at serine 40 (p-Nrf2), whereas the expression of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, was reduced in a glutathione treatment concentration-dependent manner (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). Moreover, the increased Nrf2 expression in response to the H~2~O~2~ and/or glutathione treatment was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}C).\n\n【40】3.4. The Inhibition of H~2~O~2~-Induced ROS Generation by Glutathione is Attenuated by ZnPP in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot4-antioxidants-08-00082}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】We next investigated whether the protective effects of glutathione on the H~2~O~2~-induced cytotoxicity were due to a blockade of oxidative stress. As presented in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B, the production of ROS was markedly increased within 1 h in RAW 264.7 cells exposed to H~2~O~2~; however, the accumulation of ROS in the cells pretreated with glutathione was significantly reduced compared to the H~2~O~2~-only treatment. In the fluorescence microscope observations, we further confirmed that glutathione had a strong ROS scavenging effect (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Additionally, in order to determine whether glutathione-induced HO-1 activation was involved in the antioxidant activity of glutathione, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with ZnPP, an inhibitor of HO-1, and glutathione before being exposed to H~2~O~2~. As shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 4]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}, ZnPP abrogated the protective effects of glutathione on the H~2~O~2~-induced ROS production, indicating that the cytoprotective effects of glutathione on oxidative stress may be mediated by a ROS generation blockade through HO-1 activation.\n\n【42】3.5. The Blockade of H~2~O~2~-Induced DNA Damage by Glutathione is Reduced by ZnPP in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot5-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】We subsequently performed three assays to determine whether glutathione prevents DNA damage. Immunoblotting results showed a marked increase in γH2AX phosphorylation (p-γH2AX, at serine 139), one of the DNA strand break markers, in H~2~O~2~-stimulated cells compared to untreated control cells; however, the increased levels of p-γH2AX caused by H~2~O~2~ were suppressed almost to control levels in the presence of glutathione (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). In addition, the H~2~O~2~ treatment significantly increased the production of the 8-OHdG adduct, an oxidative stress-induced DNA damage marker, compared to the control group, but the pretreatment with glutathione significantly reduced the production of 8-OHdG by H~2~O~2~ (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). Furthermore, in the comet assay, another method for detecting DNA strand breaks, there was no smeared pattern of nuclear DNA in the untreated controls and the cells treated only with glutathione. However, in the H~2~O~2~-treated cells, the length of the comet tail clearly increased, which means that DNA damage occurred; and in glutathione pretreated cells, the tail length was obviously shorter than in the H~2~O~2~-treated cells (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 5]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"}C,D). On the other hand, ZnPP excluded some, but not all, of the protective effects of glutathione against H~2~O~2~-induced DNA damage, suggesting that the cytoprotective effect of glutathione on oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 cells is partially mediated through HO-1 induction.\n\n【44】3.6. The Reduction of H~2~O~2~-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction by Glutathione is Diminished by ZnPP in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot6-antioxidants-08-00082}\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】In order to examine the protective effect of glutathione on mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H~2~O~2~, MMP and intracellular ATP levels were evaluated. According to the results of JC-1 staining shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f006){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B, changes in the ratio of polarized and depolarized cell populations were observed in RAW 264.7 cells treated with H~2~O~2~, and the increase in the depolarized mitochondrial membrane was about 4 times higher than in the control group. Along with these results, the concentration of ATP in cells exposed to H~2~O~2~ was significantly decreased compared with cells cultured in the normal medium (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 6]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f006){ref-type=\"fig\"}C). Glutathione was able to prevent these changes, but the protective effects of glutathione were significantly abrogated in the presence of ZnPP, demonstrating that the activation of HO-1 was involved in this protective activity.\n\n【46】3.7. The Inhibitory Effect of Glutathione on the Change of Apoptosis Markers Genes by H~2~O~2~ is Reversed by ZnPP in RAW 264.7 Cells {#sec3dot7-antioxidants-08-00082}\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of the apoptosis-protective effect of glutathione and the role of HO-1, we examined the effects of glutathione and ZnPP on H~2~O~2~-induced changes of the apoptosis-regulated gene expression. The immunoblotting results shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f007){ref-type=\"fig\"}A demonstrate that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was significantly down-regulated in H~2~O~2~-treated RAW 264.7 cells, while the pro-apoptotic Bax protein remained unchanged. Additionally, the expression of pro-caspase-3 was markedly reduced, and its activity was increased about 4 times in the H~2~O~2~-treated cells as compared with the control. In addition, the expression of cleaved PARP, a representative substrate protein degraded by activated caspase-3, was also increased (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f007){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B). These changes resulting from the H~2~O~2~ treatment were relatively conservative in the cells that were pretreated with glutathione, but the protective potentials of glutathione disappeared under the condition in which the activation of HO-1 was suppressed. It is noteworthy that ZnPP also excluded the beneficial effects of glutathione on H~2~O~2~-induced apoptosis and survival reduction (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 7]</u>(#antioxidants-08-00082-f007){ref-type=\"fig\"}C,D), indicating that the protective role of glutathione was at least somewhat dependent on HO-1.\n\n【48】4. Discussion {#sec4-antioxidants-08-00082}\n=============\n\n【49】Glutathione is an endogenously produced non-enzymatic antioxidant that plays a critical role in regulating intracellular redox-sensitive signal transduction \\[[@B10-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B11-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B12-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B13-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B14-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B17-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. In particular, the depletion of glutathione has been proposed as an early event prior to the initiation of apoptosis by oxidants inducing the ROS production, while the supplementation of glutathione has the effect of preventing such apoptosis \\[[@B15-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B16-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B18-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. However, the role of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in relation to the cytoprotective effect of glutathione against oxidative stress has not been well studied. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether glutathione is effective in preventing oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity through Nrf2-mediated HO-1 activation. The results of the present study demonstrated that the supplementation of exogenous glutathione prevented H~2~O~2~-induced apoptosis through the rescue of the mitochondrial function by blocking the ROS accumulation. It was also found that glutathione promoted the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and that the inhibition of the HO-1 activity eliminated the protective effect of glutathione, suggesting that the protective effects of glutathione in RAW 264.7 cells were, at least, HO-1 dependent.\n\n【50】As is well known, the mechanism of Nrf2 induction is dependent on the inducers and cell types, but Nrf2 plays a central role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by regulating the transcriptional activity of antioxidant genes, including HO-1 \\[[@B19-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Similar to the results of this study, previous studies have shown that H~2~O~2~ can enhance the expression of HO-1 \\[[@B26-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B27-antioxidants-08-00082]\\], and the up-regulation of HO-1 has been identified as a defense mechanism against H~2~O~2~-induced apoptosis in a variety of cell types \\[[@B22-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B26-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. The overexpression of HO-1 has also exhibited resistance to DNA damage and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress \\[[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B23-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B28-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]; however, the inhibition of HO-1 activity improved cytotoxicity against oxidative stress and reduced the efficacy of antioxidants \\[[@B29-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B30-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Our results show that H~2~O~2~ alone partially increases the expression of HO-1 as well as the expression of Nrf2, but the expression of both proteins and the activity of HO-1 were further markedly increased by the co-treatment with glutathione when compared to cells treated with H~2~O~2~ alone. In addition, the expression of p-Nrf2, an active form of Nrf2, was also significantly increased under the same conditions, which was related to the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Therefore, we hypothesized that the induction of HO-1 by glutathione could block DNA damage and the apoptosis of RAW 264.7 cells caused by oxidative stress by blocking ROS generation. In this study, we also investigated the effects of ZnPP, an HO-1 specific inhibitor, on the inhibitory effect of glutathione on the ROS production in H~2~O~2~-treated cells and observed that the inhibition of the ROS production by glutathione was abolished by the ZnPP treatment. These results suggest that the protective effect of glutathione on H~2~O~2~-induced oxidative stress is mediated through the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of glutathione on H~2~O~2~-induced DNA damage was significantly reduced by ZnPP, which also implies that the protective role of glutathione on H~2~O~2~-induced cytotoxicity was dependent on HO-1.\n\n【51】Most experimental evidence supports the role of mitochondria as the main target intracellular organelle for H~2~O~2~ toxicity, and excessive ROS accumulation due to oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms leading to apoptosis associated with mitochondrial injury \\[[@B1-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B2-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. In addition, the activation of HO-1 may also lead to the inactivation of the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. It has been recognized as a cell protection mechanism for oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction \\[[@B20-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B23-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. In the induction of ROS-mediated apoptosis, ROS overload causes the free radical attack of the membrane phospholipid, which in turn leads to a mitochondrial membrane depolarization resulting in the loss of MMP. This is considered to be the onset of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway \\[[@B4-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B31-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. At the same time, mitochondrial dysfunction promotes abnormalities in the mitochondrial respiratory chain's electron transport pathways, ultimately interfering with the intracellular ATP production \\[[@B5-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B32-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Consistent with previous studies \\[[@B33-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B34-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B35-antioxidants-08-00082]\\], current studies have shown that when cells are exposed to H~2~O~2~, the MMP levels and ATP content are significantly reduced compared to controls, whereas the co-treatment with glutathione significantly reverses the H~2~O~2~-induced loss of MMP and APT. However, in the presence of ZnPP, the glutathione-mediated repair of the mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased production of ATP were significantly diminished. In view of maintaining energy homeostasis, these results are in good agreement with previous studies showing that the protective effects of apoptosis against oxidative stress are related to the maintenance of the ATP production through the preservation of the mitochondrial function \\[[@B36-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B37-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B38-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. We therefore consider that the conservation of the ATP production due to the retention of the mitochondrial function is one possible mechanism by which glutathione can preserve the cell survival pathway from oxidative stress through HO-1 activation.\n\n【52】The activation of caspase-9 by the release of apoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm due to the loss of MMP is a major initial step in the initiation of a caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway \\[[@B39-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B40-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Also, the activation of caspase-9 ultimately activates downstream effector caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7, eventually leading to cell death. This process is accompanied by the degradation of the substrate proteins of effector caspases such as PARP, and the fragmentation of these proteins is used as evidence that caspase-dependent apoptosis is induced \\[[@B39-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B41-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. The activation of caspase is regulated by various proteins, including Bcl-2 family members consisting of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins. Among the Bcl-2 family members, anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane to prevent the release of apoptogenic factors and provide protection by inhibiting the consumption of ATP \\[[@B41-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B42-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. On the other hand, pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, antagonize anti-apoptotic proteins or translocate to mitochondrial membranes to form membrane-integrated homo-oligomers that induce mitochondrial pore formation, leading to the loss of MMP and resulting in the cytosolic release of apoptotic factors \\[[@B43-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B44-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Therefore, the balance of apoptotic Bax family proteins to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins serves as a determinant of the induction or inhibition of the activation of the caspase cascade for the initiation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Many previous studies have shown that the induction of apoptosis by H~2~O~2~ in RAW 264.7 cells was associated with a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and/or activation of caspases \\[[@B45-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B46-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. However, several natural antioxidant products that can protect against H~2~O~2~-mediated cytotoxicity have altered this tendency \\[[@B47-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B48-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Consistent with previous findings, our results showed that the decreased expression of Bcl-2 in H~2~O~2~-treated RAW 264.7 cells was reverted in the presence of glutathione. In addition, the H~2~O~2~-induced activation of caspase-3 and the degradation of PARP were also blocked by glutathione administration concomitant with increased cell viability and reduced apoptosis. In this respect, it is suggested that glutathione can rescue H~2~O~2~-induced cytotoxic injury in RAW 264.7 cells by blocking mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis. However, these protective effects of glutathione against H~2~O~2~ were markedly hindered by the inhibition of the HO-1 function by an HO-1 inhibitor. These results are in good agreement with other recent studies showing that HO-1 restored cell survival through the prevention of oxidative damage-mediated apoptosis \\[[@B34-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B49-antioxidants-08-00082],[@B50-antioxidants-08-00082]\\]. Therefore, although further studies on the relevance of multiple GSH-dependent enzymes should be undertaken, the current results indicate that the cellular protective potential of glutathione against oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 cells is at least dependent on the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.\n\n【53】5. Conclusions {#sec5-antioxidants-08-00082}\n==============\n\n【54】In conclusion, the present study confirms that exogenous glutathione can effectively prevent RAW 264.7 cells from H~2~O~2~-induced cytotoxicity by blocking oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage and the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, which was associated with the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Although studies on mitochondrial damage-associated energy metabolism and glutathione downstream signal molecules are needed, these findings may be presented as additional evidence that the intracellular uptake of glutathione can alter the redox state of cells and thereby regulate cellular antioxidant signaling pathways.\n\n【55】Conceptualization, H.J.C. and Y.H.C.; methodology, D.H.K.

We investigated the possibility of monitoring an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using DNA methylation changes of an oxidative stress response element in the promoter region of an enzymatic antioxidant gene. Using DNA extracted from blood leukocytes, the cytosine phosphodiester bond guanine positions of an overlapping CCAAT box/metal response element (CGATTGGCTG) of the glutathione peroxidase 3 promoter activated by oxidative stimuli and expressed in plasma were analysed for methylation changes in 20 newborns with hyperphenylalaninemia and 20 healthy controls.

Understanding how ZIKV could evade the innate immune defenses of the mother, placenta, and fetus has become central to determining how the virus can traffic into the fetal brain. ZIKV, like other flaviviruses, evades host innate immune responses by leveraging viral proteins and other processes that occur during viral replication to allow spread to the placenta. Within the placenta, there are diverse cell types with coreceptors for ZIKV entry, creating an opportunity for the virus to establish a reservoir for replication and infect the fetus. The fetal brain is vulnerable to ZIKV, particularly during the first trimester, when it is beginning a dynamic process, to form highly complex and specialized regions orchestrated by neuroprogenitor cells. In this review, we provide a conceptual framework to understand the different routes for viral trafficking into the fetal brain and the eye, which are most likely to occur early and later in pregnancy. Based on the injury profile in human and nonhuman primates, ZIKV entry into the fetal brain likely occurs across both the blood/cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the choroid plexus and the blood/brain barrier. ZIKV can also enter the eye by trafficking across the blood/retinal barrier. Ultimately, the efficient escape of innate immune defenses by ZIKV is a key factor leading to viral infection. However, the host immune response against ZIKV can lead to injury and perturbations in developmental programs that drive cellular division, migration, and brain growth. The combined effect of innate immune evasion to facilitate viral propagation and the maternal/placental/fetal immune response to control the infection will determine the extent to which ZIKV can injure the fetal brain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Analysis revealed that children exposed to the resource recalled significantly more hazards and made more comparisons to their own farm experiences than controls. However, differences on individual achievement were observed between groups due to a lack of randomisation.

EFT is higher in children with CAH than in healthy children and correlated with carotid intima media thickness, left ventricular mass and mitral deceleration time. EFT may be used as a possible marker of early atherosclerosis and myocardial function in children with CAH.\n\n【5】Introduction {#s2}\n============\n\n【6】Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from mutations in enzymes required for adrenal steroid synthesis ([@ref1]). Defects in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, leading to enzyme deficiency, are responsible for approximately 95% of cases ([@ref2]). CAH is commonly divided into the severe classical and the milder nonclassical form. Classical CAH is generally subdivided, depending on the extent of enzymatic impairment, into the salt-wasting (SW) form, presenting with both cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and the simple virilizing (SV) form, characterized by an isolated cortisol deficiency. Both conditions are associated with androgen excess resulting in virilization of female external genitalia ([@ref3]). Researchers have long thought that patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases due to the resulting high plasma levels of androgens and/or the harmful effects of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid treatment ([@ref4]). 21-hydroxylase deficiency may also have detrimental effects on vascular structures as well as ventricular systolic and diastolic function ([@ref5]). Obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance (IR) have been found to be associated with both CAH itself and the treatment strategies ([@ref6]).\n\n【7】Few studies have utilized carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) to assess vascular structural changes in children with CAH ([@ref4],[@ref5],[@ref7]). A hindrance to the wider use of CA-IMT measurements in the pediatric population is the lack of standardization of CA-IMT values in this age group ([@ref8]). Epicardial fat thickness (EFT) is a layer of adipose tissue surrounding the heart and coronary vessels which can be measured by ultrasound, a simple, noninvasive procedure ([@ref9]). EFT is a reliable and sensitive marker of cardiovascular risk and has become an emerging target for therapeutic and medical interventions ([@ref10]). We are not aware of any published data on EFT in children with CAH.\n\n【8】The aim of this study was to evaluate the EFT measurement and its relation to CA-IMT and left ventricular function in a cohort of children with classical CAH.\n\n【9】Methods {#s3}\n=======\n\n【10】Patients and Methods {#s3a}\n--------------------\n\n【11】This cross-sectional, controlled study included 36 children (11 males and 25 females; mean ± standard deviation age=13.7±2.4 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of classic CAH ([@ref4]). Diagnosis was made based on clinical signs and biochemical assessment \\[elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione and testosterone, in addition to low cortisol\\]. SW was diagnosed in patients with frank hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia accompanied by low plasma aldosterone and elevated rennin concentrations ([@ref11]). Patients were included if they were on glucocorticoid therapy for a minimum of five years. They were recruited during the period between January and December 2017 from the Pediatric Endocrinology Unit of Assiut University Children Hospital, Assiut, Egypt. Patients who had chest deformities, chronic lung disease, poor echo window, pericardial and/or pleural effusion on transthoracic echocardiography were excluded. Thirty six healthy children (7 males and 27 females) matched for age, gender, pubertal status and socioeconomic status were recruited as control subjects from the General Pediatric Outpatient Clinic of the same hospital. None of the controls were hypertensive and none were smokers, on any medication, or had a chronic illness. Controls were attending the outpatient clinic either because of minor illness or accompanying their sick siblings. All patients had classical CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (SW n=30; SV n=6) and were receiving glucocorticoid substitution therapy with hydrocortisone (HC) (n=30) or prednisone (PR) (n=6). PR dose was converted to HC using the conversion assumption that 20 mg of HC is equivalent to 5 mg of PR ([@ref12]). SW patients were also on 9-alphafludrocortisone therapy at a dose of 50-100 ug/m2/day. The adequacy of steroid therapy was monitored periodically during follow-up visits every 3-6 months by clinical parameters, such as signs of androgen excess, growth curves, bone age and hormonal assay ([@ref13]). Patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of control on medical treatment, that is those patients with acceptable disease control and children with poor disease control, based on the previously mentioned data ([@ref14]).\n\n【12】The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Assiut University Children Hospital, Assiut, Egypt (approval number: 312/2017) and also by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants.\n\n【13】All patients and controls were subjected to a full medical history-taking as well as a thorough clinical examination. Demographic and clinical data included age, gender, duration of treatment, type and dose of steroids, blood pressure (BP), height, weight and body mass index (BMI). Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured in all subjects in the right arm with a standard sphygmomanometer (Exacta) by the same operator. Height and weight were measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer (seca 213 l) and a calibrated weight scale (Uline Industrial Platform Scales), with the child wearing underwear only. BMI was calculated using the following formula: BMI=weight (kg)/height (m)^2^. BMI was expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) using the Egyptian Growth Reference Data ([@ref15]). Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lower edge of the ribs in the midaxillary line and the top of the iliac crest by the same clinician. Waist-to-height ratio was then calculated as an index of visceral adiposity. Pubertal status was assessed according to Tanner staging ([@ref16]). A radiograph of the left hand was used to determine BA using the Greulich-Pyle method ([@ref17]). This assessment was made in a blinded fashion by a single pediatric endocrinologist. BA was defined as advanced when greater than the subject's chronological age by one year or more ([@ref18]).\n\n【14】Blood samples were drawn after an overnight fast for at least 12 hours at 8.00-10.00 a.m. before the first dose of steroids for assessment of serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glucose and insulin. Serum TG and TC were assessed by quantitative enzymatic colorimetric technique (Bio Merieux-Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd. Charlottetown, CA, USA). Serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were measured by the phosphotungstate precipitation method (Biomerieux kit, Marcy L'etoile, Craponne, France). LDL cholesterol was calculated by Friedewald's formula: (TC) - (HDL-C) - 1/5 (TG) ([@ref19]). IR was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) equation formula:\n\n【15】HOMA-IR=Fasting insulin (uU/mL) multiplied by fasting glucose (mmol/L) divided by 22.5.\n\n【16】A cut-off level of 2.7 was used for diagnosing IR as previously described ([@ref20]). ACTH, plasma 17-OHP, serum cortisol, androstenedione and testosterone were also measured with commercially available RIA kits (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Los Angeles, CA, USA). The plasma level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured using the hsCRP enzyme immunoassay test (ELISA) kit for quantitative determination of the CRP concentration in human serum (catalog no. E29-056; Immunospec Corp. Canoga Park, CA, USA).\n\n【17】Echocardiographic Examination {#s3b}\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】All echocardiographic examinations were performed according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography ([@ref21]). A Philips Envisor Ultrasound System with a S4-2 Broadband Sector (Philips Medical Systems, Inc. Netherlands) was used. Measurements were performed using the machine's incorporated analysis package. An M-mode echocardiography was obtained at the left sternal border. Left ventricular (LV) dimension, LV fractional shortening (FS) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were measured. LV mass index (LVMI) was measured using a LVMI calculator. LV diastolic function was evaluated by mitral inflow velocities obtained in the apical four-chamber view. Mitral filling was assessed with the peak velocity of the transmitral early filling wave (E) and the peak velocity of atrial late filling (A) and the ratio of both (E/A) was calculated. The interval from the early peak velocity to the zero intercept of the extrapolated deceleration time (DcT) slope (early filling mitral DcT) was measured. The interval between the end of the LV outflow velocity and the onset of mitral inflow \\[isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)\\] obtained by pulsed-wave Doppler with the cursor placed in the LV out-flow near the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, was measured from the end of the LV ejection to the onset of the mitral inflow.\n\n【19】Epicardial Fat Thickness Measurement {#s3c}\n------------------------------------\n\n【20】A two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram, using a standardised procedure, was performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. EFT thickness was measured by an experienced pediatric echocardiologist, who was blinded to the subjects' clinical and demographic data, using the procedure validated by Iacobellis et al ([@ref9]). EFT was identified as the echolucent region between the external wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of the pericardium (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). This thickness was measured perpendicularly on the free wall of the right ventricle at the end of systole over three cardiac cycles, using a parasternal long and a parasternal short axis. The average value of the three cardiac cycles from each echocardiographic view was used for the statistical analysis.\n\n【21】Carotid Intima Media Thickness Measurement {#s3d}\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】All participants underwent an ultrasound scan to measure CA-IMT. The studies were performed in the morning between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. after the children had fasted overnight. All ultrasound scans were performed by an experienced vascular operator who was unaware of the subject's clinical details. Examination of CA-IMT was manually performed using a color duplex flow imaging system (Acuson 128 XP; Acuson Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). The examinations were performed while the patients were in a supine position, with their necks slightly extended and their heads turned 450 away from the examination side. From both sides of the head, three images were obtained from the distal common carotid artery, 1-2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb at end diastole. These images were then stored for later offline analyses. All studies were done according to a predetermined, standardized scanning protocol for the right and left carotid arteries ([@ref22]). All measurements were performed in all participants by the same pediatric cardiologist who was blinded to the clinical and treatment status of the study participants. Reliability of echocardiographic measurements of CA-IMT and EFT were assessed by intra-observer correlation coefficient in all subjects.\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis {#s3e}\n--------------------\n\n【24】Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as means + standard deviation. Comparisons of quantitative variables between the study groups were made using the paired Student t-test. Correlations between EFT and demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were assessed using Pearson test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors that were significantly associated with high EFT. The odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and significances were calculated. For all tests, values of p\\<0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n【25】Results {#s4}\n=======\n\n【26】Demographic and anthropometric data of the patients and controls are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t1){ref-type=\"table\"}. Bone age in the patient group was advanced by an average of two years compared with chronological age. Compared with healthy controls, children with CAH exhibited increased visceral adiposity, as suggested by higher values of BMI SDS, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist to height ratio. Moreover, CAH children had higher SBP and DBP, although all children had blood pressures within the normal ranges.\n\n【27】Laboratory data of the patients and controls are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#t2){ref-type=\"table\"}. Concentrations of TC, TG, LDL-C, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, hsCRP, 17-OHP, androstenedione and testosterone were significantly higher while concentration of HDL-C was significantly lower in CAH patients compared to control subjects. HOMA-IR values were also significantly higher in the patients compared with controls.\n\n【28】The results of echocardiographic EFT and CA-IMT examinations are shown in 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#t3){ref-type=\"table\"}. There were no significant differences in EF and FS values between patients and control subjects. However, compared to control subjects, patients had higher LVMI value, indicating myocardial hypertrophy, and lower E/A ratio, higher IVRT values and prolonged mitral DcT, indicating impaired diastolic function and increased CA-IMT and higher EFT. Intra-observer agreement on CA-IMT and EFT measurements were excellent. Intra-observer correlation coefficient was 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, indicating excellent reproducibility of these measures. Compared to patients who were well controlled (n=16), patients who were uncontrolled (n=20) were older, had advanced bone ages and had higher levels of 17-OHP, testosterone and hsCRP. In addition poorly controlled patients had higher values of LVMI, mitral DcT, EFT and CA-IMT (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>(#t4){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【29】EFT thickness showed a statistically significant positive correlation with BMI, waist circumference, SBP, DBP, HOMA-IR, hsCRP, 17-OHP, testosterone, LVMI, mitral DcT and CA-IMT (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 5]</u>(#t5){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【30】Multivariate analysis in children with CAH revealed that EFT was significantly correlated with waist circumference, 17-OHP, HOMA-IR, testosterone, mitral DcT, CA-IMT and LVMI (see 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 6]</u>(#t6){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n【31】Discussion {#s5}\n==========\n\n【32】This study demonstrates that a) children with classical CAH may have subclinical LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and subclinical atherosclerosis; b) EFT was higher in patients with CAH than in the healthy controls; c) EFT is correlated to carotid intima media thickness, LV mass and mitral DcT suggesting that EFT may be used as an additional marker of endothelial and myocardial dysfunction in children with CAH. The classical cardiovascular risk factors in children with CAH, namely obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, steroid treatment and others have been extensively discussed elsewhere ([@ref4],[@ref5],[@ref6]).\n\n【33】To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that EFT was significantly increased in children with classical CAH compared with control children (p\\<0.001). In addition, we showed that EFT was correlated positively with CA-IMT. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the CA-IMT was the variable that most influenced EFT. EFT was reported to be increased in children with a positive family history of type 2 DM and has been suggested as a risk factor for early atherosclerosis ([@ref23]). A meta-analysis showed that EFT may be an effective marker for the prediction of coronary heart disease ([@ref24]). Epicardial fat is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD) as it releases a wide range of biologically active molecules that modulate vascular smooth-muscle contraction ([@ref25]). The paracrine effects of these molecules might be attributable to their location being close to the adventitia and extravascular bed ([@ref26]). Gastaldelli and Basta ([@ref27]) reported the existence of a link between epicardial fat and hypertension, atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Several studies have emphasized the link between EFT and the severity of CAD ([@ref28]). Epicardial fat has an important role in the inflammatory process within the atherosclerotic plaque ([@ref29]). Furthermore, it has been shown that epicardial fat products induce increased cell surface expression of adhesion molecules, enhance adhesion of monocytes to coronary artery endothelial cells, and facilitate migration of adherent monocytes ([@ref30]).\n\n【34】Echocardiographic EFT measurements, provide some advantages when used to assess the cardiometabolic risk. They are objective, quantified, non-invasive, low cost, have routine applicability, avoid exposure to radiation and have a potential for monitoring therapeutic effects. They may also be used as a simple marker for identification of CAH patients with higher cardiovascular risk who may need further cardiac evaluation ([@ref31]).\n\n【35】In the present study, children with CAH had echocardiographic changes indicating the presence of LV hypertrophy, as indicated by increased LVMI. Moreover, our study showed significant positive correlations between EFT and LVMI that remained significant after regression analysis, which suggested a detrimental effect of EFT excess on the myocardium of patients with CAH. This is in agreement with Corradi et al ([@ref32]) who reported that EFT levels have an important role in LV hypertrophy. Some mechanisms may be suggested to explain this correlation. It could be assumed that the increased visceral fat directly effects LV output and stroke volume to perfuse the increased body mass. Additionally, the biochemical properties of visceral adipose tissue, such as increased IR, high free fatty acids (FFA) levels, and adrenergic activity, could contribute to LV hypertrophy ([@ref33]).\n\n【36】In the present study, children with CAH had echocardiographic changes indicating presence of diastolic dysfunction (as evidenced by reduced E/A ratio and prolonged IVRT and mitral DcT). Regression analysis revealed that EFT in CAH patients correlates with mitral DcT. This is in agreement with the study of Van der Meer ([@ref34]) which showed that myocardial fat has progressive and harmful effects on LV diastolic function. Diastolic dysfunction has been considered as one of the first echocardiographic abnormalities to appear in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a high rate of release of FFA ([@ref35]), which encounter no physical barrier or fascia before reaching the cardiomyocytes ([@ref36]). Therefore, the myocardium receives a double dose of FFA from both the epicardial fat and the systemic circulation. Epicardial fat is a source of several bioactive molecules that might directly influence the myocardium ([@ref37]). In metabolic and cardiovascular disease states, these fat tissues expand, becoming hypoxic and dysfunctional and recruiting phagocytic cells which would lead to a reduction in the production of protective cytokines and, eventually, impaired cardiac function ([@ref38],[@ref39]).\n\n【37】BMI and waist circumference are widely accepted measures of generalized adiposity. However they are poor indicators for visceral obesity. It is well known that visceral adipose tissue accumulation is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In this study, we found a very good correlation between EFT and waist circumference by multiple regression analysis in children with CAH. However we did not find a significant correlation between BMI-SDS and EFT. These findings suggest that waist circumference is a better anthropometric cardiovascular risk predictor and support the evidence that EFT is related to visceral fat, rather than total adiposity ([@ref40]). Mavri et al ([@ref41]) suggested that CA-IMT regression may also be achieved by weight reduction programs. Altin et al ([@ref42]) suggested that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy induced weight loss results in regression of CA-IMT and EFT. Marked adipose mass reduction is associated with dramatic changes in circulating adipokine levels, with leptin reduction and adiponectin increase, thereby leading to a reduced leptin/adiponectin ratio. Of note, such a ratio was found to be directly correlated with CA-IMT in male subjects ([@ref43]).\n\n【38】Testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in our subjects with CAH compared to controls, particularly in children who were poorly controlled on medical treatment. In addition, testosterone correlated positively and significantly with EFT. Colgecen et al ([@ref44]) reported that subjects in advanced stages of androgenetic alopecia had higher echocardiographically measured EFT than controls. Moreover, Cakir et al ([@ref45]) reported a strong positive correlation between testosterone concentrations and EFT in patients with polycystic ovarian disease. This finding suggests that androgen excess may be responsible for the increased EFT in patients with CAH. Physicians treating these patients should be aware that amelioration of androgen excess in patients with CAH should also be considered as a way to prevent cardiovascular symptoms and not only as a tool to improve hyperandrogenic symptoms.\n\n【39】In the present study, children with CAH had higher HOMA-IR than controls. EFT correlated positively and significantly with HOMA-IR by multiple regression analysis. This finding is in agreement with Manco et al ([@ref46]) who reported that epicardial fat is a significant marker of increased insulin resistance. These observations suggest that epicardial fat is a tissue with high IR ([@ref47]). EFT is associated with high lipolytic activity, probably because of the reduced antilipolytic effect of insulin in this tissue and an increased expression of B-adrenergic receptors, especially B-3 receptors. Stimulation by these receptors activates lipolysis and increases the release of FFAs which are able to promote blood pressure increase through different pathways, including adrenergic stimulation, increased oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and vascular cell growth ([@ref48]).\n\n【40】Study Limitations {#s5a}\n-----------------\n\n【41】We recognize that this study has some limitations such us; Due to the difficulties in enrolling and studying CAH children, the sample was relatively small in size and included patients with a wide age range. Due to the cross-sectional design, it is difficult to generalize the results to the general population. CA-IMT measurements were performed manually. We were not able to confirm EFT using the standard magnetic resonance imaging methods. However, echocardiographic calculation of epicardial fat has been reported to show good reliability when compared with magnetic resonance epicardial fat measurements ([@ref49]). Epicardial adipose tissue has a three-dimensional distribution. Therefore 2D echocardiography may not accurately reflect the total amount of epicardial adiposity.\n\n【42】Conclusions {#s6}\n===========\n\n【43】EFT is increased in children with classic CAH, particularly in those with poor control and is correlated with CA-IMT, LV mass and mitral DcT. Measurement of EFT by echocardiography in CAH children may help to identify those at high risk of developing LV dysfunction and subclinical atherosclerosis. Future prospective and multicenter studies are required to confirm our results.\n\n【44】Ethics\n\n【45】Ethics Committee Approval: The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Assiut University Children Hospital, Assiut, Egypt (approval number: 312/2017).\n\n【46】Informed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants.\n\n【47】Peer-review: Externally peer-reviewed.\n\n【48】Authorship Contributions\n\n【49】Surgical and Medical Practices: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Concept: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Design: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Data Collection or Processing: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Analysis or Interpretation: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Abdelrahman Abdelhamid, Literature Search: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly, Writing: Kotb Abbass Mewalley, Hekma Saad Farghaly.\n\n【50】Financial Disclosure: The authors declared that this study received no financial support.\n\n【51】###### Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data of the congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients compared with controls\n\n【52】![](JCRPE-11-61-g2)\n\n【53】###### Laboratory data of the congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients compared with controls\n\n【54】![](JCRPE-11-61-g3)\n\n【55】###### The echocardiographic, carotid artery intima-media thickness and epicardial fat thickness findings in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients compared to controls\n\n【56】![](JCRPE-11-61-g4)\n\n【57】###### The demographic, laboratory and echocardiographic characteristics of patients, according to the degree of control on medical treatment\n\n【58】![](JCRPE-11-61-g5)\n\n【59】###### The correlation between epicardial fat thickness and anthropometric, laboratory and echocardiographic data in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n【60】![](JCRPE-11-61-g6)\n\n【61】###### Multivariate correlation coefficients between epicardial fat thickness and various confounding variables in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n【62】![](JCRPE-11-61-g7)\n\n【63】![Echocardiographic imaging of the epicardial fat](JCRPE-11-61-g1){#f1}", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

A chemically obtained biantennary heptasaccharide-azide was reduced and acylated with a 6-aminohexanoyl spacer. Elongation of the deprotected heptasaccharide using glycosyltransferases yielded a biantennary nonasaccharide with terminal galactose residues and two undecasaccharides terminating with alpha 2,6- or alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid. The free amino group of the spacer of these oligosaccharides was converted into an isothiocyanate. Its subsequent coupling to bovine serum albumin gave neoglycoproteins with a yield of 2.4-3.6 glycan chains per carrier molecule. This versatile synthetic pathway allows employment of a wide variety of complex-type glycans, which can be introduced to various test systems in vitro and in vivo to evaluate potential biomedical applications. Solid-phase assays with biotinylated sugar receptors revealed discriminatory binding properties of the three neoglycoproteins, especially for the mistletoe lectin. This direct assay system is preferable to the measurement of inhibitory capacities with respect to model ligands. Ligand type- and cell type-dependent quantitative differences in the binding properties of the probes were detected by FACScan analyses with a panel of tumor cell lines and by monitoring of staining in tissue sections for small cell and non-small-cell lung cancer and mesotheliomas. Biodistribution of iodinated neoglycoproteins in mice gave a prolonged presence of the sialylated probes in serum. Relative to the nonasaccharide, the uptake, especially of the iodinated neoglycoprotein with alpha 2,3-sialylated ligand chains, was clearly elevated in mice for kidneys and Ehrlich tumors. On the basis of the documented feasibility of these applications, it is concluded that the further elaboration of glycan chain variants by the described synthetic approach in combination with the given test panel is warranted to evaluate the potential of complex glycan chain-carrying neoglycoproteins for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

However, those following the insertion of nasopharyngeal airways have not been studied. The aim of this investigation was to compare the cardiovascular responses to the insertion of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways in anaesthetized patients. Twenty-four ASA I or II patients aged 16-65 yr, requiring nasotracheal intubation as part of their anaesthetic management, received a standardized general anaesthetic and were randomly allocated to receive either a nasopharyngeal or an oropharyngeal airway. The two groups were similar with respect to age, weight and gender. There was a significant decrease in systolic pressure following the induction of anaesthesia in both groups. Following nasopharyngeal airway insertion, there was a significant rise in systolic pressure above pre-insertion levels (P< or =0.001), though not above pre-induction levels (P=0.808). There was no significant change in the oropharyngeal airway insertion group (P=0.619). At 1 min post-insertion, the mean (sd) systolic pressure in the nasopharyngeal insertion group, 122 (21.6) mm Hg, was significantly greater than that in the oropharyngeal insertion group, 103 (15.3) mm Hg (P=0.017).

The results show that these antibodies could not completely inhibit Coxsackievirus B3 and Coxsackievirus B5 binding or infectivity. Furthermore five new proteins have been identified that are used by Coxsackieviruses for binding to cardiac tissue and are distinct from CAR or CD55, leading us to believe that these viruses may use a different set of receptors for infection of cardiac muscle.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The present study was designed to determine whether tocotrienol has a direct cardioprotective role. Isolated rat hearts were perfused for 15 min with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer in the absence or presence of palm tocotrienol derived from the tocotrienol-rich fraction (0.035%) of palm oil (TRF). In another group of studies, the hearts were preperfused for 15 min in the presence of a c-Src inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo-3,4-d-pyrimidine (PPI). The hearts were then subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. As expected, ischemia-reperfusion caused ventricular dysfunction, electrical rhythm disturbances, and increased myocardial infarct size. PPI or TRF could reverse the ischemia-reperfusion-mediated cardiac dysfunction. Ischemia-reperfusion also upregulated c-Src expression and phosphorylation. Although TRF only minimally affected c-Src expression, it significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Src. Ischemia-reperfusion reduced 20S and 26S proteasome activities, an effect prevented by TRF pretreatment. PPI exerted a cardioprotective effect that is not mediated by the proteasome but, rather, through direct inhibition of c-Src. The results of this study support a role for c-Src in postischemic cardiac injury and dysfunction and demonstrate direct cardioprotective effects of TRF. The cardioprotective properties of TRF appear to be due to inhibition of c-Src activation and proteasome stabilization.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "d32331d4-8c6f-4ad4-a67c-90472cc37ed5", "title": "", "text": "【0】Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\n【1】Self-assembly of proteins into various complexes ranging from the nanometre to the micrometre scale is ubiquitous, and the resulting systems play pivotal roles in many biological processes^[@CR1]^. The process of self-assembly inherently defines the supramolecular structures of protein complexes, confers structural stability, and could include a regulatory dimension.\n\n【2】The bacterial microcompartment (BMC) is a paradigm of self-assembling macromolecular complexes and is a subcellular organelle assembled from many thousands of protein subunits of 10--20 distinct types^[@CR2]^. The BMC is composed of a single-layer protein shell that resembles an icosahedral viral capsid, with facets composed of hexameric and trimeric proteins and vertices capped by pentameric proteins, and internal enzymes encapsulated by the shell^[@CR3]--[@CR7]^. The shell proteins possess a central pore that is key to modulating passage of metabolites and thus facilitating the catalytic activities of internal enzymes^[@CR3],[@CR4],[@CR8]--[@CR10]^. In addition, segmenting and compartmentalising key enzymatic pathways inside the BMC permit enhanced metabolic performance and protect the cell from toxic or volatile intermediates. These organisational features allow BMCs to play critical roles in a range of biological processes, including CO~2~ fixation, pathogenesis, and microbial ecology, across a broad range of bacterial species^[@CR11]--[@CR13]^.\n\n【3】The anabolic carboxysome, the CO~2~-fixing organelle in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs, was the first BMC to be discovered^[@CR14]^. Other catabolic BMCs, or metabolosomes, have evolved for utilisation of diverse carbon sources, for example, the 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD)-utilising microcompartment (Pdu MCP) in Salmonella and other enteric bacteria, which plays vital roles in 1,2-PD degradation and enteric pathogenesis^[@CR9],[@CR15]--[@CR17]^. In Salmonella, the genes related to Pdu MCP formation and function are located in a single pdu operon that encodes a total of 22 proteins (Fig. [1a](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The shell of the Pdu MCP contains nine types of proteins: PduA, B, B', M, N, J, K, T, and U^[@CR16]^. PduA, B, B', and J are the major shell components, whereas PduK, M, N, T, and U have relatively low abundance in the Pdu MCP shell^[@CR18]^. Among the shell proteins, PduN forms pentamers occupying the vertices of the polyhedral structure^[@CR16],[@CR19]^. The Pdu MCP shell encapsulates enzymes and cofactors for 1,2-PD degradation^[@CR13]^ and confines propionaldehyde, a product of 1,2-PD degradation, to protect the bacterial cell from toxic sequelae^[@CR20]^. The catalytic enzymes of 1,2-PD degradation pathway consist of propanediol dehydratase (PduCDE), PduL, PduP, PduQ, and PduW. PduCDE (diol dehydratase) is the major enzyme in the organelle to catalyse the conversion of 1,2-PD to propionaldehyde^[@CR21]^. Propionaldehyde is then converted to propionyl coenzyme A (propionyl-CoA) or 1-propanol by PduP (aldehyde dehydrogenase) or PduQ (alcohol dehydrogenase), respectively^[@CR22],[@CR23]^. PduL catalyses the conversion of propionyl-CoA to propionyl-PO~4~^2- [@CR24]^, and PduW converts the resulting propionyl-PO~4~^2-^ to propionate, transferring the phosphate group to ADP to generate ATP^[@CR25]^. In addition, the 1,2-PD metabolism requires the enzymes for the reactivation of diol dehydratase and vitamin B~12~ recycling, including PduS (cobalamin reductase)^[@CR26]^, PduO (adenosyltransferase)^[@CR27]^, PduGH (diol dehydratase reactivase)^[@CR15]^, and PduX (L-threonine kinase)^[@CR28]^. PduV, a protein of unknown function, was proposed to connect with the cytoskeleton and be responsible for positioning of Pdu MCPs in the bacterial cytoplasm^[@CR29]^.Fig. 1The Pdu microcompartments and their isolation from S. Typhimurium LT2.a Diagram of the pdu operon, which encodes structural genes (pduABB'JKMNTU) and catalytic genes (pduCDELPQW for 1,2-PD degradation and pduGHOSX for B~12~ recycling) of the Pdu MCP. b Thin-section transmission electron microscopy of the WT and ΔpduA cells showing the presence of Pdu MCPs . c Negative staining TEM images of purified Pdu MCPs from the WT and ΔpduA cells, demonstrating the structural integrity of isolated Pdu MCPs. d SDS-PAGE of purified Pdu MCPs from the WT and ΔpduA cells, revealing the polypeptide composition.

The centre for error bars represents the mean, and error bars represent SD. n number of biologically independent experiments. Source data of Fig. 1e is provided as a [Source Data](#MOESM3){ref-type=\"media\"} file.\n\n【4】The fundamental nature of self-assembly has provoked great interest in the adoption of these principles for bioinspired design and the engineering of functional protein self-assemblies for biotechnological applications. However, we still have limited knowledge about the biogenesis and self-assembly of BMCs; particularly, the exact stoichiometric composition and organisation of BMCs, as the key features of the self-assembly, have not been established. To address these questions requires precise quantification approach as well as preparation and analysis of functional BMCs.\n\n【5】Here we perform absolute quantification of protein components in the active Pdu MCPs from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) LT2, by exploiting quantitative mass spectrometry using a QconCAT (concatamer of standard peptides for absolute quantification) standard^[@CR30],[@CR31]^. We define the stoichiometry of individual shell proteins and interiors within the Pdu MCP. The encapsulation of Pdu enzymes within the Pdu MCP is characterised by live-cell confocal microscopy and electron microscopy (EM). The accurate protein stoichiometry allows us to propose a structural model of the Pdu MCP. Our findings provide insights into the organising principles of Pdu MCPs, which could be extended to other BMCs and self-assembling macromolecular complexes, and may inform strategies for the bespoke engineering of functional metabolosomes in biotechnology applications.\n\n【6】Results {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n【7】Formation and isolation of functional Pdu MCPs {#Sec3}\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【8】The genes involved in 1,2-PD metabolism form a continuous cluster on the Salmonella chromosome, at the pdu locus, beginning with the pduA gene that encodes the canonical BMC shell protein PduA (Fig. [1a](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The pdu operon is transcribed from a single transcriptional start site located at 25 nucleotides upstream of pduA^[@CR32],[@CR33]^. To investigate the structural variability of distinct Pdu MCP forms and to verify the protein quantification strategy, we studied both the wild type (WT) S. Typhimurium LT2 and the LT2-ΔpduA deletion mutant (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}, Supplementary Tables 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"} and 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). The increased growth rate of the LT2-ΔpduA strain compared with the WT in the presence of 1,2-PD at limiting levels of vitamin B~12~ (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}) probably reflects the altered organisation of Pdu MCP particles and the semi-permeability of a remodelled shell that allows access of substrates to internal enzymes, as reported previously^[@CR16],[@CR34]^. The formation of Pdu MCPs in the WT and ΔpduA cells grown in the microcompartment-inducing media (MIM)  was confirmed by thin-section EM (Fig. [1b](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, arrows). In both strains, the Pdu MCP structures were polygonal with straight edges and angular facets, typical features of BMCs^[@CR35]^.\n\n【9】The Pdu MCPs were isolated from the WT and the pduA-null mutant by differential centrifugation^[@CR36]^. EM observations confirmed the polyhedral architecture of isolated Pdu MCPs, with the diameter ranging from 90 to 130 nm (Fig. [1c](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The mean diameter of the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (102 ± 16 nm, n = 87) was slightly smaller than that of the WT forms (110 ± 13 nm, n = 104) (p = 1.12e^−4^, Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). The mean thickness of the protein shell was 4.5 ± 0.6 nm (n = 156) for the WT and 4.3 ± 0.6 nm (n = 141) for the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). The presence of major Pdu proteins in the purified MCPs was indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; Fig. [1d](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). PduA was detected in the WT Pdu MCPs but was absent from the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (Fig. [1d](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, red), confirming the genetic deletion of pduA. The minor Pdu MCP proteins (PduH, K, L, M, N, V, W, and X) were not visualised by SDS-PAGE, due to their low abundance within the Pdu MCP^[@CR36]^. It was evident that the level of PduJ, one of the major shell proteins, was elevated in the ΔpduA Pdu MCP compared to the WT Pdu MCP (Fig. [1d](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, blue), whereas the content of PduB, PduB', and PduD were reduced in the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (Fig. [1d](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, yellow). The isolated Pdu MCPs were enzymatically functional (Fig. [1e](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}); the WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs had similar PduCDE activity normalised by the total protein amount of the samples (p = 0.651, n = 4, two-sided t test). Taken together, our results demonstrate the structural and functional integrity of the isolated Pdu MCPs; comparison of WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs suggests that the abundance of individual proteins and the overall structure of the functional Pdu MCP can be modulated.\n\n【10】Absolute quantification of proteins within the Pdu MCP {#Sec4}\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Mass spectrometry has been used for the relative quantitation of Pdu MCP components but could not define the number of proteins per metabolosome^[@CR18]^. To establish the accurate stoichiometry of all Pdu proteins within the isolated Pdu MCP, we used high-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) calibrated with protein-specific stable-isotope labelled internal standards generated via the QconCAT strategy (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Supplementary Note 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"})^[@CR31],[@CR37]^. The QconCAT approach is based on an artificial protein, a concatenation of multiple standard peptides that are quantotypic for the targeted proteins (Supplementary Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"})^[@CR31]^. A single, stable isotope-labelled QconCAT protein was produced by cell-free synthesis^[@CR30]^, validated by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). The QconCAT was detectable as a strong band at the expected mobility, clearly visible above the cell-free system (CFS) background. This QconCAT protein was spiked into the Pdu MCP samples and co-digested to generate a set of reference peptides for all Pdu MCP proteins that permitted absolute quantification of multiple proteins (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}).Fig. 2Schematic overview of QconCAT strategy.The QconCAT gene was subcloned into a plasmid vector (pEU01) optimised for cell-free system (CFS). The CFS was employed for transcription and translation to express the QconCAT proteins labelled with stable isotopes (\\[^13^C~6~,^15^N~4~\\]arginine and \\[^13^C~6~,^15^N~2~\\]lysine). The labelled QconCAT proteins (heavy, purple) were purified, quantified, and added to isolated Pdu MCPs from WT or ΔpduA cells with four replicated (unlabelled, light, green) in known quantity. After trypsin digestion, analyte mix released each of the QconCAT peptides in a strict stoichiometry of 1:1. LC-MS analysis allowed the quantification of each represented peptide of the isolated Pdu MCPs. One signature peptide for PduL, SVSQVEIS, was shown as an example.\n\n【12】Because the Pdu MCPs were so highly purified and the Pdu MCP proteins are the most abundant in the samples (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}), we elected to use an MS1 precursor QconCAT quantification. The purity of the Pdu MCP complexes was also evident from the base peak chromatograms of purified complexes compared with the complex chromatograms derived from lysed cell extracts (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). By contrast, the purified complex yield base peak intensity chromatograms that exhibited few peaks, each of which was baseline resolved from adjacent peaks, are exactly as would be anticipated from highly purified proteins, and indeed were confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the Pdu MCPs (Supplementary Fig. [8a](#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). Each precursor ion was cleanly isolated using the high-resolution and high-scanning speed of the MS1 approach. Further, replicate samples of lysed cell extracts and purified MCPs were analysed by label-free quantification (Supplementary Fig. [8b, c](#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). Proteins were ranked according to abundance, as measured by label-free quantification, and the abundances of the shell and core proteins of the MCPs were highlighted on the ranked protein abundance curves. The combined label-free abundance of Pdu proteins is 96% of the total proteins in the MCP fraction compared with 15% in the whole-cell lysate. The Pdu MCP complexes were abundant in lysed cell extracts and were highly enriched after purification, lending weight to the utility of an MS1 approach.\n\n【13】The purified Pdu MCP proteins were mixed with QconCAT, co-digested, and analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry of their precursor ions. This approach yielded a high number of sampling points across the chromatographic peak, and processing the data through Skyline^[@CR38]^ permitted accurate integration of peak area. The representative extracted ion chromatograms for two peptides attest to the quality of the data and the ease with which the precursor ions could be recovered (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}).\n\n【14】We designed the QconCAT to deploy two unique peptides to quantify each Pdu MCP protein (Supplementary Tables 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"} and 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). The agreement between the two peptides was excellent, yielding accurate quantification of all the proteins (except for PduE) (Fig. [3a, b](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). Digestion time-course analysis (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}) revealed that one of the target peptides from PduE demonstrated differing digestion kinetics between the target protein and QconCAT standard. This peptide was then excluded. Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"} presents the percentage of each Pdu protein within MCPs isolated from four biological replicates of WT and ΔpduA S. Typhimurium cells. Replicates of the same strain (WT vs WT, ΔpduA vs ΔpduA) were mostly consistent, while the PduA and PduB content differed between the WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}). A perfect icosahedral Pdu MCP will have 20 facets and contain 12 PduN pentamers at the vertices of the icosahedron^[@CR4],[@CR39]^. Based on the value of 60 PduN molecules per Pdu MCP, we quantified the other Pdu proteins within a single Pdu MCP (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}).Fig. 3Stoichiometry and localisation of Pdu proteins.a Gross number of the structural proteins per Pdu MCP. b Gross number of the catalytic proteins per Pdu MCP. Circle: signature peptide 1; triangle: signature peptide 2. The peptides with higher values were used for generating error bars (SD) and centre (mean), reasoning that signal loss from endogenous peptide is more likely. One peptide with higher values for PduE was excluded, because a time course digest revealed that slower digestion of this peptide could have led to overestimation. The stoichiometric data are shown in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}. The deletion of PduA resulted in significant changes in the abundance of shell proteins PduB, B', and PduJ (p = 7.110e^−7^, 2.022e^−8^, and 0.013, respectively, n = 4, two-sided t test) and interiors PduC, D, E, O, and Q (p = 0.001, 0.0003, 0.002, 0.027, and 0.028, respectively, n = 4, two-sided t test). n number of biologically independent samples. ns, p \\> 0.05; \\p \\< 0.05; \\\\p \\< 0.01; \\\\\\p \\< 0.001. c The subcellular distribution of PduV, PduW, and PduX in S.

The eGFP fused to the C-terminal of PduX and the native eGFP were plasmid encoded. The spotty distribution of PduV, similar to that observed for PduT and PduP, indicated that PduV is localised with the Pdu MCPs. In contrast, PduW and PduX were localised throughout the cytoplasm, comparable to native eGFP, and did not possess typical Pdu MCP distribution in vivo.

The ratio of distinct shell protein subunits (A:B:B':J:K:M:N:T:U) was 31:11:14:87:9:1:1:5:2 (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}). PduJ accounted for 54.2% of all shell proteins by number, higher than the sum of PduA, PduB, and PduB' (34.8%), demonstrating the key role of PduJ in tiling the shell. Apart from the major shell proteins, we also quantified the abundance of minor Pdu shell proteins (PduK, M, N, T, and U) (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). There were 514 copies of PduK monomers per Pdu MCP. The number of trimeric PduT (289 monomers per Pdu MCP) was more than twice that of hexameric PduU (130 monomers per Pdu MCP), which is different from the PduT/PduU ratio of 1:2 estimated by two-dimensional electrophoresis^[@CR18]^. PduM has been reported to be a Pdu MCP structural protein^[@CR36]^, and our data revealed 56 copies of PduM subunits per Pdu MCP, comparable with the content of less abundant shell pentamer PduN (normalised as 60 monomers per Pdu MCP).Table 2Different ratios calculated from the data of gross number of proteins per Pdu MCP.Ratio of gross contents of Pdu proteinsWTΔpduAReported values for WT^b^A:B:B':J:K:M:N:T:U^a^31:11:14:87:9:1:1:5:20:3:3:120:10:1:1:5:210:6:7:15:1:---:---:1:2^[@CR18]^PduC:PduD:PduE1:1:11:1:11:1:1^[@CR39]^; 2:1:2^[@CR18]^PduG:PduH2:12:12:1^[@CR18]^; 2:2^[@CR40]^PduT:PduS6:16:1PduO:PduS3:13:1PduP:PduQ3:22:12:1^[@CR23]^Shell proteins:internal enzymes4.6:16.2:1PduBB′ (WT:ΔpduA)5:1PduJ (WT:ΔpduA)2:3PduCDE (WT:ΔpduA)2:1^a^The number of PduN was set to 1, and the ratio of other shell proteins was calculated accordingly.^b^For comparison, the corresponding values for WT that were reported previously are listed.\n\n【16】Of the catalytic proteins for the WT Pdu MCP, PduCDE diol dehydratase was the most abundant. The subunit ratio of PduC, D, and E in the diol dehydratase was approximately 1:1:1 (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}), consistent with the stoichiometry revealed by the crystal structure of diol dehydratase in Klebsiella oxytoca^[@CR40]^ but unsupportive to the ratio of 2:1:2 estimated previously^[@CR18]^. The ratio of diol dehydratase reactivase PduG and PduH subunits was 2:1, consistent with an earlier S. Typhimurium study^[@CR18]^, but distinct from the ratio of 2:2 in K. oxytoca estimated by SDS-PAGE densitometry^[@CR41]^. The PduS enzyme, cobalamin reductase, was reported to interact with the PduO adenosyltransferase and shell protein PduT trimers^[@CR42],[@CR43]^. Here we showed that the ratios of PduT:PduS and PduO:PduS were 6:1 and 3:1, respectively. PduP aldehyde dehydrogenase and PduQ alcohol dehydrogenase could potentially bind with each other^[@CR23]^; our data revealed that PduP and PduQ made up 1.8% and 1.2% of total Pdu protein, respectively, at a ratio of 3:2 (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}), which is slightly lower than the ratio of 2:1 estimated in prior studies^[@CR23]^. PduL had 33 copies per Pdu MCP, less than the content of the vertex protein PduN, confirming that this protein was a minor component of the Pdu MCP^[@CR24]^.\n\n【17】Variability of the stoichiometric organisation of Pdu MCPs {#Sec5}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】PduA has been reported to mediate the majority of interactions with other shell proteins, including PduB, PduJ, PduK, and PduU^[@CR29]^. Comparison of protein stoichiometry of the WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs indicated that the absence of PduA resulted in an \\~10% reduction in the total copy numbers of shell proteins (decline from 9607 to 8602, p = 0.045) and an \\~41% reduction in the internal enzymes (decrease from 2065 to 1376 molecules, p = 0.005) (Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). The lower abundance of individual proteins was consistent with the reduced size of the ΔpduA Pdu MCPs as revealed by EM (Fig. [1c](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}).\n\n【19】In the ΔpduA Pdu MCP, the ratio of individual shell proteins (B:B':J:K:M:N:T:U) was 3:3:120:10:1:1:5:2, which was different from the ratio of 11:14:87:9:1:1:5:2 determined in the WT form (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}). There was a 38% increase in PduJ abundance within the Pdu MCP that lacked PduA (Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}). Interestingly, the copy number of PduJ within the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (n~m~ = 1200 ± 148) was approximately equal to the total abundance of PduA (n~m~ = 307 ± 17) and PduJ (n~m~ = 869 ± 72) within the WT Pdu MCP (Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). We speculate that PduJ could compensate for the defects in the Pdu MCP structure caused by the lack of PduA, because PduA and PduJ proteins share high sequence (83%) and structural similarities^[@CR44]^. In contrast, the PduBB' content per Pdu MCP that lacked PduA decreased by a factor of 4, and the ratio of PduB and PduB' in both complexes remained at 1:1 (Fig. [3a](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}, Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#Tab2){ref-type=\"table\"}), raising the possibility that PduA and PduBB' were structurally coordinated in the shell^[@CR13],[@CR29]^. The absence of PduA caused no significant difference in the abundance of PduK (p = 0.096), PduU (p = 0.146), PduM (p = 0.333), and PduT (p = 0.514).\n\n【20】In addition to the variation of shell protein abundance, the deletion of PduA also led to a 50% decline in the PduCDE content and an approximately 20% reduction in the content of PduO and PduQ (Fig. [3b](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The PduP stoichiometry in the WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs was unchanged (Fig. [3b](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}), which does not confirm the suggestion that PduP was encapsulated within the Pdu MCP via interactions with the C-terminus of PduA^[@CR45]^. Significantly, the enzyme assays revealed no notable difference in the enzyme activities of the isolated WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs, when normalised by the total protein content (Fig. [1e](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, the reduced total protein content and PduCDE amount per ΔpduA Pdu MCP led to the estimation that the catalytic activity per ΔpduA Pdu MCP is lower than that per WT Pdu MCP, due to the reduction in cargo enzyme content as well as the altered shell organisation and permeability in the absence of PduA.\n\n【21】In summary, our results demonstrate that the stoichiometric composition and structure of the functional Pdu MCP can be remodelled.\n\n【22】Association of PduV, PduW, and PduX with the Pdu MCP {#Sec6}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Several less abundant building proteins were also characterised in the WT and ΔpduA Pdu MCPs, PduV (7 copies per Pdu MCP), PduW (11 copies per Pdu MCP), and PduX (4 copies per Pdu MCP) (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). However, given that this abundance was at the similar level of the PduA mass spectrometric background signal detected in the ΔpduA Pdu MCP (10 copies per Pdu MCP, compared to 1841 copies in the WT, Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}), it was uncertain that these low-abundance proteins represent genuine components of the Pdu MCP structure. Thus, to validate the association of PduV, PduW, and PduX with the Pdu MCP, we fused enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to the C-terminus of each of the three proteins individually, expressed each from the chromosome of S. Typhimurium LT2 (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}) and characterised intracellular localisation. Fluorescence tagging and live-cell confocal fluorescence imaging have been exploited in studying the composition, assembly, and biogenesis of Pdu MCPs^[@CR29]^ and carboxysomes^[@CR46]--[@CR50]^ in vivo. In addition, one shell protein PduT and one internal enzyme PduP were fused with eGFP, and a S. Typhimurium LT2 strain expressing native eGFP was constructed as the localisation controls. The GFP-fused strains grew slightly slower than the WT in the presence of 1,2-PD at limiting levels of B~12~ (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}).\n\n【24】Confocal fluorescence imaging identified discrete intracellular patches of PduV that resembled the locations of PduT and PduP, representing the typical distribution pattern of Pdu MCPs in vivo (Fig. [3c](#Fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). In contrast, PduW that catalyses the conversion of propionyl phosphate to propionate was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, comparable to the distribution of native eGFP, indicating that PduW had a cytosolic location in S. Typhimurium LT2. PduX is responsible for the conversion of L-threonine to L-threonine phosphate and plays a role in the synthesis of Ado-B~12~, a substrate for the PduCDE enzymes during 1,2-PD degradation. PduX is not required when Salmonella grows aerobically on the MIM medium with succinate as the carbon source^[@CR28]^. The GFP fluorescence of PduX at the native chromosome locus was not detectable. We thus overexpressed PduX in S. Typhimurium LT2 while inducing the synthesis of Pdu MCPs. PduX::eGFP exhibited even distribution in the cytosol, similar to free eGFP. Taken together, our results reveal that PduV functions as a component of the Pdu MCP, while PduW and PduX are likely not encased within the Pdu MCP structure, suggesting that metabolism of propionyl phosphate and L-threonine phosphate may occur predominately in the cytosol and is not present within the Pdu MCP lumen.\n\n【25】Discussion {#Sec7}\n==========\n\n【26】Despite endeavours to uncover BMC self-assembly and functions, their stoichiometry and overall structures are surprisingly unclear. This is mainly due to the difficulties to isolate intact, functional BMCs^[@CR37],[@CR51],[@CR52]^ and the limitations of protein quantification. Numerous studies have used mass spectrometry to estimate the relative abundance of Pdu MCPs^[@CR18],[@CR37]^ and carboxysomes^[@CR52],[@CR53]^, which permitted comparison between different growth conditions but not the actual number of proteins per BMC. Recently, the use of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy allowed precise carboxysome protein stoichiometry to be determined by counting discrete bleaching steps of fluorescently tagged components within the carboxysome in live cyanobacterial cells^[@CR50]^. Here we isolated Pdu MCPs using differential centrifugation to ensure their structural and functional integrity^[@CR36]^, which was confirmed by EM, SDS-PAGE, and catalytical assays (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Absolute quantification using mass spectrometry, based on QconCAT technology^[@CR30],[@CR31]^, was then used to characterise the isolated Pdu MCPs, leading to direct counting of the copy numbers of shell proteins and cargos per Pdu MCP, and to quantify the PduA-dependent stoichiometric changes in Pdu MCPs (Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#Tab1){ref-type=\"table\"}). Our understanding of the levels of individual proteins led us to propose a model of the Pdu MCP structure (Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#Fig4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The data show that QconCATs are a reproducible, broadly deployable tool that can be extended to study diverse BMCs and self-assembling biosystems.Fig. 4Schematic models of the Pdu MCP shell and interior organisations.a Models for two adjacent Pdu MCP shell facets in the S. Typhimurium LT2-WT and LT2-ΔpduA. Note that the model construction is based on the number of shell proteins from the absolute quantification data, and the relative geometric arrangement remains speculative. PduM is not shown here because of its unknown structure and uncertain role. b Model for the organisation of catalytic proteins. PduCDEGHLOPQV function as components of the Pdu MCP, whereas our confocal data suggest that PduW and PduX are not integrated into the Pdu MCP structure.\n\n【27】We found that PduJ was the most abundant protein in both WT-MCPs (54.2%) and ΔpduA-MCPs (83.7%) isolated from Salmonella, consistent with previous observations from Salmonella^[@CR18]^. In contrast, in the Pdu MCPs from a facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium Citrobacter freundii, PduB' was estimated to be the most abundant Pdu protein, accounting for 31% of all shell proteins, whereas the PduJ abundance was only 18%^[@CR37]^. The variations probably indicate the species-dependent stoichiometric fingerprint of Pdu MCPs, although the genomic organisations of the pdu operons in the two organisms are highly conserved. The environment-mediated modulation of the protein content determined in carboxysomes^[@CR50]^ also raises the possibility that the protein stoichiometry of Pdu MCPs may vary in different growth conditions, such as anaerobic environment and different carbon source, and this deserves further investigation.\n\n【28】Characterising the stoichiometric variations of BMCs allowed us to evaluate the inherent capacity of Pdu MCPs to remodel their composition and organisation for functional adaptation and to consider specific protein interactions in the polyhedral organelle. Our results demonstrated that the increased amount of PduJ proteins incorporated within the ΔpduA Pdu MCP corresponds to the amount of PduA in the WT Pdu MCP. We propose that the major shell proteins PduA and PduJ are functionally redundant and use a complementary strategy to retain the overall shape of Pdu MCPs.\n\n【29】The more thoroughly characterised carboxysomes could offer functional insights into the Pdu MCP, as multiple types of major shell homologues are also present in the α-carboxysome of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus (CsoS1A, B, and C)^[@CR54]^, as does the β-carboxysome in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (CcmK1 and CcmK2)^[@CR4]^. In addition, the carboxysome minor shell homologues CcmK3 and CcmK4, which are encoded by the ccmK3 and ccmK4 genes that co-occur in cyanobacterial genomes, could form heterohexamers and are functionally linked^[@CR55]^. The ratio of CcmK4:CcmK3 per carboxysome is relatively constant, in the range of 3.6--4.1, under different growth conditions^[@CR50]^, validating their organisational correlation within the carboxysome shell. Whether the heterohexamer formation occurs in Pdu MCP shell proteins remains to be tackled.\n\n【30】In summary, we performed absolute protein quantification of the Pdu MCP metabolosome to characterise the stoichiometric and structural variations of Pdu MCPs with a combination of QconCAT-driven quantitative mass spectrometry and microscopic imaging. The growing interest in reprogramming BMCs for various biotechnological applications necessitates a deeper understanding of the protein stoichiometry and regulatory organisation of natural BMCs. Advanced knowledge about Pdu MCP self-assembly and the analytic methods developed here could be relevant to other self-assembling bacterial organelles and biological systems and so stimulate the engineering of bespoke, functional BMC structures in heterogeneous organisms for the enhancement of cellular metabolism.\n\n【31】Methods {#Sec8}\n=======\n\n【32】Bacterial strains and growth conditions {#Sec9}\n---------------------------------------\n\n【33】The bacterial strains were derivatives of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2^[@CR56]^. The rich medium used was LB-Lennox medium (10 g L^−1^ tryptone, 5 g L^−1^ yeast extract, 5 g L^−1^ sodium chloride), and the minimal medium used was no-carbon-E (NCE) medium^[@CR57]^. MIM is NCE medium supplemented with 1 mM MgSO~4~, 0.5% succinate, 50 μM Fe(III) citrate, and 0.6% 1,2-PD^[@CR36],[@CR58]^. For Pdu MCP purification, overnight culture was sub-inoculated 1:100 in 20 mL of LB-Lennox medium and grown for about 2 h to an OD~600~ of 0.6--0.8. Subsequently, 4 mL of this LB culture was used to inoculate a 400 mL MIM culture, which was shaken aerobically at 37 °C until the OD~600~ reached 1.0--1.2.\n\n【34】Construction of chromosomal mutations {#Sec10}\n-------------------------------------\n\n【35】Salmonella mutants (LT2-ΔpduA, LT2-pduP::eGFP, LT2-pduT::eGFP, LT2-pduV::eGFP, LT2-pduW::eGFP, and LT2-pduX::eGFP) were constructed by the gene disruption technique developed by Datsenko and Wanner^[@CR59]^. A complete list of strains and plasmids used in this study and construction details could be found in Supplementary Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}. Primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}. The template plasmids used for gene disruption and fluorescence fusion were pKD4 and pIJ786, respectively. pKD46 and pSIM5-tet^[@CR60]^ were used for lambda red recombination. P22 transduction was used to move the individual mutations into a clean genetic background^[@CR61]^. pCP20 plasmid, an ampicillin-resistant helper plasmid that expresses the FLP recombinase acting on the FRT sites flanking the resistance gene, was transformed into the bacteria by electroporation and used to eliminate the resistance cassette. All gene deletion mutants or fluorescently labelled strains were verified by PCR and DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA (Supplementary Fig. 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}).\n\n【36】Growth assays {#Sec11}\n-------------\n\n【37】Ten μL of an overnight LB cell culture was used to inoculate 10 mL of LB containing 0.6% 1,2-PD and shaken aerobically in a shaker at 220 rpm. After 6 h, cells were washed three times with the NCE medium supplemented with 0.6% 1,2-PD and 1 mM MgSO~4~. The washed and pelleted cells were resuspended in NCE medium (containing 0.6% 1,2-PD; 0.3 mM each of valine, isoleucine, leucine, and threonine; 50 μM ferric citrate; and 20 nM CN-B~12~) to an OD~600~ of 0.15, followed by growing at 37 °C in a microplate reader (BMG LABTECH) with intermittent shaking. The readings of OD~600~ were taken every hour. The growth curves were repeated at least three times in duplicate.\n\n【38】Pdu MCP purification {#Sec12}\n--------------------\n\n【39】The Pdu MCPs from both S. Typhimurium LT2-WT and LT2-ΔpduA were isolated by detergent treatment and differential centrifugation^[@CR36]^. Briefly, 400 mL cells were harvested and washed twice with 40 mL of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl~2~, and 1.5% 1,2-PD) and lysed with a mixture of 10 mL of buffer A and 15 mL of the bacteria-specific reagent (BPER-II, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC; Sigma-Aldrich), 25 mg lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mg DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich), with 60 rpm shaking at room temperature for half an hour. Subsequently, Pdu MCPs were separated from cell debris by consecutive centrifuge steps at 4 °C (12,000 × g for 5 min twice to pellet cell debris, 20,000 × g for 20 min to pellet Pdu MCPs). The pellet after centrifugation at 20,000 × g was washed with a 10-mL mixture of buffer A and BPER-II (2:3, v/v) containing 1× PIC and then was resuspended in 0.2 mL of buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl~2~, 1% 1,2-PD) with 1× PIC. Finally, isolated Pdu MCPs were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (3 × 1 min) to further remove cell debris.\n\n【40】PduCDE enzyme assay {#Sec13}\n-------------------\n\n【41】PduCDE activity was measured by monitoring the formation of propionaldehyde^[@CR58]^. Alcohol dehydrogenase was used as the coupled enzyme with the cofactor NADH. The components of the 200-μL reaction system included 0.5 μg of purified Pdu MCPs, 200 mM 1,2-PD, 25 μg mL^−1^ Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4 mM NADH, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), and 20 μM AdoB~12~. The reactions were plated in 96-well plates and were initiated by adding AdoB~12~. The absorbance (340 nm) was monitored at 37 °C with a microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). Different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mM) of NADH were used for generating standard curves to determine the amount of NADH consumption.\n\n【42】SDS-PAGE analysis {#Sec14}\n-----------------\n\n【43】Standard procedures for SDS-PAGE were employed. Protein composition was determined by 15% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.\n\n【44】Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) {#Sec15}\n--------------------------------------\n\n【45】The Pdu MCPs structures in the LT2 WT and mutant strains were visualised using thin section^[@CR49]^. Salmonella cells were pelleted and fixed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 1 h. Samples were then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h, washed with ultrapure water, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate for overnight at 4 °C. Dehydration was conducted with a series of increasing alcohol concentrations (30--100%) before the cells were embedded in resin. Thin sections of 70 nm were cut with a diamond knife. The structures of isolated Pdu MCPs were characterised using negative staining TEM^[@CR52]^. The isolated Pdu MCPs (1 mg mL^−1^) were stained with 3% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded using an FEI 120 kV Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN TEM equipped with a Gatan Rio 16 camera. Image analysis was carried out using the ImageJ software. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test conducted by IBM SPSS Statistics 24.\n\n【46】Proteomic analysis {#Sec16}\n------------------\n\n【47】Absolute quantification for the Pdu MCP proteomics was conducted using concatenated signature peptides encoded by a QconCAT^[@CR31]^. In general, two peptides, serving as surrogates, were nominated to quantify each protein based on the published design principles (Supplementary Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"})^[@CR62]^. Only one peptide meeting the criteria was selected for quantification of PduB, PduN, and PduX. The data are still reliable, given the excellent agreement between the nominated two peptides of other Pdu MCP proteins. All peptides were searched against the Uniprot of S. enterica database to make sure that they are unique. The QconCAT gene was subcloned into a plasmid vector (pEU01) optimised for CFS, provided by GeneMill, University of Liverpool. The coding DNA sequence and translated peptide sequence for QconCATs are shown in Supplementary Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#MOESM1){ref-type=\"media\"}. The CFS (WEPRO8240/8240H/8240G Expression Kit, CellFree Sciences) was used to express the QconCAT proteins labelled with stable isotopes^[@CR30]^. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.\n\n【48】WT and PduA knockout Pdu MCPs preparations, 4 replicates each, were diluted to a final protein concentration of 2 μg in 25 mM NH~4~HC0~3~ (40 μL). QconCAT (approximately 10 pmol) was added, and samples were reduced by the addition of 2.5 μL of 12 mM dithiothreitol (Melford Laboratories) in 25 mM NH~4~HC0~3~ and incubation at 60 °C for 10 min. Alkylation was carried out by the addition of 2.5 μL of 36 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 25 mM NH~4~HC0~3~ and incubation at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Trypsin 2.5 μL (200 ng in 25 mM NH~4~HC0~3~; E:P 1:10) was added to each sample in a final digest volume of 50 μL. Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade, was from Promega. Samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. To remove residual Rapigest that was present in the QconCAT stock solution, digests were acidified by the addition of 0.5 μL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Fisher Chemicals) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. Samples were centrifuged at 17,200 × g for 30 min and transferred to fresh low-bind tubes.\n\n【49】LC-MS analyses were conducted on a QExactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-liquid chromatograph 通用删除1(英):<u>(Thermo Fisher, UK, Xcalibur software version 4.1)</u>. Sample digest (2 μL) was loaded onto a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18, 75 µm × 2 cm, 3 µm packing material, 100 Å) using a loading buffer of 0.1% (v/v) TFA, and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile in water for 7 min at a flow rate of 12 µL min^−1^. The trapping column was then set in-line with an analytical column (EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18, 75 µm × 50 cm, 2 µm packing material, 100 Å), and the peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 96.2% A (0.1% \\[v/v\\] formic acid):3.8% B (0.1% \\[v/v\\[formic acid in water:acetonitrile \\[80:20\\] \\[v/v\\]) to 50% A:50% B over 30 min at a flow rate of 300 nL min^−1^, followed by washing at 1% A:99% B for 5 min and re-equilibration of the column to starting conditions. The column was maintained at 40 °C, and the effluent was introduced directly into the integrated nano-electrospray ionisation source operating in positive ion mode. The mass spectrometer was operated in MS-only mode with survey scans between m/z 350--2000 acquired at a mass resolution of 240,000 (full width at half maximum (FWHM)) at m/z 200.

Biopsy results change the clinical diagnosis in 36% and the therapy for 59% of patients \\[[@CIT0001]\\]. An indication biopsy is used to assess the causes of graft dysfunction, which include rejection, de novo or recurrent renal diseases, infectious diseases, and drug toxicity, to provide guidance for treatment. Many pathological morphological studies have focused on graft dysfunction based on an indication biopsy, but few etiological analyses have been conducted in a large case series.\n\n【2】Methods {#s0002}\n=======\n\n【3】Sample collection {#s0003}\n-----------------\n\n【4】A total of 366 patients who underwent an indication biopsy following living kidney transplantation from July 2003 to June 2016 at our center were included (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 1]</u>(#F0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The patients included 260 males and 106 females with a mean age (mean ± SD) of 38.6 ± 11.3 years (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#t0001){ref-type=\"table\"}). Blood and urine routine examinations, liver and kidney function tests, and therapeutic drug monitoring were conducted before the biopsy for all patients. Induction treatment consisted of basiliximab (85.2%) or rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (14.8%); the standard maintain immunosuppressive regimen included a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), FK506 (89%) or Cyclosporin A (CsA) (11%), combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (100%) and corticosteroids (100%); prednisone oral began with 30 mg, qd and withdrawal gradually to 5--10 mg, qd for a period of 4 weeks. This study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of our center, and all patients signed informed consent forms.\n\n【5】![To investigate the causes of graft dysfunction, this series included patients with repeated indication biopsies, but excluded protocol biopsies and repeated indication biopsies with the same diagnosis. Additionally, biopsy results without a clear etiology and clinical diagnosis were excluded, such as chronic changes without evidence of any specific etiology (category 5 or 6 in Banff 2007).](IRNFA1455592F0001B){#F0001}\n\n【6】###### \n\n【7】Recipient and donor characteristics.\n\n【8】  Variable                                                   \n  --------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------\n  Recipient age (years)                                     38.6 ± 11.3 通用删除7(英):<u>(7--68)</u>\n  Recipient sex, f/m (%)                                    106/260 (29/71)\n  Recipient race, East Asian (%)                            366 通用删除7(英):<u>(100)</u>\n  Time on dialysis before Tx (months)                       25.7 ± 15.3 通用删除7(英):<u>(0--52)</u>\n  Diabetes (%)                                              71 (19.4)\n  Hypertension (%)                                          332 (90.7)\n  Second or higher Tx (%)                                   12 (3.2)\n  Anti-HLA antibodies[^a^](#TF2){ref-type=\"table-fn\"} (%)   76 (20.8)\n   Class I (%)                                              29 (7.9)\n   Class II (%)                                             54 (14.7)\n  HLA mismatches (A, B, or DR)                              2.2 ± 1.3\n  Donor age (years)                                         51.2 ± 8.4 通用删除7(英):<u>(36--65)</u>\n  Donor sex f/m (%)                                         218/148 (59/41)\n  Donor race, East Asian (%)                                366 通用删除7(英):<u>(100)</u>\n  Related donors (%)                                        318 通用删除7(英):<u>(87)</u>\n  Follow-up (years)                                         3.7 ± 2.3\n\n【9】Tx: transplantation.\n\n【10】Including donor-specific antibody and non-donor specific antibody.\n\n【11】Indication and procedures in biopsy {#s0004}\n-----------------------------------\n\n【12】The indications for the biopsy with reference to 2009 KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline \\[[@CIT0002]\\] were as follows: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> continuous anuria or oliguria; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> durative hematuria or proteinuria; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> continuous increase in the serum creatinine (sCr) or a concentration above the normal level; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> B-scan ultrasonography showing an abnormal blood flow resistance index (RI); 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> panel-reactive antibody (PRA) \\> 0% or presence of a donor-specific antibody (DSA).\n\n【13】A needle biopsy guided by ultrasonography was performed with an 18-gauge needle (Bard). Each sample had at least six glomeruli under light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence analyses (for IgA, IgG, IgM, C1q, and C4D) were performed on all biopsies and were observed by two senior pathologists in an independent and blinded fashion. The diagnosis and classification were determined by senior pathologist, some were consulted with doctor in charge, according to the Banff 2007 schema combined with clinical examinations, including therapeutic drug monitoring and BK virus testing in the urine and sera.\n\n【14】Statistical analysis {#s0005}\n--------------------\n\n【15】We analyzed the incidence and the 5-year graft cumulative survival rate of the various causes of graft dysfunction. Due to a great discrepancy in diseased time of different causes, the survival time after transplantation may not reflect the clinical features of graft dysfunction, we defined the time of follow-up began from the day of diagnosis by biopsy instead of the day of transplantation.\n\n【16】Data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics software version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The comparisons of categorical variables were performed with the Mann--Whitney U test or chi-square test, p values lower than .05 were considered statistically significant, the multiple comparisons were performed with Kruskal--Wallis test and the results were corrected with Bonferroni correction.\n\n【17】Results {#s0006}\n=======\n\n【18】The 366 cases (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#t0002){ref-type=\"table\"}) included 85 cases (22.0%) of acute rejection (AR), the glomerulitis (g \\> 0) was found in 52 cases (61.2%), and the peritubular capillaritis (ptc \\>0) in 73 cases (85.9%); of which 14 cases were acute antibody-mediated rejection (AAMR), all these biopsies (16.5%) had ptc and were C4d-positive by immunohistochemical staining. Thirty-two cases occurred within the first year after transplantation; nevertheless, three cases occurred more than 10 years postoperatively (通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#F0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Patients with T cell-mediated rejection (ACMR) were treated with a methylprednisolone pulse (MPP) and ATG intravenous therapy. Additionally, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was added to patients considered as antibody-mediated. Of these patients, 84.7% recovered and 15.3% lost graft within 1 year after diagnosis. Overall, the 5-year graft cumulative survival rate of AR was 60.1%.\n\n【19】![The incidence of various causes in different clinical settings.

We adjusted the dosage according to the blood concentrations or converted immunosuppression from CNI to rapamycin (RAPA). With early control of the blood pressure and hyperlipidemia, the 5-year graft cumulative survival rates were 31.2% and 66.6%, respectively.\n\n【25】Forty-three cases (11.1%) had BK virus-associated nephropathy (BKVAN), most of which occurred within 1--2 years after transplantation. None of the patients were diagnosed with BKVAN after more than 7 years. After the treatment of immunosuppression reduction and replacement of FK506 with CsA, the 5-year graft cumulative survival rate was 74.3%.\n\n【26】De novo or recurrent renal diseases occurred in 134 cases, representing the highest incidence (34.7%) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#t0002){ref-type=\"table\"}). These diseases included IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in 80 cases (59.7%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 41 cases (30.6%), membranous nephropathy (MN) in six cases (4.5%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in four cases (3.0%), lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) in two cases (1.5%), and lupus nephritis (LN) in one case (0.7%). IgAN and FSGS were predominant. These two diseases occurred at any time after transplantation, although the latter disease occurred more frequently within the first year and nearly 10 years postoperatively. CsA and medium/low prednisone combination therapy was used to relieve disease progression, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were used to reduce proteinuria, and patients with FSGS were treated with plasma exchange (PE). As a result, the 5-year graft cumulative survival rates of these two diseases were 67.7% and 54.5%, respectively. For comparison, the 5-year graft cumulative survival rate for the total 134 cases was 67.1%.\n\n【27】Graft dysfunction with other causes occurred in nine cases (2.3%), including acute pyelonephritis, hypertension, and chronic obstruction nephropathy. Twenty cases had two causes simultaneously; these causes were AR and CR in four cases, de novo or recurrent renal disease and CNI toxicity damage in five cases, de novo or recurrent renal disease and CR in five cases, and de novo or recurrent renal disease and AR in six cases.\n\n【28】Discussion {#s0007}\n==========\n\n【29】With the wide use of effective immunosuppression, the incidence of AR has been reduced markedly in recent years \\[[@CIT0003]\\]. The overall risk within one year after transplantation is less than 15% \\[[@CIT0004]\\]. In our study, the incidence of AR was second to the risk of de novo or recurrent renal diseases. However, the reduction in the incidence was not associated with a better prognosis, and the rejection episodes were more severe than previously reported \\[[@CIT0005]\\]. Due to improved immunosuppression and management during the perioperative period, some cases of AR, especially those in subclinical rejection, showed fewer typical clinical features, such as an acute increase in creatinine with oliguria, fever and graft tenderness and swelling. Thus, renal biopsy is one of the main methods to predict and guide treatment.\n\n【30】AR has a high incidence in the first year but can occur at any time after transplantation \\[[@CIT0004]\\]. This pattern was also observed in our study, with some cases occurring more than 10 years postoperatively. This result suggests that late AR must be noted and may occur when immunosuppression is reduced due to cancer, infection, or drug toxicity. Late AR, which is defined as a rejection occurs more than 3 months post-transplantation. Humoral factors have been reported to take effect in late AR and AAMR is observed in more than 40% of late AR cases \\[[@CIT0006],[@CIT0007]\\]. AAMR is one of the most common and severe causes of graft dysfunction, and is characterized by hormone resistance and refractory. One study found that AAMR occurred in nearly 24% of the AR biopsies \\[[@CIT0008]\\]. Fourteen biopsies (16.5%) showed AAMR in our study. Considering the low risk of rejection in living transplantation, this result was coincident with reports in the literature.\n\n【31】Although most AR cases can be cured, many studies have indicated that AR is still the main reason cause of graft dysfunction \\[[@CIT0009],[@CIT0010]\\] and accounts for one-third of graft losses \\[[@CIT0011],[@CIT0012]\\]. Late AR is often associated with poorer outcomes and a high risk of graft loss. We found that the 29 cases (96.6%) of AR that occurred within 2 year after transplantation (Group 1) recovered with anti-rejection treatment compared with the curative effective rate of only 86.0% in the 50 cases that occurred over one year postoperatively (Group 2) (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 3]</u>(#t0003){ref-type=\"table\"}), although there is no statistically significant in cure rate between two groups, the treatment outcome of group 1 is better than group 2 as can be seen from the decline degree of sCr. Moreover, the biopsies showed a higher degree of histopathological injury in Group 2 versus in Group 1. A meta-analysis showed that early steroid avoidance or withdrawal after renal transplantation increased the risk of late AR \\[[@CIT0013]\\].

However, some studies have suggested that the risk of recurrence has increased as a result \\[[@CIT0016],[@CIT0017]\\]. This finding could help explain why de novo or recurrent renal diseases occupied the first position of the various causes of graft dysfunction in our results.\n\n【43】All forms of original nephropathy may recur after transplantation, including IgAN, FSGS, MN, and MPGN. However, great discrepancies exist in their clinical features and prognoses. Data have shown that de novo or recurrent renal diseases are the third leading cause of graft dysfunction, following CR and death with functional graft \\[[@CIT0018]\\].\n\n【44】IgAN is the most common recurrent nephropathy and recurs in 9--61% of patients \\[[@CIT0019]\\]. Moreover, IgAN had the highest incidence in our study. Genetic factors play a role in the recurrence of IgAN and exhibit familial clustering \\[[@CIT0020]\\]. We noted that IgAN recurrence was significantly more frequent in low HLA-mismatched living transplantation, which conformed to a review of the Australia--New Zealand registry \\[[@CIT0021]\\]. Therefore, we suggest that further attention should be paid to the family history in cases involving transplantation from living donors. IgAN may recur at any time after transplantation. We found that most patients diagnosed with recurrent IgAN accepted a biopsy for initial asymptomatic hematuria and/or mild proteinuria, whereas few for an increased serum creatinine level, which was contrary to the rejection and CNI toxicity data (通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 4]</u>(#t0004){ref-type=\"table\"}). Early research suggested that recurrent IgAN presented relatively slow progression and a benign outcome with little impact on graft function compared with other risk factors, such as rejection, drug toxicity, or infection \\[[@CIT0022]\\]. More recent studies have confirmed that IgAN reduces the long-term survival rate of the graft and indicates a poor prognosis, especially in patients with asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria \\[[@CIT0023],[@CIT0024]\\].\n\n【45】###### \n\n【46】The clinical features of different causes at the time of biopsy.\n\n【47】                                  IgAN (n = 80)   AR (n = 85)                                    CR (n = 62)                                    CNI toxicity (n = 41)                         p value\n  ------------------------------- ----------------- ------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------- -----------\n  Proteinuria (−∼+++)             80                85[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}              62                                               41[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}             \\<.01\n    − (%)                         20 (25.0)         52 (61.2)                                        19 (30.6)                                        24 (58.5)                                        \n    + (%)                         31 (38.7)         14 (16.5)                                        18 (29.0)                                        12 (29.3)                                        \n    ++ (%)                        20 (25.0)         8 (9.4)                                          14 (22.6)                                        3 (7.3)                                          \n    +++ (%)                       9 (11.2)          11 (12.9)                                        11 (17.7)                                        2 (4.9)                                          \n  24-h urinary protein (g/24 h)   1.14 ± 1.47       0.82 ± 0.93                                      1.80 ± 2.55                                      0.69 ± 0.78                                     .05\n  Haematuria (−∼+++)              80                85[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}              62[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}              41[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}             \\<.01\n    − (%)                         24 (30.0)         54 (63.5)                                        36 (58.1)                                        28 (68.3)                                        \n    + (%)                         26 (32.5)         17 (20.0)                                        20 (32.2)                                        8 (19.5)                                         \n    ++ (%)                        21 (26.2)         7 (8.2)                                          4 (6.4)                                          4 (9.7)                                          \n    +++ (%)                       9 (11.2)          7 (8.2)                                          2 (3.2)                                          1 (2.4)                                          \n  Urinary RBC count (µ/ml)        64.1 ± 95.7       111.2 ± 413.1[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}   36.8 ± 132.9[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}    51.7 ± 239.3[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}   \\<.01\n  Cholesterol (mmol/L)            5.5 ± 1.9         5.4 ± 2.0                                        5.6 ± 1.3                                        5.3 ± 1.3                                       .23\n  LDL (mmol/L)                    3.6 ± 1.4         3.6 ± 1.5                                        3.9 ± 1.1                                        3.5 ± 1.0                                       .21\n  ALB (g/L)                       40.7 ± 5.9        41.5 ± 5.3                                       38.8 ± 5.7                                       42.6 ± 4.1                                      \\<.01\n  sCr increased (µmol/L)          42.1 ± 69.2       160.6 ± 238.5[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}   121.8 ± 138.8[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}   61.4 ± 76.7                                     \\<.01\n  Diseased time (years)           4.0 ± 3.1         2.2 ± 2.6[^a^](#TF12){ref-type=\"table-fn\"}       5.4 ± 4.0                                        4.3 ± 4.0                                       \\<.01\n\n【48】RBC: red blood cell; LDL: low density lipoprotein; ALB: albumin.\n\n【49】The significant difference between the IgAN group and the other three groups, p values lower than .008 (0.05/6) were considered statistically significant with Bonferroni correction.\n\n【50】Recurrent FSGS develops in approximately 30% of patients after the first transplantation \\[[@CIT0025]\\]. We found that this disease occurred more frequently within the first year and nearly 10 years postoperatively. Early cases were characterized by severe proteinuria within hours to days after transplantation. In contrast, the late cases developed asymptomatic proteinuria within several months to years. In some cases, the primary diseases of the recipients were unknown; therefore, distinguishing between recurrent FSGS and de novo cases is difficult. Thus, we conjecture that these two periods may represent a peak incidence of recurrent and de novo FSGS, respectively. To test the hypothesis, more biopsy samples should be collected preoperatively. Recurrent FSGS is prone to occur in males and children \\[[@CIT0026]\\], but most patients in our study were male (71.4%) and adults (100%). Although few studies have reported data on prognoses in adult cases with recurrent FSGS, we can acknowledge that recurrence is associated with poor graft survival. Moroni et al. \\[[@CIT0026]\\] reported recurrent FSGS in 12 adult patients; graft failure occurred in seven of the patients within 10 months, and five patients retained good functions at 106 months. Our study uncovered a similar result, with a 5-year graft cumulative survival rate of 54.5%.\n\n【51】BKVAN resulted in graft failure in 7% of the cases and emerged as one of the most important infectious diseases after transplantation \\[[@CIT0011]\\]. Significant BK viruria and viremia is common following transplantation within the first year and subsequently proceeds to BKVAN. Therefore, we observed a peak incidence of BKVAN diagnosed by biopsy within 1--2 years postoperatively in our study. Although no patient was diagnosed with BKVAN after more than 7 years, further research is needed to determine whether BKV infections can influence the long-term prognosis. Immunosuppressant reduction treatment and replacement of FK506 with CsA are effective in BKV infection recipients at an early stage. Our previous study provided successful resolution of BK viremia and BKVAN with excellent graft survival at 5 years by intensive monitoring and pre-emptive immunosuppression reduction \\[[@CIT0027]\\]. Recently, one study called for the use of pre-transplantation BK viral serological testing of living donors and recipients, which provided a serological marker that predicted the risk of BK viremia and BKVAN after transplantation \\[[@CIT0028]\\]. Subsequent studies are needed to increase the efficiency of BK virus screening.\n\n【52】Since the pathological and immunological mechanisms remain unknown, no reliable treatment strategy has been proven to reverse the progression of some diseases, such as CR, recurrent IgAN, and FSGS. However, biopsy promotes the detection rate of the causes of graft dysfunction. Early and aggressive treatment could be provided to improve the prognosis.\n\n【53】Conclusions {#s0008}\n===========\n\n【54】A biopsy is helpful for the diagnosis of graft dysfunction. To this end, we conclude that de novo or recurrent renal disease, represented by IgAN, is more frequent than rejection as a major cause of graft dysfunction following living kidney transplantation. When choosing to maintain immunosuppressive treatments for living transplantation, especially in patients with a high risk of recurrence, steroid withdrawal should be handled with caution, and an early biopsy should be performed.\n\n【55】Limitation {#s0009}\n==========\n\n【56】Despite the incidence and 5-year graft cumulative survival rates analyzed in our study, we did not perform a comparison of the significance between groups for the prognosis of graft dysfunction, influenced by the lack of information about the primary diseases of the recipients and other donor factors. In addition, a few patients did not visit and have biopsy in time when having an initial indication. So we could not compare the outcomes of the different causes in this study. To achieve this end, a complete database and survival analysis based on Cox regression is needed in a subsequent study.\n\n【57】Disclosure statement {#s0010}\n====================\n\n【58】No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In such ecosystems, the surface sediment layer (a few millimeters thick) is a transition zone between oxic and anoxic conditions that favor the development of stratified and cohesive layers of diverse assemblages of oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophic microorganisms. Mass blooms of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, forming large colored mats, can occur at the sediment surface in the intertidal zone ([@B27]). On the Orkney islands ([@B62]) and Roscoff Aber Bay ([@B24]), blooms dominated by purple sulfur bacteria typically occur on sandy sediments locally enriched in organic matter derived from the decomposition of macroalgal deposits. In their habitats, such as enclosed lagoons, estuaries, and salt marshes, purple sulfur bacteria have to cope with occasionally occurring drastic changes of salinity, temperature, and light conditions ([@B11]; [@B13]; [@B29]). This situation occurs in Roscoff Aber Bay, a temperate intertidal bay, where muddy-sandy sediments are extensively covered by stranded Enteromorpha sp. and mats of purple sulfur bacteria during warm summer months ([@B22], [@B23]). In a preliminary study ([@B24]), we reported that these mats were dominated by Chromatiaceae. These purple sulfur gammaproteobacteria are all capable of photolithoautotrophic growth under anoxic conditions with sulfide and elemental sulfur as electron donors and are potentially mixotrophic and photoassimilate simple organic compounds, of which acetate and pyruvate are the most widely used ([@B28]). We previously assessed the biochemical composition (fatty acids, photosynthetic pigments) of the microbial mats and their influence on ecosystem functions (sediment cohesiveness, CO~2~ fixation) at low tide in Roscoff Aber Bay and demonstrated that the proliferation of these purple sulfur bacteria have a major impact on the diversity and functionality of intertidal mats ([@B24]). Particularly, their massive growth resulted in a dramatic increase of both gross CO~2~ fixation as well as total mat respiration in comparison to diatom-dominated mats. However, despite the increase of total CO~2~ fixation, purple sulfur bacterial mats presented a net CO~2~ degassing whereas diatom-dominated mats represented a net CO~2~ sink. We suggested that photosynthetic efficiency was probably hampered in these mats and that macroalgal-derived organic matter favored the photoheterotrophic lifestyle of purple sulfur bacteria.\n\n【2】Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) is a powerful technique capable of imaging elemental distributions and measuring metabolic activities of a single-cell level in mixed populations, including within biofilms. Combining NanoSIMS with stable isotope enriched incubations has been used recently to study the cycling and flux of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen in phototrophic microbial mats from several environments ([@B15]; [@B10]; [@B64], [@B63]; [@B32]). To better understand the structure and the development of phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria assemblages at the surface of intertidal sediment and their influence on important ecosystem functions and services, we sampled undisturbed cores of these mats and performed a stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment. In this study, our aims were 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> to identify the dominant and active members of the mats, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> to elucidate preferred carbon sources taken up by the mat members and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> to estimate organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen uptake rates at the sub-micrometric scale by combining compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and NanoSIMS analyses.\n\n【3】Materials and Methods {#s1}\n=====================\n\n【4】Sampling Site\n-------------\n\n【5】Sediment cores and microbial mats were collected at mid day in August 2010 at low tide in the Roscoff Aber Bay (Brittany, France; 48°42′59.836 N, 3°59′51.611 W). The bay is about 1 km long and 2 km wide, entirely situated above mid-tide level, and its annual benthic metabolism has been extensively studied in the past ([@B20]; [@B22], [@B25]). Particularly sheltered, the bay is dominated by sandy-muddy sediments, with local freshwater inputs from the river located at the landward end of the bay and with freshwater seepages. The bay is affected by the seasonal proliferation of green macroalgae that affect both the trophic ecology ([@B45]) and C fluxes of the ecosystem ([@B20]). The selected mats were established at the surface of fine-sand intertidal sediments (mean particle size: 215 ± 43 μm, [@B22]). Oxic layers were absent or very thin (\\<1 mm thick) below these mats.\n\n【6】Incubation Experiments with Stable Isotopes\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Core incubations were first carried out to follow substrate incorporation in microbial fatty acids over time using specific isotope analysis of fatty acid methyl ester (CSIA-FAME). Undisturbed microbial mats were isolated at mid day from surrounding sediment using sterile polycarbonate cut-off syringes (10 mm diameter) pushed down to about 3 cm depth (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Three cores used to determine baseline conditions (control) were immediately removed from the sediment; the first two millimeters were sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The remaining cores were used for 3 different triplicate incubations designated AceL, PyrL, CO3L. Incubation designations referred to the labeled substrate added and to the light condition: \"Ace\" for \\[1-^13^C\\] sodium acetate-1- (99 atom %), \"Pyr\" for \\[2-^13^C\\] sodium pyruvate (99 atom %) and \"CO3\" for ^13^C sodium bicarbonate (99 atom %), \"L\" for incubations at ambient light. A constant volume (1.9 ml) of the ^13^C labeled substrate solutions (final concentration of 500 μM, prepared with seawater freshly collected from the study site) was gently added on top of the mat cores and incubated in situ at ambient light (\\>1000 μmol photons m^-2^ s^-1^) and temperature (22--23°C) for 2 h. At the end of the incubation period, cores were removed from the sediment, the first two millimeters sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\n【8】![General aspect of various types of purple sulfur bacterial mats of the Roscoff Bay. Emersed (a,b) or immerged (c) biofilms. Adapted from [@B65].](fmicb-08-01995-g001){#F1}\n\n【9】Core incubations were also carried out to examine the assimilation of labeled substrates at single cell level by NanoSIMS analysis. Several underwater purple sulfur bacterial mats were sampled as described above, homogenized and brought back to laboratory shortly after collection under controlled conditions. Briefly, the homogenized microbial mats were used for 7 different triplicate incubations designated control, AceL, AceD, PyrL, PyrD, CO3L, and CO3D. Incubation designations were as above and \"D\" referred to incubations in the dark. The ^13^C labeled substrate solutions were prepared as above and incubations were performed at ambient light (\\>1000 μmol photons m-2 s-1) or in the dark at controlled temperature (19°C) for 5 h. Cores samples were incubated with ^13^C-labeled bicarbonate, ^13^C-labeled acetate and ^13^C -labeled pyruvate In addition, to estimate nitrogen uptake, ^15^N-labeled ammonium chloride (98 atom %; final concentration of 100 μM) was added to all incubations. The final atomic ratios (bicarbonate: 28.1, acetate: 33.5, pyruvate: 86.9% atom percent ^13^C, ammonium: 74.5% atom percent ^15^N) were calculated taking into account the natural concentrations of the corresponding substrate previously measured in discrete seawater samples collected before mat collection (bicarbonate, ammonium) or concentration ranges (acetate, pyruvate) used in similar studies ([@B38]; [@B57]). After incubation, purple sulfur bacterial mats were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, filtered on gold-coated polycarbonate (GTTP type; pore size 0.22 μm, diameter 25 mm, Millipore), and washed with filter-sterilized seawater to remove labeled substrates in excess. The filters were further stored at -20°C until processing.\n\n【10】### Fatty Acid Composition\n\n【11】Fatty acids (FAs) were extracted following the method of Bligh and Dyer ([@B6]) slightly modified by [@B37]. Total lipids were extracted by sonication (35 kHz, 20 min) using a chloroform/methanol/water cocktail (2:1:1, v:v:v), concentrated under a constant N~2~ flow, and the residue hydrolyzed (90 min, 90°C) with NaOH:MeOH (1:2, v:v). An internal standard (tricosanoic acid: 23:0, 10 μg) was added to each sample before extraction. Hydrolysis (i.e. saponification) aimed to release individual FAs from more complex molecules, such as triglycerides or phospholipids, by breaking the ester bonds. Individual FAs were then derivatized into fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) by the addition of one methyl (CH3) group (i.e. methylation procedure) so that they can be separated and quantified by gas chromatography. Methylation was performed by incubating individual FAs with boron-trifluoride methanol (BF3-MeOH) at 90°C for 10 min. Sample were then dried under N~2~ flux and transferred to hexane for injection in a gas chromatograph (GC, Varian CP-3800 equipped with flame ionization detector - FID). Most FAMEs were identified by comparing their retention times with those of known standards (Supelco^TM^ 37, PUFA-1 Marine Source, and Bacterial Mix; Supelco Inc. Bellefonte, PA, United States). Unidentified FAMEs were further identified by GC coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC-MS, Varian GC450-220MS). For both devices, FAMEs separation was performed using a Supelco OMEGAWAX 320 column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d. 0.25 μm film thickness) with H~2~ as carrier gas. After injection of 1 μl of sample at 60°C, the temperature was raised to 150°C at 40°C min-1, then to 240°C (held 14 min) at 3°C min-1. FAMEs were systematically corrected for the added methyl group and corresponding individual FAs are designated in this study as CX:Y-nZ, where X is the number of carbons, Y the number of double bonds and Z the position of the ultimate double bond from the terminal methyl. Cyclopropane FAMEs were detected and noted 9-10diMe C16 and 9-10diMe C18 for Methyl cis-9,10-methylene hexa- and octa-decanoate, respectively.\n\n【12】Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】After GC and GC-MS analyses, isotope ratio gas-chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) was used to measure the carbon stable isotope ratios (expressed in ‰) of individual fatty acids. Measurements were performed at the UC Davis Stable Isotope Facility of the University of California (Davis, CA, United States). FAMEs dissolved in hexane are injected in splitless mode and separated on a Varian factorFOUR VF-5ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 micron film thickness). Once separated, FAMEs are quantitatively converted to CO~2~ in an oxidation reactor at 950°C. Following water removal through a nafion dryer, CO~2~ enters the IRMS. δ^13^values were corrected using working standards composed of several FAMEs calibrated against NIST standard reference materials. Stable carbon isotope ratios for individual fatty acids (FA) were calculated from FAME data by correcting for the one carbon atom in the methyl group that was added during the derivatization process. This correction was made according to [@B18] by taking into account the isotope ratio of the derivatized methanol (BF3-methanol, -37.9 ‰ in our study), and the fractional carbon contribution of the free fatty acid to the ester.\n\n【14】δ\n\n【15】13\n\n【16】C\n\n【17】F\n\n【18】A\n\n【19】=\n\n【20】(\n\n【21】δ\n\n【22】13\n\n【23】C\n\n【24】F\n\n【25】A\n\n【26】M\n\n【27】E\n\n【28】−\n\n【29】(\n\n【30】1\n\n【31】−\n\n【32】f\n\n【33】)\n\n【34】·\n\n【35】δ\n\n【36】13\n\n【37】C\n\n【38】C\n\n【39】H\n\n【40】3\n\n【41】O\n\n【42】H\n\n【43】)\n\n【44】f\n\n【45】where δ^13^C~FA~ is the isotopic composition of the free fatty acids, δ^13^C~FAME~ is the isotopic composition of the fatty acid methyl ester, f is the fractional carbon contribution of the free fatty acid to the ester and δ^13^C~CH3OH~ is the isotopic composition of the methanol derivatization reagent. For instance, in the case of a C16 FA, f would be equal to 16/17. The isotopic composition of the methanol was determined by the same GC-IRMS system.\n\n【46】Molecular Identification of the Mat-Forming Purple Bacteria Using 16S rRNA and pufM Genes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Biomass from three microbial mats was collected close to where the cores were sampled using sterile plastic syringes and transferred in Eppendorf tubes. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and further stored at -80°C until analysis. For DNA extraction, cells were thawed and suspended in DNA lysis buffer (0.75 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) and processed using the procedure described by [@B36]. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Any trace of genomic DNA was removed using a Turbo DNA-free kit (Ambion). DNA removal in RNA samples was confirmed by control PCR amplifications without the reverse transcription step. No amplification was detected in these controls. ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) was used for the reverse transcription of mRNA from total RNA samples. The cDNA synthesis was performed at 50°C using random primers.\n\n【48】Small-subunit (16S) rRNA genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal reverse primer 1492R and Bacteria-specific forward primer 8F ([@B61]). PCR amplification of pufM genes was performed using the primers 557F and 750R designed by [@B1]. Reaction mixture (25 μL) contained the following components: 5X buffer (10 μl), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 pmoles of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; Eurogentec), 10 pmoles of each oligonucleotide primer, 2.5 U of GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) and 50 to 100 ng of template DNA. Amplifications were carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) with the following parameters: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C, respectively, and extension at 72°C for 60 s and 30 s for 16S rRNA and pufM gene amplification, respectively, with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. Amplicons were cloned directly or after gel extraction using the TOPO4-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were sequenced using an ABI 3130 POP7 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Biogenouest Sequencing-Genotyping Platform (Roscoff site).\n\n【49】The sequences were trimmed to remove any vector and primer sequences. Chimeras were removed using Uchime (v4.2.40; [@B14]). Gene sequences were compared to sequences in public databases with BLASTn ([@B3]). The 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned the SILVA SSUref N99 references (v.128) using ARB aligner. The pufM DNA sequences were translated into amino acid sequences and aligned using the MAFFT E-INS-I algorithm. The resulting protein alignment was back-translated to nucleotide acid sequences using pal2nal ([@B53]). Conservative values of 97% and 94% nucleic acid sequence similarity for 16S rRNA and pufM sequences, respectively, were chosen for clustering sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using MOTHUR ([@B48]). Representative sequences (defined as the sequence with the minimum distance to all other sequences in the OTU) were obtained using MOTHUR.\n\n【50】A pufM database and a consensus Bayesian tree were built as described in [@B7]. Representative sequences of each OTU (245 pb) and short pufM environmental reference sequences were aligned as above and added to the backbone tree using the ADDBYPARSIMONY algorithm implemented in ARB software ([@B34]). Likewise, representative ssu sequences of each OTU (927 pb) were added to the SILVA reference tree using ARB. Non-informative taxa were removed from both final tree.\n\n【51】NanoSIMS Image Acquisition\n--------------------------\n\n【52】Secondary ion images of ^12^C-, ^13^C-, ^12^C^14^N-, ^12^C^15^N-, and ^32^S- were recorded simultaneously for each individual cell using the Cameca NanoSIMS N50 at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France). All measurements were performed using the same analytical conditions. Firstly, a 30 × 30 μm image field was chosen and the filters were pre-sputtered during 4 min with a 18.8 pA Cs- primary ion beam that was stepped over the sample in a 256 × 256 pixel raster with a counting time of 1 ms per pixel. Then image acquisition was made by rescanning 25--30 times a 25 × 25 μm image field sputtered with a 0.5 pA Cs- beam in a 256 × 256 pixel raster with a counting time of 1 ms per pixel.\n\n【53】NanoSIMS Data Processing\n------------------------\n\n【54】NanoSIMS data were then processed using the proprietary WinImage Software (L'image, CAMECA SIMS Image Processing). Purple sulfur bacteria were detected based on their typical coccoïd shape from the ^12^C^14^N- images and each bacterial cell was defined as a region of interest (ROIs). ROIs data were exported as.csv files and processed using the R© statistical framework to calculate carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios as well as atom percent of ^13^C and ^15^N.\n\n【55】r\n\n【56】i\n\n【57】=\n\n【58】(\n\n【59】R\n\n【60】ini\n\n【61】−\n\n【62】R\n\n【63】measured\n\n【64】.\n\n【65】i\n\n【66】)\n\n【67】R\n\n【68】ini\n\n【69】−\n\n【70】R\n\n【71】final\n\n【72】.\n\n【73】i\n\n【74】where r~i~ is a dimensionless ratio for incubation experiment i, R~ini~ is the initial isotopic ratio of the bacteria (based on the mean of natural isotopic composition of the control), R~measured.i~ is the measured isotopic ratio (NanoSIMS) of a given bacterial cell for incubation experiment i, R~final.i~ is the theoretical isotopic ratio of a given bacterial cell based on the isotopic composition of the substrate used during the incubation experiment. R~final.i~ was calculated by taking into account the isotopic ratio of the substrate at its final concentration in the sample. It is assumed that no isotopic fractionation would occur during substrate assimilation. All isotopic ratios (R) are in atom %. Substrate incorporation was calculated as follows:\n\n【75】F\n\n【76】i\n\n【77】=\n\n【78】C\n\n【79】i\n\n【80】·\n\n【81】V\n\n【82】bac\n\n【83】·\n\n【84】r\n\n【85】i\n\n【86】t\n\n【87】where F~i~ is the quantity of substrate incorporated by a bacterial cell per hour (moles.cell^-1^. h^-1^), C~i~ is the final concentration of substrate i (in moles.L^-1^), Vbac (in L) is the mean cell volume (estimated to 2.4 μm^3^, mean diameter = 1.67 μm), r~i~ is the dimensionless ratio for incubation experiment i , t is the incubation time in h. F~i~ was then converted to carbon and nitrogen weight units (fg C.cell^-1^. h^-1^ and fg N.cell^-1^. h^-1^) assuming a molar mass of 12 and 14 g.mol^-1^ for carbon and nitrogen, respectively.\n\n【88】Statistical Analyses\n--------------------\n\n【89】All analyses and graphs were performed using the R© statistical framework. Normality was checked to perform one sample t-tests. When normality and/or homogeneity of variance assumption were not met, Van der Waerden tests were performed, which convert the ranks of a non-parametric Kruskal--Wallis rank sum test into quantiles of the standard normal distribution. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to compare the regression slopes between carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios. This analysis was used to test the effect of a categorical factor (i.e. treatment) on a dependent variable (i.e. N isotopic ratio) while controlling for the effect of a continuous co-variable (i.e. C isotopic ratio).\n\n【90】Nucleotide Accession Numbers\n----------------------------\n\n【91】16S rRNA gene and transcript sequences obtained in this study are deposited under GenBank accession numbers [MF320555](MF320555) to [MF320732](MF320732). Sequences of pufM genes and transcripts are deposited under GenBank accession numbers [KX352089](KX352089) to [KX352145](KX352145) and [KX358536](KX358536) to [KX358562](KX358562), respectively.\n\n【92】Results\n=======\n\n【93】Fatty Acid Composition\n----------------------\n\n【94】The mats were characterized by several bacterial markers such as branched FAs (i.e. iso and anteiso FAs), two cyclopropane FAs, as well as the vaccenic fatty acid (C18:1n-7). C16:1n-7, C18:1n-7, C16:0 and C14:0 prevailed in the mats and their concentrations varied greatly between treatments (Figure [2A](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, their proportions in the six treatments did not vary significantly from the control (one sample t-test, p \\> 0.05) (Figure [2B](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), indicating that treatments did not affect FA composition.\n\n【95】![Fatty acid composition of the purple sulfur bacterial mats in terms of quantity (A) and percentages (B).](fmicb-08-01995-g002){#F2}\n\n【96】Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA)\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【97】Sediment cores with dense purple sulfur bacterial mats were incubated at ambient light and temperature with ^13^C- and/or ^15^N-labeled acetate, pyruvate, bicarbonate and ammonium. Main cellular fatty acids of purple sulfur bacteria ([@B40]) such as C18:1n-7, C16:1n-7 and C16:0 were detected by GC-IRMS and their isotopic compositions measured. According to Van der Waerden tests, fatty acids were systematically significantly enriched compared to the control (natural FA isotopic composition), when acetate and bicarbonate were used as growth substrates. Vaccenic acid (C18:1n-7), an unambiguous marker of purple sulfur bacteria was the most strongly enriched after ^13^C-acetate amendment. Although they were also significant, ^13^C enrichments with ^13^C-bicarbonate or ^13^C-pyruvate were much lower. In contrast, palmitic acid C16:0 and palmitoleic acid C16:1n-7 were more ^13^C enriched with bicarbonate than with acetate and pyruvate (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Although algal fatty acids such as C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3 (macroalgae) and C20:5n-3 (microalgae) were significantly enriched by the selected substrates, they were more ^13^C enriched in the presence of bicarbonate. In addition to the bacterial markers identified by GC and GC-MS, several others were further identified by GC-IRMS such as another cyclopropane FA (cyC17:0), known to improve membrane fluidity of halophilic microorganims ([@B41]), and hydroxy fatty acids such as C16:0-OH ([@B60]). Both FAs and C17:0 anteiso were significantly more enriched when ^13^C-bicarbonate and ^13^C-acetate were provided as substrate than in the control and ^13^C-pyruvate amendment.\n\n【98】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Isotopic ratio (δ^13^C notation) of the main fatty acids of purple sulfur bacterial mats.

NanoSIMS imaging revealed that the purple bacterial mats were formed by dense populations of coccoid cells aggregated in microcolonies. This dominant mat morphotype was detected based on its typical coccoid shape from the naturally abundant ^14^N (^12^C^14^N-) images (Figure [4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and defined as ROI. A total of 1,204 bacterial cells were identified and encircled across all the treatments as shown in Figure [4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}. For each ROI, ^15^N/^14^N (inferred from the ^12^C^15^N-/^12^C^14^N- ratio) and ^13^C/^12^C (^13^C-/^12^C-) ratios were calculated and expressed in delta value (‰, Figures [4C,D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Examination of the NanoSIMS images and delta values indicated that purple spherical bacterial cells were not equally enriched in ^15^N and ^13^C relative to the non-amended cells (control). Significant differences were observed between treatments (Figures [4C,D](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and within treatments, especially under light. Cells displayed a great heterogeneity in terms of C and N uptake at a very small spatial scale (Figure [4B](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). They were substantially more enriched in both ^13^C and ^15^N under light that in the dark irrespective of the growth substrate. The highest delta values were obtained with pyruvate. A significant correlation between C and N ratios in each treatment (except control) as well as linear relationships (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}) indicated that C and N uptakes were linked. All linear regressions, except AceD, were significantly similar (ANCOVA: p = 9.489e-12 with all treatments, p = 0.1037 when removing AceD, the control treatment was removed from all analyses). Assimilation rates were very variable and ranged from 0 to 0.002 fg C.bacterial cell^-1^. h^-1^ and from 0 to 0.0003 fg N.bacteria cell^-1^. h^-1^ (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Uptake of ^13^C and ^15^N in the incubations were significantly higher in the light for the three carbon sources while no elevated ^13^C- and/or ^15^N-uptake was detected in dark incubations, except in ^13^C-acetate amendments, indicating that acetate incorporation, the most active in the dominant mat morphotype, was not light-dependent.\n\n【101】![(A,B) Examples of NanoSIMS isotopic images of the purple sulfur bacteria mats.

To determine the bacterial community in the mats and identify which community members expressed the functional gene for anoxygenic photosynthesis, 16S rRNA and pufM clone libraries were constructed from DNA and cDNA recovered from two mat samples. Coverage estimates ranging from 66.7 to 98.4% (mean 82%) and rarefaction curves (Supplementary Figure [S1](#SM1){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}) indicated that a large part of the sample diversity was detected in the libraries. In 16S rRNA clone libraries of two samples (178 clones), a substantial proportion of the sequences were related to the genera Thiohalocapsa (OTUs 8 and 22) and Marichromatium (OTUs 2 and related) within the Chromatiaceae family (Supplementary Figure [S2](#SM2){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Both these genera, known to form dense purple layers in microbial mats, are morphologically distinct since Thiohalocapsa cells are spherical and cells of Marichromatium are straight to slightly curved rods ([@B12]; [@B26]). The most abundant bacterial phylotype (OTU1, ∼48% of the total clones) in the libraries was, however, very closely related to a Pseudomonas strain isolated from a deep-sea sediment. The rest of the bacterial community was composed of minor OTUs that included sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfobacteraceae) and diverse members of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\n【106】Most of the 203 total DNA- and cDNA-derived pufM sequences (95 and 108 clones, respectively) recovered from three mat samples were assigned to known genera of the Chromatiaceae (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>(#F7){ref-type=\"fig\"} and Supplementary Table [S1](#SM4){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Thiohalocapsa-related pufM sequences were numerically dominant in the DNA libraries (\\>60% of the total sequences). Sequencing of the pufM transcripts revealed that the majority (\\>80%) of expressed pufM sequences recovered from cDNA of the samples also belonged to the Thiohalocapsa cluster, confirming the identity of the prevalent morphotype observed on NanoSIMS images.\n\n【107】![Phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between pufM gene sequences of anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria retrieved from the Roscoff Aber Bay mats (in bold) and relatives retrieved in GenBank.

The scale bar represents dissimilarity between nucleotide positions.](fmicb-08-01995-g007){#F7}\n\n【108】The few other pufM sequences recovered in this study were closely related to the alphaproteobacterial genera Roseobacter, Jannaschia, Roseovarius, Sulfitobacter, Loktanella and to Luminiphilus in the Gammaproteobacteria (Supplementary Figure [S3](#SM3){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). These bacteria correspond to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAP) which are known from previous studies to represent marine, halophilic and salt-dependent bacteria in the top oxic layer of sandy or muddy intertidal sediments ([@B49]; [@B9]; [@B44]; [@B50]).\n\n【109】Discussion\n==========\n\n【110】In this study, we used a combination of chemical, molecular and NanoSIMS analyses to investigate natural purple sulfur bacterial mats from the intertidal sediments of the Roscoff Aber Bay and estimate carbon and nitrogen fluxes at the submicrometric scale. We discovered that purple bacteria belonging to the Thiohalocapsa cluster represented almost the entire fraction of the expressed pufM genes. In addition, the coupled NanoSIMS/CSIA-FAME approach led us to conclude that members of the genus Thiohalocapsa were the most photosynthetically active bacteria in the studied mats. As pointed out recently by [@B17], NanoSIMS is a handy tool to investigate the functions and process of microorganisms especially in complex natural environments but yet requires further development. We believe that validation of NanoSIMS fluxes by CSIA is a very promising combination in revealing substrate uptake at the single cell level.\n\n【111】Bacterial Community Composition of Purple Sulfur Mats\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【112】The phylogenetic analysis showed that purple bacterial mats were dominated by very few species. Based on 16S rRNA gene library, the most abundant clone was closely related to a Pseudomonas strain. Whilst this finding is not completely within the scope of the present study, it is interesting to note that this dominant sequence was found in several different samples, suggesting that the corresponding organism is favored by the modified chemical and physical gradients occurring at the sediment surface and/or takes advantage of the development of purple bacterial mats. Other dominant 16S rRNA clones were mainly affiliated with the family Chromatiaceae and most closely related to Thiohalocapsa and Marichromatium. Members of the genera Marichromatium and Thiohalocapsa are typical purple sulfur bacteria isolated from or detected in shallow coastal habitats such as the Roscoff Aber Bay where they are exposed to diel cycles of light intensity and temperature ([@B8]; [@B12]; [@B54]). Overall, pufM sequences that we obtained mainly grouped within the Thiohalocapsa clade. Several lines of evidence indicate that Thiohalocapsa-related bacteria were the main purple sulfur bacteria in the mats. First, [@B55] demonstrated an overall high consistency of tree topologies of pufM and 16S rRNA gene, allowing a phylogenetic classification of purple sulfur bacteria to the genus and in many cases to the species level. Second, Thiohalocapsa-related sequences were prominent in the DNA- and rRNA based pufM libraries. And third, microcolonies viewed on NanoSIMS images were mainly composed by spherical cells typical of the Thiohalocapsa species described to date ([@B12]; [@B26]; [@B4]). Minor phylotypes of purple sulfur bacteria and aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria were detected in the mat samples. Nucleotide sequence similarities of these phylotypes showed different degrees of relatedness (from 84 to 96% similarity) to recognized species. The majority of them could be assigned to uncultured Chromatiaceae and to aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria AAPs related to the genera Roseobacter clade and Luminiphilus, respectively ([@B31]; [@B59]; [@B58]; [@B35]; [@B50]). The coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs has been reported in bacterial mats covering marine and saline sediments ([@B44]; [@B56]). AAP bacteria have been shown to be abundant and active in marine oxygenated waters ([@B5]; [@B30]; [@B7]) and it is not clear whether they are active in oxygen-limited or anoxic conditions. In this study, only one pufM sequence from AAP bacteria (OTU10) was recovered in the cDNA-based libraries, suggesting that most of detected AAP bacteria were not able to grow photosynthetically under the low oxygen levels occurring at the mat surface.\n\n【113】Structure and Heterogeneity of the Thiohalocapsa Mats\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【114】NanoSIMS images allowed the detection of 1024 ROIs based on the typical coccoïd shape of Thiohalocapsa-like cells. The most remarkable feature of the microbial mats was the relative homogeneity of morphotypes characterized by the presence of sulfur globules inside the cells (Figure [4A](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}). They result from the transient storage of sulfur during oxidation of sulfide ([@B12]). As the likely result of the sample preparation procedure for NanoSIMS (i.e. high vacuum, ionization), the sulfur globules were visible as \"holes\" in the NanoSIMS images. This situation has already been observed in electron micrographs ([@B16]). In that context, the naturally abundant ^14^N (^12^C^14^N-) images were very useful to detect Thiohalocapsa-like cells and define ROIs but, surprisingly, it was not possible to detect elemental sulfur using the ^32^S-detector neither within the globules (as sulfur was probably lost during sample preparation) nor in the rest of the cells.\n\n【115】Our data demonstrated that ^13^C enrichments can vary greatly between individual cells from the same species in the same bacterial mat although they are physically close to each other and even within cell clumps. This finding was surprising given the relative homogeneity of the microbial mats in terms of structure, fatty acid composition and bacterial community composition. This has also been observed in natural populations of other phototrophic microorganisms ([@B39]; [@B43]). [@B39] reported this situation in anaerobic phototrophic bacteria and hypothesized that the observed differences could be explained by the presence of physiologically distinct populations of phylogenetically identical or closely related organisms or by differences in gene expression among individual cells. In this study, ^13^C and ^15^N uptake rates were positively related which may indicate that the observed heterogeneity between individuals is likely explained by the presence of active and inactive cells, reflecting distinct physiological states or life \"traits\" ([@B39]).\n\n【116】C Assimilation in Natural Purple Sulfur Mats\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【117】NanoSIMS analyses showed that the highest δ^13^C were obtained in the light in the presence of pyruvate, suggesting that pyruvate was the preferred photoassimilated carbon source for the Thiohalocapsa-dominated mats in our experimental conditions. However, direct comparison of the δ^13^C and δ^15^N values between treatments must be taken cautiously in the light of the final atomic ratio of each substrate used during the incubation. Indeed, the natural concentrations of acetate, pyruvate, bicarbonate and ammonium as well as their natural δ^13^C and δ^15^N must be known in order to properly estimate C & N fluxes. In our experiments, we used initial bicarbonate (1.3 mM; final isotopic ratio of 33.5 atom%) and ammonium levels (30.8 μM; final isotopic ratio of 86.9 atom%) corresponding to mean values measured in water covering biofilms and that are typical mean values recorded in August ([@B21]). Since we were unable to measure the initial concentrations of acetate and pyruvate before the incubation experiments, these values were taken from the literature. Pyruvate is an important intermediate for microbial metabolism but it is involved exclusively in intracellular reactions ([@B46]). As a consequence, its natural concentrations in pore waters is generally very low ([@B46]; [@B47]; [@B19]) thought it can be locally abundant if cell lysis is important or adsorbed onto extracellular polymeric substances through ketal links ([@B52]). Acetate is generally more abundant than pyruvate in sediments. While most studies agree that acetate concentrations are about 50 μM in the oxic zone of the sediment, they may increase significantly (up to 2 mM) when the environment becomes anoxic ([@B2]). We therefore used concentration estimates for pyruvate (70 μM) and acetate (1000 μM) which correspond to final isotopic ratios of 33.5 and 86.9 atom%, respectively. Using these final atomic ratios, our data showed that Thiohalocapsa-related bacteria preferentially assimilate acetate and bicarbonate in the light. Their uptakes of acetate, bicarbonate and pyruvate under light conditions are in agreement with the substrate utilization of Thiohalocapsa species in culture under anaerobic conditions when sulfide is present ([@B12]; [@B26]; [@B4]), suggesting that anoxic conditions prevailed in the mats during the incubation experiments. To our knowledge, no studies have compared the assimilation rates of carbon sources by Thiohalocapsa species either in culture or in the natural environment. Here, additionally to their potential nutritional preferences under light, we also showed that acetate assimilation, although slower, was still efficient in the dark while uptakes of bicarbonate and pyruvate were minor in the same conditions. Chemoorganotrophic growth in micro-oxic conditions in the dark has been reported in T. halophila with pyruvate ([@B12]) and in other Chromatiaceae with acetate and/or pyruvate ([@B29]). This suggests that micro-aerobic conditions also occur in Thiohalocapsa-dominated mats. The coexistence of micro-aerobic and anoxic zones at the micrometer scale in the investigated biofilms may also have contributed to the observed heterogeneity in the uptake of labelled substrates as revealed by NanoSIMS analysis. The ability of Thiohalocapsa-related bacteria to use acetate, one of the most important intermediates of anaerobic degradation of organic matter, during diurnal cycles of the light regime in oxic to anoxic conditions may likely explain their bloom formation in coastal microbial mats of Roscoff Aber Bay.\n\n【118】Using our single cell NanoSIMS fluxes (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}), we extrapolated the bicarbonate fixation rates (mean CO3L fluxes -- mean CO3D fluxes) to the whole community assuming a mean cell density of 7.5 × 1011 cells.g sediment^-1^ as evaluated using BChl a levels ([@B24]), a BChl a content of 0.01991 mg Bchl a.mg C^-1^ ([@B42]), and a cell carbon content of 20 fgC.cell^-1^ ([@B33]). The result (1.95 ± 0.14 10^-7^ gC.g sediment^-1^.h^-1^) is close to the gross CO~2~ fixation rate (2.7 ± 0.1 10^-7^ gC.g sediment^-1^.h^-1^) of Thiohalocapsa-dominated mats measured using benthic chambers in a previous study ([@B24]). In this calculation, we considered a mean carbon flux of 27.3 ± 0.9 mgC m^-2^ h^-1^, a chamber surface of 0.71 m^2^, a volume of 1 m^2^ of biofilm of 1000 cm^3^ (width and length = 100 cm, depth = 0.1cm) and a sediment density of 1 g.cm^-3^). Both these estimations are also in line with those (0.18 10^-7^ gC.g sediment^-1^.h^-1^) of purple sulfur bacterial mats from the Orkney islands ([@B62]) assuming a O:C ratio of 1 during respiration and the same g to m^2^ conversion factor as above. This confirms that single-cell fixation rates may be useful to estimate carbon fluxes at the biofilm scale.\n\n【119】Conclusion\n==========\n\n【120】The combination of analytical chemistry as well as molecular ecology methods together with NanoSIMS imaging allowed the quantification of carbon and nitrogen fluxes at the submicrometric scale. Here, we demonstrated that Thiohalocapsa-dominated mats in the Roscoff Aber Bay assimilated a substantial amount of dissolved bicarbonate although they probably favor a photoheterotrophic lifestyle for their growth. In the future, more precise quantitative C and N budgets for purple sulfur bacterial mats could be constructed. Nevertheless, taking into account their wide dispersion in intertidal sediments, as recently evidenced by spectral reflectance ([@B23]), this study gives the way to the hitherto unsuspected importance of purple sulfur bacteria in the coastal carbon biogeochemical fluxes of coastal environments.\n\n【121】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author Contributions\n====================</u>\n\n【122】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Project PI: CH; field work: CH, CJ, and BJ; laboratory measurements: DB (molecular), NT (fatty acids), YB (chemistry); NanoSIMS measurements and analysis: CH and CJ; statistical analysis: CH and DB (molecular); manuscript writing: CH and CJ; manuscript revision: CH, CJ, and BJ.</u>\n\n【123】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest Statement\n==============================</u>\n\n【124】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【125】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by French National Program EC2CO-MicroBien (project BIOPOURPRE).

But this simple correlation does not prove that the relationship is causal. Neeraj Kaushal sifts through the evidence from economics and public policy and reviews large national and international studies to conclude that, indeed, education has large intergenerational payoffs in many areas of children's lives, and that these payoffs persist over time. Kaushal shows that, if anything, traditional measures of returns to education--which focus on income and productivity--almost certainly underestimate the beneficial effects that parents' education has on their children. She reports causal positive effects not only on children's test scores, health, and behavior, but also on mothers' behaviors that can affect their children's wellbeing, such as teenage childbearing and substance use. Her findings suggest that, as a component of two-generation programs, helping parents extend their education could go a long way toward reducing inequality across generations and promoting children's healthy development. Thus the rationale for two-generation programs that boost parents' education is compelling. However, Kaushal cautions, the U.S. education system reinforces socioeconomic inequality across generations by spending more money on educating richer children than on educating poorer children. By themselves, then, two-generation programs will not necessarily ameliorate the structural factors that perpetuate inequality in this country.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Previous research about ANC services in urban areas of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, has found the high turnover of health workers to be a barrier, exacerbated by a focus on training students, which hinders the continuity of care and privacy \\[[@CR10]\\]. Interventions aimed at strengthening ANC delivery through targeted technical training, equipment provision and guideline adaption have had only mixed success in strengthening the quality and frequency of ANC visits \\[[@CR11], [@CR12]\\].\n\n【4】The provision of ANC services in rural areas of Ethiopia is the joint responsibility of midwives and Health Extension Workers (HEWs). Midwives, stationed in rural areas at Primary Health Care Units (PHCUs), are frontline health workers who provide basic emergency obstetric and newborn care during normal deliveries, and identify and refer complications of childbirth to higher levels of the health system \\[[@CR13], [@CR14]\\]. Midwives based at PHCUs supervise the work of several HEWs stationed across about 5 health posts (the most decentralized health facility, staffed by HEWs). When trained to international standards, midwives can provide nearly 90% of care needed by women and newborns \\[[@CR15]\\]. In Ethiopia, about 97% of health centres or clinics employ at least one midwife, although few of these midwives have received training in basic emergency obstetric and newborn care \\[[@CR16]\\].\n\n【5】HEWs play a significant role alongside midwives to promote maternal health \\[[@CR4]\\]. These community-based health workers, all female, are recruited from local villages and have at least a grade ten level of education before undergoing their one-year HEW training \\[[@CR4]\\]. Once assigned at to their health post, HEWs are expected to spend 75% of their time conducting community outreach activities \\[[@CR4], [@CR17]\\], and serve a critical role in connecting women from their respective communities to higher levels of the health system. HEWs have a role in identifying, training and collaborating with the voluntary Women Development Army, a group of community leaders who support the work of the HEW. In terms of promoting MNCH, HEWs fulfill tasks such as: regular mapping of households with pregnant women; providing referral linkage for ANC visits at the PHCU; individual counselling on nutrition, breastfeeding, immunization, insecticide-treated net use, and family planning; and emphasizing the importance of institutional delivery through educational conferences \\[[@CR18]\\]. As of 2013, there are about 38,000 HEWs deployed across 16,440 rural kebeles (villages of about 5000 people) in Ethiopia \\[[@CR19], [@CR20]\\].\n\n【6】Midwives and HEWs work together in different aspects of ANC delivery to ensure women receive adequate ANC services. These efforts are represented across three noteworthy stages of ANC service promotion and delivery: health promotion (e.g. leading pregnant women conferences \\[[@CR21]\\]); community outreach (e.g. identification and follow-up of pregnant women); and ANC visits. It is unclear, however, how midwives and HEWs have been progressing in collaborative efforts to provide ANC to women. Collaboration among key actors is critical in improving productivity and performance in the promotion and delivery of ANC services, and thereby maternal and neonatal health outcomes \\[[@CR22], [@CR23]\\]. Evidence from mid and high-income workplace settings suggest that team cohesion is associated with improved organizational performance and learning \\[[@CR24]\\]. Studies also suggest that collaboration among interdisciplinary health care teams contributes to improved health outcomes among populations in healthcare settings \\[[@CR25]\\], and improved performance through the utilization of collective knowledge \\[[@CR26]\\].\n\n【7】This article focuses on such collaboration using data collected from midwives who not only have a large role in ANC service delivery, but also work alongside HEWs to promote the use of MNCH services, including ANC, at the community level. The aim of the study is to generate a better understanding of the interaction between midwives and HEWs in promoting and providing ANC, in order to provide new insights for decision-makers to build on current strengths, address barriers, and consider ways forward in improving maternal healthcare utilization and quality of care. Explorations of midwife perspectives on ANC service provision in rural Ethiopia is currently understudied, though important to discern the way forward for strengthening MNCH in rural settings.\n\n【8】Methods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n【9】Study context {#Sec3}\n-------------\n\n【10】Evidence for this article is derived from the larger Safe Motherhood Project, a mixed-methods, randomized cluster intervention trial testing the roll out and scale up of interventions to improve access to health facilities for pregnant women and reduce preventable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The study focuses on two interventions: the delivery of information, education, and communication workshops in conjunction with key community leaders; and improving the functionality of maternal waiting areas (residences nearby health facilities for women nearing their delivery date, allowing for close monitoring and rapid birth attendance by a skilled midwife \\[[@CR25]\\]). This research is being conducted in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, across 24 PHCUs in three rural districts: Gomma, Kersa, and Seka Chekorsa. There are 112 kebeles in the study area (41 in Gomma, 32 in Kersa and 38 in Seka Chekorsa).\n\n【11】Data collection {#Sec4}\n---------------\n\n【12】As a part of the larger Safe Motherhood Project baseline qualitative assessment, we conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with midwives, HEWs, PHCU directors, male and female community leaders, and religious leaders to explore various aspects of MNCH in the community. The interviews included questions about: MNCH service delivery and use; stakeholder roles in promoting MNCH; community participation in MNCH activities; problems related to MNCH; and maternity waiting areas. This paper focuses on data collected from 11 midwives, employed at PHCUs across Gomma (n = 5), Kersa (n = 2) and Seka Chekorsa (n = 4) districts. Findings derived from the HEW interviews (n = 31) have been reported elsewhere \\[[@CR27]\\]. The interview guide used in this study was developed for the Safe Motherhood Project (通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#MOESM2){ref-type=\"media\"}).</u>\n\n【13】For interviews with midwives, six random PHCUs for each intervention arm were selected using the Wolfram Alpha software. This software generated sets of six random and different integers, which were matched with PHCU listing numbers to randomly select PHCUs in each arm for midwife interviews. In total, 18 interviews were to be conducted with PHCU midwives in accordance with the sampling frame. Data collectors were able to conduct 11 of these interviews, achieving 61% of their target. The interviews took place in selected areas in each respective PHCU where the midwives worked.\n\n【14】The baseline qualitative data were collected over a four-month period (November 2016 -- February 2017), working with data collectors from Jimma University. (A parallel baseline quantitative survey was also administered, but is not reported on in this article.) The data collectors were fluent in both English and the local language (Afan Oromo), had graduate-level university training, and had previous experience doing qualitative research. The data collectors participated in a one-week training and induction workshop prior to the field work, which focused on techniques to conduct interviews and keep field notes. At least two researchers from the Safe Motherhood Project were present in a supervisory capacity during the field work to address any issues that arose. A member of the research team obtained informed written or oral consent from all study participants. With the permission of the participants, interviews were digitally recorded. The data collectors transcribed and translated the interviews. Detailed field notes were taken by the data collectors and their supervisors to contextualize and supplement the interview data.\n\n【15】Data analysis {#Sec5}\n-------------\n\n【16】Following detailed readings of the transcripts, a code guide was developed for analysis of all the qualitative baseline data, and continually refined to allow for emergent themes. Data analysis was undertaken by members of the research team, using Atlas.ti software. After summarizing descriptive findings according to the coding categories, major themes and findings from the midwives' transcripts were identified and discussed by the research team. This inductive approach to analysis facilitated new insights into the data, such as the highly significant and focal aspect of midwife-HEW interaction and engagement surrounding the provision of ANC services (reported in this article).\n\n【17】We adopt a simple health systems analysis framing construct to present the results of the analysis (context -- inputs -- process -- outputs) \\[[@CR28]\\]. First, highlighting context, we begin with midwives' descriptions of their and HEWs' extant roles across the three stages of ANC promotion and delivery: health promotion, community outreach and ANC visits. Then, turning to midwife-HEW interactions, we present midwives' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses related to the inputs, processes and outputs of ANC delivery.\n\n【18】Ethical clearance was obtained from the authors' respective institutes: Jimma University College of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board, and University of Ottawa Health Sciences and Science Research Ethics Board.\n\n【19】Results {#Sec6}\n=======\n\n【20】Context: roles in ANC service promotion and delivery {#Sec7}\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Although midwives take on a supervisory role when working with the HEWs, the HEWs take a leadership role in their local catchment areas. During the first stage of health promotion, HEWs and midwives work collaboratively to plan educational conferences for pregnant women, and counsel women and their husbands. These conferences are intended to take place twice per month at the kebele level, although midwives acknowledge that they may occur less frequently. According to a midwife from Gomma district,\"\"They \\[HEWs\\] make the participants ready for us and \\[we come\\] there and awareness creation is conducted.\"\"\n\n【22】Both midwives and HEWs appear to be involved in promoting ANC services, and health facility deliveries. The health promotive role of HEWs appears to be especially prominent early in a women's pregnancy when they promote the timely use of ANC services. A midwife from Kersa acknowledges that efforts to generate community participation yield higher use of MNCH services:\"\"Those \\[midwives and health workers\\] who have highly participated in the community 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[will see\\]</u> client flow increase from day to day, and the confidence of the community will increase, for example \\[evidenced by higher use of\\] ANC, long term family planning, abortion care and child immunization.\"\"In the second stage of community outreach, HEWs reportedly have a leadership role in identifying pregnant women in the community (often in conjunction with members of the Women Development Army), and report this list to the midwives on a monthly basis. HEWs are also responsible for following up with the women, and appropriately referring them to a midwife at the health centre for first and fourth ANC visits, or as necessary to address complications.\n\n【23】In the third stage, ANC visits, HEWs and midwives have distinct and complementary responsibilities in delivering care at different points of the pregnancy. Women are advised to attend a total of four ANC appointments over the course of their pregnancy: midwives administer the first and fourth ANC visits, while HEWs provide the second and third (in the case of a pregnancy with no apparent complications). During the provision of ANC services and up to the time of delivery, however, the overlapping roles of the midwives and HEWs becomes more evident, as one midwife from Gomma district explains:\"\"After the fourth ANC checkup we \\[midwives and HEWs\\] prepare them \\[pregnant women\\] for delivery and during delivery there is ambulance service. They call to the Health Extension Workers for ambulance service and if their \\[the HEW's\\] phone is not functioning, they can either call me, or the health center director.\"\"\n\n【24】Inputs: resources {#Sec8}\n-----------------\n\n【25】Midwives identified resource scarcity as a challenge that negatively impacted their interactions with HEWs. In many cases, midwives spoke about barriers related to a lack of human, material, and financial resources, as well as inadequate training or general capacity. They explained that service demands on midwives could create a communication gap between themselves and the HEWs, as a midwife from Seka Chekorsa district noted:\"\"My working linkage with the kebele HEWs is too small because I am very busy here at the health centre and there is a gap between me and them.\"\"\n\n【26】Most of the midwives also reported that a shortage in material resources hindered their ability to adequately perform their role in ANC service delivery, such as running out of ANC cards at the PHCU, which are used to track the services that the women receive. Relatedly, some midwives mentioned that HEWs did not always track the ANC services that they delivered at the heath post, or that HEWs did not always report these activities to the midwives. This made it difficult for midwives to understand the needs of the pregnant women, and appropriately refer women to other health facilities. A midwife from Seka Chekorsa district explains:\"\"HEWs have basic data about the ANC \\[visit\\], but there is a problem of reporting by them. The problem is that HEWs are not always available at the health post. \\[So\\] we lack good combination on referral issues . because there is a problem of reporting on a continuous basis.\"\"As a way to strengthen the linkages with HEWs, many of the midwives emphasized the need to improve the material and human resources at the health facilities. According to the participants, increased resource availability would also help to improve the quality of care that midwives could provide, ameliorating women's dissatisfaction with ANC services (reported elsewhere \\[[@CR29]\\]). This, in turn would strengthen HEW's confidence in referring pregnant women from the health post to the PHCU, and make it more worthwhile for women to travel to the health centre for at least two of their four recommended ANC visits.\n\n【27】Similarly, a few midwives stated that receiving basic emergency obstetric and newborn care training in addition to other related training would be beneficial in supplementing the current referral process, and increasing their confidence in service delivery. A midwife from Gomma district explains:\"\"It would be better if training was available regularly. Health issues are dynamic, so it is better if when a new thing about health is identified, it \\[training\\] reaches health professionals on time, so the way they address the \\[health\\] problem \\[would be\\] improved.\"\"\n\n【28】Process: engagement and communication {#Sec9}\n-------------------------------------\n\n【29】Midwives reported meeting with HEWs on a monthly basis when HEWs visit the PHCU for training programs or to collect supplies for the health post. These visits provide an opportunity for midwives and HEWs to discuss women who are not attending ANC services. A midwife from Gomma district explains:\"\" . when there are dropouts they \\[HEWs\\] look for them \\[the women\\] and communicate their findings with us.\"\"Some midwives reported that they, together with HEWs, develop systems to minimize the number of women dropping out from ANC service delivery. A midwife from Gomma district explains the process that she used:\"\"We have list of pregnant women, \\[prepared\\] with the help of HEWs\\. If the woman does not come back to the health center, we identify where she went, with the help of the HEWs. And if the women did not yet give birth, we encourage her to continue ANC visits until delivery . So, we communicate with HEWs to trace those women who have dropped out from the visit.\"\"In addition to face-to-face meetings or interactions during ANC promotion at the health post level, midwives described modes of communicating with HEWs, including supervisory visits to the health posts. As one midwife from Gomma district describes:\"\"There is a linkage: the HEWs invite midwives \\[to the health post\\] every two weeks. We go there having developed a checklist and then we identified \\[any\\] problems. After we identified the problem by using checklist, we identify the good things they've done well and the gaps. We give them feedback.\"\"This midwife provides examples of other ways that they communicate with HEWs. In cases where they are unable to personally visit the health post, midwives communicate by phone, or through another PHCU health worker assigned to visit the kebele (since midwives themselves rotate across about five health posts).\n\n【30】Alongside these positive aspects of communication, however, midwives frequently reported a fundamental misunderstanding in the roles and responsibilities regarding activities that overlap with HEWs -- reflecting a potential deficit in training and job preparation, or a breakdown of communication. As a result, midwives felt that HEWs did not always assist them in duties that are expected to be collaborative efforts. A midwife from Seka Chekorsa commented that this misunderstanding could be due to the HEW's lack of experience or capacity. When probed further, the midwife responded:\"\"They believed that the \\[ANC\\] services is only for midwifery workers \\[to do\\], therefore some of them never want to assist us.\"\"\n\n【31】Outputs: collaborative efforts to increase ANC demand, use and quality {#Sec10}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Many midwives observed that working with HEWs to raise awareness about ANC greatly increased demand for all four recommended ANC visits. A midwife from Gomma district commented:\"\"Now since conferences \\[with pregnant women\\] are continuously held and awareness is created and they \\[pregnant women\\] are given \\[maternal health\\] services free of payment . there is a \\[greater\\] load on ANC service.\"\"\n\n【33】Because HEWs work in the community and have frequent contact with the women in this setting, they are more likely to encounter undetected pregnancy-related complications that they can then report to the midwives. This frontline interaction is a key strategy for the early detection and prevention of adverse health consequences. A midwife from Gomma district explains how HEWs can facilitate access to higher levels of the health system using ambulance services:\"\"After the ambulance services began, we have standby ambulance at our health center. When they \\[HEWs\\] call the ambulance, it can go up to the health centre with the professional who is managing the issue and pick them and bring \\[the woman\\] to the health center.\"\"\n\n【34】Several midwives acknowledged well-known barriers to ANC service use, such as distance and lack of transportation. A midwife from Gomma district recognized that working together with HEWs helps women overcome these barriers:\"\"We found a solution for this as \\[pregnant women\\] attend the first ANC \\[at the PHCU then\\], we allow her to attend the other ANC \\[visits\\] with the Health Extension Worker \\[at the nearby health post\\].\"\"\n\n【35】Furthermore, some midwives believe that further collaboration between HEWs can strengthen the quality of care that midwives are able to provide. A midwife from Gomma district says:\"\"We have a plan in strengthening the linkage with Health Extension Workers for the future.\"\"\n\n【36】Discussion {#Sec11}\n==========\n\n【37】In this study, we explored midwives' perceptions of ANC provision, including the interaction between two pivotal actors, namely midwives and HEWs. Our findings underscore the complementary and, at times overlapping, roles of midwives and HEWs across aspects of ANC promotion and delivery. While midwives acknowledged many positive aspects of this working relationship, the results also highlight the problematic impact of resource deficits, poor communication channels, and other situational barriers. Addressing these factors stands to benefit the collaborative potential of midwives and HEWs, and thereby enhance the reach, quality and effectiveness of ANC services.\n\n【38】A significant challenge identified by the midwives is the human resources for health shortage, often causing worker burnout and inadequate performance. Although the health worker density in Ethiopia has increased from 0.84 to 1.3 per 1000 population between 2008 and 2013, the doctor, health officer, nurse and midwife to population ratio is only 0.7 per 1000 population -- far behind the recommended 2.3 per 1000 required to ensure high coverage \\[[@CR3]\\]. Although some efforts are in place by the Ethiopian government to increase the quantity of higher level health workers to meet the country's demand -- and indeed the early success in scaling up of HEWs has paved the way for more costly initiatives, such as scaling up midwives \\[[@CR13], [@CR30]\\] -- the capacity and readiness of higher education institutions to assure quality education has not developed proportionally to its growth in numbers \\[[@CR3]\\]. Many women in Ethiopia still give birth in the home, attended by non-skilled personnel such as traditional birth attendants, family members or neighbours \\[[@CR9]\\].\n\n【39】Enhancing the effectiveness of supervisory activities offers another possible way to improve worker performance in the short term, while serving as a mechanism for professional development, improving health workers' job satisfaction, and increasing motivation \\[[@CR31], [@CR32]\\]. When delivered in a manner that reinforces trust and mutual respect, supportive supervision contributes to establishing leadership for improved ANC delivery \\[[@CR10]\\]. The main challenges with supervision, also evident in the results of this paper, include improving the quality of supervision and increasing the time supervisors spend with health workers. To the extent that midwives see themselves, and are seen by others, as offering supervision to HEWs, it is important to assess whether they have the sufficient skills, tools, training, and transportation to provide such supervision, and are not over-burdened with other responsibilities.\n\n【40】Also evident from our findings is the perception of midwives as being responsible for managing ANC activities such as the educational pregnant women conferences. Although HEWs are recognized as leaders in their local kebeles and have a leadership role with regards to the activities of the Women Development Army, midwives perceive themselves to be leaders among the HEWs. This hierarchy could prompt a competitive rather than collaborative relationship when both are working together at the health post level. Previous studies have also raised the hierarchical nature of health workers relationships, and the reluctance of lower-ranked health workers to question authority \\[[@CR33]\\].\n\n【41】The different approaches to recruiting and training midwives and HEWs position them differently with regards to the communities that they serve. While HEWs are recruited from the community and assumed to be de facto representatives, midwives are university trained and may be deployed throughout the country. In providing ANC, our findings confirm that HEWs (and, more locally, members of the Women Development Army) generally have a larger role in community outreach than do midwives, and that they are seen as trusted sources of health information \\[[@CR34]\\]. Though HEWs receive a salary, albeit modest, they are assumed to be working in the interest of their communities, whereas it is less apparent how the community views the motivation behind midwives' engagement -- a factor that may influence community members' willingness to visit midwives for and comply with their advice and recommendations.\n\n【42】A more comprehensive and focused strategy to address the challenges that midwives face as they work together with HEWs to provide ANC is needed, as the role of both actors in improving service utilization among pregnant women are interdependent. Midwives in this study identified some shortcomings in how HEWs delivered on their role with regards to ANC service provision, though nevertheless saw the importance of strengthening this collaboration as the way forward in improved MNCH. Given that there are no national guidelines for ANC in Ethiopia, \\[[@CR10]\\] the lack of formal clarifications surrounding the roles and responsibilities of midwives and HEWs may contribute to miscommunications between the two groups of professionals. In Ethiopia, midwives generally report low job satisfaction, though positive interpersonal relationships with coworkers is a determinant of higher satisfaction \\[[@CR14], [@CR35]\\]. In the rural setting where this study was conducted, the benefits from enhancing the collaborative potential of midwives and HEWs serves as an important aspect of further inquiry in strengthening ANC services and MNCH more generally.\n\n【43】This study has illustrated the direct and indirect implications of broad health system deficits (e.g. resource scarcity, poor infrastructure and inadequate training) on one aspect of MNCH care provision. To address these cross-cutting factors, engagement from high-level political leaders across health and non-health sectors is warranted. Engaging with political leaders has shown to incur promising outcomes with the scale up of education and training programs for health workers \\[[@CR36]\\]; and should continue going forward. The Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030, for example, identified political engagement and financial investment as critical factors in building capacity among health workers in settings such as rural Ethiopia \\[[@CR37]\\]. In line with the 2001 Abuja Declaration call for increasing spending on health, Ethiopia has increased its prioritized spending on health over time, yet remains below the specified targets \\[[@CR38]\\]. Although the Ethiopian government has prioritized health, more attention is needed towards key areas of concern as identified by the World Health Organization, which include: funding inconsistency, budget underspends, and misallocation of resources \\[[@CR39]\\].\n\n【44】Study strengths and limitations {#Sec12}\n-------------------------------\n\n【45】This research explored the perspectives of midwives using semi-structured in depth interviews, which allowed for data collectors to ask open-ended questions and further probe to receive rich insight on their topics of inquiry. Collaborating with local researchers to collect data helped to lessen some level of social desirability bias, which has been raised as a potential concern in qualitative health research \\[[@CR40]\\]. Strategies to minimize social desirability bias were discussed and implemented by the researchers at various stages of the fieldwork. Some of these included modified questioning techniques, and building rapport with interviewees.\n\n【46】Some potential limitations to this research include those that are challenging to fully control in several types of qualitative research. First, transcription errors such as accidental and/or unavoidable alterations of data may have occurred \\[[@CR41]\\]. Moreover, differences in fluency of the English language led to some interpretative problems during data analysis. These issues were generally mitigated by cross-referencing with data collectors and other researchers who were on the field during data collection to clarify linguistic challenges that had surfaced throughout. We acknowledge that data analysis is subject to individual interpretive processes, which are shaped by their unique experiences and perspectives. Researchers remained reflexive throughout the analysis process, and engaged in discussions with local MNCH experts, data collectors and other members of the research team in interpreting the findings.\n\n【47】Conclusion {#Sec13}\n==========\n\n【48】The expansion of health services into rural Ethiopia over the past decades demonstrates a commitment to improving MNCH outcomes. There remains a need for more financial, material, and human resources and their strategic deployment to reduce challenges that health workers face in providing ANC and aspects of MNCH care. Influential stakeholders such as the Ethiopian government, and various non-governmental organizations have a role to play in resolving these barriers and establishing more favourable conditions for midwives and HEWs to enhance their collaborations. This may include, for example, integrated trainings to advance key skills and competencies required in their roles, and strategizing on how to improve their collaborative efforts via more regular forms of communicative exchange. Moving forward, we call attention to the need to expand upon this research to further explore the interaction and collaboration between health workers in rural Ethiopia and better understand how they prioritize tasks and overcome barriers in their work.\n\n【49】Supplementary information\n=========================\n\n【50】 {#Sec14}\n\n【51】通用删除12(英):<u>Additional file 1: Table S1.

The fact that menthol was not included in the original list of banned flavours concerned many in the public health arena who argued that menthol is used by the tobacco industry to attract young, inexperienced smokers and/or African--Americans.[@b3] In addition to youth appeal, the addition of 'medicinal menthol' to cigarettes may also appeal to established health-concerned smokers who might otherwise quit.[@b4]\n\n【2】Others have investigated the internal tobacco industry documents for different but related questions on how tobacco companies manipulate menthol content in cigarettes to target young people[@b5] and consumer perceptions of the sensory characteristics of menthol.[@b6] This paper analyses internal tobacco industry documents to determine if tobacco companies marketed mentholated cigarettes as public health advocates allege, and how the tobacco industry managed consumer perceptions of menthol through marketing strategies. This knowledge can help inform the regulatory decisions by the US FDA and comparable agencies elsewhere in the world, and can augment public health\\'s understanding of why the tobacco industry opposed menthol\\'s inclusion in the list of banned flavouring additives.\n\n【3】Academics and government scientists independent of the tobacco industry have shown that the tobacco industry targets various population groups, including specific racial and ethnic populations, with marketing and advertising generally[@b7] and for mentholated products specifically.[@b8] A 2006 case study[@b9] of Kool, Brown & Williamson\\'s best selling mentholated brand, described the company\\'s use of music events to promote the brand to young, particularly African--American, people. Independent research has shown explicit and implicit health messages in advertisements for menthol cigarettes.[@b10] [@b11] Some health messages are explicit, for example, in a 1942 advertisement asking 'Throat sore? Time to give it a rest!' and directing the reader to 'Change to Spuds. Enjoy their soothing coolness!' (the Spud brand was the first in the US to advertise that it was mentholated). It is nevertheless important to examine the intentions behind the creation of such marketing communications in the words of tobacco company insiders themselves, particularly if marketing shifted from communicating this type of explicit health message to messages that continue to communicate health benefits, but less explicitly.[@b10] [@b11] The current study begins with historical examples and moves forward in time, but is not a strictly chronological treatment of the topic. The results are presented in three overall sections: marketing messages for menthol cigarettes, then consumer perceptions of those messages, and specific populations targeted by such messages.\n\n【4】A decline in per capita cigarette consumption in the US in 1953--1954 resulting from the 'health scare' marked the beginning of changes in health-related messages in cigarette marketing materials.[@b12] A decade later, after the 1964 US Surgeon General\\'s Report 'Smoking and Health'[@b13] and the 1965 Cigarette Act,[@b14] US tobacco marketers continued to be faced with the challenge of marketing a product identified as harmful by health authorities while distracting consumers from those known harms. These challenges necessitated a move away from explicit health messages and towards other messages that would appeal to different groups of potential consumers of 'low-tar' or 'light' tobacco products. Research has elucidated many of these alternative marketing messages for 'low-tar' and 'light' cigarettes,[@b4] [@b15] and has demonstrated that consumers tend to perceive 'low-tar' and 'light' cigarettes to be less harmful than 'regular' cigarettes.[@b16; @b17; @b18; @b19; @b20] less is understood about messages for menthol cigarettes or about how consumers perceive menthol. A 2010 scholarly commentary stated that the 'industry has used menthol\\'s association with cold remedies to infer that smoking menthol cigarettes has some medicinal or health benefit for more than 70 years'.[@b21] Internal documents can shed light on whether consumers have accepted this inference of health benefits.\n\n【5】This paper addresses the following questions on marketing for and consumer perceptions of menthol cigarettes:Are/were menthol cigarettes marketed with health reassurance messages?What other messages come from menthol cigarette advertising?How do smokers tend to view menthol cigarettes?Were menthol cigarettes marketed to specific populations?\n\n【6】Methods\n=======\n\n【7】A complete discussion of the general tobacco documents research methods employed in this study is found elsewhere in this issue.[@b22] Details specific to the current study are as follows: in this qualitative research study of the digitised repository of previously internal tobacco industry documents, a snowball sampling design[@b23] was used to search the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library (LTDL) 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu>)</u>. The LTDL was systematically searched between 28 February and 27 April 2010, using standard documents research techniques. These techniques combine traditional qualitative methods[@b24] with iterative search strategies tailored for the LTDL data set.[@b25]\n\n【8】Initial keyword searches combined terms related to: menthol, health/healthy/healthier, cool/cooling/cooler, market/markets/marketing, consumer perception, focus group, creative, advertisement copy, communication, market research, report, topline and target group. This initial set of keywords resulted in the development of further search terms and combinations of keywords (eg, menthol cigarette brand names, project names, individuals and companies named in correspondences and on research reports, and specific target groups). For each set of results, the first 50--300 documents were reviewed. If documents did not appear to be relevant to the research questions, or if there was a repetitive pattern of documents, the review moved on to the next search term. Among the reports, correspondence and studies conducted by product development and research departments of the major tobacco companies (American Tobacco (AT), British American Tobacco (BAT), Brown & Williamson (B&W), Lorillard, Philip Morris (PM) and RJ Reynolds (RJR)), relevant documents were found in the following subject areas: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> marketing menthol using health assurance messages; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> user-imagery focused marketing; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> consumer perceptions of menthol products; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> targeting specific populations. A final collection of 953 documents, created between the 1930s to the first decade of the 21st century, relevant to 1 or more of the research questions were qualitatively analysed. Memos were written to summarise the relevant documents to further narrow down to the 60 representative documents that are cited in this paper.\n\n【9】Results\n=======\n\n【10】Health reassurance messages in menthol advertising\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Menthol cigarettes were marketed using health reassurance messages suggesting that menthol cigarettes were safer than 'full flavour' or non-menthol cigarettes. The first mentholated cigarette is credited to a young man, Lloyd 'Spud' Hughes, a chronic cold sufferer, when in the 1920s his mother prescribed a treatment of menthol crystals that he surreptitiously added to his smoking tobacco tin.[@b26] [@b27] Bearing Hughes\\'s nickname, Spud cigarettes became the first commercial menthol brand to be marketed in the US; B&W followed with Kool Menthol in 1933. Initially Kool Menthol, and menthol in general, was advertised as being 'for occasional use' in order to 'rest your throat'[@b28] rather than a regular, daily-use product.\n\n【12】Menthol cigarettes were first popularised as a remedy to the burn, dryness and throat irritation that accompany smoking (通用删除8(英):<u>[figure 1]</u>(#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). B&W and Lorillard marketed menthols with health-reassuring slogans such as 'Breathe easy, smoke clean', 'When your throat tells you it\\'s time for a change.'[@b29] and 'The beneficial head-clearing qualities of menthol'.[@b30] Similar claims made were that menthol brands act as a 'remedy or treatment for coughs' and counteract 'throat irritations due to heavy smoking'.[@b31]\n\n【13】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Spuds brand and Kool brand cigarettes, the earliest two brands to be marketed specifically as mentholated brands in the US, were presented in the 1920s and 1930s as brands that provide relief from the throat pain and irritation caused by smoking 通用删除1(英):<u>(images retrieved from <http://lane.stanford.edu/tobacco/index.html>)</u>.]</u>(tobaccocontrol41939fig1){#fig1}\n\n【14】Tobacco company executives sought to emphasise health messages in the marketing of menthol products relative to non-menthol products from the beginning. The advertising firm Cunningham & Walsh compiled a report for B&W in 1980 in which they observed that Kool\\'s '(r)emedial specialty brand image' in the early 1950s 'benefits (the b)rand as smokers perceive menthol as less harmful'.[@b32] In a 1960s brand evaluation, B&W noted that '(e)mphasis on the throat, with its important health implications, has. been an important part of Kool advertising since 1960'.[@b33] According to a 30 May 1973 Lorillard meeting agenda to discuss 'Kent Menthol 100′s', the objective of a menthol line extension of Lorillard\\'s 'low tar' Kent brand was to 'convince smokers of competitive menthols (as well as smokers contemplating entering the category) that Kent menthol is the menthol that offers refreshing menthol smoking satisfaction and health reassurance'.[@b34] B&W declared that 'KOOL must move into the health reassurance segment so that 45% of KOOL business will be in the perceived product safety arena by 1982'.[@b35]\n\n【15】Other messages in menthol cigarette advertising\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】The 1950s marked the beginning of significant public awareness in the US of the health hazards of smoking.[@b36] With the introduction of RJR\\'s Salem brand in 1956, the ostensible 'health' benefit of menthol was overtaken by the 'taste' benefit of menthol, and menthol as a cigarette style moved from the occasional into the regular use arena.[@b37] The importance of this shift was neatly explained in a 1982 B&W market presentation:\n\n【17】> Salem created a whole new meaning for menthol. From the heritage of solves-the-negative-problem-of-smoking, menthol almost instantly became a positive smoking sensation. Menthol in the filter form in the Salem advertising was a 'refreshing' taste experience. It can be viewed as very 'reassuring' in a personal concern climate. Undoubtedly, the medicinal menthol connotation carried forward in a therapeutic fashion, but as a positive taste benefit.[@b37] (Emphasis added.)\n\n【18】The Newport brand\\'s entry into the market in 1957 with the advertising slogan 'Rich taste---with a touch of refreshing mint' made menthol 'now a positive experience, not just a solver of smoking 'problems''.[@b37] Being aware that menthol also carried health connotations, tobacco companies were freed up to market menthol cigarettes as a thing of pleasure and personal preference while still providing health reassurances to menthol smokers.\n\n【19】### Refreshing, fresh, cool and clean\n\n【20】Avoiding overt health messages by the late 1950s, Kool advanced new advertising copy such as, 'What a wonderful difference when you switch to snow fresh KOOLs. Your mouth feels clean and cool, your throat feels soothed and fresh. Enjoy the most refreshing experience smoking'.[@b38] By the 1960s Kool advertising employed implicit health-related messages in print advertisements for college, military, and 'Negro' publications, such as 'Only KOOL gives you real menthol magic' or 'Come all the way up to KOOL Filter Kings for the most refreshing coolness you can get in a cigarette',[@b38] capitalising on the perception of cooling as healthier.\n\n【21】Smokers describe menthol\\'s 'cooling' or 'refreshing' effects variably as a taste or flavour on the one hand, or a sensation or impact on the other hand. A 1988 Philip Morris (PM) study of the menthol market noted that 'menthol\\'s appeal primarily focused on the unique feeling or sensation it provides', and that 'menthol taste (is) more difficult to describe than menthol sensation'.[@b39] Menthol cigarette marketers were quick to exploit the perception of menthol as a sensation in addition to a taste. Major objectives for the Kool brand family from 1979 to 1985 included the necessity 'to enhance the perception of the two major menthol buying motivations---satisfaction and refreshment'.[@b35] ADI Research, Inc. advised B&W similarly in a 1984 cigarette smokers study that 'frequently mentioned positive characteristics of Kool Filter Kings were refreshingness, coolness, smell, sensation, and smoothness'[@b40] That year, Cunningham and Walsh advised B&W to forge Kool\\'s popularity worldwide by positioning the brand as 'something enjoyable from US, most refreshing taste sensation'.[@b41] 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 2]</u>(#fig2){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows some examples of 'refreshing' and 'cool' messages.\n\n【22】!通用删除8(英):<u>[Triggered by the health scare of the 1950s and increasing after the 1964 US Surgeon General\\'s Report, advertisements for menthol brands emphasised general refreshment and coolness rather than the explicit health messages of earlier decades. Menthol nevertheless continued to carry the medicinal and health connotations of previous decades 通用删除1(英):<u>(images from the 1980s, retrieved from <http://www.tobacco.org/ads>)</u>.]</u>(tobaccocontrol41939fig2){#fig2}\n\n【23】Although there was shift away from overt health messages towards less tangible 'refreshment' and similar messages in menthol marketing triggered by the health scare of the 1950s, tobacco companies still wished to maintain health associations with menthol. According to a B&W brand planning document in 1978 (estimated date), a prime Kool objective for 1979--1985 was also to '(p)rovide product safety reassurance while enhanc(ing) the satisfaction and refreshment perception of the appropriate KOOL styles, through the successful, national launch in 1979 of either: 1. Low-'tar' parent (or) 2. Repositioned KOOL Milds'.[@b35]\n\n【24】### Identity and in-group belonging\n\n【25】Menthol is commonly thought of as an African--American cigarette style in the US market, and to an extent, evidence from industry documents supports this perception. However, tobacco companies do not intend for menthol to be only or even mostly an African--American style, but rather a cigarette style associated with group identity for various subgroups in the market, including, but not exclusively, African--American identity.\n\n【26】Some industry analysts, such as Diane Burrows of the RJR Marketing Development Department (a competitor of B&W), observed a change in the cigarette market, particularly in the menthol market, in the 1960s. In her 1984 analysis of RJR\\'s Salem, Lorillard\\'s Newport and B&W\\'s Kool, Burrows stated:\n\n【27】> Younger adult Blacks of the 1930s to 1950s had basically gone with whatever brand was big among younger adult White smokers. In the 1960s, they began to coalesce behind Kool, which only had a 2% share among younger adult Whites. It was time for Blacks to build their own brand in the 1960s, the heyday of Martin Luther King and 'Black pride'.[@b42]\n\n【28】The strategy for exploiting this phenomenon was simple:\n\n【29】> Kool apparently capitalized on this aspect of the 1960s by simply advertising to Blacks before its competitors did. Kool ads were in Ebony consistently from at least 1962, when our records start. Kool became 'cool' and, by the early 1970s, had a 56% share among younger adult Blacks---it was the Black Marlboro.[@b42]\n\n【30】Without referencing Dr King or 'black pride' specifically, B&W stated in a 1966 marketing analysis company presentation that the brands 'perform very well in ethnic markets because for some time we have been tailoring our advertising to fit local markets'.[@b43] Further, in a 1969 marketing report, B&W stated that Kool 'continues to direct advertising towards specific ethnic groups with special emphasis on the Negro market'.[@b44]\n\n【31】In 1979, B&W explicitly planned to '(e)nhance the social acceptance of the entire KOOL line through all creative efforts so that the product is equally acceptable to White smokers-as to Black smokers. This will be realized through smoker image creative management as well as specific media targeting'.[@b35] By 1983, M. A. Schreiber, Kool\\'s Senior Brand Manager for B&W, wrote:\n\n【32】> In January, 1982, KOOL launched its current campaign. Pan-racial music imagery was established as KOOL\\'s strategic property. (A)n advertising exploratory was started to .specifically address how to communicate. (a)n attractive, contemporary image to young adult Whites.[@b45]\n\n【33】An urban image, which appealed to young people of many ethnicities, continued to be important to menthol marketing through the 1990s. Advertising agency Leo Burnett reported to PM in December 1995 that among 'urban dwellers, ages LA-24 (legal age to age 24), African--American and Caucasian, menthol loyalists. (u)rban terminology transcends beyond the African--American community'.[@b46] The agency tested marketing creatives (mock-up advertisements for participant feedback), including '(m)enthol approaches tied to identified urban smoker insights' with the theme 'Diversity/Community'.[@b46] One specific creative in the 'Diversity/Community' theme titled 'Huze Art' was observed by the agency to be '(b)y far the strongest of the approaches, its appeal was driven by the sense of urban multi-culturality expressed through art'.[@b46] The appeal of this execution was explained as follows:Urban lifestyle crosses ethnic boundaries.Urban lifestyle appeals outside of urban boundaries.[@b46]\n\n【34】To attach a menthol brand to in-group identity, Kapuler Marketing Research, Inc. conducted a study of a new campaign for Kool targeting ethnic Hawaiians in 1988 for B&W, titled 'Kool and Mild Today'. The agency concluded '(t)he use of ethnic models is seen as something new and respondents are generally positive about this concept. It could provide an opportunity for KOOL to capitalize on being the first to employ ethnic advertising in Hawaii'.[@b47] The agency noted the models should not look too Japanese but rather should appear to be ethnic Hawaiian Islanders. Preferred models were described as 'fun, happy-go-lucky young people in their 20 s. They have full social calendars and spend a lot of time outdoors at the beach. people who display what islanders call the aloha spirit'.[@b47]\n\n【35】### Fun loving, sociable and youthful\n\n【36】RJR noted in 1981 that the 'Coolness Segment' (RJR\\'s term for the menthol market, describing the cooling properties of menthol) is the youngest of all cigarette market segments.[@b48] RJR stated in 1981 that '(a)dvertising must convince younger adult smokers that SALEM is smoked by natural, unpretentious but interesting people who are social leaders/catalysts (make things happen) whose sense of humor and wit makes them fun and exciting to be with'.[@b49]\n\n【37】Youthfulness and sociability are not images restricted to menthol users. Social interaction is thought by tobacco marketers to be important to young adults and adolescents in general. RJR observed in 1981 that:\n\n【38】> (s)moking is frequently used in situations when people are trying to make friends, to look more mature, to look more attractive, to look 'cooler', and to feel more comfortable around others. These aspects of social interaction are especially prevalent among younger adult smokers. The benefit of smoking which has most frequently and most successfully been exploited by brand families appears to be Social Interaction. For example, some brands, such as Newport, have focused on the younger adult 'peer group' aspect of social interaction.[@b50]\n\n【39】These user images carry particular weight within the menthol market. Speaking specifically about target users of a new Salem Lights 100 mm product, RJR asserted in 1982 that 'user imagery reflects aspirations of the Personal Experience segment identified by Yankelovich (Inc. a consumer research company). The lifestyle of the Personal Experience segment is defined as seeking direct experience and excitement. social interaction is a key element to personal fulfillment'.[@b51] The emphasis on sociability, fun and enjoyment is particularly evident in Lorillard\\'s long-running Newport 'Alive with Pleasure' campaign.[@b52] These messages of sociability, fun and enjoyment proved so popular with young audiences that RJR created their 'Salem Spirit' campaign to communicate the values 'sociable' and 'have a good time',[@b53] though they noted problems with consumers confusing the campaign with Lorillard\\'s similar Newport campaigns. PM observed in 1995 that Newport\\'s '(c)onsistent theme ('Alive with Pleasure') and strategy ('Friends having fun') have given Newport a clear identity in smokers minds', that Newport was '(t)he only brand to capitalized on important 'sociability' aspect of category'.[@b54] 通用删除8(英):<u>[Figure 3]</u>(#fig3){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows a 'Newport Pleasure' campaign advertisement that communicates sociability and in-group belonging. It is perhaps menthol\\'s younger profile relative to non-menthol that makes youthfulness and sociability particularly important to many menthol smokers.\n\n【40】!通用删除8(英):<u>[This 2003 Newport advertisement communicates fun-loving youthfulness and sociability, as well as in-group belonging (African--Americans in an urban bar scene). The 'Alive with Pleasure' slogan of the 1990s is here replaced with simply 'Pleasure', further removing the campaign explicit health claims while continuing in the theme of the previous campaign that includes the health-suggestive word 'Alive' 通用删除1(英):<u>(image retrieved from <http://www.trinketsandtrash.org>)</u>.]</u>(tobaccocontrol41939fig3){#fig3}\n\n【41】Consumer perceptions of menthol marketing messages\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】Menthol smokers view menthol cigarettes as safer or less harmful than 'full flavour' or non-menthol cigarettes. Menthol smokers sometimes identified safety perceptions explicitly, but sometimes implicitly with terms such as 'mild', 'light', 'cooling', or 'soothing'; terms that suggest relative safety or health benefits. Terms that imply health messages, including 'light' and 'mild', have been determined to be deceptive in federal Judge Gladys Kessler\\'s ruling that the US cigarette manufacturers violated the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)[@b55] as well as by Congress in the FSPTCA.\n\n【43】A focus group study conducted for American Tobacco in 1969 tested, in part, perceptions of a new menthol product. It was observed that:\n\n【44】> Menthol smokers indicated that they smoked menthol cigarettes because they were 'mild', 'cooling', 'refreshing', and 'soothing to the throat'. There were indications that the menthol smokers subconsciously perceived menthol cigarettes as being healthier. There was somewhat of a 'health image' associated with menthol, related to its masking of the tobacco taste, and its association with medicine, colds, and sore throats.[@b56] (Emphasis added.)\n\n【45】In 1976, B&W noted that 'evidence indicates that a pseudo-health image has accrued to mentholated cigarettes'.[@b57] Then, 2 years later, B&W explicitly acknowledged its Kool franchise '(r)ides on the connotation that menthol has health overtones',[@b58] and that the Kool Super Lights line extension\\'s 'menthol and tar delivery has synergistic therapeutic implications'.[@b58] Such perceptions are exemplified in the statement of a respondent in a marketing study for B&W in 1980, 'that menthol cigarettes are better for you'.[@b59]\n\n【46】In 1975 (estimated date), Lorillard recognised the perception of protection against throat irritation as a boon to the company:\n\n【47】> Overall, menthol smokers appear to be a prime target for a low-irritation story because they seem to be very conscious of irritation. It is highly identifiable by them, and they already view menthol cigarettes as the best route to diminish irritation. Therefore, they would not have to be 'sold' on the idea that a menthol cigarette and diminished irritation are compatible.[@b60]\n\n【48】As RJR stated in a 1977 analysis of the potential for share growth with 'high filtration' menthol products, '(t)he health concern was perhaps the primary motive for switching to menthol in the first place. In the hierarchy of product benefits/attributes desired by menthol filter smokers, throat concerns rank just behind generic taste and satisfaction'.[@b61]\n\n【49】Smokers perceive 'mild' cigarettes as healthier than regular (non-'light') cigarettes.[@b62; @b63; @b64; @b65] Menthol\\'s perception as a milder and therefore safer product as compared to 'regular' cigarettes has caused switching from non-menthol to menthol brands and styles. In a 1976 marketing plan for a 'low-tar' menthol cigarette, B&W asserted that 'Menthols and particularly Hi-Fi\\'s (high filtration cigarettes) have a net gain from brand switching'.[@b57] The Sherman Group Inc. conducted a reconnaissance study of Newport for RJR in 1976 and found among young people:\n\n【50】> (i)n rejecting the 'regular' cigarette taste, the smokers are referring back to their own experiences. These young smokers began smoking the 'popular' brands, Winston, Marlboro, Tareyton and Kents, etc, and moved to menthols for a variety of reasons or circumstances; the rejection of tobacco taste, the search for a 'milder' cigarette, personal influence, or the circumstances of having a cold and wanting to continue smoking, but being unable to 'handle' the hot taste of cigarettes in an already irritated throat.[@b66]\n\n【51】Lorillard observed in 1972 that '(b)rand-switching has resulted in a 13% gain for Menthols which is larger than the 8% for Hi Fi brands, the only types gaining from claimed switching'.[@b67]\n\n【52】Beliefs about the health benefits of mentholated cigarettes prevent some potential quitters from quitting in favour of switching to a mentholated brand or style. A William Esty Co. study for RJR in 1973 stated:\n\n【53】> Generally when a respondent reported that he made a conscious decision to switch to a mentholated brand it was because of some problem, minor or major. For instance, many switched to mentholated cigarettes because of throat irritation, colds, coughs or chronic bronchitis. Sometimes respondents saw smoking a mentholated brand as the only alternative to giving up smoking altogether.[@b68] (Emphasis added.)\n\n【54】The Roper Organization prepared a study for PM in 1979 on the attitudes of menthol smokers and that '(m)enthol smokers express slightly less desire to quit smoking than do non-menthol smokers---39% would like to quit, versus 43% of non-menthol smokers'.[@b69] Burrows\\' analysis of key market trends of the 1960s concluded the tendency to switch from non-menthol to menthol rather than quit was important for Kool\\'s rise in this decade:\n\n【55】> The key trend for Kool was the emerging importance of younger adult Black smokers in the market. In the health-concerned 1960s, younger adult Blacks didn\\'t back off from smoking to the extent that Whites did. Because of this, their importance surged from 6% of 18-year-old smokers in the 1950s, to 10% in the 1960s.[@b42]\n\n【56】Marketing menthol cigarettes to specific populations\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【57】### African--Americans\n\n【58】Advertisements for menthol cigarettes have been overrepresented in popular African--American magazines relative to non-African--American magazines[@b11] [@b70] [@b71] and in predominantly African--American urban neighborhoods.[@b72] RJR stated in an in-house presentation on the 'US cigarette market in the 1990s (that) 95% of black younger adult smokers now choose menthol, and Newport has a 73 (percent) share-of-smoker among this group'.[@b73]\n\n【59】As an assessment of the menthol market from PM in 1986 recognised, '(r)elative to all smokers, menthol smokers tend to be: women, young (mainly 25--34), Black, light smokers (\\<20 cigarettes a day), lower-income earners, pack buyers, (and) 100 mm smokers'.[@b74] PM had earlier seen, in 1968, that menthol 'was a product which by some virtue was especially suited to the needs, desires and tastes of Negro consumers', speculating that the 'great enthusiasm for menthol cigarettes. was based both on dynamic sensory and on psychological gratifications'.[@b75]\n\n【60】To exploit the 'potential opportunity sector' represented by black smokers, RJR produced a 'Black Opportunity Analysis' in 1985.[@b76] RJR noted, '(t)here are. gaps within Blacks. Several studies have suggested that Blacks are becoming [polarized]{.ul} into an 'elite' and an 'underclass'. It is the 'underclass' who are smokers\\'.[@b76] Acknowledging the disadvantages of underclass status, RJR concluded that, although health may be a concern, 'Blacks simply have more pressing concerns than smoking issues'.[@b76] The implication is that this market, with its myriad socioeconomic pressures, should remain reliable consumers even if they are aware of tobacco\\'s health risks.\n\n【61】Heavy targeting of largely African--American urban populations is reflected in corresponding menthol brands and styles accounting for the bulk of African--American urban smoking. A 1983 'Cigarette Attitude Study (Among low-income Black smokers)' for Newport revealed '(t)he use of menthol cigarettes among the 18--34 lower-income Black segment is almost universal. Nearly 9 out of 10 smokers currently smoke a menthol brand'.[@b77] Noting changes from data in 1979, the study observed that '(o)verall, black smokers have better recall of advertising for specific menthol brands than in 1979' and 'showed a lower frequency of purchasing secondary brands, and more longevity with regard to the length of time current brand was smoked'.[@b77] B&W found in 1993 that 'Blacks are three times as likely to smoke menthol and four times as likely to smoke full revenue menthol compared to non-Blacks'.[@b78]\n\n【62】### Other populations: young people, women and Asians\n\n【63】Although the preponderance of menthol usage among African--American smokers is widely known and important, most menthol cigarettes are smoked by non-black populations. B&W\\'s 1993 study found that although 72.3% of black smokers used menthol compared to 25.3% of non-black smokers, the total menthol market was 73.5% non-black and only 26.4% black.[@b78]\n\n【64】A 1983 study in the Lorillard collection on its Newport market found that:\n\n【65】> (t)he three leading menthol brands exhibit distinct user profiles. Newport smokers tend to be younger 通用删除7(英):<u>(18--21)</u>, single and less educated. (B&W\\'s) Kool is smoked more by men, those over 25 years of age and those with even slightly lower incomes. (RJR\\'s) Salem users are more often female, over age 25, more likely to be married, and more often employed. Younger smokers 通用删除7(英):<u>(18--24)</u> were most concerned with brand(s) smoked by family members and/or friends, and women were more frequently interested in a mild tasting product.[@b77]\n\n【66】Menthol styles are often lumped together by tobacco marketers in marketing language such as RJR\\'s 'Coolness Segment'. Consumers in this segment 'are the youngest, the most economically disadvantaged, and the most likely to be in minority and ethnic groups',[@b50] who 'tend, more than average, to desire their brand of cigarettes to symbolize personal qualities such as youth; modern womanhood; romance; career orientation; and success'.[@b50] Recognising the brand-specific image consciousness of the segment, RJR stated, 'brands in the Coolness Segment gain little or no imagery directly from the fact of their mentholation. Rather, they are able to develop a wide diversity of images'.[@b50]\n\n【67】The three largest standalone menthol brands, Kool, Newport and Salem, have different brand identities in the minds of the manufacturers and the consumers. RJR noted in 1977 that Salem was characterised by 'worried' smokers\\' and smokers who are 'passive, feminine'.[@b79] RJR appears to have embraced this image in 1981 particularly with its Salem Slim Lights line extension, positioning it for consumers 'who desire a refreshing, low-tar cigarette with (a) stylish, unpretentious, feminine image'.[@b48] Though the menthol segment 'skews female' (female consumers are overrepresented in the segment),[@b80; @b81; @b82] B&W\\'s Kool has a more masculine image than the other standalone brands. Lorillard noted in 1994 that 'Kool is viewed as a strong tasting, 'tough guy' cigarette'.[@b83]\n\n【68】Of the major menthol brands, Lorillard\\'s Newport was 'the brand with the youngest demographics in the industry' according to a 1992 Lorillard report.[@b84] Newport\\'s marketing strategy through much of the 1990s was to 'continue to improve Newport\\'s appeal as the 'peer' brand among younger adult smokers'.[@b85] [@b86] Part of the strategy was to 'develop an 'attack plan' to establish an offensive posture in the general market to more aggressively compete with Marlboro Menthol in select markets'.[@b87] 'General market', a term denoting the overall cigarette market, is contrasted here with 'urban center',[@b87] the term for young inner city African--Americans. This attack plan included marketing initiatives to 'continue to define 'Newport Pleasure' in a variety of different ways: social interactions, 'zany' fun, smoking situations, intimate moments, and refreshment'.[@b87]\n\n【69】Discussion\n==========\n\n【70】Menthol cigarettes were originally marketed on a health platform, and health messages convinced consumers that menthol cigarettes were healthier for them than non-menthol cigarettes. Descriptors and colouring of cigarette packs communicate health information to consumers with no actual mention of health.[@b88] Associations of menthol with health continue to this day, although health assurance marketing messages for menthol cigarettes have become more oblique.\n\n【71】There is not a single menthol user image across all mentholated products. The overrepresentation of African--Americans in the menthol cigarette market is widely discussed in the academic literature,[@b70] [@b72] [@b89; @b90; @b91] but in sheer numbers, more non-African--American smokers use menthol. It is important to examine if and how menthol products have been marketed to various other populations (eg, women, other ethnic/racial groups as well as African--Americans). Women and girls, as well as some ethnic/racial groups, are important potential consumers for the tobacco industry in the US and abroad in nations where smoking rates in these groups are currently low. Similar to Virginia Slims\\' targeting of women in the second wave of the feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s with a product superficially designed for them and an aggressive marketing campaign,[@b92] menthol products, particularly Kool and Newport, aggressively targeted young black populations with socially relevant messages of in-group identity.\n\n【72】Menthol is also targeted to young people and women in the US. Consistent with the current findings, research in 2010 showed that in addition to a higher prevalence of menthol use among African--American men and women, female smokers of all races used mentholated cigarettes at higher than male smokers.[@b93; @b94; @b95] The 'young female skew' of menthol is evident not only within the borders of the US, however; menthol is strongly represented among young women in Asian countries. Although different menthol brands present their own brand personalities (such as Kool being perceived largely as an African--American man\\'s cigarette in the US), menthol in general is perceived to be for women, younger people and lighter smokers. There is some international agreement on this latter point. That menthol skews female is particularly evident in studies of Asians, Pacific Islanders and Asian--Americans. In 1991, PM analysed the four Asian countries most important to PM Asia\\'s growth: Japan, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore, and noted that:\n\n【73】> Salem King Size and Salem Lights are attracting a high proportion of young adult smokers under 25, traditionally the stronghold of the Marlboro franchise. The Salem franchise is also attracting a high proportion of young adult women, in markets where the incidence of young adult female smokers is growing as women become more emancipated.[@b96]\n\n【74】A 1985 study for B&W on menthol in Japan showed that 'menthol cigarettes tended to be considered as 'fashionable'' and that 'those who smoke menthol brands are somewhat 'different' people, if they were not young women'.[@b97] The report advised that these aspects 'should be seriously considered by a marketer of menthol cigarettes since the primary target segment is younger women, that is, female students and office girls\\'.[@b97] Marketing that emphasises coolness, refreshing sensations, mildness, soothing taste, and youthful, fun-loving imagery contributes to these perceptions.\n\n【75】Further evidence that these results replicate outside the US borders, the perception of health benefits of menthol over non-menthol has become global. A 1991 study by ASI Market Research Inc. in Japan for PM noted that men in particular '(t)ried (menthol cigarettes) when not in good physical condition/when throat was feeling sore, and found them enjoyable'.[@b98] This report also noted that '(m)enthol cigarettes were also felt to be somehow better for the health than non-menthol cigarettes (ie, gentler on the throat)'.[@b98] Marketing Decision Research (Pacific) Ltd. found similar results in a 1992 study of Hong Kong for PM:\n\n【76】The 'cooling' and 'refreshing' abilities of menthol have the following advantages:make smokers feel comfortableless easy to cause throat discomfort.\n\n【77】can also elate one\\'s spirit but is much better than strong stimulation of nicotine in full-flavored cigarettes. It is relatively healthier.[@b99] (Emphasis added.)\n\n【78】A 1979 study by PACC Information Systems showed B&W that in Kuwait:\n\n【79】(M)enthol cigarettes are thought to present many good aspects; they are usually.\n\n【80】1.  relieving\n\n【81】2.  help to expell (sic) catharr (inflammation of the mucous membranes)\n\n【82】3.  help in the case of colds.\n\n【83】(M)enthol cigarettes are thought to be less harmful to health than ordinary cigarettes.[@b100]\n\n【84】These documents demonstrate that what the US tobacco companies do affects consumers around the globe. Transnational tobacco companies based in the US study consumers home and abroad, and it is not always clear which study or studies a certain bit of insight about effective marketing efforts originally came from. The consumer studies in Asia and in Kuwait echoing those that were conducted in the US reflect an interesting finding that US tobacco company activities are relevant beyond the borders of the US. Including menthol in the US FDA\\'s list of banned cigarette flavouring additives as a policy measure help may lay a foundation for positive public health effects beyond the US borders in the future as well.\n\n【85】Menthol products have been marketed as, and are often perceived as, milder than 'regular' cigarettes and therefore less of a threat to health, similar to perceptions of 'low-tar' and 'light' products. Whereas menthol users appear less interested in 'tar' than traditional health-concerned smokers who seek 'light' and 'ultralight' styles, the perception of health-protective effects of menthol makes menthol products function similarly to 'light' products. The products attract consumers who may otherwise quit smoking and provide psychological health assurances to continuing smokers.\n\n【86】Based upon the findings of this study, it appears the importance of menthol to the tobacco industry (and likely a reason that the industry opposes menthol\\'s inclusion in the FDA\\'s list of banned additives) is that menthol makes cigarettes easier and more palatable to smoke for new initiators and for established health-concerned smokers. Making cigarettes more attractive to new smokers and less desirable to quit among established smokers contributes to the incidence of tobacco-related diseases; menthol should be included on the list of banned additives.\n\n【87】###### What this paper adds\n\n【88】-   Marketing for menthol cigarettes targets specific populations in the US, such as African--Americans. Less is known about what specific messages are communicated in marketing for different populations or about how consumers perceive messages in menthol cigarette marketing.\n\n【89】-   Menthol cigarettes were marketed as, and are perceived by consumers to be, healthier than non-menthol cigarettes. Additionally, menthol marketing targeting African--Americans, young people and women is perceived by these groups to signal social group belonging.\n\n【90】-   Menthol consumers (new initiators and established health-concerned smokers) believe that menthol makes cigarettes easier and more palatable to smoke.\n\n【91】I thank Karen Butter, University Librarian, University of California San Francisco, for procuring the funding for this project.\n\n【92】Funding: This research was supported by the Department of Health and Human Services Contract HHSN261201000035I.\n\n【93】Competing interests: None.\n\n【94】Contributors: SJA designed the study; collected, analysed, and interpreted the data; drafted the manuscript; and gave final approval to the manuscript.\n\n【95】Provenance and peer review: Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.

By examining the stability ratio, W, it was found that even in the most destabilized state, i.e. at charge neutralization, the starch chains had induced steric stabilization to the system. At higher particle and starch concentrations relaxation of the aggregates could be seen, as monitored by a decrease in turbidity with time. This relaxation was evaluated by fitting the data to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function. It was found that irrespective of the starch to particle charge ratio the relaxation time was similar. Moreover, a molecular weight dependence on the relaxation time was found, as well as a more pronounced initial aggregated state for the higher molecular weight starch. This initial aggregate state could be due to bridging flocculation. With time, as the starch chains have relaxed into a final conformation on the particle surface, bridging will be less important and is gradually replaced by patches that will cause patchwise flocculation.

Cervical cancer is thought to develop through a multistep process involving virus, tumor suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes and immunological factors. It is known that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary but insufficient to cause malignancy. At present, the etiology of cervical carcinoma remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the expression of FOS-like antigen-1 (Fra-1) gene was downregulated in cervical cancer compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting techniques. To uncover the effect of Fra-1 on cervical cancer, we tested and confirmed that Fra-1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells by MMT assays in vitro. At the same time, overexpression of Fra-1 promoted apoptosis of HeLa cells. To explore the possible mechanism of Fra-1 in cervical cancer, we tested the expression levels of key molecules in p53 signaling pathway by western blotting technology. The results showed that p53 was downregulated in cervical cancer compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues, but MDM2 proto-oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (MDM2) was upregulated in cervical cancer. In vitro, the p53 was upregulated and MDM2 was downregulated in HeLa cells with Fra-1 overexpression. In summary, our results suggested that Fra-1 expression is low in cervical cancer tissues and promotes apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by p53 signaling pathway.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

However, with increasing safety and efficacy concerns over currently available drugs and a dearth of options available for atypical depot formulations, there is a considerable need for the development of new formulations and agents. This review examines the profile of seven antipsychotic drugs currently in the premarketing stage of development and summarizes their mechanism of action, clinical potential and safety.Asenapine is an antipsychotic with activity for multiple receptors and has potential to improve negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Bifeprunox is a partial dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist showing a less than convincing efficacy profile, but which may offer safety advantages over available agents by means of a reduced risk of metabolic complications. Iloperidone is a D2 and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist requiring further studies to establish its effectiveness. It has a high affinity for alpha通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>-adrenoceptors, which can lead to associated haemodynamic adverse effects. Nemonapride is essentially a typical antipsychotic drug, similar in structure to sulpiride, which has been available for some time in Japan. It has efficacy against positive symptoms and has shown some antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, although efficacy data for it are somewhat limited. Norclozapine (N-desmethylclozapine) is a major metabolite of clozapine formed by its demethylation. Its partial agonist activity at D2 receptors has raised interest in it as an antipsychotic in its own right. In addition, it appears to have muscarinic agonist activity, which is believed to be responsible for the observed positive effects it has on cognition. It was envisaged to be effective as an adjunct to other agents or at high doses in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia, although a recent randomized, controlled study showed that it was no more effective than placebo in patients with schizophrenia experiencing an acute psychotic episode. Olanzapine pamoate depot injection has shown comparable efficacy to oral olanzapine in several studies. However, it has provoked considerable safety concerns by its association with inadvertent intravascular injection events in numerous patients. This accidental intravascular administration of olanzapine pamoate leads to excessive sedation, confusion, dizziness and altered speech. Post-injection observation periods and postmarketing surveillance are planned following the introduction of the depot. Paliperidone palmitate is the palmitate ester of paliperidone, the major metabolite of risperidone, and is formulated as a long-acting injection for intramuscular use. Its pharmacology is comparable to risperidone, having D2 and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist activity. Efficacy studies have shown positive results, and because paliperidone has no antagonistic activity at cholinergic receptors, it has low potential for anticholinergic adverse effects, including cognitive dysfunction. However, with higher doses, the frequency of extrapyramidal side effects and orthostatic hypotension have been shown to be greater than with placebo.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

This study examines long-term facial nerve function in relation to the immediate postoperative function and the function at time of discharge from the hospital. Subjects included 515 patients who underwent primary acoustic neuroma removal at House Ear Clinic from 1982 through 1989 and who had normal preoperative facial function, an intact facial nerve after surgery, and a House-Brackmann facial nerve grade available immediately postoperatively, at time of hospital discharge, and at least 1 year postoperatively. Rate of acceptable facial function (House grades I-IV) differed significantly (p < or = 0.001) at the three postoperative time intervals: 85.2%, immediate; 73.6%, discharge; 93.8%, long-term. Of those with good immediate function (grades I-II), 98.6% had acceptable long-term function. Of those with poor immediate function (grades V-VI), 69.8% had acceptable long-term function. We conclude that facial nerve recovery after acoustic neuroma surgery is characterized by slight deterioration in the immediate postoperative period, but subsequent improvement in the long-term. Patients can be reliably counseled that acceptable function immediately after surgery is associated with a favorable long-term outcome; poor function immediately after surgery, despite an intact nerve, has a more guarded prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

Analysis of mRNA levels of CD66c in colon tumors suggests that this antigen is strongly up-regulated compared to its normal counterpart and could, therefore, be of clinical interest. CD66c is also expressed in normal lung and spleen tissues and, above all, on granulocytes. The appearance of CD66b in serum, the only strictly granulocyte-specific antigen, could point to the involvement of granulocytes in disease. Specific sandwich ELISAs have been established to determine CEA, CD66b and CD66c levels in serum. Controls have been carried out by testing sera from patients with benign tumors or inflammatory diseases and from healthy individuals. In sera of most patients suffering from solid tumors, sensitivities for CD66c are comparable to or lower than those for CEA. CD66c showed a much higher sensitivity in early colon tumor stages. Sensitivities over 40% have been determined for CD66b in sera of patients with uterine and kidney carcinomas. CML patients revealed sensitivities of 84% for CD66c and 47% for CD66b. Investigations of sera from patients with inflammatory colon diseases which are negative for CEA showed high sensitivity for CD66c but not for the granulocyte-specific CD66b. Patients with mastopathy revealed sensitivities of over 40% for both CD66c and CD66b. CD66b, CD66c and CEA are independently regulated proteins in a high percentage of patients. The simultaneous determination of CEA and CD66b/c can increase the sensitivities for malignant tumors but high sensitivities of CD66b/c for benign diseases limit their usefulness as tumor markers.

It has been assumed that in a diffusion-based system, each spiracle contributes to oxygen flux into and carbon dioxide flux out of the tracheal system according to the size of its opening. We evaluated this hypothesis by determining how a reduction in size and interference with the spatial distribution of gas exchange areas impair flight muscle function and aerodynamic force production in the small fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This was done by selectively blocking thoracic spiracles of tethered flies flying inside a flight simulator. Flow-through respirometry and simultaneous measurements of flight force production and wing kinematics revealed a negligible functional safety margin for respiration. Maximum locomotor performance was only achieved by unmanipulated flies, supporting the general assumption that at the animal's maximum locomotor capacity, maximum spiracle opening area matches respiratory need. The maximum total buffer capacity for carbon dioxide in Drosophila amounts to approximately 33.5 mul g通用删除7(英):<u>(-1)</u> body mass, estimated from the temporal integral of carbon dioxide release rate during the resting period after flight.

This is a consistent body of evidence demonstrating that patients with HF are burdened by metabolic comorbidities, including dysfunction of lipid metabolism, that dramatically impact long‐term outcomes.通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0002){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0003){ref-type=\"ref\"} Recently, adipose tissue has been increasingly realized to contribute to this pathophysiological process.\n\n【4】Adipose tissue, identified as a complex endocrine organ, has profound effects on the cardiovascular system by exerting a wide range of regulatory functions, which is classified into two anatomically distinct types, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue.通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"} Those fat depots surrounding the heart, also referred to as epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), function as metabolic transducers in the regulation of cardiac functions in HF.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[7]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"} EAT is a metabolically active visceral fat depot located in atrioventricular and interventricular grooves. There is no anatomical boundary between EAT and myocardium, and they share the coronary microcirculation. Due to this anatomical arrangement, there are potential physiological (including vasocrine and paracrine) interactions between these two tissues.通用删除6(英):<u>[5]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0005){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[8]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0008){ref-type=\"ref\"} EAT serves as a local energy source during high‐energy demands by releasing fatty acids to the myocardium and protecting the heart against high fatty acid levels and associated lipotoxicity. The relationship between EAT thickness/volume and the extent of cardiovascular disease has already been established.通用删除6(英):<u>[9]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0009){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[10]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[11]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0011){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"} The accumulation of EAT has been identified to be a significant feature of chronic metabolic status related to HF. In clinical setting, HF patients had more EAT compared with controls and EAT volume was closely associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus and with biomarkers related to myocardial injury.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}\n\n【5】As the proteome is the determinant of the cell and can better elucidate the process behind the manifestation of diseases, the label‐free quantitative proteomic approach was employed to calculate the changes in protein abundance between groups. In the proteomic study of EAT by Salgado‐Somoza and colleagues, proteins related to oxidative stress seemed to be more expressed in EAT rather than subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with coronary artery disease, which suggested that EAT in patients with cardiovascular disease was closely associated with myocardial stress.通用删除6(英):<u>[14]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0014){ref-type=\"ref\"} Recently, a study on proteomics of the epicardial fat secretome has suggested EAT secretome as a possible substrate for post‐operative atrial fibrillation.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"} However, few studies have focused on the proteomic changes of EAT in patients accompanied by HF. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the EAT proteome and investigate substrate changes that may contribute to the genesis of HF. The use of nano‐LC‐MS/MS generated a comprehensive proteome of EAT, including 8031 peptides of 1430 proteins. From amongst them, we selected 24 differently expressed proteins in EAT that are possibly involved in HF‐related pathology. Of these proteins, serine proteinase inhibitor A3 (Serpina3) was significantly increased in EAT from HF patients, which was further confirmed in the following validation stage. These data indicate that Serpina3 may play an important role in the progression of HF.\n\n【6】2. MATERIALS AND METHODS {#jcmm14758-sec-0002}\n========================\n\n【7】2.1. Experimental design and statistical rationale {#jcmm14758-sec-0003}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】In order to make comparative quantitative proteomic analyses of human EAT associated with HF, we selected patients with HF (n = 5) and patients with non‐HF (n = 5) as the control group. Enrolled patients in this study were all free of cancer. The baseline demographic and laboratory characteristics are summarized in Table [S1](#jcmm14758-sup-0003){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}. In HF group, four patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and one patient underwent cardiac surgery for valve replacement, similar to non‐HF group. As shown in Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, after collection, EAT samples were processed and analysed in a label‐free quantitative proteomic workflow. In each cohort, an equal concentration of 100‐μg proteins was isolated from EAT, proteolytically digested with trypsin and subsequently analysed using nano‐LC‐MS/MS with a nano‐UPLC system and a quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The relative label‐free quantitative (LFQ) intensities of the proteins across the individual samples were acquired with MaxQuant software. The correlation coefficient for the LFQ intensities between LC‐MS/MS runs was greater than 0.80. The relative label‐free quantitation profiling was highly reproducible between two intra‐cohort or inter‐cohort LC‐MS/MS runs. Open‐source public databases were then applied in the quantitative proteomic analyses and the proteins of interest would be further verified in the following procedures. In addition to the proteomic analyses, we explored the relationships amongst clinical variables and the underlying biological processes derived from protein data.\n\n【9】![Experimental workflow of quantitative proteomic analysis of human epicardial adipose tissue using LC‐MS/MS‐based approach](JCMM-24-511-g001){#jcmm14758-fig-0001}\n\n【10】2.2. Patients and tissue sampling {#jcmm14758-sec-0004}\n---------------------------------\n\n【11】Epicardial adipose tissue were collected from ten patients undergoing CABG or cardiac surgery for valve replacement between April 2018 and August 2018. All EAT samples were taken under the same haemodynamic conditions, a few minutes before the extracorporeal circulation was started. EAT (volume 1‐2 cm^3^) were collected from the left‐interventricular groove, cut into small pieces, washed with ice‐cold PBS three times to remove the blood, transferred into frozen tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen for 10 minutes and finally stored at −80°C until analysis. To confirm the validity of the selected proteins by proteomics analysis, we included patients who were diagnosed with AMI between August 2018 and February 2019 and divided into HF and non‐HF groups. The diagnosis of HF was based on symptoms and clinical examinations \\[brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) \\> 500 ng/L, enlarged left ventricular end diastolic diameter and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (\\<50%)\\]. Baseline demographic characteristics and clinical parameters were obtained at admission. Each patient provided written informed consent after individual explanation, and the research was conducted in compliance with the principles specified for research on patients in the Declaration of Helsinki and the research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital.\n\n【12】2.3. Extraction and digestion of epicardial adipose proteins {#jcmm14758-sec-0005}\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Proteins were extracted from EAT using RadioImmuno Precipitation Assay buffer (Solarbio, Beijing) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis). Protein concentration was determined with BCA protein assay (Pierce, IL). Take 100‐μg proteins and add pre‐chilled acetone to alkylated protein. Extracted proteins were solubilized in 100 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate with 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and reduced with 5 mmol/L tris 2‐carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride for 10 minutes at 55°C, followed by alkylation with 10 mmol/L iodoacetamide for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The concentration was then digested overnight at 37°C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (trypsin 1:50 protein w/w ratio; Promega, Madison, WI). After clean‐up of SDC with 2% TFA, the tryptic peptides were desalted using C18 cartridge (3M, St. Paul) and the eluted peptides were dried in a vacuum concentrator.\n\n【14】2.4. Label‐free quantitative proteomics by LC‐MS/MS {#jcmm14758-sec-0006}\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Extracted peptides were separated using a reversed‐phase column (100 μm × 150 mm, 3 μm ReproSil‐Pur 120 C18‐AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr Math) at a 300 nL/min flow rate and analysed with the EASY‐nLC nano‐UPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The UPLC mobile phase A \\[0.1% formic acid (FA) with 2% acetonitrile (ACN)\\] and B \\[80% ACN with 0.1% FA\\] were used to perform a 120‐min gradient elution as follows: 8%‐30% B for 92 minutes, 30%‐40% B for 20 minutes, 40%‐100% B for 2 minutes, 100% B for 2 minutes, 100%‐2% B for 2 minutes and finally 2% B for 2 minutes. Peptides were analysed using a Q‐Extractive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fish Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled with MS for the 20 highest‐intensity ions with a normalized collision energy of 27% for HCD and an isolation window of 2 m/z. The full mass and subsequent MS/MS analyses were performed in an Orbitrap analyzer with a resolution of 70 000 for MS1 (at 200 m/z) and 17 500 for MS2, respectively. The automatic gain control target for MS1 was set to 3.0 E^+6^ with max IT 50 ms and 5.0 E^+4^ for MS2 with max IT 100 ms. The top 20 most intense ions were fragmented by HCD with normalized collision energy of 27% and isolation window of 2 m/z. The dynamic exclusion was set at 30 seconds.\n\n【16】2.5. Bioinformatics and data analysis {#jcmm14758-sec-0007}\n-------------------------------------\n\n【17】Raw data were processed with MaxQuant software . The following parameters were used: carbamidomethyl \\[C\\] as fixed modification, oxidation \\[M\\] and acetyl \\[protein N‐term\\] as variable modifications, three missed cleavages were allowed. The false discovery rates (FDRs) of the peptide‐spectra matches determined by a decoy database (Uniprothuman201609) search were set less than 0.01. Only unique & razor peptides were used for quantification. All the other parameters were reserved as default. Proteins were considered to be successfully identified if they could be established at greater than 99% probability with at two correct assigned peptides obtained. Protein abundance was calculated on the basis of the normalized spectral protein intensity (LFQ intensity). The significance of Log~2~LFQ intensity of proteins between HF and non‐HF group was calculated using Perseus program (Figure [S1](#jcmm14758-sup-0001){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Scatter do plots were generated, and parameters were statistically analysed using unpaired student\\'s t test. P value \\< .05 was considered significant. The intracellular pathway analysis was performed using clusterProfiler in R package to search Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. For protein‐protein interaction network analysis, the UniProt functional annotations were used to hierarchical clustering the proteins into several clusters. Based on the raw data from MS, proteins matched in clusters were extracted and submitted to STRING database to define the physical and functional interactions amongst these proteins and then interpreted by Cytoscape into visualized network.\n\n【18】2.6. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction {#jcmm14758-sec-0008}\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Total RNA was extracted from human EAT using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA concentration was measured using of NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, DE, USA). Approximately 1 μg of RNA from each sample was reversely transcribed using SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) for cDNA synthesis, and Roche FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix was used to perform quantitative real‐time PCR. β‐Actin was used as an endogenous control.\n\n【20】2.7. Determination of Serpina3 levels in plasma {#jcmm14758-sec-0009}\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Plasma concentrations of Serpina3 were determined by commercially available microplate ELISA kit (AACT Human SimpleStep ELISA Kit, Abcam, USA) according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions. Venous blood samples were collected in potassium EDTA‐containing tubes. After collection, the blood sample was centrifuged immediately at 1500 g for 15 minutes at ambient temperature. Plasma was extracted and frozen in aliquots at −80°C until analysis. During measurement, the plasma samples were diluted 1:50 000. The intra‐assay and inter‐assay coefficients of variation were both \\<5%.\n\n【22】2.8. Statistics {#jcmm14758-sec-0010}\n---------------\n\n【23】Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), where appropriate. Comparisons between groups were performed using independent‐sample t test, Kruskal‐Wallis or Mann‐Whitney U tests for continuous variables and Chi‐square or Fisher\\'s exact tests for categorical variables. Linear regression analysis was performed to calculate clinical relevant factors related to Serpina3 levels. A receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of HF were analysed. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY), and a 2‐tailed P \\< .05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【24】3. RESULTS {#jcmm14758-sec-0011}\n==========\n\n【25】3.1. Human EAT proteome profile associated with HF {#jcmm14758-sec-0012}\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】In order to identify EAT proteins' abundances in HF, we threw the raw data to LC‐MS/MS database for searching and got a core set of 771 quantified proteins (FDR \\< 0.01) (Table [S3](#jcmm14758-sup-0005){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Based on the protein ratios of the 771 EAT proteins, we then identified 24 potential differently expressed proteins in EAT associated with HF. Of the 24 proteins, 17 proteins increased in HF relative to non‐HF, whereas seven proteins decreased in HF. These proteins, especially associated with inflammation and oxidative stress response, were differently expressed between groups. Amongst these proteins, Serpina3 was significantly up‐regulated in the HF group (P = .0047). Detailed protein information is provided in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#jcmm14758-tbl-0001){ref-type=\"table\"}. The distributions of statistical significance and magnitude of change for these proteins for each group are presented in volcano plots (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}A). The cluster heat map, using hierarchical analysis with a Pearson correlation, separated groups with the presence of HF, and was detailed in Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0002){ref-type=\"fig\"}B.\n\n【27】###### \n\n【28】Significantly changed proteins in EAT identified by LC‐MS/MS (HF vs non‐HF) (P \\< .05)\n\n【29】  Protein name                                                  UniProt ID    Number of unique peptides   \\% sequence coverage   P value   Fold change (HF: non‐HF)\n  ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------- --------------------------- ---------------------- ----------- --------------------------\n  Alpha‐1‐antichymotrypsin                                      AACTHUMAN    11                          26.5%                  .0047       4.63\n  ATP synthase subunit e, mitochondrial                         ATP5IHUMAN   2                           30.4%                  .012        2.31\n  Cofilin‐2                                                     COF2HUMAN    3                           34.9%                  .048        2.28\n  Fatty acid synthase                                           FASHUMAN     63                          28.4%                  .028        2.25\n  Creatine kinase B‐type                                        KCRBHUMAN    7                           25.2%                  .037        2.24\n  Lipoma‐preferred partner                                      LPPHUMAN     3                           8.2%                   .026        2.19\n  Acetyl‐CoA carboxylase 2                                      ACACBHUMAN   20                          10.3%                  .014        2.11\n  Pyruvate carboxylase, mitochondrial                           PYCHUMAN     17                          17.1%                  .036        2.03\n  Alpha‐1‐antitrypsin                                           A1ATHUMAN    16                          54.3%                  .021        1.91\n  60S ribosomal protein L24                                     RL24HUMAN    2                           13.2%                  .037        1.85\n  Ceruloplasmin                                                 CERUHUMAN    20                          25.5%                  .011        1.81\n  Zinc‐alpha‐2‐glycoprotein                                     ZA2GHUMAN    10                          41.6%                  .016        1.79\n  Alpha‐1B‐glycoprotein                                         A1BGHUMAN    9                           21.4%                  .016        1.67\n  Beta‐hexosaminidase subunit beta                              HEXBHUMAN    4                           8.1%                   .04         1.63\n  NAD (P) transhydrogenase, mitochodrial                        NNTMHUMAN    4                           3.9%                   .049        1.58\n  Enoyl‐CoA hydratase, mitochondrial                            ECHMHUMAN    10                          43.8%                  .038        1.53\n  Electron transfer flavoprotein subunit alpha, mitochondrial   ETFAHUMAN    8                           38.6%                  .021        1.52\n  Non‐histone chromosomal protein HMG‐17                        HMGN2HUMAN   2                           23.3%                  .042        0.63\n  Annexin A7                                                    ANXA7HUMAN   4                           13.4%                  .044        0.51\n  Calpain‐2 catalytic subunit                                   CAN2HUMAN    3                           5.5%                   .045        0.51\n  F‐actin‐capping protein subunit alpha‐2                       CAZA2HUMAN   2                           11.5%                  .016        0.49\n  Cytochrome b‐245 heavy chain                                  CY24BHUMAN   2                           6.9%                   .009        0.36\n  Bisphosphoglycerate mutase                                    PMGEHUMAN    7                           27%                    .011        0.25\n  Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide                            CAMPHUMAN    3                           16.8%                  .044        0.13\n\n【30】UniProt ID, protein identifier within Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) knowledgebase; Number of unique peptides, peptides on which protein identification was based; % sequence coverage, percentage of sequence of the full‐length protein covered by the unique peptides that were identified.\n\n【31】Abbreviations: EAT, epicardial adipose tissue; HF, heart failure.\n\n【32】John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n\n【33】![Comprehensive proteome profile of human epicardial adipose tissue.

Functional analyses of the differential EAT proteome associated with HF {#jcmm14758-sec-0013}\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【35】We then compared differentially expressed proteins between study groups by performing enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology biological process and identified key biological processes and potential pathways that might discriminate HF from control. The cellular processes significantly represented by the EAT proteome included neutrophil activation in immune response and degranulation, biotin metabolic process, fatty acid beta‐oxidation, cellular lipid catabolic process and coenzyme and water‐soluble vitamin metabolic process, which mainly related to responses to reactive oxygen species and oxidation stress, inflammatory/immune responses and lipid metabolism. The enrichment analysis of GO cellular components revealed that most of these proteins were localized in the cytoplasm, vesicle, platelet alpha granule and blood microparticle. Through paracrine and autocrine secretion, these active factors participated in fatty acid biosynthesis, propanoate and pyruvate metabolism and ferroptosis, as described in KEGG pathway mapping (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0003){ref-type=\"fig\"}A,B).

Network analysis identifies HF‐related specific protein network in EAT {#jcmm14758-sec-0014}\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】To explore the relationships amongst the differentially expressed proteins related to HF, we conducted adipose gene network analysis to identify HF‐related specific protein and extracted the subnetworks that were influenced by advanced cardiac function. For the inflammation‐related process in the network model, one notable network included Serpina3, CKB, CP, Serpina1, AZGP1, MMP14 and CAMP, which were involved in the inflammation‐related modules, mitochondrial metabolism and cell degranulation in the regulation of acute phase response. On the other hand, regarding the metabolism regulation in the constructed model, protein products of key candidates associated with lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including ACACB, FASN, ETFA, ECHS1 and PC, response significantly increased in EAT of patients with HF. Our analysis illustrates an up‐regulation in proteins and gene networks associated with leukocyte activation and macrophage activation and an increase in proteins related with fatty acid metabolism in patients with poor cardiac function, which indicating a complex relationship between cardiovascular system and adipose tissue.\n\n【39】3.4. Validation of the selected protein {#jcmm14758-sec-0015}\n---------------------------------------\n\n【40】In the discovery phase using label‐free LC‐MS/MS, 24 candidate EAT proteins were identified as primary targets for further clinical validation in larger cohorts. As shown in Table 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#jcmm14758-tbl-0001){ref-type=\"table\"}, Serpina3 levels in EAT were highly up‐regulated in HF, with HF/non‐HF ratio of 4.63 and a P value of 0.0047. Serpina3, also called alpha‐1 antichymotrypsin or AACT, was first discovered as an acute phase plasma protease inhibitor, which has been implicated in the pathology of complex human disorders. Gene expression levels were further confirmed via QT‐PCR on EAT samples of controls and HF (20 vs 20). The analysis confirmed a significant increase in Serpina3 in HF (P \\< .001) as shown in Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0004){ref-type=\"fig\"}A. Additionally, the circulating levels of Seprina3 were measured in patients with (n = 28) or without HF (n = 88) at admission. The basic and laboratory parameters are detailed in Table [S2](#jcmm14758-sup-0004){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}. As expected, patients with HF showed elevated Serpina3 levels in plasma compared with non‐HF cohort (460.08 \\[243.47, 803.19\\] vs 263.58 \\[171.70, 408.73\\] μg/mL, P = .004, Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#jcmm14758-fig-0004){ref-type=\"fig\"}B). During the process of HF, many other biochemical factors and cardiac hormones are up‐ or down‐regulated, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), as a feedback control for the deterioration of cardiac function. Accordingly, the relationships between baseline Serpina3 and other serum biomarkers sampled at baseline were analysed. Plasma Serpina3 concentrations correlated positively with C‐reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.206, P = .038), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0.363, P \\< .001) and BNP (r = 0.222, P = .018), whilst correlated negatively with high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (r = −0.186, P = .047) and serum albumin (r = −0.201, P = .032). In the multivariate linear regression analysis, BMI (standardized β = −0.243, P = .032), ESR (standardized β = 0.269 P = .04) and fibrinogen (standardized β = 335, P = .012) were independent determinants of Serpina3 (Table [S4](#jcmm14758-sup-0006){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Although Serpina3 was not the best predictor of HF compared with BNP and heart rate (Table [S5](#jcmm14758-sup-0007){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}), the presence of increased Serpina3 levels improved the diagnosis of HF. In the ROC analysis for the prediction of HF, the AUC for BNP was 0.673 (CI: 0.549, 0.796, P = .006), whilst the AUC for the combination of BNP and Serpina3 was 0.727 (CI: 0.613, 0.841, P \\< .001) (Figure [S2](#jcmm14758-sup-0002){ref-type=\"supplementary-material\"}). Collectively, Serpina3 protein may play a key role in the biology of EAT, participating in the physiopathology of cardiac dysfunction.\n\n【41】![Validation of the Serpina3 expression.

DISCUSSION {#jcmm14758-sec-0016}\n=============\n\n【43】Epicardial adipose tissue is a metabolically active visceral fat depot located in atrioventricular and interventricular grooves.通用删除6(英):<u>[12]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0012){ref-type=\"ref\"} Under physiological conditions, EAT can serve as a buffer, absorbing fatty acids as a lipid storage depot and as brown fat, defending the myocardium against load pressure.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"} But in pathological conditions, EAT may experienc \"phenotypic\" transformation and the EAT store and metabolic activities are different from normal condition.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"} As reported, increased volume and inflammation of EAT are associated with the progression of cardiac dysfunction in obese individual.通用删除6(英):<u>[16]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0016){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[17]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0017){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[18]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0018){ref-type=\"ref\"} However, the alterations of metabolic and functional alterations in EAT have been considered clinically important but are yet to be systematically investigated. Accordingly, in this study, we described comprehensive proteome profiles of EAT to identify the proteins possibly modulating the primary pathophysiological process, inflammatory response and metabolic alterations linked to HF. To achieve this goal, we conducted a workflow that involved a comprehensive proteome profiling of whole EAT using nano‐LC‐MS/MS, identified differently expressed proteins in EAT between HF and controls, constructed HF‐related network models and analysed biological functions of the proteome related to HF, and validated the selected protein using QT‐PCR and ELISA in a larger cohort. Using this workflow, we identified an array of 24 differentially expressed EAT proteins related to HF, participating in the prominent perturbation of inflammatory, mitochondrial and lipid metabolism pathways.\n\n【44】Systemic inflammatory response and oxidative stress are implicated in the deterioration of cardiac function.通用删除6(英):<u>[15]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"} The inflammation‐related network in response to HF included up‐regulated Serpina3, CKB, CP, Serpina1, AZGP1 and MMP14. These have been a consensus that inflammatory status in EAT underlines the deterioration of cardiac function.通用删除6(英):<u>[13]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0013){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[19]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0019){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[20]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0020){ref-type=\"ref\"} The recruitment of proinflammatory immunocytes to EAT and releasing of proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the link between EAT and cardiovascular disorders. In addition, the modules in lipid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including ACACB, FASN, ETFA, ECHS1 and PC, responded significantly increased in the status of HF. Our data provided a detailed list of proteins in EAT potentially participated in the pathogenesis of HF, thus extending extensively the current understanding of mechanism of cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, the network model lays a foundation for combing inflammation of EAT and metabolic dysfunction in EAT with cardiovascular diseases. The network suggested that inflammation of adipose tissue surrounding heart and fatty acid oxidation should be part of pathophysiology in HF. However, as our study is mainly relied on curated databases for protein‐protein interaction, future researches are needed to investigate the exact mechanisms underlying the association of candidate EAT proteins in HF.\n\n【45】Amongst the differentially expressed proteins, we believe that Serpina3 make a prominent link between EAT and HF. Serpina3, also called alpha‐1 antichymotrypsin or AACT, was first discovered as an acute phase plasma protease inhibitor.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[22]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0022){ref-type=\"ref\"} It serves the function predominantly via the regulation of neutrophil cathepsin G, leukocyte elastase and mast cell chymases. Of note, cathepsin G is contained in neutrophil granules and released as a response to inflammatory status, but the excessive release or long‐time activation would eventually result in an adverse effect. It has been implicated that Serpina3 partly contributes to the pathology of devastating human diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer\\'s disease, Parkinson\\'s disease and cerebral haemorrhage.通用删除6(英):<u>[21]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0021){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[23]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"} However, continuous infusion of recombinant human alpha‐1 antichymotrypsin significantly attenuated myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting neutrophil‐accumulation into ischaemic‐reperfused myocardium and by inactivating cytotoxic metabolites released from neutrophils.通用删除6(英):<u>[24]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0024){ref-type=\"ref\"} The plasma alpha‐1 antichymotrypsin levels are described as elevated in patients with HF,通用删除6(英):<u>[25]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0025){ref-type=\"ref\"} as shown in our study, but the role of Serpina3 in this status, that is helping control inflammation or contributing to the deterioration of cardiac function, needs to be further illustrated. HF is a complex syndrome of inflammation, characterized by the explosion of a variety of cytokines. It has been proposed that EAT inflammation in response to metabolic disturbance leads to cardiac dysfunction via release of free fatty acid that activates the immune system and leads to release of cytokines, such as IL‐1β, TNFα, IL‐6.通用删除6(英):<u>[26]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"} Importantly, human EAT obtained from obese patients with preserved ejection fraction showed a significant increase in EAT inflammation and activated M1‐phenotype macrophages.通用删除6(英):<u>[6]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0006){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[27]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0027){ref-type=\"ref\"} In our study, we did not detect disturbance in immune system and cytokine cascade in plasma by either gene enrichment analysis or blood chemical examinations, but higher Serpina3 levels were closely associated with higher BNP levels (P = .018), higher ESR (P \\< .001) and higher CRP (P = .038) levels. It is possible that the regulation of Serpina3 metabolism promotes the EAT inflammatory response associated with HF. Researches on the role of Serpina3 in immune alteration and inflammatory response are needed. Furthermore, HF was shown to be related to the development of cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[28]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"} The presence of failing heart resulted in significantly increased intestinal tumour load, with markedly elevated Serpina3 levels compared with healthy human beings. Serpina3 has been proposed as markers of tumour progression of adenoma into carcinoma and is linked to a variety of cancer.通用删除6(英):<u>[29]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0029){ref-type=\"ref\"}, 通用删除6(英):<u>[30]</u>(#jcmm14758-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"} Whether the role of Serpina3 in neoplasia would influence the long‐term prognosis of HF still needs to be investigated.\n\n【46】We were aware of several limitations in our study, which should be taken into consideration. First, the relatively small sample size in this study may weaken the association of candidate EAT proteins with HF. The role of Serpina3 in HF should be further discussed in a large‐scale prospective study. Second, only plasma Serpina3 was measured in the validation phase without other differentially expressed proteins. Plasma‐based screening assay should be applied in the validation studies. Third, there is not enough evidence to illustrate if Serpina3 produced in the EAT might be released into circulation. The source of circulating plasma Serpina3 in humans is unclear. Fourth, we only discussed HF with reduced ejection fraction. Because of the proteomic profile of HF in different stage might be different, the variability amongst patients needs to be considered for sample inclusion. Finally, this discovery phrase is the first step toward the understanding of EAT in response to HF. A study focused on the mechanism will be followed.\n\n【47】In summary, EAT has become research focus regarding its implication in the genesis and progression of HF. By establishing genetic and proteomic networks with proteomic alterations, we described a comprehensive dimension of potential indicators for pathogenesis and therapeutic target of HF. Several proteins were differentially expressed in HF, whilst Serpina3 serves important function in pathways known to be involved in the genesis of HF such as inflammatory response. Although our findings are descriptive, they pinpointed key regulators for the mechanism of EAT in HF and offered fertile grounds for future mechanistic studies.\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST {#jcmm14758-sec-0017}\n====================</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS {#jcmm14758-sec-0018}\n====================</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>LZ and XY designed the study.

Glutathione is known to have multifaceted physiological functions and is a critical factor in protecting organisms against toxicity and disease. Intracellular cysteine concentration is a limiting factor for glutathione synthesis. In the present study, the metabolism of intra- and extracellular glutathione in HeLa and hepatoma cell cultures is investigated by using different transport inhibitors for cellular uptake of cystine/cysteine. There exist several ways of cystine/cysteine transport into HeLa and hepatoma cells, and inhibition of them decreased intracellular concentration of cystine/cysteine and in some cases also of glutathione. It was also shown that a large pool of total cell culture glutathione was located extracellularly in both HeLa and hepatoma cell cultures when gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GT) activity was inhibited by acivicin (ACI). Furthermore, the addition of thiol-reactive metal ions significantly increased the total amount of glutathione in hepatoma cell cultures during acivicin inhibition. Thus, occasional determinations of extracellular concentrations of glutathione without GT inhibition strongly underestimate the total turnover of glutathione in a cell culture.

The first choice of treatment strategy for MTX-associated LPD (MTX-LPD) is typically discontinuation or dose reduction of MTX. However, the pathogenesis of MTX-LPD still remains unclear and the treatment of MTX-LPD has been controversial. This case suggests the one important possibility for considering the mechanism or treatment of MTX-LPD. This report was approved by our hospital\\'s Institutional Review Board results.\n\n【2】CASE REPORT\n===========\n\n【3】A 70-year-old man who was incidentally found to have a liver tumor on enhanced computed tomography (CT) during a comprehensive medical examination was referred to our hospital in April 2014. He was diagnosed with RA in 1994 and MTX had been administered since 2006 at a dose of 12 mg/week.\n\n【4】His family history was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed no specific abdominal findings. The results of routine blood examination and liver function tests were normal, and serum tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, DUPAN-2, and Span-1) were within normal limits. Serum cortisol was 14.1 μg/dL (normal: 4.5--21.1 μg/dL) and corticotropin was 91.7 pg/mL (normal: 7.2--63.3 pg/mL). Serum epinephrine was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: ≤0.1 ng/mL), norepinephrine was 0.048 ng/mL (normal: 0.1--0.45 ng/mL), and dopamine was 0.02 ng/mL (normal: ≤0.02 ng/mL). Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a low echoic mass (30 mm in diameter) at the dorsal part of the liver adjacent to the inferior vena cava (IVC). The tumor was hypovascular on enhanced CT scan (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) and indicated low intensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high intensity on T2-weighted or diffusion MRI (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

We therefore performed exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperative finding revealed a right adrenal gland mass with direct infiltration to segment 7 of the liver (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[2]</u>(#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and right adrenectomy was performed extending to segment 7 of the liver. Because we had not reached definite diagnosis before operation, we had thought to diagnose due to biopsy during operation as 1 choice. However, we performed complete resection of the tumor as excisional biopsy under the condition that we could not find another malignancy around the origin from preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings. We did not think the need of extra resection whatever the results came out because we performed complete resection of the tumor, so we did not perform pathological diagnosis during surgery.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>FIGURE 2Intraoperative findings showing the tumor located right dorsal to the IVC and derived from the right adrenal gland. The tumor showed strong adhesion to hepatic segment 7. Right adrenectomy was performed extending to segment 7 of the liver.

Because the infiltration extended to the liver, the boundary between the liver and adrenal grand tissues was ambiguous in some resected portions. The center of the tumor showed geographic necrotic tissue with diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration. In the necrotic tissue, cellular outlines resembling lymphocytes were noted, indicative of lymphoma. The presence of atypical lymphocytes was confirmed by strongly positive immunohistochemical staining for CD20, EBV-encoded RNA transcript (EBER), Epstein--Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA), and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Staining was negative for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD15, CD21, CD30, CD56, Bcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and MUM1 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[3]</u>(#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The geographic necrotic tissue was strongly positive for CD20 (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[4]</u>(#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

LPD was stage IE according to the Ann Arbor classification.^[@R11]^ MTX therapy for RA was discontinued and the patient was followed regularly. He has remained relapse-free for almost 1 year.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n==========\n\n【14】Primary malignant lymphoma of the adrenal gland is a rare and highly aggressive disease that has been reported only rarely in the literature.^[@R1]--[@R4]^ It represents only 3% of extranodal lymphomas.^[@R3]^ Secondary involvement of the adrenal gland with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma occurs more frequently, in nearly 25% of patients during the course of disease.^[@R9]^ Secondary adrenal involvement generally affects elderly individuals, especially those with a history of cancer, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or autoimmune disorder, and in about 50% of cases it manifests as adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal involvement.^[@R12]^\n\n【15】Rashidi and Fisher^[@R4]^ defined primary adrenal lymphoma as a histologically proven lymphoma that involves 1 or both adrenal glands and has at presentation no prior history of lymphoma elsewhere and unequivocally dominant adrenal lesions in cases with lymph nodes or other organ involvement. In our case, preoperative enhanced CT revealed no other lesions except that in the right adrenal gland and postoperative whole-body gallium scintigraphy showed no hot spots. The tumor involved hepatic segment 7, but the adrenal lesion was unequivocally dominant. Accordingly, we diagnosed unilateral primary adrenal LPD.\n\n【16】In 1991, Ellman et al^[@R5]^ first reported the association between lymphoma and MTX therapy in patients with RA. Patients with RA have various immune abnormalities, including T-cell dysfunction and B-cell activation associated with autoantigen stimulation.^[@R6]^ Thought the pathogenesis of RA-associated lymphoma remains unclear, it has been speculated that high inflammatory activity associated with RA, immunosuppressive agents including MTX used for treatment, or EBV infection/reactivation.\n\n【17】Actual risk elevation for lymphoma among patients treated with MTX is unclear. However, given the reported fact that there were several cases with LPD regressed after discontinuation of MTX therapy,^[@R7]^ MTX itself might have strong correlation with LPD in some cases. In addition, it is well known that immunosuppression predisposes patients to EBV-related lymphomas. Suzuki et al^[@R8]^ reported that the developmental mechanism of MTX-LPD may include reactivation and/or persistence of EBV due to immunosuppression by MTX. Indeed, EBV infection was detected in 12% to 44% of lymphomas emerged in patients with RA.^[@R7]^\n\n【18】In current case, blood test revealed positive result for serum anti-EBV (VCA) IgG antibody, anti-EBNA antibody and negative for anti-EBV (VCA) IgM antibody. In addition, the atypical lymphocytes was confirmed in pathologic specimen by strongly positive results in immunohistochemical staining for EBER and EBNA. There results suggest that chronic viremia due to reactivation of EBV may have played a strong role in development of lymphoma in the current case. Given the reported evidence, MTX usage might have relation with reactivation of EBV in this case.\n\n【19】Iatrogenic immunodeficiency-related LPD usually regresses upon withdrawal of the drug; it is thus considered attributable to a toxic/metabolic effect rather than being EBV-related. In a previous study, tumor size decreased in 20% to 30% of cases of MTX-LPD following the discontinuation of MTX.^[@R6]^ The first choice of treatment strategy for MTX-LPD is typically discontinuation or dose reduction of MTX. However, if tumor size does not decrease after discontinuation, chemotherapy or radiotherapy should be performed as second-line therapy. Kawakami et al reported that chemotherapy as the first-line treatment without discontinuation of MTX did not always achieve good outcomes, as infections could occur as a complication.^[@R13]^ They recommended starting chemotherapy after stopping MTX whenever possible. Recent descriptions of relapsed Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma that were EBV-positive at initial diagnosis but EBV-negative at recurrence raise the possibility that DNA is lost during tumor progression in some individuals.^[@R14],[@R15]^ Salloum et al reported that 62.5% of patients observed after MTX withdrawal without additional antitumor therapy showed at least partial regression in response, and most of these patients were EBV-positive.^[@R16]^ Further, survival ratios are higher in patients with Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma than in those with Hodgkin-like lesions.^[@R17]^\n\n【20】Histopathologically, atypical lymphocytes were confirmed by strongly positive immunohistochemical staining for CD20, EBER, EBNA, and LMP1. This confirmed the diagnosis of primary adrenal MTX-associated EBV-positive B-cell LPD. In our case, the adrenal tumor showed characteristic changes, with predominant geographic necrotic tissue and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration in the center of the tumor. Typically, MTX-LPD is not accompanied by tumor necrosis. Since necrotic tissue tends to contain few tumor cells, it can be extremely difficult to accurately diagnose a tumor, and hematoxylin--eosin staining alone fails to provide a definitive diagnosis. In the present case, although the primary adrenal tumor contained a mostly necrotic center, immunostaining of tissue assisted in the diagnosis. In the necrotic tissue, the cellular outlines of lymphocytes indicated lymphoma. Further, immunostaining revealed that the necrotic tissue was strongly positive for CD20.\n\n【21】Generally, such necrosis is attributed to the efficacy of chemotherapy or another treatment. It was generally regarded as MTX withdrawal will restore antitumor immunity and leads the tumor cell necrosis. However, our patient had not received treatment for the adrenal tumor and so we have no identifiable etiology for the tumor necrosis. In other words, the tumor cell might be healing spontaneously in spite of the presence or absence of MTX withdrawal in the past reports. There was no report in the past that the MTX-LPD became necrotic without treatment. And also, it is extremely difficult to diagnose the necrotic tissue like this case by the normal pathological examination.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that undergoing this form of global forefoot reconstruction is reliable based on specific preoperative and intraoperative techniques used to realign the individual rays.

Information from peer-reviewed journals, as well as from non-peer-reviewed publications, abstracts and posters, textbooks, and unpublished works, was also considered. In an effort to procure the highest quality studies available, studies were eligible for inclusion only if they involved patients undergoing Scarf osteotomy of the first ray combined with Weil distal oblique shortening osteotomies of the lateral rays, evaluated patients at mean follow-up of 12-months or longer duration, commented on the reliability of metatarsal realignment, and included details of complications, as well as the incidence and severity of wound-healing complications.

CLS models the aging process of post-mitotic cells and measures the capacity of postdiauxic stationary cultures to maintain viability over time \\[[@R2],[@R3]\\]. For CLS studies, yeast cells are usually aged in media containing 2% glucose. Under these conditions, cells divide exponentially producing energy preferentially by fermentation and respiration is repressed in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. As glucose is being consumed, growth slows down and the diauxic shift occurs which involves a shift from fermentation to respiration, the activation of stress resistance mechanisms and the accumulation of nutrient stores (glycogen and trehalose) to be used later in the stationary phase where the metabolic rate is significantly reduced. Mitochondrial respiration during growth is known to be essential for a strain to achieve a standard wild-type CLS \\[[@R4],[@R5]\\]. However, our recent data shows that yeast cells have a large reserve respiratory capacity to sustain CLS, as respiration only limits CLS when depleted below a \\~40% of wild-type threshold \\[[@R1]\\]. Strains that respire above the threshold during growth adjust their metabolic rate after the diauxic shift in a manner similar to that of wild-type strains. In contrast, strains that respire below the threshold during growth have extremely poor respiratory capacity in the stationary phase and very short CLS. Further, respiratory defects are less detrimental when produced only in the stationary phase, once yeast have accumulated nutrient stores during growth and undergone their metabolic remodeling during the diauxic shift.\n\n【2】An essential question is why strains respiring below the threshold have a short CLS. First, aerobic energy production is required for the efficient function of anti stress systems, most needed during the diauxic shift and stationary phase. Furthermore, cells respiring below the threshold have altered metabolism of stored nutrients. Respiratory-deficient cells accumulate normal amounts of glycogen during growth, but they synthesize trehalose inefficiently. Both of these reserve carbohydrates are quickly consumed when the cells reach the stationary phase because, in the absence of respiration, yeast must rely on fermentation, which generates a 14-fold lower energetic yield. Glycogen and trehalose are virtually exhausted in respiratory-deficient cells by the end of their CLS, thus suggesting that starvation is an important factor limiting their survival. In support of this conclusion, trehalose supplementation of the growth media enhances the stress-resistance capacity of respiratory null strains and significantly extends their CLS.\n\n【3】Another way in which mitochondrial respiration controls aging and longevity is through generation of ROS. Although mitochondrial ROS are known to limit the long-term survival of yeast cells during CLS and can have a detrimental effect during aging in higher eukaryotes, they can also act as signaling molecules with hormetic effects on longevity \\[[@R6]-[@R8]\\]. For example, tor1Δ strains deficient in the nutrient-responsive TORC1 signaling have increased coupled respiration, and also enhanced ROS production during exponential growth that provides an adaptive signal that contributes to increase cell protection systems and extend CLS \\[[@R6]\\]. A comparison of yeast strains with different genetic backgrounds has suggested a correlation between respiratory capacity, mitochondrial ROS generation and CLS \\[[@R1]\\]. Strains with high respiration and ROS production have longer CLS which is curtailed by increased mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 levels while strains with low respiration and ROS production have shorter CLS and can significantly benefit from additional exogenous ROS or tor1Δ-induced endogenous ROS to significantly extend their CLS \\[[@R1],[@R6]\\]. Also caloric restriction (CR) extends the lifespan in yeast through a mechanism that involves, in part, inhibition of nutrient-responsive kinases such as TOR and RAS2 \\[[@R9]\\], general enhancement of stress-resistance mechanisms, increased respiration during growth and metabolic remodeling involving a dramatic reduction in their metabolic rate in the stationary phase that allow the cells to consume their stored nutrients at a slow rate. However, cells must respire during growth at least above a \\~40% threshold to benefit from either CR- or tor1Δ-induced CLS extension. Also important, increased respiration during growth (i.e. by hyperactivating mitochondrial biogenesis) is not sufficient to extend CLS in strains that have maximized the CLS extension achievable by ROS signaling if it is not accompanied by an enhancement of cell protection systems that promote survival in the stationary phase as for tor1Δ and CR-treated cells.\n\n【4】In conclusion, we have proposed a model (Figure 通用删除6(英):<u>[1]</u>(#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}) in which ROS signaling and respiratory thresholds contribute to achieve increased stress resistance, efficient use of energy stores, and likely other beneficial effects in stationary phase, which extends CLS. In multicellular organisms, respiratory thresholds to support cellular life probably vary for every tissue, which in turn likely changes the importance of ROS signaling in a tissue-specific manner. Further studies on the dynamic changes of these mitochondrial parameters in response to environmental cues are expected to provide important information concerning cellular, tissular and organismal aging.\n\n【5】![Complementary roles of mitochondrial energy production though respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial ROS signaling in promoting cell survival and regulating aging and longevity.](aging-04-578-g001){#F1}\n\n【6】The author is grateful for support from the Florida Department of Health / James & Esther King Biomedical Research Program and NIH-RO1 GM071775.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

In the present study, we investigated the anti-cancer effects of 6-gingerol on osteosarcoma cells. MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability.

Ultimately, one would like to link the developmental biology to various aspects of behavior. We are studying the consequences of nicotine exposure on nervous system development in zebrafish and have previously shown that chronic nicotine exposure produces paralysis. We also have made observations that the embryos moved in the initial minutes of the exposure as the bend rates of the musculature increased. This nicotine induced behavior manifests as an increase in the rate of spinal musculature bends, which spontaneously begin at approximately 17 h post fertilization. The behavioral observations prompted the systematic characterization of nicotine-induced modulation of zebrafish embryonic motor output; bends of the trunk musculature. We first characterized embryonic motor output in zebrafish embryos with and without their chorions. We then characterized the motor output in embryos raised at 28 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The act of dechorionation along with temperature influenced the embryonic bend rate. We show that nicotine exposure increases embryonic motor output. Nicotine exposure caused the musculature bends to alternate in a left-right-left fashion. Nicotine was able to produce this phenotype in embryos lacking supraspinal input. We then characterize the kinetics of nicotine influx and efflux and demonstrate that nicotine as low as 1 microM can disrupt embryonic physiology. Taken together, these results indicate the presence of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) associated with embryonic spinal motor circuits early in embryogenesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "d03f29c4-dc44-43bc-9e24-9f61ba1bac5f", "title": "", "text": "【0】1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\n【1】In the United States (USA), cigarette consumption has steadily declined during the past decade. However, sales of cigars, particularly little cigars and cigarillos, have markedly increased. Of the three types of cigar products available in the USA, trend data from 1993 to 2006 suggest that the sales of large cigars decreased from 37% to 47%, while the sales of cigarillos increased from 25% to 32% and little cigars increased from 37% to 47% \\[[@B1]\\]. Increased consumption of small cigars (i.e. little cigars and cigarillos) presents a new challenge for tobacco control researchers. Small cigars are similar to cigarettes in their size, shape, and filtering, are often inhaled, and are flavored. All cigars contain approximately the same toxic and carcinogenic compounds found in cigarettes \\[[@B2]\\]. Small cigars deliver considerable amounts of nicotine to sustain dependence and increase the carbon monoxide levels of smokers \\[[@B3], [@B4]\\]. Small cigar smoking is a public health threat and is not a safer alternative to cigarette smoking.\n\n【2】Small cigar smoking has become increasingly popular among young adults, aged 18--35. Over 65% of young adults have heard about small cigars \\[[@B5]\\], and 26% report ever use of small cigars \\[[@B6]\\]. Young adults with a history of tobacco use have an elevated risk for cigar smoking, with recent studies indicating that 12.0--16.0% of young adult cigarette smokers have smoked some cigar variant (cigars, little cigar, or cigarillos) in the past 30 days \\[[@B6]--[@B8]\\]. The increased popularity of small cigars among young adult smokers may be due, in part, to their exposure to advertisements and promotions of small cigar products. Although magazines and point-of-sale advertisements (which accounted for 24.1% and 13.0% of cigar advertising and promotional expenditures in 1999) \\[[@B9]\\] are traditional avenues for cigar advertisements, tougher restrictions on tobacco advertising may entice the tobacco industry to use creative marketing strategies to promote small cigars.\n\n【3】In 2012, a celebrity hip-hop music artist, Calvin Broadus Jr. also known as Snoop Dogg, announced his launching of a new brand line of cigarillo products, called Executive Branch. Several widely circulated music magazines and press releases reported that Snoop Dogg planned to \"unveil\" the new product during his upcoming performances at the 2012 Coachella Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. The music festival mainly attracts an international audience of adults aged 35 and younger \\[[@B10], [@B11]\\]. A recent study by Richardson and colleagues recently documented Snoop Dogg\\'s promotion of Executive Branch small cigars on social media sites, such as Instagram \\[[@B12]\\]. The tobacco industry historically has relied upon hip-hop and other forms of music to promote smoking, as music can be used as a form of direct, targeted marketing \\[[@B13]\\]. Hip-hop music has a wide appeal and a varied fan base across different genders, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and nationalities (i.e. USA versus international countries). Endorsements by its celebrity music artists can introduce their youthful fan base (primarily under 30 years old and including many fans under the age of 18) to new tobacco products and smoking behavior. As such, exposure to a hip-hop music artist\\'s endorsement and promotion of a brand-specific small cigar product may be associated with young adults\\' small cigar smoking behaviors. In 2012, the Surgeon General\\'s report concluded that there is a causal association between exposure to smoking in the movies and youth smoking. The report also concludes that traditional advertising causes youth smoking \\[[@B14], [@B15]\\]. To our knowledge no study has examined the association between small cigar smoking behavior and exposure to a celebrity music artist\\'s advertisement and promotion of small cigars. We surveyed a random sample of young adult cigarette smokers who attended the Coachella festival in Indio, California, to assess their exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s endorsement and advertisement for Executive Branch small cigars. We focused on young adult cigarette smokers because extant evidence suggests that they may be considered at high risk for small cigar use \\[[@B6], [@B7], [@B16]\\]. We hypothesized that young adults who reported exposure to the artist\\'s small cigar advertisements, compared to those who did not report exposure, would have greater susceptibility or intention to smoke Executive Branch small cigars in the future. Our hypothesis is supported by ample evidence that has reported that exposure to cigarette smoking advertisements is associated with a susceptibility to smoke cigarettes \\[[@B17]--[@B20]\\]. Our rationale for use of intention to smoke small cigars is that it is a proximal predictor of smoking behavior \\[[@B21]\\] and is the most appropriate outcome to assess in a cross-sectional design.\n\n【4】2. Methods {#sec2}\n==========\n\n【5】2.1. Participants and Sampling Frame Construction {#sec2.1}\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Eligible participants were young adults, aged 18--35, who attended the Coachella festival and reported smoking at least one cigarette in the past 30 days. Approximately 85,000 concertgoers attended the festival per day over a three-day period \\[[@B22]\\]. According to a small survey of concertgoers (n = 238) posted on the festival\\'s webpage 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://www.coachella.com>)</u>, 31.5% were aged 25--29 years, 29.8% were aged 20--24 years, and 12.2% were aged 30--34 years old. Venue-based sampling procedures \\[[@B23]\\], in which the venue is the primary sampling unit, were used to select and survey eligible young adults at the festival.\n\n【7】To construct our sampling frame, the study team (K.S. and N.P.) utilized ethnographic sampling techniques to survey the area and identify locations within the festival where young adult smokers would gather or pass through. We identified three locations within the venue that fit this criterion: two \"beer gardens\" where festival attendees purchased and consumed alcoholic beverages and a smoking lounge. Each location was restricted to individuals aged 18 and older. Within the smoking lounge, we implemented area-based sampling and approached each individual for inclusion into the survey. For the two \"beer gardens,\" we identified young adults who were smoking cigarettes and randomly selected them by systematically intercepting every third cigarette smoking attendee that crossed a predetermined point.\n\n【8】2.2. Procedures {#sec2.2}\n---------------\n\n【9】The two study team members collected data from attendees over a two-day period from festival open to close. Upon interception, each team member approached festival attendees, gave them a short description about the study, and obtained verbal consent. If the attendee refused, the study team member noted their refusal and continued the process with the next random participant. Festival attendees who appeared to be visibly impaired by alcohol or other substances were not approached. The study team determined the eligibility status of festival attendees that were intercepted and who were willing to participate using a brief screener that verified the attendant\\'s age and cigarette smoking status. Attendees who did not meet the eligibility criteria were not surveyed.\n\n【10】Over the two-day data collection period, a total of 275 participants were approached. Of those 126 (45.8%) refusals were noted and 6 (2.2%) participants did not meet study eligibility criteria. Data were lost for 22 respondents due to a synchronization error between the server and the device and could not be retrieved. Thus survey responses were collected and retained for 121 young adults.\n\n【11】2.3. Study Sample Description {#sec2.3}\n-----------------------------\n\n【12】The majority of the 121 respondents were male (55.4%) and between the ages of 18 and 30 years old (88.0%). Regarding race/ethnicity, most respondents were white (75.2%) and lived in a country outside of the USA (52.4%). Overall, 70% reported past 30-day nonmentholated cigarette smoking, while 36.4% smoked menthol cigarettes.\n\n【13】2.4. Measures {#sec2.4}\n-------------\n\n【14】Survey items were entered in a survey software app, iSurveySoft 通用删除1(英):<u>(<http://www.isurveysoft.com>)</u>, and were uploaded to the handheld device (iPod touch 5th generation). The brief survey consisted of 21 items including demographic information, smoking history and current tobacco use, and exposure to small cigar advertisements.\n\n【15】### 2.4.1. Demographic Information {#sec2.4.1}\n\n【16】Respondents were asked about their age, gender, race/ethnicity, and country and state of residence. Age categories included \\<18 years old, 18--24 years old, 25--30 years old, and 31 years or older. Racial/ethnic categories included Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black/African-American, Hispanic, White, and other. Respondents were allowed to select one or more of the racial/ethnic categories.\n\n【17】### 2.4.2. Smoking-Related Variables {#sec2.4.2}\n\n【18】Respondents were asked if they had used any of the following tobacco products in the past 30 days: cigarettes, nonmentholated (i.e. Marlboro), mentholated cigarettes (i.e. Newports), cigars, and small cigars (e.g. Black & Mild, Swisher Sweets). The response categories for each included \"yes\" or \"no\". Brand names were provided for each tobacco product to help respondents better recognize the tobacco product \\[[@B24]\\]. Respondents were allowed to select one or more of the tobacco products if they used them in the past 30 days. Those who selected \"yes\" for the past 30-day use of any of the tobacco products were classified as current users.\n\n【19】### 2.4.3. Susceptibility to Smoke Small Cigars in the Future {#sec2.4.3}\n\n【20】Respondents were asked two questions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> if they intended to smoke Executive Branch small cigars and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> if they intended to smoke any other small cigar in the future. Response categories for both questions were \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\n【21】### 2.4.4. Exposure to Small Cigar Advertisements {#sec2.4.4}\n\n【22】We assessed festival attendees\\' exposure to 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the Snoop Dogg\\'s advertisements of the Executive Branch small cigars and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> other advertisements for other small cigar products (e.g. Swisher Sweets). Brand names were provided to assist the respondents with recall. Response categories for both questions were \"yes\" or \"no.\" If a respondent reported exposure to the product, they were asked to recall where they had seen the advertisement. Response categories included in a newspaper, in a magazine, on the Internet, on social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.), and other.\n\n【23】### 2.4.5. Urge to Smoke Small Cigars {#sec2.4.5}\n\n【24】Urge to smoke Executive Branch small cigars was assessed by asking respondents how much they wanted to smoke the product after exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s advertisement. The urge to smoke variable is similar to the one used by Sargent and colleagues \\[[@B25]\\]. A four-point response category was used to assess urge to smoke and included 1 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree. We assessed exposure to and urge to smoke other small cigar products with similar questionnaire items, by replacing the phrasing \"celebrity-endorsed small cigar product\" with \"other small cigar products.\"\n\n【25】2.5. Analysis {#sec2.5}\n-------------\n\n【26】Respondent demographics, smoking-related behaviors, advertising exposure, and urge to smoke variables were explored using descriptive statistics. We assessed the prevalence of the past 30-day small cigar smoking among our sample of young adult cigarette smokers. To understand the demographic and tobacco use characteristics of small cigar users in our sample, we conducted descriptive analyses comparing survey responses from those young adult cigarette smokers who reported past 30-day use of small cigars to those who did not report use. Descriptive statistics were also used to assess exposure to small cigar advertisements (celebrity-endorsed and other) and the urge to smoke small cigars after viewing the ads. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations between small cigar smokers and nonusers and the demographic, smoking-related, exposure, and urge to smoke variables. The dependent variable for the bivariate and multivariate analysis was small cigar smoking.\n\n【27】3. Results {#sec3}\n==========\n\n【28】3.1. Small Cigar Smoking Behavior and Demographic Characteristics {#sec3.1}\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Of the 121 young adult cigarette smokers in our sample, 25.6% reported smoking small cigars at least once in the past 30 days. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 1]</u>(#tab1){ref-type=\"table\"} shows the distribution of demographic characteristics by small cigar smoking status. The majority of small cigar smokers in our sample were male and aged 18--24 years old, though a sizeable proportion were aged 25--30 years old. Although most small cigar smokers in our sample were White, significantly more African-Americans reported smoking a small cigar in the past 30 days than not smoking a small cigar (P = 0.001). Notably, over half of the small cigar smokers in our sample lived in a country outside of the United States.\n\n【30】3.2. Concurrent Tobacco Use among Small Cigar Smokers {#sec3.2}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】Small cigar smokers (N = 31) in our sample reported concomitant use of other tobacco products. Over two-thirds (71.0%) of small cigar smokers reported smoking nonmentholated cigarettes in the past 30 days, while one-third (32.3%) reported using mentholated cigarettes. Small cigar smokers also reported current cigar smoking, with 19.4% reporting smoking cigars at least once in the past 30 days.\n\n【32】3.3. Exposure to Small Cigar Advertisements and Urge to Smoke {#sec3.3}\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Approximately 14.0% of respondents reported seeing Snoop Dogg\\'s advertisement of Executive Branch small cigars. The majority of respondents (33.3%) reportedly saw these advertisements on the Internet, while 27.8% reported seeing them on social media sites, such as Facebook or Instagram. Of the respondents who were exposed to the Executive Branch advertisements, 82.4% said seeing the advertisement made them want to try the product.\n\n【34】Approximately 60.2% of our respondents had been exposed to other small cigars advertisements. Respondents reported seeing advertisements for the other small cigars in magazines (35.1%), on the Internet (23.0%), in convenience stores or bodegas (12.4%), in smoke shops (6.6%), and on social media sites (5.4%). Over half of respondents (55.1%) wanted to try the small cigars after being exposed to the advertisements.\n\n【35】3.4. Susceptibility to Smoke Executive Branch Small Cigars {#sec3.4}\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】Forty-five percent (45.4%) of 121 young adult cigarette smokers in our sample reported an intention to smoke Executive Branch small cigars in the future; of these, 40.9% were current small cigar smokers. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess whether the demographic and smoking-related variables and the exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s Executive Branch small cigar advertisements were associated with susceptibility to smoke the product in the future. Though demographic variables were not associated with susceptibility, bivariate analyses found that past 30-day cigar (OR = 4.90, 95% CI 1.26, 19.13, P = 0.02) and small cigar (OR = 2.98, 95% CI 1.19, 7.42, P = 0.02) smoking were significantly associated with an intention to smoke Executive Branch small cigars. Exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s advertisements was marginally associated with intention to smoke Executive Branch small cigars (P = 0.08). Given the exploratory nature of our study, variables from the bivariate analysis that were significant at P \\< 0.10 were included in the multivariate analysis. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#tab2){ref-type=\"table\"} shows the results of our multivariate model. Respondents who reported current cigar smoking were five times more likely and those who smoked small cigars were three times more likely to be susceptible to smoking Executive Branch small cigars. Respondents who reported seeing the artist\\'s advertisement for Executive Branch small cigars were three times more likely to be susceptible to smoking those small cigars than those who were not exposed to the advertisement.\n\n【37】3.5. Susceptibility to Smoke Other Small Cigars in the Future {#sec3.5}\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】Over half (53.7%) of our respondents intended to smoke other small cigars in the future; 41.5% were already current small cigar smokers. Bivariate analyses found that past 30-day cigarette (P = 0.06), cigar (OR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.00, 14.00, P \\< 0.05), and small cigar smoking (OR = 16.34, 95% CI 3.65, 73.18, P \\< 0.001) were significantly associated and exposure to other small cigar advertisements (P = 0.06) was marginally associated with the susceptibility to smoke other small cigars. 通用删除8(英):<u>[Table 2]</u>(#tab2){ref-type=\"table\"} shows the results of our multivariate model for susceptibility to other small cigars. Past 30-day cigar and small cigar smoking were significantly associated with susceptibility to smoke small cigars in the future. Exposure to other small cigar advertisements was not significantly associated with susceptibility to smoke other small cigar products, however.\n\n【39】4. Discussion {#sec4}\n=============\n\n【40】Small cigar smoking is a growing public health concern among young adults, particularly for those with a history of tobacco use. Among our sample of young adult cigarette smokers, over 25% concurrently smoked small cigars in the past 30 days. Our finding is consistent with that of prior studies \\[[@B6], [@B7]\\]. Concurrent use of both products is a public health concern, as it may increase young adults\\' risk for developing nicotine dependence \\[[@B2], [@B26]\\], may lead to an escalation of tobacco use, and may make it difficult to quit smoking and achieve long-term abstinence.\n\n【41】Our preliminary findings suggest that exposure to small cigar advertisements may explain, in part, young adults\\' awareness of small cigars. Over 60% of our respondents reported exposure to other small cigar advertisements, and 14% reported exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s Executive Branch small cigar advertisement. Although traditional outlets such as magazines and convenience stores were also sources of advertisement exposure, respondents reported exposure to small cigar advertisements on the Internet, particularly on social media sites. This is consistent with growing body of evidence that has found protobacco images and references \\[[@B27]--[@B29]\\], in particular small cigar smoking \\[[@B12], [@B30]\\] on Internet social media sites.\n\n【42】We have little evidence to support the claim that the tobacco industry paid for or supported the hip-hop artist\\'s endorsement of this small cigar product. However, the Federal Trade Commission Report of 1999 documented the cigar industry\\'s payments to celebrities for their endorsements, appearances, and cigar product placements. It is well documented that cigarette smoking has been promoted through rap and hip-hop music \\[[@B15], [@B31]\\] and through music-themed campaigns (i.e. the Kool Mixx campaign by Brown & Williamson \\[[@B13]\\], and concerts and festivals such as Camel\\'s \"Smooth Moves\" and \"Speakeasy\" tours) \\[[@B32]\\]. Rap and hip-hop music genres have a wide reach. Hip-hop artists appeal to individuals across gender, nationalities (USA versus international), racial/ethnic backgrounds and ages (although as noted previously, to youth in particular). These artists are often viewed as trendsetters. Taken together, the artists\\' endorsement of a cigar product may establish brand loyalty and influence the smoking behaviors of large segments of their fans. Perhaps the use of celebrity rap and hip-hop artists to promote small cigar products and smoking is a strategy that is being used by the cigar industry to circumvent tobacco advertising restrictions.\n\n【43】Exposure to the hip-hop artist\\'s small cigar advertisements appeared to influence small cigar smoking susceptibility among the young adult cigarette smokers in our sample. Those who reported exposure to the artist\\'s Executive Branch small cigar advertisements were three times more likely to intend to smoke these small cigars in the future. Notably, over 40% of those who reported an intention to use the Executive Branch small cigars were already past 30-day small cigar smokers. Although not previously documented for music entertainment, our findings are consistent with studies that found an association between exposure to prosmoking depictions in films and smoking behavior among adolescents \\[[@B15]\\]. Future studies that examine the association between exposure to small cigar advertisements and intention to smoke among other young adult smoking samples are needed to substantiate our findings.\n\n【44】An important limitation of this study is its generalizability, as the survey sample largely consisted of a sample of young adult festival attendees in the United States. Findings from this study may not generalize to other young adult populations. While we broadly assessed other small cigars, this study specifically examined exposure to Snoop Dogg\\'s advertisements and promotions of Executive Branch small cigars. As such, our findings may not generalize to other small cigar brands. We used brand-specific items to estimate small cigar use among our respondents. Though these items may estimate small cigar use more accurately \\[[@B24]\\], their use may also limit comparability to studies that used other measures to capture small cigar use (i.e. single \"catch all\" question assessing cigar product use). Finally, the items that assessed small cigar use in our study did not specifically ask if participants were smoking tobacco in the small cigar. Despite the use of this item to measure small cigar smoking in other studies \\[[@B8]\\], its use may bias findings because it may also capture use of marijuana. Thus, our findings should be interpreted with caution.\n\n【45】4.1. Conclusion {#sec4.1}\n---------------\n\n【46】Our study documented young adult smokers\\' exposure to a celebrity hip-hop artist\\'s advertising of Executive Branch small cigars. We also provided preliminary evidence of an association between exposure to a celebrity artist\\'s small cigar promotion and susceptibility to smoke the brand-specific small cigar. Our findings indicate that celebrity endorsement is a potentially important source of marketing small cigar products to young adults and should be monitored.\n\n【47】The authors declare that they have

Subjects were four 14-16-year-old white and Hispanic males and females whose parents or teachers had referred them for 5-12 months of behavioral family therapy. The first subject received no booster sessions; after the typical decrease in substance use and academic problems at the end of treatment, his problems recurred and subsequently worsened during follow-up. The other three subjects responded similarly to behavioral family therapy, but this was followed by 6 months of booster sessions, leading to a second decrease in substance use and academic problems. Improvement was maintained throughout follow-up. These results suggest that booster sessions can prevent the recurrences of adolescent problem behavior that often follow treatment termination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

We have established the standardized methodology including preparation of glycosylated derivatives and construction of a platform for tracing the molecules in vivo at first. Combined use of an aminooxy-terminated thiol derivative and a phosphorylcholine (PC) derivative provides quantum dots (QDs) with novel functions for the chemical ligation of ketone-functionalized compounds and the prevention of nonspecific protein adsorption concurrently. In order to track the derivatives in vivo, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of QDs displaying various simple sugars (glyco-PC-QDs) after administration into the tail vein of the mouse can be performed. It has revealed that distinct long-term delocalization over 2 h can be observed depending on the species of glycans ligated to PC-QDs at least in the liver. Until today we have performed live animal imaging utilizing various kinds of sialyl glyco-PC-QDs. They are still retained stably in whole body after 2 h while they showed significantly different in vivo dynamics in the tissue distribution, suggesting that structure/sequence of the neighboring sugar residues in the individual sialyl oligosaccharides might influence the final organ-specific distribution, which should be equivalent to the distribution of sialic acid-recognizing lectins. Here we describe a standardized protocol using ligand-displayed PC-QDs for live cell/animal imaging by versatile NIR fluorescence photometry without influence of size-dependent accumulation/excretion pathway for nanoparticles (e.g. viruses)>10 nm in hydrodynamic diameter by the liver.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

The primary objective of this review was to highlight a portion of these recent studies to demonstrate how imaging tools can be used to understand military-associated brain injury. We focus here on the phenomenon of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) given its high prevalence in the Veteran population and current recognition of the need to better understand the clinical implications of this trauma. This is intended to provide readers with an initial exposure to the field of neuroimaging of mTBI with a brief introduction to the concept of traumatic brain injury, followed by a summary of the major imaging techniques that have been applied to the study of mTBI. Taken together, the collection of studies reviewed demonstrates a clear role for neuroimaging towards understanding the various neural consequences of mTBI as well as the clinical complications of such brain changes. This information must be considered in the larger context of research into mTBI, including the potentially unique nature of blast exposure and the long-term consequences of mTBI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

This work reports the mutagenicity of oxanine as well as oxanine DNA glycosylase (ODG) activities in mammalian systems. Using human DNA polymerase beta, deoxyoxanosine triphosphate is only incorporated opposite cytosine (Cyt). When an oxanine base is in a DNA template, Cyt is efficiently incorporated opposite the template oxanine; however, adenine and thymine are also incorporated opposite Oxa with an efficiency approximately 80% of a Cyt/Oxa (C/O) base pair. Guanine is incorporated opposite Oxa with the least efficiency, 16% compared with cytosine. ODG activity was detected in several mammalian cell extracts. Among the known human DNA glycosylases tested, human alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) shows ODG activity, whereas hOGG1, hNEIL1, or hNEIL2 did not. ODG activity was detected in spleen cell extracts of wild type age-matched mice, but little activity was observed in that of Aag knock-out mice, confirming that the ODG activity is intrinsic to AAG. Human AAG can excise Oxa from all four Oxa-containing double-stranded base pairs, Cyt/Oxa, Thy/Oxa, Ade/Oxa, and Gua/Oxa, with no preference to base pairing. Surprisingly, AAG can remove Oxa from single-stranded Oxa-containing DNA as well. Indeed, AAG can also remove 1,N通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>-ethenoadenine from single-stranded DNA. This study extends the deaminated base glycosylase activities of AAG to oxanine; thus, AAG is a mammalian enzyme that can act on all three purine deamination bases, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and oxanine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}

However, the factors triggering its growth are not yet well understood. This knowledge is needed to develop strategies to minimize the risk of the spread of Legionnaires' disease that originates in these systems. In the present study, L. pneumophila multiplied exponentially at 35 °C in activated sludge, but lower temperatures (24 °C and 15 °C) did not favour the growth of the pathogen despite the presence of its protozoan hosts (free-living amoeba and ciliates). L. non-pneumophila species, which are adapted to low temperature, prevailed at 15 °C. Legionella was found dispersed in the activated sludge, forming clusters of different sizes and also inside protozoa. This study shows that temperature is a key parameter triggering the growth of L. pneumophila in activated sludge. The detection of infected protozoa suggests that these are important vehicles for the multiplication of Legionella. However, in this study it was not possible to exclude the growth of Legionella directly on the substrate or on the activated sludge matrix.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "journal-pile", "batch_name": "20240924", "version": "version0"}
