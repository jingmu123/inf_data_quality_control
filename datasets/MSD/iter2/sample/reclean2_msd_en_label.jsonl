success rates exceed 85% (1 References Posterior epistaxis (nasal hemorrhage) can often be controlled with balloon tamponade.Epistaxis may be due to bleeding from the anterior or posterior nasal passageEndovascular SPA embolization; reported success rate 88% (2 References Posterior epistaxis (nasal hemorrhage) can often be controlled with balloon tamponade.Epistaxis may be due to bleeding from the anterior or posterior nasal passage.Endoscopic SPA ligation is done by an otolaryngologist and has a lower risk of major complications (eg, stroke, blindness) than endovascular SPA embolization and may be more appropriate for patients who can safely tolerate general anesthesia or if the embolization procedure is not readily available.Endovascular SPA embolization is done by an interventional radiologist under local anesthesia and may be better for patients with multiple comorbidities that preclude safe general anesthesia, for those on anticoagulant therapy, and for patients who present with bleeding after previously having had endoscopic SPA ligation.Relevant Anatomy Severe or intractable posterior epistaxis often stems from the sphenopalatine artery or its proximal branches.Positioning The patient should sit upright in the sniffing position with head extended, preferably in an ENT specialist's chair.The patient's occiput should be supported to prevent sudden backward movement.The patient's nose should be level with the physician's eyes.The patient should hold an emesis basin to collect any continued bleeding or emesis of swallowed blood.Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Initial steps: Start IV and send any laboratory studies needed.Place patient on cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter.Have the patient blow the nose to remove clots, or suction the nasal passageway gently.To help identify the bleeding site (and possibly stop the bleeding), apply a vasoconstrictor/anesthetic mixture: Place about 3 mL of 4% cocaine solution or 4% lidocaine with oxymetazoline in a small medicine cup and soak 2 or 3 cotton pledgets with the solution and insert them into the nose, stacked vertically (or spray in a topical vasoconstrictor such as oxymetazoline and place pledgets containing only topical anesthetic).Leave the topical drugs in place for 10 to 15 minutes to stop or reduce the bleeding, provide anesthesia, and reduce mucosal swelling.Insert a nasal speculum with your index finger resting against the patient's nose or cheek and the handle parallel to the floor (so the blades open vertically).Slowly open the speculum and examine the nose using a bright headlamp or head mirror, which leaves one hand free to manipulate suction or an instrument.If no bleeding site is visible in the anterior nose, use a tongue depressor and look into the oropharynx.Continued bleeding suggests a posterior source.Place balloon catheter to tamponade active posterior bleeding: Give IV analgesia (eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/kg fentanyl to a maximum dose of 100 mcg; consider lower doses in those older than age 65 and titrate to effect).Insert the balloon catheter into the nose, and gently advance it parallel to the floor of the nasal cavity.Advance the catheter until the tip can be seen in the oropharynx when looking through the mouth.Follow inflation instructions for any commercial epistaxis balloon.If using a Foley catheter, partially inflate the balloon with 5 to 7 mL of water.Gently pull the catheter anteriorly until it is firmly seated in the posterior nasal cavity.Then slowly add another 5 to 7 mL of water.If pain or inferior displacement of the soft palate occurs, deflate the balloon until the pain resolves or the soft palate is no longer displaced.While maintaining traction on the catheter, place anterior nasal packing How To Treat Anterior Epistaxis With Tamponade Epistaxis (nasal hemorrhage) can often be controlled by tamponade of the involved area.Epistaxis may be due to bleeding from the anterior or posterior nasal passage.Consider packing the contralateral anterior nasal cavity to avoid septal deviation.Wrap a piece of gauze around the catheter at the naris to protect the nasal ala and place a clamp on the catheter to prevent the balloon from sliding back out of the posterior nasal cavity.If using a dual-balloon catheter, first inflate the posterior balloon, using the same general technique as for the single balloon catheter.Then inflate the anterior balloon (typically with 30 mL).Anterior nasal packing with layered gauze is unnecessary when using a dual-balloon catheter.How To Treat Nosebleeds (Epistaxis) VIDEO Aftercare Admit all patients with posterior balloon packing.Manage hypoxemia as required.Avoid use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 days post-treatment.Give an antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg orally twice a day for 7 to 10 days) to prevent sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactionsIntroduction to Middle Ear and Tympanic Membrane Disorders Middle ear disorders may be secondary to infection, eustachian tube obstruction, or trauma.Deflate the balloon and remove the catheter after 48 to 72 hours.Warnings and Common Errors Do not open the nasal speculum laterally or use in an unsupported manner.(Brace a finger of the hand holding the speculum on the patient's cheek or nose.) Overfilling the catheter balloon can cause significant pain.Tips and Tricks Elevating the patient's chair to eye height is easier on the practitioner's back than bending down.Always consult an otolaryngologist after placement of a posterior nasal pack to ensure follow-up.After placement of the posterior pack, look through the mouth to make sure that there is no further bleeding down the throat.If there is bleeding, put more fluid into the catheter balloon.If this fails to control bleeding, consult an otolaryngologist immediately.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9143, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 In the United States, vaginal infections are one of the most common reasons women see their doctor, accounting for millions of visits each year.Vaginal infections are caused by microorganisms, but women can take precautions, such as wearing loose, absorbent underwear, to reduce their risk of getting infections.Infections usually cause a discharge with itching, redness, and sometimes burning and soreness.Doctors examine a sample of fluids from the vagina or cervix to check for microorganisms that can cause infections.Treatment depends on the cause.Vaginal infections include Bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is a vaginal infection that occurs when the balance of bacteria in the vagina is altered.Trichomonas vaginitis is usually sexually transmitted.However, these symptoms do not necessarily indicate an infection.Instead, they may result from other conditions that affect the vagina.For example, chemicals or other materials (such as hygiene products, bubble bath, laundry detergents, contraceptive foams and jellies, and synthetic underwear) can irritate the vagina and cause a discharge and discomfort.The inflammation that results is called noninfectious (inflammatory) vaginitis.The Vagina VIDEO A vaginal discharge may be caused by a disorder that affects other reproductive organs, rather than the vagina.For example, a discharge can result from certain sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydial infection Chlamydia and Other Nongonococcal Infections Chlamydial infections include sexually transmitted infections of the urethra, cervix, and rectum that are caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis.The bacteria that cause these diseases can spread from the vagina to the cervix (the lower, narrow part of the uterus that opens into the vagina) and the uterus, causing pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the upper female reproductive organs (the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries).Genital herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals.Internal Female Genital Organs Causes of Vaginal Infections Vaginal infections may be caused by bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms.Certain conditions make infection more likely: Reduced acidity (increased pH) in the vagina: When acidity in the vagina is reduced, the number of protective bacteria (lactobacilli) that normally live in the vagina decreases, and the number of bacteria that can cause infection increases, sometimes resulting in bacterial vaginosis Causes Bacterial vaginosis is a vaginal infection that occurs when the balance of bacteria in the vagina is altered.Poor hygiene: When the genital area is not kept clean, the number of bacteria increases, making bacterial infections more likely.Tight, nonabsorbent underwear: This type of underwear may trap moisture, which encourages the growth of bacteria and yeast.Tissue damage: If tissues in the pelvis are damaged, the body’s natural defenses are weakened.Damage can result from tumors, surgery, radiation therapy, or structural abnormalities such as birth defects or fistulas.Fistulas are abnormal connections between organs, which may, for example, allow the intestine’s contents (which include bacteria) to enter the vagina.Irritation: Irritation of vaginal tissues can lead to cracks or sores, which provide access to the bloodstream for bacteria and yeast.Some specific causes of vaginal infections are more common among certain age groups.Children In children, vaginal infections are usually caused by bacteria from the anus.These bacteria may be moved to the vagina when girls, particularly those aged 2 to 6 years, wipe from back to front or do not adequately clean the genital area after bowel movements.Fingering the genital area, particularly if girls do not wash their hands after bowel movements, may also move these bacteria to the vagina.Fingering is often a response to itching.Putting an object (such as a toy or toilet tissue) in the vagina is another common cause of vaginal infections in children. Children may get a vaginal infection when they move bacteria from the anus to the vagina by wiping from back to front.Women of childbearing age Hormonal changes shortly before and during menstrual periods or during pregnancy can reduce acidity in the vagina, as can frequent douching, use of spermicides, and semen.Reduced acidity encourages the growth of bacteria that cause disease.Leaving tampons in too long can lead to infection, possibly because tampons provide a warm, moist environment where bacteria can thrive and because they can irritate the vagina. Douching can often remove normal, protective bacteria from the vagina, increasing the risk of infection.Postmenopausal women After menopause, estrogen levels decrease.As a result, tissues in the vagina become thinner, drier, and more fragile.Cracks or sores may form, providing access for bacteria or yeast.Also, acidity in the vagina decreases, increasing the risk of infection.Women who have urinary incontinence Urinary Incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine.Irritation from urine and stool can lead to infection.Women of all ages At any age, conditions that increase the risk of getting a vaginal infection include A fistula (abnormal connection) between the intestine and genital tract, which allows bacteria from the intestine to enter the genital tract Pelvic radiation or tumors, which break down tissue and thus impair the body's normal defenses against infection Conditions other than infections cause up to 30% of cases of vaginitis.For example, vaginitis may result from hypersensitivity to or irritation from hygiene sprays or perfumes, menstrual pads, laundry soaps, bleaches, fabric softeners, fabric dyes, synthetic fibers, bathwater additives, toilet tissue, or, occasionally, spermicides, vaginal lubricants or creams, latex condoms, or contraceptive rings or diaphragms.Table Symptoms of Vaginal Infections Typically, vaginal infections cause a vaginal discharge.This discharge differs from a normal one because it is usually accompanied by itching, redness, and sometimes burning or soreness in the genital area.A discharge may have a fishy odor.The appearance and amount of the discharge tend to vary depending on the cause.However, different disorders sometimes cause similar discharges.Itching may interfere with sleep.Some infections can make sexual intercourse painful and make urination painful and more frequent.Rarely, the folds of skin around the vaginal and urethral openings become stuck together.However, sometimes symptoms are mild or do not occur.Diagnosis of Vaginal Infections A doctor's evaluation Examination and testing of sample of the discharge and/or fluid from the cervix Girls or women who have a vaginal discharge with itching or who have other vaginal symptoms, such as redness, burning, soreness, or pain during sexual intercourse, should see a doctor.Medical history To determine the cause, the doctor asks questions about the discharge (if present), about possible causes of the symptoms, and about hygiene.For example, a woman may be asked whether she is sexually active and, if so, whether she has more than one partner.This information helps the doctor determine whether other people require treatment.While examining the vagina, the doctor takes a sample of the discharge (if present) with a cotton-tipped swab.The sample is examined under a microscope.With information from this examination, the doctor can usually determine whether the cause is bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginitis, or a yeast infection.Usually, the doctor also uses a swab to take a sample of fluid from the cervix.The sample is tested for sexually transmitted infections.To determine whether there are other infections in the pelvis, the doctor checks the uterus and ovaries by inserting the index and middle fingers of one gloved hand into the vagina and pressing on the outside of the lower abdomen with the other hand.If this maneuver causes substantial pain or if a fever is present, other infections may be present.Prevention of Vaginal Infections Prevention includes the following: Keeping the genital area clean and dry to help prevent infections (washing every day with a mild, nonscented soap, such as glycerin soap, and rinsing and drying thoroughly are recommended) Wiping from front to back after urinating or defecating to prevent bacteria from the anus from being moved to the vagina Teaching young girls good hygiene Wearing loose, absorbent clothing, such as cotton or cotton-lined underpants, to allow air to circulate and to help keep the genital area dry Practicing safe sex and limiting the number of sex partners Douching frequently and using medicated douches are discouraged.Douching can remove normal, protective bacteria from the vagina and reduce the acidity of the vagina, making infections, including pelvic inflammatory disease, more likely.Treatment of Vaginal Infections Good hygiene Use of water or ice to relieve symptoms If needed, drugs to relieve itching Measures used for prevention, such as keeping the genital area clean and dry, also help treat infections.Strong or scented soaps and unnecessary topical products (such as feminine hygiene sprays) should be avoided.Occasionally placing ice packs on the genital area, applying cool compresses, or sitting in a cool sitz bath (with or without baking soda or Epsom salts) may reduce soreness and itching.A sitz bath is taken in the sitting position with the water covering only the genital and rectal area.Flushing the genital area with lukewarm water squeezed from a water bottle may also relieve soreness and itching.If these measures do not relieve symptoms, drugs may be needed.Antihistamines taken by mouth help relieve itching.They also cause drowsiness and may be useful if symptoms interfere with sleep.Specific treatment depends on the cause.For example, infections (such as bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is a vaginal infection that occurs when the balance of bacteria in the vagina is altered.Trichomonas

{"text": "【0】 A hypertensive emergency is a particularly severe, sudden form of high blood pressure that can damage one or more vital organs. is persistently high pressure in the arteries.Usually, high blood pressure in children, as in adults, has no identifiable cause.Hypertensive emergencies occur when blood pressure rapidly increases.In children, the first symptoms of a hypertensive emergency are typically a headache, listlessness, confusion, and seizures and, in infants, irritability.Doctors diagnose hypertensive emergency by measuring blood pressure and doing tests for organ damage, such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and blood and urine tests.Treatment of hypertensive emergencies involves admitting children to an intensive care unit and giving drugs by vein to lower blood pressure as soon as possible.When blood pressure is checked, two values are recorded.The higher value reflects the highest pressure in the arteries, which is reached when the heart contracts (during systole).The lower value reflects the lowest pressure in the arteries, which is reached just before the heart begins to contract again (during diastole).Blood pressure is written as systolic pressure/diastolic pressure—for example, 120/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury), referred to as 120 over 80.A hypertensive emergency is a particularly severe, sudden form of high blood pressure.Diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is usually over 100 mm Hg, and there is evidence of progressive damage in one or more vital organs (typically the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys).Children may have a variety of symptoms.Hypertensive emergencies are relatively rare in children.They may develop in children who have or have not been previously diagnosed with high blood pressure.Hypertensive emergencies usually occur when blood pressure rapidly increases.What causes the rapid increase varies by age.The most common causes are During infancy: Birth defects of the kidneys Kidney Defects There are several different birth defects that affect the kidneys (the two organs that filter waste from the blood to make urine).The clot can damage the kidney.Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.A hypertensive urgency is severe high blood pressure that has not yet caused enough organ damage to result in symptoms.Symptoms of Hypertensive Emergencies in Children Blood pressure is very high, typically at a stage 2 (severe) high blood pressure level or higher (140/90 or higher).In children, the first symptoms of a hypertensive emergency are typically a headache, listlessness (lethargy), confusion, seizures, and, in infants, irritability.Children may go into a coma.Children may have a rapid heart rate, chest pain, shortness of breath, and/or swollen ankles.Vision may be impaired.Diagnosis of Hypertensive Emergencies in Children Blood pressure measurement Tests to evaluate organ damage During a suspected hypertensive emergency, doctors use an oscillometer to measure blood pressure Diagnosis High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries.Usually, high blood pressure in children, as in adults, has no identifiable cause.The oscillometer records blood pressure automatically and quickly, which helps with the measuring that is needed (every 2 to 3 minutes).Blood pressure is measured again using a sphygmomanometer Measuring Blood Pressure and a stethoscope to confirm the measurement.When possible, doctors do intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, which involves putting a small plastic tube inside an artery and connecting it to a pressure monitor.These arterial pressure monitors measure blood pressure continuously and are also more accurate than other devices.Doctors take a medical history Medical History The medical history and physical examination can suggest that a person has a heart or blood vessel disorder that requires additional testing for accurate diagnosis.A thorough physical examination Physical Examination The medical history and physical examination can suggest that a person has a heart or blood vessel disorder that requires additional testing for accurate diagnosis.Tests are also done to determine whether vital organs are damaged and, if so, how much damage is present.Tests include Electrocardiography (ECG), chest x-ray, and, if possible, an echocardiography to check for heart disorders Urinalysis to screen for kidney abnormalities Blood tests to check for kidney damage or hormonal abnormalities Complete blood count to check for abnormal numbers of blood cells, particularly platelets (which help blood clot) Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to check for a mass or hemorrhage in the brain and to rule out other possible causes of symptoms related to the brain Drug and pregnancy tests in adolescents If the child's high blood pressure has not previously been diagnosed or evaluated, other testing to determine the cause of the high blood pressure Diagnosis High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries.Usually, high blood pressure in children, as in adults, has no identifiable cause.Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies in Children For hypertensive emergencies, admission to an intensive care unit and intravenous drugs to lower blood pressure For hypertensive urgencies, admission to an emergency department or hospital and oral drugs to lower blood pressure (occasionally intravenous drugs are needed) Children with a hypertensive emergency are rapidly admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) Types of units People who need specific types of care may be put in special care units.Intensive care units (ICUs) are for people who are seriously ill.There, drugs to lower blood pressure (antihypertensive drugs) can be given by vein (intravenously) as soon as possible.The goal of treatment of hypertensive emergencies is to lower blood pressure enough to eliminate the risk of life-threatening symptoms and to stop further damage to vital organs.For hypertensive emergencies, the preferred intravenous drugs are labetalol and nicardipine.If the preferred drugs cannot be used or do not work, sodium nitroprusside, hydralazine, and esmolol are other intravenous drugs that may be used.Once blood pressure has been lowered, doctors can give children drugs by mouth (orally).Children with a hypertensive urgency (severe hypertension but no symptoms and no organ problems) also are admitted to a hospital or emergency department and are evaluated immediately, but blood pressure does not need to be lowered as quickly as for a hypertensive emergency.These children are typically given drugs by mouth.Occasionally, intravenous drugs are needed.For hypertensive urgencies, clonidine, hydralazine, isradipine, or minoxidil is given by mouth.If possible, children with either disorder should be treated by a doctor or specialist experienced in managing severe high blood pressure in children.Table", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3888, "dataset":

{"text": "【0】 Fluid that leaks from one or both nipples is called nipple discharge.Each breast has several (15 to 20) milk ducts.A discharge can come from one or more of these ducts. or cancerous (malignant).Most are noncancerous and not life threatening.Often, they do not require treatment.Nipple discharge can occur normally during the last weeks of pregnancy and after childbirth when breast milk is produced.A nipple discharge can also be caused by breast stimulation in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, especially during the reproductive years.However, a nipple discharge in men is always abnormal.A normal nipple discharge is usually a thin, cloudy, whitish, or almost clear fluid.However, the discharge may be other colors, such as gray, green, yellow, or brown.A bloody discharge is abnormal.Abnormal discharges vary in appearance depending on the cause.An abnormal discharge may be accompanied by other abnormalities, such as dimpled skin, swelling, redness, crusting, sores, and an inverted (retracted) nipple.(A nipple is inverted if it pulls inward and does not return to its normal position when it is stimulated.) If a discharge from only one breast occurs on its own (without any stimulation of the nipple), it is considered abnormal.Causes of Nipple Discharge Several disorders can cause an abnormal discharge.A discharge from one milk duct or from one breast is likely to be caused by a problem with that breast, such as a noncancerous (benign) tumor or, less commonly, a cancerous (malignant) breast tumor Breast Cancer Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollably.A discharge from both breasts or from several milk ducts in one breast is more likely to be caused by a problem outside the breast, such as a hormonal disorder or use of certain drugs.Common causes of a nipple discharge Usually, the cause is a benign disorder of the milk ducts, such as the following: A benign tumor in a milk duct (intraductal papilloma) Dilated milk ducts (mammary duct ectasia) Fibrocystic changes Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast Fibrocystic changes of the breast (formerly called fibrocystic breast disease) include breast pain, cysts, and lumpiness that are not due to cancer.Rarely, breast infections lead to a breast abscess (a collection of pus in the breast).It is also the most common cause of a bloody nipple discharge when there is no lump in the breast.Less common causes of a nipple discharge Certain disorders stimulate the production of breast milk in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding .In most of these disorders, the level of prolactin (a hormone that stimulates production of breast milk) is elevated.Taking certain drugs can have the same effect.Cancer causes fewer than 10% of cases.Evaluation of Nipple Discharge Warning signs Nipple discharge is a cause for concern when it Is accompanied by a lump that can be felt Is bloody or pink Comes from only one breast Occurs without the nipple's being squeezed or stimulated by other means (when it occurs spontaneously) Occurs in women aged 40 or older Occurs in a boy or man When to see a doctor If a nipple discharge continues for more than one menstrual cycle or if any of the warning signs are present, women (or men) should see a doctor.Delay of a week or so is not harmful unless there are signs of infection such as redness, swelling, and/or a discharge of pus.Women with such symptoms should see a doctor within 1 or 2 days.What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the woman's symptoms and medical history.Doctors then do a physical examination.What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the discharge and the tests that may need to be done .To help identify the cause, doctors ask about the discharge and about other symptoms that may suggest possible causes.They ask Whether the discharge comes from one or both breasts What the discharge's color is How long it has lasted Whether it is spontaneous or occurs only when the nipple is stimulated Whether a lump Breast Lumps A breast lump (mass) is a thickening or bump that feels different from surrounding breast tissue.A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor.Breast pain may occur in one or both breasts. Doctors examine the breast, looking for abnormalities, including lumps Warning signs A breast lump (mass) is a thickening or bump that feels different from surrounding breast tissue.A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor.If the discharge does not occur spontaneously, the area around the nipples is gently pressed to try to stimulate a discharge.Doctors also feel the lymph nodes in the armpits and above the collarbone to check for enlarged lymph nodes.Table Testing If doctors suspect that a hormonal disorder is the cause, blood tests are done to measure the levels of prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone.If a pituitary or brain disorder is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of the head is done.If the discharge is not obviously bloody, it is analyzed to determine whether it contains small amounts of blood.If blood is present, a sample of the discharge is examined under a microscope (called cytology) to look for cancer cells.If a lump can be felt, ultrasonography or mammography is done.Testing A breast lump (mass) is a thickening or bump that feels different from surrounding breast tissue.A lump may be discovered by a woman or during a routine physical examination by a doctor.Cysts are drained (by aspiration), and the fluid is tested.If the fluid is bloody, it is checked for cancer cells.If lumps are solid, mammography is done, followed by a biopsy.When there is no lump but cancer is still suspected or when other test results are unclear, mammography is done.If test results after aspiration, ultrasonography, or mammography are abnormal, a biopsy is done.If ultrasonography and mammography do not identify a cause and the discharge occurs spontaneously and comes from one milk duct, doctors usually do a special type of mammogram (called a ductogram, or galactogram).For this procedure, a contrast agent (which helps make images clearer) is injected into the duct, and images are taken, just as for a regular mammogram.This test can help rule out or identify cancer.If no lump can be felt and the mammogram is normal, cancer is highly unlikely.Sometimes a specific cause cannot be identified.If women have any of the following, they should see a doctor who is experienced in managing breast disorders: A lump in the breast A bloody or pink discharge A spontaneous discharge from one breast An abnormality previously detected by mammography or ultrasonography Treatment of Nipple Discharge If a disorder is identified, it is treated.If a noncancerous tumor or disorder is causing a discharge from one breast, the duct that the discharge is coming from may be removed.This procedure requires only a local anesthetic and does not require an overnight stay in the hospital.Key Points Usually, the cause of nipple discharge is not cancer.If the discharge comes from both breasts or from several milk ducts and is not bloody or pink, the cause is usually a noncancerous hormonal disorder.If the discharge comes from only one breast and is bloody or pink, cancer is possible, especially in women aged 40 or older.Whether blood tests, imaging (such as ultrasonography), or both, are done depends on the suspected cause.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3853, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Abdominal pain is common and often inconsequential.Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is almost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease.It may be the sole indicator of the need for surgery and must be attended to swiftly: Gangrene and perforation of the gut Acute Perforation of the Gastrointestinal Tract Any part of the gastrointestinal tract may become perforated, releasing gastric or intestinal contents into the peritoneal space.Causes vary.Abdominal pain is of particular concern in patients who are very young or very old and those who have HIV infection or are taking immunosuppressants (including corticosteroids).Textbook descriptions of abdominal pain have limitations because people react to pain differently.Some, particularly older people, are stoic, whereas others exaggerate their symptoms.Infants, young children, and some older people may have difficulty localizing the pain.The term acute abdomen refers to abdominal symptoms and signs of such severity or concern that disorders requiring surgery should be considered.Pathophysiology of Acute Abdominal Pain Visceral pain comes from the abdominal viscera, which are innervated by autonomic nerve fibers and respond mainly to the sensations of distention and muscular contraction—not to cutting, tearing, or local irritation.Visceral pain is typically vague, dull, and nauseating.It is poorly localized and tends to be referred to areas corresponding to the embryonic origin of the affected structure.Foregut structures (stomach, duodenum, liver, and pancreas) cause upper abdominal pain.Midgut structures (small bowel, proximal colon, and appendix) cause periumbilical pain.Hindgut structures (distal colon and genitourinary tract) cause lower abdominal pain.Somatic pain comes from the parietal peritoneum, which is innervated by somatic nerves, which respond to irritation from infectious, chemical, or other inflammatory processes.Somatic pain is sharp and well localized.Referred pain is pain perceived distant from its source and results from convergence of nerve fibers at the spinal cord.Common examples of referred pain are scapular pain due to biliary colic, groin pain due to renal colic, and shoulder pain due to blood or infection irritating the diaphragm.Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal cavity.The most serious cause is perforation of the gastrointestinal tract Acute Perforation of the Gastrointestinal Tract Any part of the gastrointestinal tract may become perforated, releasing gastric or intestinal contents into the peritoneal space.Causes vary.Peritonitis can also result from any abdominal condition that causes marked inflammation (eg, appendicitis is acute inflammation of the vermiform appendix, typically resulting in abdominal pain, anorexia, and abdominal tendernessColonic Diverticulitis is inflammation with or without infection of a diverticulum, which can result in phlegmon of the bowel wall, peritonitis, perforation, fistula, or abscessIntestinal Obstruction Intestinal obstruction is significant mechanical impairment or complete arrest of the passage of contents through the intestine due to pathology that causes blockage of the bowelOverview of Pancreatitis is classified as either acute or chronic.Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both clinically and histologicallyPelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occurAcute Mesenteric Ischemia Acute mesenteric ischemia is interruption of intestinal blood flow by embolism, thrombosis, or a low-flow state.It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction.Barium causes severe caking and peritonitis and should never be given to a patient with suspected gastrointestinal tract perforation.However, water-soluble contrast agents can be safely used.Peritoneosystemic shunts, drains, and dialysis catheters in the peritoneal cavity predispose a patient to infectious peritonitis, as does ascitic fluid.Rarely, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs, in which the peritoneal cavity is infected by bloodborne bacteria.Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs primarily in patients with cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.The most common cause is portal hypertension.Symptoms usually result from abdominal distention.Peritonitis causes fluid to shift into the peritoneal cavity and bowel, leading to severe dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.Acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF, ARDS) Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as severe hypoxemia (PaO2 .Kidney failure, liver failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation follow.Without treatment, death occurs within days.Etiology of Acute Abdominal Pain Many intra-abdominal disorders cause abdominal pain ; some are trivial, but some are immediately life threatening, requiring rapid diagnosis and surgery.These include ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm.The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involvedAAA), perforated viscus, mesenteric ischemia Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Acute mesenteric ischemia is interruption of intestinal blood flow by embolism, thrombosis, or a low-flow state.It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction.Others (eg, intestinal obstruction Intestinal Obstruction Intestinal obstruction is significant mechanical impairment or complete arrest of the passage of contents through the intestine due to pathology that causes blockage of the bowelAcute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake.Several extra-abdominal disorders also cause abdominal pain .Location of abdominal pain and possible causes Table Abdominal pain in neonates, infants, and young children has numerous causes not encountered in adults.These causes include necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing Enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acquired disease, primarily of preterm or sick neonates, characterized by mucosal or even deeper intestinal necrosisHypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is obstruction of the pyloric lumen due to pyloric muscular hypertrophy.Diagnosis is by abdominal ultrasonography.Treatment is surgicalBowel Malrotation of the bowel is failure of the bowel to assume its normal place in the abdomen during intrauterine development.Diagnosis is by abdominal x-ray.Treatment is surgical repairAnal Atresia Anal atresia is an imperforate anus.(Also see Overview of Congenital Gastrointestinal AnomaliesJejunoileal Atresia Jejunoileal atresia is incomplete formation of part of the small intestine.Diagnosis is by abdominal x-ray.Treatment is surgical repair.Evaluation of Acute Abdominal Pain Evaluation of mild and severe pain follows the same process, although with severe abdominal pain, therapy sometimes proceeds simultaneously and involves early consultation with a surgeon.History and physical examination usually exclude all but a few possible causes, with final diagnosis confirmed by judicious use of laboratory and imaging tests.Life-threatening causes should always be ruled out before focusing on less serious diagnoses.In seriously ill patients with severe abdominal pain, the most important diagnostic measure may be expeditious surgical exploration.In mildly ill patients, watchful waiting and a diagnostic evaluation may be best.History A thorough history usually suggests the diagnosis .Of particular importance are pain location  and characteristics, history of similar symptoms, and associated symptoms.Concomitant symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice, melena, hematuria, hematemesis, weight loss, and mucus or blood in the stool help direct subsequent evaluation.A drug history should include details concerning prescription and illicit drug use as well as alcohol.Many drugs cause gastrointestinal upset.Prednisone or immunosuppressants may inhibit the inflammatory response to perforation or peritonitis and result in less pain, tenderness, or leukocytosis than might otherwise be expected.Anticoagulants can increase the chances of bleeding and hematoma formation.Alcohol predisposes to pancreatitis.Table Known medical conditions and previous abdominal surgeries are important to ascertain.Women should be asked whether they are pregnant.Physical examination The general appearance is important.A happy, comfortable-appearing patient rarely has a serious problem, unlike one who is anxious, pale, diaphoretic, or in obvious pain.Blood pressure, pulse, state of consciousness, and other signs of peripheral perfusion must be evaluated.However, the focus of the examination is the abdomen, beginning with inspection and auscultation, followed by palpation and percussion.Rectal examination and pelvic examination (for women) to locate tenderness, masses, and blood are essential.Palpation begins gently, away from the area of greatest pain, detecting areas of particular tenderness, as well as the presence of guarding, rigidity, and rebound (all suggesting peritoneal irritation) and any masses.Guarding is an involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles that is slightly slower and more sustained than the rapid, voluntary flinch exhibited by sensitive or anxious patients.Rebound is a distinct flinch upon brisk withdrawal of the examiner’s hand.The inguinal area and all surgical scars should be palpated for hernias of the Abdominal Wall A hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or congenital area of weakness or defect in the wall.Red flags Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology: Severe pain Signs of shock (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, diaphoresis, confusion) Signs of peritonitis Abdominal distention Interpretation of findings Distention, especially when surgical scars, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched peristalsis or borborygmi in rushes are present, strongly suggests bowel obstruction Intestinal Obstruction Intestinal obstruction is significant mechanical impairment or complete arrest of the passage of contents through the intestine due to pathology that causes blockage of the bowel.Severe pain in a patient with a silent abdomen who is lying as still as possible suggests Peritonitis Abdominal pain is common and often inconsequential.Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is almost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease.Back pain with shock suggests ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) Abdominal aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm typically constitutes an abdominal aortic aneurysm.The cause is multifactorial, but atherosclerosis is often involved.Ecchymoses of the costovertebral angles (Grey Turner sign) or around the umbilicus (Cullen sign) suggest hemorrhagic pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake.History is often suggestive .Mild to moderate pain in the presence of active peristalsis of normal pitch suggests a nonsurgical disease (eg, gastroenteritis Overview of Gastroenteritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small and large intestines.A patient who is writhing around trying to get comfortable is more likely to have an obstructive mechanism (eg, renal or biliary colic).Previous abdominal surgery makes obstruction caused by adhesions more likely.Generalized atherosclerosis increases the possibility of myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryAcute Mesenteric Ischemia Acute mesenteric ischemia is interruption of intestinal blood flow by embolism, thrombosis, or a low-flow state.It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction.HIV infection makes infectious causes more likely.Testing Tests are selected based on clinical suspicion: Urine pregnancy test for all women of childbearing age Selected imaging tests based on suspected diagnosis Standard tests (eg, complete blood count, chemistries, urinalysis) are often done but are of little value due to poor specificity; patients with significant disease may have normal results.Abnormal results do not provide a specific diagnosis (the urinalysis in particular may show pyuria or hematuria in a wide variety of conditions), and they can also occur in the absence of significant disease.An exception is serum lipase, which strongly suggests a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.A bedside urine pregnancy test should be done for all women of childbearing age because a negative result effectively excludes ruptured ectopic pregnancy.An abdominal series, consisting of flat and upright abdominal x-rays and upright chest x-rays (left lateral recumbent abdomen and anteroposterior chest x-ray for patients unable to stand), should be done when perforation or obstruction is suspected.However, these plain x-rays are seldom diagnostic for other conditions and do not need to be otherwise automatically done.Ultrasound should be done for suspected biliary tract disease or ectopic pregnancy (transvaginal probe) and for suspected appendicitis in children.Ultrasound can also detect abdominal aortic aneurysm but cannot reliably identify rupture.Noncontrast helical CT is the modality of choice for suspected renal stones.CT with oral and IV contrast is diagnostic in about 95% of patients with significant abdominal pain and has markedly lowered the negative laparotomy rate.However, advanced imaging must not be allowed to delay surgery in patients with definitive symptoms and signs.Treatment of Acute Abdominal Pain Some clinicians feel that providing pain relief before a diagnosis is made interferes with their ability to evaluate.However, moderate doses of IV analgesics (eg, fentanyl 50 to 100 mcg, morphine 4 to 6 mg) do not mask peritoneal signs and, by diminishing anxiety and discomfort, often make examination easier.Key Points Look for life-threatening causes first.Rule out pregnancy in women of childbearing age.Seek signs of peritonitis, shock, and obstruction.Blood tests are of minimal value.", "tokens":

{"text": "【0】 Along with low back pain Low Back Pain Low back pain and neck pain are among the most common reasons for health care visits.The pain usually results from problems with the musculoskeletal system—the spine, including the bones of the spine (backbones, or vertebrae) and the muscles and ligaments that support it.Some disorders cause only neck pain.Other disorders can cause neck and low back pain.Occasionally, neck pain results from a disorder, such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space).Neck Pain VIDEO The neck's flexibility makes it susceptible to wear and tear and to injuries that overstretch it, such as whiplash.Also, the neck has the critical job of holding up the head.Poor posture makes that job more difficult.Neck pain, like back pain, is common and becomes more common as people age.For pain located in the front of the neck, see Sore Throat Sore Throat Sore throat is pain in the back of the throat.The pain can be severe and is usually worsened by swallowing.Many people with sore throat refuse to eat or drink.The part of the spine that is in the neck is called the cervical spine.It consists of seven back bones (vertebrae), which are separated by disks made of jelly-like material and cartilage.The cervical spine contains the spinal cord Spinal Cord The spinal cord is a long, fragile tubelike structure that begins at the end of the brain stem and continues down almost to the bottom of the spine.Along the length of the spinal cord, spinal nerves emerge through spaces between the vertebrae to connect with nerves throughout the body.The part of the spinal nerve nearest the spinal cord is the spinal nerve root.Muscles and ligaments in the neck support the spine.Neck pain can involve damage to bones, muscles, disks, or ligaments, but pain can also be caused by damage to nerves or the spinal cord.A spinal nerve root can be compressed when the spine is injured, resulting in pain and sometimes weakness, numbness, and tingling in an arm.Compression of the spinal cord Compression of the Spinal Cord Injuries and disorders can put pressure on the spinal cord, causing back or neck pain, tingling, muscle weakness, and other symptoms.Causes of Neck Pain Most of the disorders that can cause low back pain Causes Low back pain and neck pain are among the most common reasons for health care visits.Common causes Common causes of neck pain include Muscle spasms Injuries to muscles and ligaments Arthritis (usually osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function.The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering.Injuries may occur during routine activities (for example, lifting, exercising, moving in an unexpected way) or result from trauma such a fall or car crash.Often no specific injured structures are identified with imaging tests, but doctors presume that some muscles and/or ligaments have been affected.In cervical spondylosis Cervical Spondylosis Cervical spondylosis is degeneration of the bones in the neck (vertebrae) and the disks between them, putting pressure on (compressing) the spinal cord in the neck.As a result, the nerves that emerge through the vertebrae may be pinched.Sometimes the spinal canal is narrowed (cervical spinal stenosis), and the spinal cord is compressed.Cervical spinal stenosis Cervical Spinal Stenosis Cervical spinal stenosis is narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck.In the cervical spine this results in compressing the thecal sac (the outer covering of the spinal cord), often the spinal cord, and/or its nerve roots.The usual cause is a combination of osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function.Herniated disks Herniated Disk A herniated disk occurs when the tough covering of a disk in the spine tears or ruptures.The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering.The disks between each of the vertebrae have an outer layer of cartilage (a tough, fiber-like tissue) and a soft, jelly-like interior.If a disk is repeatedly squeezed by the vertebrae above and below it, the outer layer may tear (rupture), causing pain.The interior of the disk can bulge out through the tear (herniate).The bulging disk can push on or even damage the spinal nerve root next to it.Rarely, the disk compresses the spinal cord.Fibromyalgia is characterized by poor sleep, fatigue, mental cloudiness, and widespread aching and stiffness in soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments.This disorder causes chronic widespread pain in muscles and other soft tissues in areas besides the neck.Less common causes Less common causes of neck pain that are serious include A tear in the lining of a neck artery (dissection) Meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space).It is a severe type of spasm of a specific neck muscle that causes the head to tilt and rotate into an abnormal position.Sometimes the spasms are rhythmic, causing the head to jerk.The cause may be unknown or may be due to certain drugs or hereditary disorders.Evaluation of Neck Pain The following information can help people with neck pain decide whether a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.In the evaluation, doctors first try to identify serious disorders.Warning signs In people with neck pain, certain signs are cause for concern.They include Loss of strength or sensation in the arms and legs—possibly a symptom of nerve damage Fever Night sweats Headache Lethargy or confusion Chest discomfort Sudden sweating or difficulty breathing Pain that is triggered by exertion or worsens during exertion When to see a doctor People with warning signs or difficulty or pain when swallowing should see a doctor immediately.If people without warning signs have severe pain (particularly if it is not relieved by acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.Other people can wait a few days or call their doctor to discuss how soon they need to be seen.What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.Doctors then do a physical examination.What they find during the history and examination often suggests a cause of the neck pain and the tests that need to be done .The physical examination focuses on the spine and nervous system (neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.Signs of nerve root compression include muscle weakness, abnormal reflexes (tested by tapping the tendons around the elbow and wrist), decreased sensation in parts of the body other than the head, inability to urinate Urinary Retention Urinary retention is inability to urinate or incomplete emptying of the bladder.People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence.Doctors may ask the person to move the neck in certain ways.With information about the pain, the person’s medical history, and results of a physical examination, doctors may be able to determine the most likely causes: Loss of strength or sensation may indicate damage to the spinal cord or nerves exiting from the cervical spine.Pain on the front or on one side of the neck usually is not caused by a problem with the spinal cord.Neck pain that radiates down an arm is usually caused by cervical disk herniation, cervical spinal stenosis, or spondylosis with compression of the spinal nerve root.Pain in the chest that travels up into the neck or into the arm may be caused by a heart disorder such as angina is temporary chest pain or a sensation of pressure that occurs while the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen.Pain that is constant, severe, progressively worse, and unrelieved by rest, particularly if it keeps the person awake at night and is accompanied by sweating, may indicate cancer or an infection.Table Testing Often, testing is not necessary because most neck pain is caused by muscle spasm and strains, which doctors can typically diagnose based on the examination.Testing is usually done if doctors suspect certain other disorders .If people have symptoms of nervous system malfunction (neurologic symptoms), such as weakness or numbness, magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.MRI provides clearer images of soft tissues (including disks and nerves) than CT.CT provide better images of bones than plain x-rays.However, plain x-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease.Occasionally, electromyography and nerve conduction studies Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.Treatment of Neck Pain Specific disorders are treated.General measures for neck pain Measures include Taking drugs that relieve pain Applying heat or cold to the painful area Modifying activities Light exercise as tolerated Most often, a sprain, muscle spasm, or other musculoskeletal injury is the cause of neck pain, and an over-the-counter analgesic Overview of Over-the-Counter Drugs Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are those available without a prescription.Symptoms usually resolve completely.If inflammation is not contributing to the pain (as with sprains, spasms, and other injuries), acetaminophen can be used because it is thought to be safer than NSAIDs.Ice Cold therapy (cryotherapy) Professional rehabilitation therapists treat pain and inflammation.Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.If more pain relief is needed, doctors may prescribe opioid analgesics, but, if prescribed, opioids should be used only for a short duration because long-term use of opioid analgesics can actually increase sensitivity to pain and cause side effects, such as drowsiness, confusion, and constipation, and risk the development of a substance use disorder Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use.Muscle relaxants, such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, diazepam, metaxalone, or methocarbamol, are sometimes used, but their usefulness is controversial.Muscle relaxants are not recommended for older people, who are more likely to have side effects.Avoiding aggravating activities, such as sitting for extended periods of time (particularly when also using a computer, phone, or other electronic device), may help.Using good posture and body mechanics when standing, sitting, lying down, or doing any activity is important.People are taught how to stand, sit, and sleep in ways that do not strain the neck.People who sleep on their side should use a pillow to support the head and neck in a neutral position (not tilted down toward the bed or up toward the ceiling).People who sleep on their back should use a pillow to support, but not raise, the head and neck.People should avoid sleeping on their stomach.People may also wear a neck brace (cervical collar) to keep the neck still and help relieve pain.Doctors or physical therapists Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs.Other measures to reduce neck pain People with pain that radiates into one arm and involves symptoms of nerve damage, such as arm and leg weakness, may require more intensive treatment.Traction Professional rehabilitation therapists treat pain and inflammation.Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.Corticosteroids, given orally and occasionally by epidural injection, have been used to reduce symptoms, but corticosteroid injections are controversial because they may not result in long-term improvement and can have side effects.For spasmodic torticollis, physical therapy or massage can sometimes temporarily stop the spasms.Drugs (including the antiseizure drug carbamazepine and some mild sedatives such as clonazepam, taken by mouth) can usually relieve the pain.But drugs control spasms in only about one third of people.If the pain is severe or if posture is distorted, botulinum toxin (a bacterial toxin used to paralyze muscles) may be injected into the affected muscles.Surgery for neck pain People who have a compressed spinal cord or spinal nerve due to a herniated disk in the neck and severe weakness or pain may require surgery.Surgical removal of the disk (diskectomy) and surgery to fuse vertebrae together (called cervical or spinal fusion) are the most common treatments.However, success rates are about the same for people who are treated with either nonsurgical or surgical options.The effectiveness of surgery for neck pain due to other disorders depends on the cause.Key Points Most neck pain is caused by sprains and muscle spasms and resolves completely.Many of the disorders that can cause low back pain can cause neck pain.People with warning signs, such as numbness or arm and leg weakness, should see a doctor immediately.Most neck pain can be relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and modification of activities.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4315,

{"text": "【0】 Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation is the standard method for rapidly providing rescue ventilation to patients with apnea or severe ventilatory failure.How To Insert an Oropharyngeal Airway How To Insert an Oropharyngeal Airway Oropharyngeal airways are rigid intraoral devices that conform to the tongue and displace it away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, thereby restoring pharyngeal airway patency In BVM ventilation, a self-inflating bag (resuscitator bag) is attached to a nonrebreathing valve and then to a face mask that conforms to the soft tissues of the face.The opposite end of the bag is attached to an oxygen source (100% oxygen) and usually a reservoir bag.The mask is manually held tightly against the face, and squeezing the bag ventilates the patient through the nose and mouth.Unless contraindicated, airway adjuncts such as nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal airways are used during BVM ventilation to assist in creating a patent airway.Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valves should be used if further assistance is needed for oxygenation without contraindications to its useAirway Establishment and Control Airway Establishment and Control Airway management consists of Clearing the upper airway Maintaining an open air passage with a mechanical device Sometimes assisting respirations Rapid provision of successful ventilation and oxygenation is the goal.Indications for BVM Ventilation Emergency ventilation for apnea, respiratory failure, or impending respiratory arrest Pre-ventilation and/or oxygenation or interim ventilation and/or oxygenation during efforts to achieve and maintain definitive artificial airways (eg, endotracheal intubation) Contraindications for BVM Ventilation Absolute contraindications There is no medical contraindication to providing ventilatory support to a patient; however, a legal contraindication (do-not-resuscitate order Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Orders and Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) The do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order placed in a patient’s medical record by a physician informs the medical staff that CPR should not be done in the event of cardiac arrestAdvance Directives Advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated.Relative contraindications None Complications of BVM Ventilation If bag-valve-mask ventilation is used for a prolonged period of time or if improperly performed, air may be introduced into the stomach.If this occurs and gastric distention is noted, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to evacuate the accumulated air in the stomach.Equipment for BVM Ventilation Gloves, mask, gown, and eye protection (ie, universal precautions) Oropharyngeal airways, nasopharyngeal airways, lubricating ointment Bag-valve apparatus PEEP valve Variably sized ventilation face masks Oxygen source (100% oxygen, 15 L/minute) Nasogastric tube Suctioning apparatus and Yankauer catheter; Magill forceps (if needed to remove easily accessible foreign bodies and patient has no gag reflex) to clear the pharynx as needed Pulse oximeter Capnography equipment Additional Considerations for BVM Ventilation Two-person bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation is used whenever possible.Bag-valve-mask ventilation can be done with one person or two, but two-person BVM ventilation is easier and more effective because a tight seal must be achieved and this usually requires 2 hands on the mask.Unless contraindicated, a pharyngeal airway adjunct is used when performing BVM ventilation.An oropharyngeal airway is used unless the patient has an intact gag reflex; in such cases, a nasopharyngeal airway (nasal trumpet) is used.Bilateral nasopharyngeal airways and an oropharyngeal airway are used if necessary for ventilation.Characteristics that predict difficult bag ventilation (and can thus help troubleshoot if ventilation is difficult) are described by the mnemonic MOANS: M – Mask seal: Facial hair or facial trauma can interfere with creating an adequate seal.O – Obesity/Obstruction: Obesity can be a sign of increased soft tissue in the airway and thus may cause further occlusion when the patient is obtunded.Obstruction by other soft tissues or a foreign body can also prevent adequate ventilation.A – Age: Extremes of age can predict who may be difficult to ventilate using a BVM due to anatomical changes.N – No teeth.Performing BVM on a patient without teeth is usually ineffective; a supraglottic airway may be indicated.S – Snoring: Snoring respirations can indicate that soft tissue, usually the tongue, is occluding the airway and that repositioning (eg, head-tilt, chin-lift.jaw thrust) is required.A positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve may be used during BVM to improve oxygenation.PEEP can increase alveolar recruitment and thus oxygenation if oxygenation is compromised even with 100% oxygen due to atelectasis.PEEP has also been shown to prevent lung injury.However, PEEP should be used cautiously in patients who are hypotensive or pre-load dependent because it reduces venous return.Relevant Anatomy for BVM Ventilation Aligning the external auditory canal with the sternal notch may help open the upper airway to maximize air exchange and establishes the best position to view the airway if endotracheal intubation becomes necessary.The degree of head elevation that best aligns the ear and sternal notch varies (eg, none in children with a large occiput, a large degree in obese patients).Positioning for BVM Ventilation The sniffing position—only in the absence of cervical spine injury Position the patient supine on the stretcher.Align the upper airway for optimal air passage by placing the patient into a proper sniffing position.Proper sniffing position aligns the external auditory canal with the sternal notch.To achieve the sniffing position, folded towels or other materials may need to be placed under the head, neck, or shoulders, so that the neck is flexed on the body and the head is extended on the neck.In obese patients, many folded towels or a commercial ramp device may be needed to sufficiently elevate the shoulders and neck.In children, padding is usually needed behind the shoulders to accommodate the enlarged occiput.Head and neck positioning to open the airway: Sniffing position A: The head is flat on the stretcher; the airway is constricted.B: The ear and sternal notch are aligned, with the face parallel to the ceiling (in the sniffing position), opening the airway.Adapted from Levitan RM, Kinkle WC: The Airway Cam Pocket Guide to Intubation, ed.2.Wayne (PA), Airway Cam Technologies, 2007.If there is concern for cervical spine injury: Position the patient supine or at a slight incline on the stretcher.Position yourself at the head of the stretcher.Avoid moving the neck and, if possible, use only the jaw-thrust maneuver or chin lift without head tilt to manually facilitate opening of the upper airway.Step-by-Step Description of BVM Ventilation Insert an oropharyngeal airway How To Insert an Oropharyngeal Airway Oropharyngeal airways are rigid intraoral devices that conform to the tongue and displace it away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, thereby restoring pharyngeal airway patencyBVM) ventilation.Select a mask that fits over the mouth and nose but spares the eyes.Do two-person BVM ventilation if possible.(NOTE: The accompanying video presents the one-person technique first.) Use waveform capnometry to monitor end tidal CO2 levels to assess adequacy of ventilations.Two-person mask technique In the two-person technique, the more experienced operator handles the mask, because maintaining a proper mask seal is the most difficult task.The second operator squeezes the bag.Stand at the head of the stretcher and have the second operator stand to the side.Using both hands, hold the mask between your thumbs and index fingers placed on either side of the connector stem.Making sure not to place your hands or the mask on the patient’s eyes, first place the nasal portion of the mask over the nose high enough to cover the bridge without air leaks.Next, lower the mask over the chin and allow it to seal along the 2 malar eminences.Cover the bridge of the nose, the 2 malar eminences, and the patient's lower lip by the mask to achieve a proper seal.Stretching the internal portion of the mask before placing it over the nose and mouth can help create a tighter seal.Traditional hand placement is the \"C-E\" grip, placing the middle, ring, and little fingers (the \"E\") under the mandible and pulling the mandible upward, while the thumbs and index fingers create a \"C\" and then press down against the mask.An alternative, often preferred, method (1, 2 References Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation is the standard method for rapidly providing rescue ventilation to patients with apnea or severe ventilatory failure.Place the thenar eminences (the base of the thumbs in the palm) along each lateral edge of the mask.Then lower the mask onto the face and place the other 4 fingers under the mandible.Press the mask to the face with the thenar eminences while pulling the mandible upward with the fingers.Head tilt may be applied concurrently.This technique is easier to perform; allows the use of stronger hand muscles to maintain a proper seal, minimizing fatigue; and enables 4 fingers rather than 3 to lift the mandible (accomplishing chin lift and jaw thrust).If your hands are large enough, place your little fingers behind the mandibular rami to do a jaw-thrust maneuver Step-by-Step Description of Procedure .This re-positioning helps to direct air into the trachea rather than into the esophagus and prevents gastric distention.Be sure to pull up only on the bony parts of the mandible, because pressure to the soft tissues of the neck or under the chin may obstruct the airway.Once a proper seal is achieved, have the second operator attach the bag to the mask and begin ventilation.One-person mask technique Using one hand, hold the mask, with your thumb and index finger wrapped around the connector stem of the mask.Most operators use their nondominant hand to grasp the mask, but either hand can be used as long as a good mask seal can be maintained.Making sure not to place your hand or the mask on the patient’s eyes, first place the nasal portion of the mask over the nose, and then lower the body over the patient’s mouth.The bridge of the nose, the 2 malar eminences, and the mandibular alveolar ridge must be covered by the mask in order to achieve a proper seal.Now extend your middle, ring, and little fingers underneath the patient’s mandible, and pull it upward into the mask.While maintaining this upward traction on the mandible, press the mask downward onto the face to attain a tight mask seal.Be sure to pull up only on the bony parts of the mandible, because pressure to the soft tissues of the neck or under the chin may obstruct the airway.Once a proper seal is achieved, use your other hand to begin ventilation.Bag ventilation and oxygenation For each breath, steadily and smoothly squeeze the bag to deliver a tidal volume of 6 to 7 mL/kg (or about 500 mL for an average size adult) over 1 second, and then release the bag to allow it to reinflate.If using a 1000-mL volume bag, squeeze only halfway to obtain the correct tidal volume.In cardiac arrest cases, do not exceed 8 to 10 breaths per minute (ie, one complete breath every 6 to 7.5 seconds).Observe for proper chest rise during ventilations; in practice, you can use a tidal volume just large enough to cause the chest to rise.Monitor the patient, checking breath sounds and, if possible, end-tidal carbon dioxide and pulse oximeter.(Pulse oximetry may not be useful during cardiac arrest due to poor peripheral perfusion.) Assess if adequate ventilation is continuous and sustainable or is requiring too much physical effort.If available, use waveform capnography, an excellent indicator of mask seal and proper ventilation.If oxygenation is inadequate despite proper form and use of 100% oxygen, attach a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve to recruit more alveoli for gas exchange.Set the PEEP valve initially at 5 and increase as needed to improve oxygen saturation.However, avoid PEEP in hypotensive patients.If ventilation or oxygenation is still not adequate, prepare for other airway maneuvers such as a supraglottic airway or endotracheal intubation.How To Do Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation VIDEO Aftercare for BVM Ventilation Continue bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation until either a definitive artificial airway (eg, endotracheal tube) is achieved or spontaneous ventilation is adequate (eg, following naloxone administration for an opioid overdose).If a patient becomes more conscious or a gag reflex returns while doing BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place, remove the oropharyngeal airway and provide continued treatment as appropriate.A nasopharyngeal airway may be better tolerated.If endotracheal intubation is necessary, ventilate using maximum FiO2 through a non-rebreather mask for 3 to 5 minutes before inserting the tube if feasible; if this is not feasible because intubation must proceed immediately, pre-oxygenate the patient by giving 5 to 8 vital capacity breaths using a PEEP valve.Warnings and Common Errors for BVM Ventilation Do not place your hands or the mask on the patient’s eyes.Doing so may damage the eyes or cause a vagal reaction.Tips and Tricks for BVM Ventilation Neither excessive force nor rapid insufflation should be used to ventilate; doing so increases gastric distention, compromising ventilation.A nasogastric tube is inserted to help decompress the stomach when possible.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7651, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease involves destruction of the hip in children.This disease is caused by a poor blood supply to the upper growth plate of the thighbone near the hip joint.Typical symptoms include hip pain and trouble walking.The diagnosis is based on x-rays and sometimes magnetic resonance imaging.Treatment includes immobilization of the hip and bed rest. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is an osteochondrosis, which is a group of disorders of the growth plate of bones Overview of Bone Disorders in Children Bone disorders can be caused by injury, infection, or cancer, be inherited, occur as part of a child’s growth, or occur for no known reason.Doctors are not sure what causes osteochondrosis, but the disorders do seem to run in families.Osgood-Schlatter disease Osgood-Schlatter Disease Osgood-Schlatter disease is painful inflammation of the bone and cartilage at the top of the shinbone (tibia).This disease is caused by overuse of the leg.  The upper back normally curves forward somewhat.Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease develops most commonly among boys between the ages of 5 and 10.The disease usually affects only one leg.About 10% of children have a relative who has the disease.Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is caused by a poor blood supply to the upper growth plate Overview of Bone Disorders in Children Bone disorders can be caused by injury, infection, or cancer, be inherited, occur as part of a child’s growth, or occur for no known reason.The poor blood supply causes the end of the thigh bone to die and collapse (avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is the death of a segment of bone caused by an impaired blood supply.Osteonecrosis can be caused by an injury or can occur spontaneously.The reason for the poor blood supply in Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is not known.Other problems also can interrupt blood supply to the growth plates.However, hip damage from these and other known causes is not considered Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.The Femur: Part of the Hip Joint Symptoms of Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease can cause severe hip damage before significant symptoms occur.The severe damage may, however, lead to permanent arthritis of the hip.The first symptom of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease often is pain in the hip joint and trouble walking.Pain begins gradually and progresses slowly.The pain tends to worsen when moving the hip or walking.Some children complain of pain only in the knee.A limp can develop, sometimes before the child has much pain.Eventually, joint movement becomes limited, and the thigh muscles may become wasted (atrophied) from lack of use.Diagnosis of Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease Usually x-rays Sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) The diagnosis of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is confirmed by x-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease.An MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.Later x-rays may show changes around the growth plate, such as a fracture or destruction of the bone.Doctors take x-rays of the child's skeleton if the disorder runs in the child's family or both of the child's legs are affected.These x-rays are taken to rule out hereditary disorders of the skeleton.Blood tests are done to rule out other disorders.Doctors try to determine whether the symptoms resulted from an injury.Prognosis for Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease Young children and children who have less damage when they are diagnosed have the best outcome.Treatment of Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease Bed rest and immobilization of the hip Sometimes surgery Treatment of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease includes prolonged bed rest and immobilization of the hip (for example, with a cast or splint).The choice of treatment depends on the child's age and amount of bone damage.Sometimes the partial immobilization provided by bed rest is sufficient.However, sometimes nearly total immobilization using traction, slings, plaster casts, or splints for 12 to 18 months is necessary.Such treatments keep the legs rotated outward.Physical therapy Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs.If a child is over 6 years of age and has moderate or severe bone destruction, surgery may be helpful.Even without treatment, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease usually gets better, but it takes longer, usually 2 to 3 years, and there is an increased risk of hip arthritis developing later in life.Treatment with bisphosphonates (drugs that help increase bone density) has been effective, but more studies are needed.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5242, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the bundle of nerves that extends from the bottom of the spinal cord is compressed or damaged.The most common cause of cauda equina syndrome is a herniated disk.Cauda equina syndrome causes severe pain in the lower back, urinary problems (such as incontinence).and loss of sensation in the buttocks, genital area, bladder, and rectum.Doctors immediately evaluate people with symptoms of cauda equina syndrome and do magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography to confirm the diagnosis.Surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the cauda equina, and pain relievers and corticosteroids are used to relieve pain.A bundle of nerves extends downward from the bottom of the spinal cord, through the lower back bones (vertebrae) and over the bone at the base of the spine (sacrum).This bundle is called the cauda equina, which means horse’s tail in Latin, because that is what the bundle looks like.The symptoms that result from compression of or damage to the cauda equina are called the cauda equina syndrome.Cauda Equina Syndrome A bundle of nerves extends downward from the bottom of the spinal cord, through the lower back bones (vertebrae) and over the bone at the base of the spine (sacrum).This bundle is called the cauda equina, which means horse’s tail in Latin, because that is what the bundle looks like.The cauda equina may be compressed by a ruptured or herniated disk, a tumor, or an abscess.It may be damaged by an injury or swell because it becomes inflamed (as occurs in ankylosing spondylitis).The symptoms that result are called the cauda equina syndrome.Causes of Cauda Equina Syndrome The most common cause of cauda equina syndrome is A ruptured or herniated disk Herniated Disk A herniated disk occurs when the tough covering of a disk in the spine tears or ruptures.The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering.Neural tube defects can result in nerve damage, learning disabilities, paralysis, and death.Neural tube defects can result in nerve damage, learning disabilities, paralysis, and death.The narrowing squeezes (compresses) the nerves that travel through the lower back into the legs.A tumor can put direct pressure on the cauda equina.Symptoms of Cauda Equina Syndrome People with cauda equina syndrome may have severe pain in the lower back, usually due to the disorder causing cauda equina syndrome.People may lose sensation in the buttocks, genital area, bladder, and rectum—the area of the body that would touch a saddle (called saddle anesthesia).That is, these people may be less able to feel pain, touch, temperature, and vibration in these areas.Sensation and muscle control may be impaired in the lower legs.Other symptoms of cauda equina syndrome may include the following: Reduced sexual response, including erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence.Diagnosis of Cauda Equina Syndrome A doctor's evaluation Imaging tests Doctors suspect cauda equina syndrome based on symptoms and results of a physical examination.However, symptoms tend to vary.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is done immediately when cauda equina syndrome is suspected.If MRI is unavailable, myelography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.These tests can usually confirm the diagnosis.Treatment of Cauda Equina Syndrome Surgery Usually corticosteroids People who have cauda equina syndrome require immediate medical attention.Doctors focus on treating the disorder causing cauda equina syndrome.For example, surgery is done immediately to relieve pressure on the cauda equina caused by a herniated disk.Such treatment can prevent permanent damage.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other medications are used if needed for pain relief.If medications do not relieve the pain, corticosteroids, given by mouth or injection, may help.Corticosteroids can also reduce swelling.How well a person recovers often depends on the cause and how promptly it are treated.Symptoms are more likely to lessen or go away if the cause is identified and is treated immediately.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3663, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder of unknown cause that causes large sores on the skin. The cause is not known, but this disorder can develop after an injury or in people with certain disorders.This disorder begins as small bumps or blisters that become open sores.The diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the sores.Treatment includes dressings, creams, and drugs.The cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown, but people who have pyoderma gangrenosum tend to have certain underlying disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea.In pyoderma gangrenosum, the immune system seems to be reacting to the skin itself.Pyoderma gangrenosum typically affects people who are 25 to 55 years old.Pyoderma gangrenosum can develop on areas of skin that have recently been injured or operated on.Thus, areas affected by pyoderma gangrenosum often worsen if they are biopsied (a sample of skin is removed for examination) or debrided (dead tissue is removed to clean the affected area).Symptoms of Pyoderma Gangrenosum Most often, pyoderma gangrenosum begins as a red bump that may resemble a pimple or an insect bite.Less often, it begins as a blister.The bump or blister then becomes an open, painful sore (ulcer) that expands rapidly.The sores have a raised border that is dusky or purple.The sores can grow together to form larger sores.People often are left with scars after ulcers heal.People commonly have fever and a general feeling of illness (malaise).Pyoderma gangrenosum can also develop at other locations, such as in the abdominal wall around a colostomy or ileostomy opening in people who have inflammatory bowel disease, or on the genitals.In some people with pyoderma gangrenosum, areas other than the skin, such as the bones, lungs, heart, liver, or muscles, are affected.Diagnosis of Pyoderma Gangrenosum A doctor's evaluation Doctors diagnose pyoderma gangrenosum by the appearance of the sores and by ruling out other diseases that cause sores to form on the skin.The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is strongly suggested if the sores worsen after they are debrided.A sample of skin may need to be removed and examined under a microscope (called a skin biopsy Doctors can identify many skin disorders simply by looking at the skin.A full skin examination includes examination of the scalp, nails, and mucous membranes.Treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum Dressings Corticosteroids or tacrolimus applied to the skin Sometimes drugs to suppress the immune system Dressings that protect the skin from drying are applied to help heal the sores.Potent corticosteroid creams or tacrolimus can be directly applied to sores that are new and not deep.Prednisone taken by mouth is given to people severely affected by the disease.Drugs that suppress the immune system, such as infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, are helpful, particularly for people who have inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea.Cyclosporine can be very effective, particularly for people whose disease is progressing rapidly.Dapsone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, clofazimine, thalidomide, mycophenolate mofetil, and minocycline are other treatment options.Surgical treatments are typically not done because they may worsen the sores.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6336, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and anemia with nucleated and teardrop-shaped red blood cells.Diagnosis requires bone marrow aspirate and biopsy and exclusion of other conditions that can cause myelofibrosis (secondary myelofibrosis).Treatment is often supportive, but Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or pacritnib, may decrease symptoms and stem cell transplantation may be curative Pathophysiology of Primary Myelofibrosis is a reactive, reversible increase in bone marrow collagen often with extramedullary hematopoiesis (primarily in the spleen).Myelofibrosis may be Primary (more common) Secondary to a number of hematologic, malignant, and nonmalignant conditions .Primary myelofibrosis results from neoplastic transformation of a multipotent bone marrow stem cell.These primary myelofibrosis progeny cells stimulate bone marrow fibroblasts (which are not part of the neoplastic transformation) to secrete excessive collagen.The peak incidence of primary myelofibrosis is between 50 and 70 years and predominantly in males.Mutations of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene are present in a high proportion of cases of primary myelofibrosis.JAK2 is a member of the class I type tyrosine kinase family of enzymes and is involved in signal transduction for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors among other entities.Mutations of the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene also may be the cause of primary myelofibrosis.However, there are rare cases of primary myelofibrosis in which none of these three mutations are present (triple negative primary myelofibrosis).Some of these patients have other uncommon MPL mutations, which can only be detected by next generation sequencing.In primary myelofibrosis, nucleated red blood cells (normoblasts) and myelocytes are released into the circulation (leukoerythroblastosis) when there is extramedullary hematopoiesis (ie, non-marrow organs have taken over blood cell production because of the fibrosed marrow).The serum lactate dehydrogenase level is often elevated.Bone marrow failure eventually occurs, with consequent anemia and thrombocytopenia.Malignant myelofibrosis (sometimes called acute myelofibrosis), is a rare variant of myelofibrosis characterized by pancytopenia, myeloblastosis, and marrow fibrosis that has a more rapidly progressive downhill course and is generally due to a type of acute leukemia called acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.Table Symptoms and Signs of Primary Myelofibrosis In many patients, myelofibrosis is asymptomatic.Other patients have anemia, splenomegaly, or, in later stages, general malaise, weight loss, fever, or splenic infarction.Hepatomegaly occurs in some patients.Lymphadenopathy is rare.Severe extramedullary hematopoiesis can disturb the function of organs in which it occurs, including the brain.Diagnosis of Primary Myelofibrosis Complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Testing for JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations Primary myelofibrosis should be suspected in patients with splenomegaly, splenic infarction, and anemia.If the disorder is suspected, CBC should be done and peripheral blood morphology and a bone marrow biopsy should be examined.If myelofibrosis is present on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (as detected by reticulin staining or trichrome staining, indicating excess collagen and osteosclerosis), other disorders associated with myelofibrosis  should be excluded by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation.The diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis is confirmed by detecting a mutation in JAK2, CALR, or MPL.In some cases, none of these mutations is expressed (triple-negative myelofibrosis).A broader next-generation sequencing panel may detect gene mutations associated with increased risk of leukemic transformation and may therefore be useful for prognosis.Anemia is typically present and usually increases over time.Blood cell morphology is variable.Red blood cells (RBCs) are poikilocytic.Reticulocytosis and polychromatophilia may be present; teardrop-shaped RBCs (dacryocytes) are characteristic morphologic features.Nucleated RBCs and neutrophil precursors are typically present in peripheral blood.White blood cell counts are usually increased but are highly variable.In advanced stages, myeloblasts may be present, even in the absence of acute leukemia.Platelet counts initially may be high, normal, or decreased; however, thrombocytopenia tends to supervene as the disorder progresses.Unfavorable prognostic markers include hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (< 100 g/L), a history of transfusions, leukocytosis, and a platelet count < 100,000/mcL (< 100,000 × 109/L).Patients in the least favorable risk group usually survive < 1 year, but those with low-risk disease have a median survival of 10 years.Several prognostic scoring systems are available to predict survival.A number of useful risk stratification systems are available to aid prognosis and guide decisions to institute medical therapy or stem cell transplantation.The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) for Myelodysplastic Syndromes can be used to predict progression or survival as the disease evolves (1 Prognosis references Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and anemia with nucleated and teardrop-shaped red blood cells.Some scoring systems also incorporate cytogenetics and molecular markers (eg, DIPSS-Plus).Validated symptom assessment tools (eg, Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form) are also available for patients with myelofibrosis and can be useful to monitor therapeutic responses.Patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia with myelofibrosis have a better prognosis than those with primary myelofibrosis, and their outcome can be predicted by using the MYelofibrosis SECondary to PV and ET Prognostic Model (MYSEC-PM— 2 Prognosis references Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and anemia with nucleated and teardrop-shaped red blood cells.Treatment of Primary Myelofibrosis Symptomatic therapy Sometimes interferon Sometimes ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or pacritinib Sometimes allogeneic stem cell transplantation Treatment is directed at symptoms and complications.Some patients can be observed without treatment.In early primary myelofibrosis, pegylated interferon has been shown to reduce marrow fibrosis and spleen size and can be used for low-risk patients as defined by various prognostic scoring systems (1 Treatment reference Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and anemia with nucleated and teardrop-shaped red blood cells.Currently, for advanced primary myelofibrosis, the nonspecific JAK pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib is the therapy of choice in patients with a platelet count > 50,000/mcL (50,000 × 109/L).Ruxolitinib is effective whether or not a JAK2 mutation or splenomegaly is present.The main adverse effects of ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia.Care must be taken when stopping ruxolitinib because a withdrawal syndrome may occur, with significant worsening of symptoms in part due to splenic enlargement and a rebound in inflammatory cytokines.Low-dose corticosteroids may be used short term for symptom control.When splenomegaly is significant, ruxolitinib can precipitate tumor lysis syndrome.Fedratinib, also a JAK-2 inhibitor, can be used when there is resistance or intolerance to ruxolitinib.Some patients who develop intolerance to ruxolitinib may be able to tolerate it again after a period off the drug.A third JAK-2 inhibitor, pacritinib is available for patients whose platelets counts are too low to initiate ruxolitinib.Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used in older patients.Androgens, erythropoietin, splenectomy, chemotherapy, thalidomide, lenalidomide, splenic embolization, and radiation therapy have been tried for palliation.Of these, low-dose thalidomide and prednisone can be effective in controlling splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and circulating blast cells.However, the other modalities are of limited effectiveness or have significant adverse effects.Splenectomy should be avoided if possible; splenic irradiation has only a temporary effect and can cause severe neutropenia and infection.Among agents that are under investigation for treatment of myelofibrosis is luspatercept, an activin receptor ligand trap.Key Points Myelofibrosis is excessive bone marrow fibrosis, often with loss of hematopoietic cells and consequent extramedullary hematopoiesis.Myelofibrosis is often primary but may occur secondary to a number of hematologic, malignant, and nonmalignant disorders, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis.Primary myelofibrosis is a clonal hematopoietic disorder and often involves JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations.Diagnose with blood count, examination of peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, and molecular testing for JAK2, MPL, and/or CALR mutations.Some patients have an indolent course and do not require therapy immediately, but some patients have a rapidly progressive downhill course with short survival.Ruxolitinib is the therapy of choice for control of symptoms; allogeneic stem cell transplantation is of benefit in selected cases.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7464, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

however, there are exceptions, most notably sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder resulting in noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown.Treatment of Ichthyosis Minimization of exacerbating factors Moisturization and keratolytics Sometimes infection prophylaxis When ichthyosis is caused by a systemic disorder, the underlying disorder must be treated for the ichthyosis to abate.Other treatments of ichthyosis include emollients and keratolytics and avoiding drying (1 Treatment reference Ichthyosis is scaling and flaking of skin ranging from mild but annoying dryness to severe disfiguring disease.Ichthyosis can also be a sign of systemic disease.Diagnosis is clinical.Substances that are applied to the skin may have increased absorption.For example, hexachlorophene products should not be used because of increased absorption and toxicity.An emollient, preferably plain petrolatum, mineral oil, or lotions containing urea or alpha-hydroxy acids (eg, lactic, glycolic, and pyruvic acids), should be applied twice daily, especially after bathing while the skin is still wet.Blotting with a towel removes excess applied material.Ichthyosis typically responds well to the topical keratolytic propylene glycol.To remove scale (eg, if ichthyosis is severe), patients can apply a preparation containing 40 to 60% propylene glycol in water under occlusion (eg, a thin plastic film or bag worn overnight) every night after hydrating the skin (eg, by bathing or showering); in children, the preparation should be applied twice daily without occlusion.After scale has decreased, less frequent application is required.Other useful topical agents include ceramide-based creams, 6% salicylic acid gel, hydrophilic petrolatum and water (in equal parts), and the alpha-hydroxy acids in various bases.Topical calcipotriol cream has been used with success; however, this vitamin D derivative can result in hypercalcemia when used over broad areas, especially in small children.Retinoids are effective in treating inherited ichthyosis.Oral synthetic retinoids are effective for most ichthyoses.Acitretin  is effective in treating most forms of inherited ichthyosis.In lamellar ichthyosis, 0.1% tretinoin cream or oral isotretinoin may be effective.The lowest effective dose should be used.Long-term (1 year) treatment with oral isotretinoin has resulted in bony exostoses in some patients, and other long-term adverse effects may arise.Pearls & Pitfalls Oral retinoids are contraindicated in pregnancy because of their teratogenicity, and acitretin should be avoided in women of childbearing potential because of its teratogenicity and long duration of action.Infection prophylaxis Patients with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis may need long-term treatment with cloxacillin 250 mg orally 3 or 4 times a day or erythromycin 250 mg orally 3 or 4 times a day, as long as thick intertriginous scale is present, to prevent bacterial superinfection from causing painful, foul-smelling pustules.Regularly using soaps containing chlorhexidine may also reduce the bacteria, but these soaps tend to dry the skin.Key Points Ichthyosis may be acquired or inherited as an isolated disorder or as part of a syndrome.Evaluate patients with gradual-onset ichthyosis for an underlying systemic disorder.Emollients that speed the shedding of skin (keratolytics) are effective in treating ichthyosis.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8747, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Often, lymph nodes Overview of the Lymphatic System in the neck, under the arms, or in the groin enlarge rapidly and painlessly.People may have pain or shortness of breath or other symptoms when enlarged lymph nodes press on organs.A lymph node and/or bone marrow biopsy are needed for diagnosis.Treatment may involve radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, or a combination.Most people are cured or survive for many years.People who relapse are treated with stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells Components of the Immune System The immune system is designed to defend the body against foreign or dangerous invaders.These cells help fight infections.Lymphomas can develop from either B or T lymphocytes, the two main types of lymphocyte.T lymphocytes are important in regulating the immune system and in fighting viral infections.Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are actually more than 50 different diseases that involve B cell or T cell lymphocytes.Each of these lymphomas has a distinct appearance under the microscope, a different cell pattern, and a different pattern of symptoms and progression.Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (80 to 85%) are from B cells.Less than 15 to 20% develop from T cells.Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common than Hodgkin lymphoma.It is the 6th most common cancer in the United States and causes 4% of all cancer deaths.It is more common as people get older.In the United States, over 80,000 new cases are diagnosed every year, and the number of new cases is increasing, especially among older people and people whose immune system is not functioning normally.People who have had organ transplants and some people who have been infected with hepatitis C virus or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Leukemias Overview of Leukemia Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells or of cells that develop into white blood cells.White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow.In leukemias, most of the cancerous white blood cells are in the bloodstream and bone marrow.In lymphomas, most of the cancerous white blood cells are within lymph nodes and organs such as the spleen and liver.However, leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma sometimes overlap because people with lymphoma may have cancerous white blood cells in their bloodstream and people with leukemia may have cancer cells in their lymph nodes and organs.Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma VIDEO  Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are actually a group of more than 50 different diseases.Causes of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Although the cause of most non-Hodgkin lymphomas is not known, evidence strongly supports a role for viruses in some of the less common types.A rare type of rapidly progressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which occurs in southern Japan and the Caribbean, may result from infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.The Epstein-Barr virus Infectious Mononucleosis Epstein-Barr virus causes a number of diseases, including infectious mononucleosis.The virus is spread through kissing.Other suspected viral causes include hepatitis C virus Overview of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis is common throughout the world.It is caused by human herpesvirus type 8 infection.People with HIV are at increased risk of developing some subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori Infection Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection is a bacterial infection that causes stomach inflammation ( gastritis), peptic ulcer disease, and certain types of stomach cancer.Other people at risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma include those with Inherited immunodeficiency syndromes Overview of Immunodeficiency Disorders Immunodeficiency disorders involve malfunction of the immune system, resulting in infections that develop and recur more frequently, are more severe, and last longer than usual.Enlarged lymph nodes within the chest may press against airways, causing cough and difficulty breathing, or press against blood vessels in the chest, causing swelling of the face, neck, and arms (superior vena cava syndrome).Deep lymph nodes within the abdomen may press against various organs, causing loss of appetite, constipation, abdominal pain, or progressive swelling of the legs.Some lymphomas can appear in the bloodstream and bone marrow.Lymphoma cells in the bone marrow may interfere with the ability of the bone marrow to produce enough normal blood cells.Fever and excessive sweating may indicate infection, which may result from too few normal white blood cells.Weakness, fatigue, and paleness, which may result from too few red blood cells (anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.Some people may have trouble breathing, a rapid heart rate, or chest pain.Easy bruising and bleeding, sometimes in the form of nosebleeds or bleeding gums, which may result from too few platelets (thrombocytopenia Overview of Thrombocytopenia is a low number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood, which increases the risk of bleeding.In some cases, people may bleed into their brain or abdomen.Non-Hodgkin lymphomas can also invade the digestive tract, skin, and occasionally the nervous system, causing various symptoms.Some people have persistent fever without an evident cause, the so-called fever of unknown origin.This type of fever commonly reflects an advanced stage of disease.In children, the first symptoms—anemia, rashes, and neurologic symptoms, such as weakness and abnormal sensation—are likely to be caused by infiltration of lymphoma cells into the bone marrow, blood, skin, intestine, brain, and spinal cord.Lymph nodes that become enlarged are usually deep ones, leading to the following: Accumulation of fluid around the lungs, which causes difficulty in breathing Pressure on the intestine, which causes loss of appetite or vomiting Blocked lymph vessels, which causes fluid retention called lymphedema, most noticeably in the arms and legs Table Diagnosis and Classification Lymph node biopsy Doctors suspect non-Hodgkin lymphoma when a person with no apparent infection develops persistent and painless enlargement of lymph nodes that lasts for several weeks.Sometimes enlarged lymph nodes deep within the chest or abdomen are found unexpectedly when a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) is done for another reason.Doctors do a biopsy of an enlarged lymph node to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphomas and to distinguish them from Hodgkin lymphoma and other disorders that cause enlarged lymph nodes.The type of biopsy depends on which node is enlarged and how much tissue is needed.Doctors must remove enough tissue to be able to distinguish non-Hodgkin lymphoma from other disorders that can cause lymph node enlargement, including Hodgkin lymphomas, infections, inflammation, or other cancers.The best way to obtain enough tissue is with an excisional biopsy (a small incision made to remove a piece of the lymph node).Occasionally, when an enlarged lymph node is close to the body's surface, a sufficient amount of tissue can be obtained by inserting a hollow needle (usually under ultrasound or CT guidance) through the skin and into the lymph node (core needle biopsy).When an enlarged lymph node is deep inside the abdomen or chest, surgery may be needed to obtain a piece of tissue.Although more than 50 different disorders can be called non-Hodgkin lymphomas, doctors sometimes group them into two broad categories.Indolent lymphomas are characterized by A long survival period (many years) Rapid response to many treatments Variable periods of remission but lack of cure with current standard therapies Aggressive lymphomas are characterized by Rapid progression without therapy High rates of cure with standard chemotherapy but short survival when cure is not achieved Although non-Hodgkin lymphomas are usually diseases of middle-aged and older people, children and young adults may develop lymphomas.Lymphomas that develop in children and young adults are commonly aggressive subtypes.Staging of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Imaging studies Bone marrow biopsy Blood tests (including tests of liver and kidney function) Many people with non-Hodgkin lymphomas have disease that has spread at the time of diagnosis.In only 10 to 30% of people, the disease is limited to one region.Staging is important because the treatment and the prognosis are based on the stage.Several procedures are used to stage or assess non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Basic blood tests, including a complete blood count and tests of liver and kidney function, are done along with tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications. Hepatitis is common throughout the world. Hepatitis is common throughout the world.Positron emission tomography (PET) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Positron emission tomography (PET) is a type of radionuclide scanning.If combined PET-CT scan is not available, a contrast CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is done.Other tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.Bone marrow biopsy Bone Marrow Examination Red blood cells, most white blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow, the soft fatty tissue inside bone cavities.In some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the PET-CT can reliably detect bone marrow involvement, so a bone marrow biopsy may not always be necessary.In other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the PET-CT cannot reliably detect bone marrow involvement and a bone marrow biopsy may be needed if staging would change the choice of treatment.The disease is classified into four stages based on the extent of its spread (I, II, III, IV).The higher the number, the more the lymphoma has spread.Limited stage disease includes stages I and II; advanced stage disease includes stages III and IV.In stages I and II, if non-Hodgkin lymphoma is present in an organ outside the lymph system, it is classified as stage IE or IIE.Bulky disease is the term used when there is a tumor mass in the chest, the size of which may be different for different types of lymphomas.Table Treatment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both Immunotherapy (drugs made up of antibodies that attack cancer cells), with or without chemotherapy Sometimes stem cell transplantation The treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies widely based on the subtype.For some people with indolent lymphomas, treatment is not needed when the lymphoma is first diagnosed.Studies show that waiting does not compromise outcome and prevents the patient from being exposed to side effects of treatment earlier than necessary.For people with indolent lymphomas, treatment, when needed, extends life and relieves symptoms for many years.For people with aggressive lymphomas, cure is possible and therefore waiting without treatment is not usually done.The likelihood of a cure or long-term survival depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and the stage when treatment starts.It is somewhat of a paradox that indolent lymphomas usually respond readily to treatment by going into remission (in which the disease is under control), often followed by long-term survival, but the disease usually is not cured.In contrast, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which usually require very intensive treatment to achieve remission, have a good chance of being cured.Stage I non-Hodgkin lymphomas: Limited disease People with indolent lymphomas who have very limited disease (stage I) are often treated with radiation therapy Radiation Therapy for Cancer Radiation is a form of intense energy generated by a radioactive substance, such as cobalt, or by specialized equipment, such as an atomic particle (linear) accelerator.With this approach, most people do not have a disease recurrence in the irradiated area, but non-Hodgkin lymphomas can recur elsewhere in the body as long as 10 years after treatment, so people require long-term monitoring.People with aggressive lymphomas at a very early stage need to be treated with combination chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.Stage II non-Hodgkin lymphomas: Limited or advanced disease Stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually behaves like limited disease (stage I) but sometimes behaves like advanced disease.Doctors choose the treatment depending on the disease behavior.Stages III to IV non-Hodgkin lymphomas: Advanced disease Almost all people with indolent lymphomas have stage II to IV disease.They do not always require treatment initially, but they are monitored for evidence of lymphoma progression, which could signal a need for therapy, sometimes years after the initial diagnosis.There is no evidence that early treatment extends survival in people with indolent lymphomas at more advanced stages.If the disease begins to progress, there are many treatment choices.Multiple treatment options exist, and the choice of treatment may depend on a variety of factors, including the lymphoma subtype, the extent of spread, and the person’s symptoms, and co-existing medical conditions.Treatment may include therapy with monoclonal antibodies (such as rituximab) alone or combined with chemotherapy and Other Systemic Cancer Treatments Systemic treatments are those that have effects throughout the body rather than being applied directly to the cancer.Most treatments are given intravenously.Sometimes, oral drugs are used.Treatment usually produces a remission.The average length of remission depends on the intensity of the treatment.Sometimes treatment may also include maintenance therapy (therapy given after the initial treatment to help prevent relapse).For people with aggressive lymphomas, stage II to IV, combinations of chemotherapy Combination Cancer Therapy Cancer drugs are most effective when given in combination.Many potentially effective combinations of chemotherapy drugs are available.Combinations of chemotherapy drugs are often given names created by using the initial letter of each drug that is included.For example, one of the oldest and still one of the most commonly used combinations is known as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, [hydroxy]doxorubicin, vincristine [Oncovin], and prednisone).Rituximab has been shown to improve the outcome of CHOP and is now routinely added to the combination (R-CHOP).About 60 to 70% of people with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas at an advanced stage are cured with R-CHOP chemotherapy.Other combinations of drugs are being studied.Chemotherapy, which often causes different types of blood cells to decrease in number, is sometimes better tolerated if special proteins (called growth factors) are also given to stimulate growth and development of blood cells. Combinations of chemotherapy drugs are often named by combining the initial letter of each drug name.Posttreatment strategies After radiation therapy, there is an increased risk of secondary cancers occurring 10 or more years after treatment in organs that were in the radiation field.Leukemias Overview of Leukemia Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells or of cells that develop into white blood cells.White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow.After treatment has been finished, people should have regular doctor's examinations and tests to look for return of the lymphoma (post-treatment surveillance).The type of tests depends on the patient's risk factors and type of treatment they received.Relapse Most people who have a relapse of an aggressive lymphoma receive high doses of chemotherapy drugs combined with autologous stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder.With this type of treatment, some people are cured.Sometimes stem cells from a sibling or even an unrelated donor (allogeneic transplant) can be used, but this type of transplantation has a greater risk of complications.Sometimes people are offered treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which are T cells that have been genetically engineered to fight against lymphoma.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4699, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Anemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) as measured by the red cell count, the hematocrit, or the red cell hemoglobin content.In men, anemia is defined as any of the following: Hemoglobin < 14 g/dL (140 g/L) Hematocrit < 42% (< 0.42) RBC < 4.5 million/mcL (< 4.5 × 1012/L) In women, anemia is defined as any of the following: Hemoglobin < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) Hematocrit < 37% (< 0.37) RBC < 4 million/mcL (< 4 × 10 12/L) For infants and children, normal values vary with age, necessitating use of age-related tables .Anemia is not a diagnosis; it is a manifestation of an underlying disorder , which leads to a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin content.Thus, even mild, asymptomatic anemia should be investigated so that the primary problem can be diagnosed and treated.Anemia is usually suspected based on the history and physical examination.Common symptoms and signs of anemia include General fatigue Weakness Dyspnea on exertion Pallor History and physical examination are followed by laboratory testing with a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear.The differential diagnosis (and cause of anemia) can then be further refined based on the results of testing.Pearls & Pitfalls Anemia is not a diagnosis; it is a manifestation of an underlying disorder.Thus, even mild, asymptomatic anemia should be investigated so that the primary problem can be diagnosed and treated.Patient History in Anemia The history should address Risk factors for particular anemias Symptoms of anemia itself Symptoms that reflect the underlying disorder Risk factors for Anemia has many risk factors.For example, a vegan diet predisposes to vitamin B12 deficiency anemia Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias Megaloblastic anemias result most often from deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate.Ineffective hematopoiesis affects all cell lines but particularly red blood cellsMegaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias Megaloblastic anemias result most often from deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate.Ineffective hematopoiesis affects all cell lines but particularly red blood cells.A number of hemoglobinopathies Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestryOverview of Hemolytic Anemia At the end of their normal life span (about 120 days), red blood cells (RBCs) are removed from the circulation.Cancer, rheumatic disorders, and chronic inflammatory disorders can suppress red cell production.Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young womenOverview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systemsAutoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoantibodies that react with red blood cells at temperatures ≥ 37° C (warm antibody hemolytic anemia) or < 37° C (cold agglutinin disease).Symptoms of anemia The symptoms of anemia are neither sensitive nor specific and do not help differentiate between types of anemias.Symptoms reflect compensatory responses to tissue hypoxia and usually develop when the hemoglobin level falls well below the patient's individual baseline.Symptoms are generally more pronounced in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve or when the anemia develops very rapidly.Symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, drowsiness, angina, syncope, and dyspnea on exertion can indicate anemia.Vertigo, headache, pulsatile tinnitus, amenorrhea, loss of libido, and gastrointestinal (GI) complaints may also occur.Heart failure or shock can develop in patients with severe tissue hypoxia or hypovolemia.Symptoms that suggest cause of anemia Certain symptoms may suggest the cause of the anemia.For example, melena, epistaxis, hematochezia, hematemesis, or menorrhagia indicates bleeding.Jaundice and dark urine, in the absence of liver disease, suggest hemolysis.Weight loss may suggest cancer.Diffuse severe bone or chest pain may suggest sickle cell disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestryB12 deficiency Vitamin B12 Deficiency Dietary vitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption, but deficiency can develop in vegans who do not take vitamin supplements.Physical Examination in Anemia A complete physical examination is necessary.Signs of anemia itself are neither sensitive nor specific; however, pallor is common with severe anemia.Signs of underlying disorders are more diagnostically accurate than are signs of anemia.Heme-positive stool identifies gastrointestinal bleeding Overview of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can originate anywhere from the mouth to the anus and can be overt or occult.The manifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding.Hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death.Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia.Splenomegaly is abnormal enlargement of the spleen. Splenomegaly is almost always secondary to other disorders.Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy is dysfunction of one or more peripheral nerves (the part of a nerve distal to the root and plexus)B12 deficiency Vitamin B12 Deficiency Dietary vitamin B12 deficiency usually results from inadequate absorption, but deficiency can develop in vegans who do not take vitamin supplements.Fever and heart murmurs suggest infective endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.Rarely, high-output heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Testing in Anemia CBC with white blood cells (WBC) and platelet counts RBC indices and morphology Reticulocyte count Peripheral smear Sometimes bone marrow aspiration and biopsy Laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, RBC indices and morphology (mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], red blood cell distribution width [RDW]), and examination of the peripheral smear.The reticulocyte count demonstrates how well the bone marrow is compensating for the anemia.Subsequent tests are selected on the basis of these results and on the clinical presentation.Recognition of general diagnostic patterns can expedite the diagnosis .Table Complete blood count and RBC indices The automated CBC directly measures hemoglobin, RBC count, WBC count, and platelet count, plus mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is a measure of RBC volume.Hematocrit, which is a measure of the percentage of blood made up of RBCs, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), which is a measure of the hemoglobin content in individual RBCs but is of no clinical significance, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), which is a measure of the hemoglobin concentration in individual RBCs are calculated values.The diagnostic criterion for anemia is For men: Hemoglobin < 14 g/dL (140 g/L), hematocrit < 42% (< 0.42), or RBC < 4.5 million/mcL (< 4.5 × 10 12/L) For women: Hemoglobin < 12 g/dL (120 g/l), hematocrit < 37% (< 0.37), or RBC < 4 million/mcL (< 4 × 10 12/L) For infants and children, normal values vary with age, necessitating use of age-related tables .RBC populations are termed microcytic (small cells) if MCV is < 80 fL, and macrocytic (large cells) if MCV is > 100 fL.However, because reticulocytes are also larger than mature red cells, large numbers of reticulocytes can elevate the MCV.Automated techniques can also determine the degree of variation in RBC size, expressed as the RBC volume distribution width (RDW).A high RDW may be the only indication of simultaneous microcytic and macrocytic disorders; such a pattern may result in a normal MCV, which measures only the mean value.The term hypochromia refers to RBC populations in which the MCHC is < 30%.RBC populations with a normal MCHC value are normochromic.Spherocytes can have an elevated MCHC.Red cells defend their MCHC over their MCV (preserving hemoglobin at the expense of RBC size), which is why microcytosis occurs with iron deficiency and with impaired hemoglobin synthesis.The RBC indices can help indicate the mechanism of anemia and narrow the number of possible causes.Microcytic indices occur with altered heme or globin synthesis.The most common causes are iron deficiency, thalassemia, and related hemoglobin-synthesis defects.In some patients with the anemia of chronic disease Anemia of Chronic Disease The anemia of chronic disease is a multifactorial anemiaMCV is microcytic or borderline microcytic.Macrocytic indices occur with impaired DNA synthesis (eg, due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies or chemotherapeutic drugs such as hydroxyurea or antifolate agents) and in alcohol use disorder because of abnormalities of the cell membrane.Acute bleeding may briefly produce macrocytic indices because of the release of large young reticulocytes.Normocytic indices occur in anemias resulting from deficient erythropoietin (EPO) production or inadequate response to it (hypoproliferative anemias).Hemorrhage, before iron deficiency develops, usually results in normocytic and normochromic anemia unless the number of reticulocytes is excessive.Peripheral smear The peripheral smear is highly sensitive to excessive RBC production and hemolysis.It is more accurate than automated technologies for recognition of altered RBC structure, thrombocytopenia Overview of Platelet Disorders Platelets are circulating cell fragments that function in the clotting systemRBCs, or immature granulocytes and can detect other abnormalities (eg, malaria and other parasites, intracellular RBC or granulocyte inclusions) that can occur despite normal automated blood cell counts.RBC injury may be identified by finding RBC fragments, portions of disrupted cells (schistocytes), or evidence of significant membrane alterations from sickled cells, oval-shaped cells (ovalocytes) or spherocytic cells.Target cells (thin RBCs with a central dot of hemoglobin) are RBCs with insufficient hemoglobin or excess cell membrane (eg, due to hemoglobinopathies or liver disorders).The peripheral smear can also reveal variation in RBC shape (poikilocytosis) and size (anisocytosis).Reticulocyte count The reticulocyte count is expressed as the percentage of reticulocytes (normal range, 0.5 to 1.5%) or as the absolute reticulocyte count (normal range, 50,000 to 150,000/mcL, or 50 to 150 × 10 9/L).The reticulocyte count is a crucial test in the evaluation of anemia because it informs about the response of the bone marrow and facilitates differentiation between deficient erythropoiesis (RBC production) and excessive hemolysis (RBC destruction ) as the cause of anemia.For example, higher values indicate excessive production (reticulocytosis); in the presence of anemia, reticulocytosis suggests excessive RBC destruction.Low numbers in the presence of anemia indicate decreased RBC production.Reticulocytes are best visualized when blood is stained with a supravital stain, but because red cell reticulin is composed of RNA, which is present only in young red cells and they will only have a bluish appearance in a Wright-stained blood smear (polychromatophilia or polychromasia), which can provide a rough estimate of reticulocyte production on a routine blood smear.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy provide direct observation and assessment of RBC precursors.The presence of abnormal maturation (dyspoiesis) of blood cells and the amount, distribution, and cellular pattern of iron content can be assessed.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are usually not indicated in the evaluation of anemia and are only done when one of the following conditions is present: Unexplained anemia More than one cell lineage abnormality (ie, concurrent anemia and thrombocytopenia or leukopenia) Suspected primary bone marrow disorder (eg, leukemia, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, metastatic carcinoma, myelofibrosis) Bone Marrow Biopsy VIDEO Cytogenetic and molecular analyses can be done on aspirate material in hematopoietic or other tumors or in suspected congenital lesions of RBC precursors (eg, Fanconi anemia).Flow cytometry can be done in suspected lymphoproliferative or myelodysplastic states to define the immunophenotype.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are not technically difficult and do not pose significant risk of morbidity.These procedures are safe and helpful when hematologic disease is suspected.Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are usually can be done as a single procedure.Because biopsy requires adequate bone depth, the sample is usually taken from the posterior (or, less commonly, anterior) iliac crest.If myeloma is suspected or there is severe osteoporosis, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is done because it is the safest to avoid penetrating the pelvis.Other tests for evaluation of anemia Serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can sometimes help differentiate between hemolysis and blood loss; both are elevated in hemolysis and normal in blood loss.Other tests, such as vitamin B12 and folate levels and iron and iron binding capacity, are done depending on the suspected cause of anemia.Other tests are discussed under specific anemias and bleeding disorders.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8680, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Commonly used emergency contraception regimens include Insertion of a copper-bearing T380A IUD within 5 days of unprotected intercourse Insertion of a 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, which, like the copper-bearing IUD, probably requires insertion within 5 days of unprotected intercourse Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg orally once within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse Ulipristal acetate 30 mg orally once within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse For women who have regular menses, the risk of pregnancy after a single act of intercourse is about 5%.This risk is 20 to 30% if intercourse occurs at midcycle.A urine pregnancy test 2 weeks after use of emergency contraception is recommended.When a copper-bearing or 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is used for emergency contraception, it must be inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse (or within 5 days of suspected ovulation, if the timing of ovulation can be estimated).The pregnancy rate with is 0.1% for emergency contraception with the copper-releasing IUD and 0.Also, the IUD can be left in place to be used for long-term contraception.As emergency contraception, the copper-bearing IUD may affect blastocyst implantation; however, it does not appear to disrupt an already established pregnancy.The resumption of menses plus a negative pregnancy test reliably excludes pregnancy; a pregnancy test should be done 2 to 3 weeks after insertion to be sure that an unintended pregnancy has not occurred before insertion.Oral levonorgestrel (1.5 mg, single dose) used as emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by inhibiting or delaying ovulation.The probability of pregnancy is reduced by 85% after oral levonorgestrel emergency contraception, which has a pregnancy rate of 2 to 3%.However, overall risk reduction depends on the following: The woman's risk of pregnancy without emergency contraception The time in the menstrual cycle that emergency contraception is given The woman's body mass index (BMI; levonorgestrel emergency contraception is less effective than ulipristal acetate in obese women with a BMI > 30 kg/m2) In the US, oral levonorgestrel emergency contraception is available behind pharmacy counters without a prescription.A hormonal contraceptive may be started at the same time as use of oral levonorgestrel as part of a quick-start protocol.A backup method (such as a condom) is recommended for 7 days.Ulipristal acetate (a single oral dose of 30 mg), a progestin-receptor modulator, as emergency contraception has a pregnancy rate of about 1.5% and is thus more effective than oral levonorgestrel.Ulipristal acetate, like levonorgestrel, prevents pregnancy primarily by delaying or inhibiting ovulation.Although ulipristal acetate is more effective than levonorgestrel for women with a BMI > 30 kg/m2, its effectiveness also decreases as BMI increases.Thus, in obese women who strongly desire to avoid an unintended pregnancy, the copper-bearing IUD is the preferred method for emergency contraception.Ulipristal acetate is available by prescription only.Hormonal birth control should not be started until 6 days after use of ulipristal acetate, since progestins may interfere with emergency contraceptive efficacy.If hormonal contraception is started on day 6, a backup method (such as a condom) should be used for 7 days.There are no absolute contraindications to levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate emergency contraception.Oral levonorgestrel and ulipristal emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible and within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.The Yuzpe method is another regimen.It consists of 2 tablets, each containing ethinyl estradiol 50 mcg and levonorgestrel 0.25 mg, followed by 2 more tablets taken 12 hours later but within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.The high estrogen dose often causes nausea and may cause vomiting.A hormonal contraceptive may be started at the same time as use of the Yuzpe method, as part of a quick-start protocol.A backup method (such as a condom) is recommended for 7 days.The Yuzpe method is less effective than other methods; thus, it is no longer recommended except when women do not have access to other methods.Key Points Oral methods of emergency contraception include ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel; they are taken within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse.A copper-bearing IUD, inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse, is also effective and can be left in place for long-term contraception.A 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, inserted within 7 days of unprotected intercourse, is also effective.Pregnancy rates are 1.5% with ulipristal acetate, 2 to 3% with oral levonorgestrel, 0.1% with a copper-bearing IUD, and 0.3% with a 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUD.Likelihood of pregnancy after hormonal emergency contraception depends on pregnancy risk without emergency contraception, time in the menstrual cycle that emergency contraception is taken, and BMI.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8221, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 For many patients with chronic respiratory disorders, medical therapy only partially allays the symptoms and complications of the disorder.Due to the potential for bias, findings require validation in a prospective randomized clinical trial.Pulmonary rehabilitation programs Although most often pulmonary rehabilitation is conducted in a hospital or clinic, alternative strategies include home-based care, telerehabilitation, internet-based programs, and programs that require minimal resources.Some programs combine cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitationPatient assessment Program components Method of delivery Quality assurance Before pulmonary rehabilitation begins, a health care provided makes an initial assessment of patient needs.This assessment is conducted in a hospital or clinic pulmonary rehabilitation center and includes the following: An exercise test A field exercise test Quality-of-life measurements Dyspnea assessment Nutritional status evaluation Occupational status evaluation An adequate pulmonary rehabilitation program includes both endurance training and resistance training.The prescription is tailored to the patient's status and goals and progress is assessed regularly.The care team ideally includes an individual who has expertise in exercise, and health care providers who are trained in delivering rehabilitation.Indications In the past, pulmonary rehabilitation was reserved for patients with Severe COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smokeHowever, an increasing body of evidence suggests a benefit to patients with Asthma is a disease of diffuse airway inflammation caused by a variety of triggering stimuli resulting in partially or completely reversible bronchoconstrictionBronchiectasis is dilation and destruction of larger bronchi caused by chronic infection and inflammationCOVID-19 COVID-19 COVID-19 is an acute, sometimes severe, respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2Cystic fibrosis Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the gastrointestinal and respiratory systemsNeuromuscular disorders Pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathicSarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder resulting in noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown.Studies done in patients with COPD have suggested that pulmonary rehabilitation should start before COPD becomes severe (ie, as identified by degree of airflow obstruction) because there appears to be a poor correlation between disease severity and exercise performance.Contraindications are relative and include comorbidities (eg, untreated angina, left ventricular dysfunction) that could complicate attempts to increase a patient’s level of exercise.However, these comorbidities do not preclude application of other components of pulmonary rehabilitation.Complications There are no complications of pulmonary rehabilitation beyond those expected from physical exertion and exercise.Procedure Pulmonary rehabilitation is best administered as part of an integrated program of Exercise training Education Psychosocial and behavioral interventions Pulmonary rehabilitation is delivered by a team of physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, and psychologists or social workers.The intervention should be individualized and targeted to the patient's needs.Pulmonary rehabilitation can be started at any stage of disease with the goal of minimizing disease burden and symptoms.Exercise training involves aerobic exercise and respiratory muscle and upper and lower extremity strength training.There is increasing evidence to support doing both strength training and interval training of the extremities.Interval training is alternating short bursts (eg, 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer periods (eg, 2 minutes) of less intense activity.Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is often a component of pulmonary rehabilitation.IMT uses devices that impose a resistive load that is set at a fraction of an individual's maximal inspiratory pressure.Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) uses a device that applies transcutaneous electrical impulses to selected muscles to stimulate contraction.NMES can be effective in patients with severe lung disease because it minimizes circulatory demand and does not cause the dyspnea that often limits these patients from participating in typical exercise training.Thus, neuromuscular electrical stimulation is uniquely suited for patients with significant deconditioning or for patients with an acute exacerbation of respiratory failure.Education has many components.Counseling about the need for smoking cessation Smoking Cessation Most smokers want to quit and have tried doing so with limited success.Nutritional counseling can be given if needed.Teaching breathing strategies (such as pursed-lip breathing, in which exhalations are begun against closed lips to decrease respiratory rate, thereby decreasing gas trapping) and the principles of conserving physical energy are helpful.Explaining treatment, including using drugs correctly and planning for end of life care The Dying Patient Dying patients can have needs that differ from those of other patients.So that their needs can be met, dying patients must first be identified.Psychosocial interventions involve counseling and feedback for the depression, anxieties, and fear that hinder the patient’s full participation in activities.Behavioral modification strategies and an emphasis on self-management are critical components of pulmonary rehabilitation.Although the most optimal maintenance strategy is unknown, continued participation in an exercise program is essential to maintain the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8751, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

Heredity is the passing of genes from one generation to the next.In some states, the disorder is detected with newborn screening tests Newborn Screening Tests Many serious disorders that are not apparent at birth can nonetheless be detected by various screening tests.There are two main types of tyrosinemia and a third, uncommon form: Type I Type II Type III (rare) Type I tyrosinemia Type I tyrosinemia is most common among children of French-Canadian or Scandinavian descent.Newborns may have liver failure.Older infants and children have dysfunction of the liver, kidneys, and nerves, resulting in irritability, rickets Hypophosphatemic Rickets Hypophosphatemic rickets is a disorder in which the bones become painfully soft and bend easily because the blood contains low levels of the electrolyte phosphate.Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.Every state in the United States requires all newborns be screened for type I tyrosinemia with a blood test.To confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing or other tests of the blood and urine and a biopsy of the liver are done.Restriction of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet is recommended.A drug called nitisinone (also known as NTBC), which blocks production of toxic metabolites, may help children with type I tyrosinemia.Often, children with type I tyrosinemia require a liver transplant Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions.Type II tyrosinemia Type II tyrosinemia is less common.Diagnosis of type II tyrosinemia is with a blood test.Other tests of the blood and urine and a biopsy of the liver may be done.Treatment of type II tyrosinemia is by restricting tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet.Type III tyrosinemia Type III tyrosinemia is very rare.Diagnosis of type III tyrosinemia is with a newborn blood screening test.Urine and blood tests may also be done if the screening is abnormal.Treatment of type III tyrosinemia is by restricting tyrosine and phenylalanine in the diet.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4389, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Anxiety may result in physical symptoms.Diagnosis is clinical.Treatment is with behavioral therapy and drugs, usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Some anxiety is a normal aspect of development, as in the following: Most toddlers become fearful when separated from their mother, especially in unfamiliar surroundings.Fears of the dark, monsters, bugs, and spiders are common in 3- to 4-year-olds.Shy children may initially react to new situations with fear or withdrawal.Fears of injury and death are more common among older children.Older children and adolescents often become anxious when giving a book report in front of their classmates.Such difficulties should not be viewed as evidence of a disorder.However, if manifestations of anxiety become so exaggerated that they greatly impair function or cause severe distress and/or avoidance, an anxiety disorder should be considered.Anxiety disorders emerge in about 3% of 6-year-olds and in about 5% of teenage boys and 10% of teenage girls (1–3 General references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and

phobic disorders consist of persistent, unreasonable, intense fears (phobias) of specific situations, circumstances, or objects.Etiology Evidence suggests that anxiety disorders involve dysfunction in the parts of the limbic system and hippocampus that regulate emotions and response to fear.In mice, loss of expression of the serotonin 1A-receptor (5-HT1AR) in the forebrain during early development results in dysregulation of the hippocampus and leads to anxiety behaviors (1 Etiology reference Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Heritability studies indicate a role for genetic and environmental factors.No specific genes have been identified; many genetic variants are probably involved.Anxious parents tend to have anxious children; having such parents may make children’s problems worse than they otherwise might be.Even normal children have difficulty remaining calm and composed in the presence of an anxious parent, and children who are genetically predisposed to anxiety have even greater difficulty.In as many as 30% of cases, treating the parents’ anxiety in conjunction with the child’s anxiety is helpful (for anxiety disorders in adults, see Anxiety Disorders Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.Symptoms and Signs Perhaps the most common manifestation of an anxiety disorder in children and adolescents is school refusal.“School refusal” has largely supplanted the term “school phobia.” Actual fear of school is exceedingly rare.Most children who refuse to go to school probably have separation anxiety, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or a combination.Some have a specific phobia.The possibility that the child is being bullied at school must also be considered.Some children complain directly about their anxiety, describing it in terms of worries—eg, “I am worried that I will never see you again” (separation anxiety) or “I am worried the kids will laugh at me” (social anxiety disorder).However, most children couch their discomfort in terms of somatic complaints: “I cannot go to school because I have a stomachache.” These children are often telling the truth because an upset stomach, nausea, headaches, and sleep problems often develop in children with anxiety.Several long-term follow-up studies confirm that many children with somatic complaints, especially abdominal pain, have an underlying anxiety disorder.Diagnosis Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of an anxiety disorder is through a clinical assessment (1 Diagnosis reference Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.A thorough psychosocial history can usually confirm it.Rating scales can be useful for screening.Several validated scales are freely available: Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders [SCARED] , Spence Children's Anxiety Scale [SCAS] , Preschool Anxiety Scale [PAS] , and General Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7] ).The physical symptoms that anxiety can cause in children can complicate the evaluation.In many children, considerable testing for physical disorders is done before clinicians consider an anxiety disorder.Prognosis depends on severity, availability of competent treatment, and the child’s resiliency.Many children struggle with anxiety symptoms into adulthood.However, with early treatment, many children learn how to control their anxiety.Treatment Behavioral therapy (exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy [ 1 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at handParent-child and family interventions Drugs, usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and to a lesser degree, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) and tricyclic antidepressants (2 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at handTreatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Anxiety disorders in children are treated with behavioral therapy (using principles of exposure and response prevention), sometimes in conjunction with drug therapy (4 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.In exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), children are systematically exposed to the anxiety-provoking situation in a graded fashion.By helping children remain in the anxiety-provoking situation (response prevention), therapists enable them to gradually become desensitized and feel less anxiety.Behavioral therapy is most effective when an experienced therapist knowledgeable in child development individualizes these principles.In mild cases, behavioral therapy alone is usually sufficient, but drug therapy may be needed when cases are more severe or when access to an experienced child behavior therapist is limited.SSRIs are usually the first choice for long-term treatment .SSRIs combined with CBT have the highest likelihood of improving symptoms (4 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Benzodiazepines are better for acute anxiety (eg, due to a medical procedure) but are not preferred for long-term treatment.Benzodiazepines with a short-half life (eg, lorazepam 0.05 mg/kg to a maximum of 2 mg in a single dose) are the best choice.Buspirone was found to be well tolerated in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17) with a generalized anxiety disorder (1 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Reports of improvement in developmental disorders such as Williams syndrome (5 Treatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at handTreatment references Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, or dread that greatly impairs the ability to function normally and that is disproportionate to the circumstances at hand.Occasionally, upset stomach, diarrhea, insomnia, or weight gain may occur.Some children have behavioral adverse effects (eg, agitation, disinhibition); these effects are usually mild to moderate.Usually, decreasing the drug dose or changing to a different drug eliminates or reduces these effects.Rarely, behavioral adverse effects (eg, aggressiveness, increased suicidality) are severe.Behavioral adverse effects are idiosyncratic and may occur with any antidepressant and at any time during treatment.As a result, children and adolescents taking such drugs must be closely monitored.Key Points The most common manifestation of an anxiety disorder may be school refusal; most children couch their discomfort in terms of somatic complaints.Consider anxiety as a disorder in children only when anxiety becomes so exaggerated that it greatly impairs functioning or causes severe distress and/or avoidance.The physical symptoms that anxiety can cause in children can complicate the evaluation.Behavioral therapy (using principles of exposure and response prevention) is most effective when done by an experienced therapist who is knowledgeable about child development and who tailors these principles to the child.When cases are more severe or when access to an experienced child behavior therapist is limited, drugs may be needed.Commercially available panels testing for CYP variants remain limited.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8086, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",

{"text": "【0】 Originating in China several millennia ago, traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that illness results from the imbalance of the life force (qi, pronounced chee) through the body.Qi is restored by balancing the opposing forces of yin (dark, feminine, negative forces) and yang (bright, masculine, positive forces), which manifest in the body as cold and heat, internal and external, and deficiency and excess.Various practices are used to preserve and restore qi and thus health.Most commonly used are Acupuncture, a therapy within traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the most widely accepted CAM therapies in the Western worldQi gong Other practices include diet and massage Professional rehabilitation therapists treat pain and inflammation.Such treatment makes movement easier and enables people to participate more fully in rehabilitation.Traditional Chinese medicine uses formulas containing mixtures of herbs to treat various ailments.Determining whether these mixtures are safe and effective is difficult.One problem is that standardization and quality control are almost nonexistent.Thus, the following can result: Proportions of herbs in the same mixture may vary.The amount of the active ingredient can vary from one source for herbs to another.Mixtures may contain various other substances (such as drugs produced by pharmaceutical companies) or may be contaminated with toxic heavy metals.Because mixtures can vary so much and because there are so many mixtures that could be studied, most conventional research usually studies one herb, not a mixture.However, one herb, used alone rather than as a part of a mixture, may not be considered effective by traditional practitioners Medicinal uses Chinese herbal mixtures have been used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, Tourette syndrome, and many other disorders.For the most part, evidence that these mixtures are effective is weak or inconclusive, although conclusive evidence is difficult to obtain because of the variability of the types and compositions of the herbs used.For example, some evidence suggests that the herb Astragalus may improve quality of life for people being treated with chemotherapy for lung cancer.However, it does not prolong life or slow the progression of cancer.In such cases, more research is needed to determine whether the herbs are effective.Possible side effects Each herb and mixture may have its own unique side effects.For example, an herb called ma huang (Ephedra), an ingredient in many remedies, is a stimulant that can increase heart rate and blood pressure and thus increase the risk of stroke or heart attack.In herbal mixtures, adverse effects may also result from interactions between active ingredients.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5826, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Priapism is painful, persistent, abnormal erection unaccompanied by sexual desire or excitation.It is most common in boys aged 5 to 10 years and in men aged 20 to 50 years.Pathophysiology of Priapism The penis is composed of 3 corporeal bodies: 2 corpora cavernosa and 1 corpus spongiosum.Erection is the result of smooth muscle relaxation and increased arterial flow into the corpora cavernosa, causing engorgement and rigidity.Ischemic priapism Most cases of priapism involve failure of detumescence and are most commonly due to failure of venous outflow (ie, low flow), also known as ischemic priapism.Severe pain from ischemia occurs after 4 hours.If prolonged > 4 hours, priapism can lead to corporeal fibrosis and subsequent erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.Stuttering priapism is a recurrent form of ischemic priapism with repeated episodes and intervening periods of detumescence.Nonischemic priapism Less commonly, priapism is due to unregulated arterial inflow (ie, high flow), usually as a result of formation of an arterial fistula after trauma.Nonischemic priapism is not painful and does not lead to necrosis.Subsequent erectile dysfunction is common.Etiology of Priapism In adults, the most common cause In children, the most common causes are Hematologic disorders (eg, sickle cell disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestryIn many cases, priapism may be idiopathic and recurrent.Table Evaluation of Priapism requires urgent treatment to prevent chronic complications (primarily erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse.Evaluation and treatment should be done simultaneously.History of present illness should cover the duration of erection, presence of partial or complete rigidity, presence or absence of pain, and any recent or past genital trauma.The drug history should be reviewed for offending drugs, and patients should be directly asked about the use of recreational drugs and medications used to treat erectile dysfunction.Review of systems should seek symptoms suggesting a cause, including dysuria is painful or uncomfortable urination, typically a sharp, burning sensation.Some disorders cause a painful ache over the bladder or perineumProstate Cancer Prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma.Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain.Past medical history should identify known conditions associated with priapism , particularly hematologic disorders.Patients should be asked about a family history of hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestryThalassemias Thalassemias are a group of inherited microcytic, hemolytic anemias characterized by defective hemoglobin synthesis.Physical examination A focused genital examination should be done to evaluate extent of rigidity and tenderness and determine whether the glans and corpus spongiosum are also affected.Penile or perineal trauma and signs of infection, inflammation, or gangrenous change should be noted.The general examination should note any psychomotor agitation, and the head and neck examination should look for pupillary dilation associated with stimulant use.The abdomen and suprapubic area should be palpated to detect any masses or splenomegaly, and a digital rectal examination should be done to detect prostatic enlargement or other pathology.Neurologic examination is useful to detect any signs of lower-extremity weakness or saddle paresthesias that might indicate spinal pathology.Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Pain Priapism in a child Recent trauma Fever and night sweats Perineal and/or lower extremity neurologic manifestations Interpretation of findings In most cases, the clinical history reveals a history of drug treatment for erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction Erectile dysfunction is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourseSickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry.In patients with ischemic priapism, physical examination typically reveals complete rigidity with pain and tenderness of the corpus cavernosa and sparing of the glans and corpus spongiosum.By contrast, nonischemic priapism is painless and nontender, and the penis may be partially or completely rigidOverview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systemsComplete blood count Urinalysis and culture Hemoglobin electrophoresis in Black people and men of Mediterranean descent Many clinicians also do drug screening, intracavernosal arterial blood gas testing, and duplex ultrasonography Variations of Ultrasonography In ultrasonography, a signal generator is combined with a transducer.Penile duplex ultrasonography will show little or absent cavernosal blood flow in men with ischemic priapism and normal to high cavernosal blood flow in men with nonischemic priapism.Ultrasonography may also reveal anatomic abnormalities, such as cavernous arterial fistula or pseudoaneurysm, which usually indicate nonischemic priapism.Occasionally, MRI with contrast is useful to demonstrate arteriovenous fistulas Arteriovenous Fistula An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal communication between an artery and a veinOverview of Aortic Aneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries caused by weakening of the arterial wall.Treatment of Priapism Treatment is often difficult and sometimes unsuccessful, even when the etiology is known.Whenever possible, patients should be referred to an emergency department; patients should preferably be seen and treated urgently by a urologist.Other disorders should be treated.For example, priapism often resolves when sickle cell crisis is treated.Measures used to treat priapism itself depend on the type.Ischemic priapism Treatment should begin immediately, typically with aspiration of blood from the base of one of the corpora cavernosa using a nonheparinized syringe, often with saline irrigation and intracavernous injection of the alpha-receptor agonist phenylephrine.For phenylephrine injections, 1 mL of 1% phenylephrine (10 mg/mL) is added to 19 mL of 0.9% saline to make 500 mcg/mL; 100 to 500 mcg (0.2 to 1 mL) is injected every 5 to 10 minutes until relief occurs or a total dose of 1000 mcg is given.Before aspiration or injection, anesthesia is provided with a dorsal penile nerve block or local infiltration.If these measures are unsuccessful or if priapism has lasted > 48 hours (and is thus unlikely to resolve with these measures), a surgical shunt can be created between the corpus cavernosum and glans penis or corpus spongiosum and another vein.Stuttering priapism Stuttering priapism, when acute, is treated in the same way as other forms of ischemic priapism.There is a report of several cases caused by sickle cell disease Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry.Treatments that may help prevent recurrences of stuttering priapism include antiandrogen therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, estrogen, bicalutamide, flutamide, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, and ketoconazole.The goal of antiandrogen therapy is to decrease the plasma testosterone level to < 10% of normal.Digoxin, terbutaline, gabapentin, and hydroxyurea have also been tried with some success.Nonischemic priapism Conservative therapy (eg, ice packs and analgesics) is usually successful; if not, selective embolization or surgery is indicated.Refractory priapism If other treatments are ineffective, a penile prosthesis can be placed.Key Points Priapism requires urgent evaluation and treatment.Drugs (prescription and recreational) and sickle cell disease are the most common causes.Acute treatment is with alpha agonists, needle decompression, or both.",

{"text": "【0】 Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are conditions related to abnormalities of enzymes involved in the production of heme and characterized by sensitivity to sunlight.The heme precursor protoporphyrin accumulates in the bone marrow, red blood cells, and other tissues, including skin.People have severe skin pain and swelling soon after exposure to sunlight.Doctors test blood to look for elevated levels of protoporphyrin.People should avoid exposure to sunlight.Afamelanotide, a medication that stimulates the production of more melanin, can decrease sensitivity to sunlight and improve quality of life.Porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by abnormalities of enzymes involved in the production of heme.Heme is a chemical compound that contains iron and gives blood its red color.Heme is a key component of several important proteins in the body. Heme is a chemical compound that contains iron and gives blood its red color.Accumulation of protoporphyrin in the skin results in extreme sensitivity to sunlight and severe pain soon after exposure.The sunlight activates the protoporphyrin molecules, which damage the surrounding tissue.Accumulation of protoporphyrins in the liver can cause liver damage.Protoporphyrins excreted in the bile can often lead to gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder.Erythropoietic protoporphyria Erythropoietic protoporphyria is uncommon.It usually appears in childhood.In most people with erythropoietic protoporphyria, a deficiency of the enzyme ferrochelatase leads to accumulation of the heme precursor protoporphyrin Overview of Porphyrias are a group of disorders caused by deficiencies of enzymes involved in the production of heme.Heme is a chemical compound that contains iron and gives blood its red color.The enzyme deficiency is inherited from both parents.X-linked protoporphyria About 10% of people who have the symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria actually have increased activity of a different enzyme.The increased activity leads to accumulation of the same heme precursor.However, the abnormal gene for this form of erythropoietic protoporphyria is carried on the X-chromosome Inheritance of Single-Gene Disorders Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.Because X-linked protoporphyria is so similar to erythropoietic protoporphyria, it is sometimes regarded as a variant of erythropoietic protoporphyria.Symptoms usually start in childhood.Severe skin pain and swelling develop soon after even brief exposure to sunlight.Crusting may develop around the lips and on the back of the hands after prolonged sun exposure.Because blistering and scarring do not occur, doctors usually do not recognize the disorder.Skin Symptoms in Erythropoietic Protoporphyria Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (Sun Sensitivity) These children with erythropoietic protoporhyria have redness, hyperpigmentation (darkening), and crusting on the face and redness and swelling of the hands after sun exposure.© Springer Science+Business Media Erythropoietic Protoporphyria This photo shows rough, thickened, and leathery skin on the hand of a person who has erythropoietic protoporphyria.By permission of the publisher.From Bloomer J, Risheg H.In Gastroenterology and Hepatology: Liver.Edited by M Feldman (series editor) and WC Maddrey.Philadelphia, Current Medicine, 2004.Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (Carp Mouth) This photo shows deep grooves (carp mouth) that have developed in a person who has erythropoietic protoporphyria.© Springer Science+Business Media gallstones are collections of solid material (predominantly crystals of cholesterol) in the gallbladder.Liver damage may lead to increasing liver failure Liver Failure Liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function.Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.If skin protection is chronically neglected, rough, thickened, and leathery skin (lichenification) may develop, especially over the knuckles.Deep grooves may develop around the mouth (carp mouth).People with X-linked protoporphyria tend to have higher levels of protoporphyrin in their red blood cells, plasma, and other tissues and, therefore, more severe reactions to sunlight and more severe liver disease than those with erythropoietic protoporphyria.Children in whom erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria is unrecognized may develop psychosocial problems because they inexplicably refuse to go outdoors.They have often been misdiagnosed for years as having \"allergy\" to sunlight.The fear or anticipation of pain may be so distressing that children become nervous, tense, aggressive, or develop feelings of detachment from the surroundings or even suicidal thoughts. Young children often cannot describe their symptoms, so doctors and parents may have difficulty connecting their discomfort to sun exposure.Diagnosis Blood tests The diagnosis is made when increased levels of protoporphyrin are detected in red blood cells and blood plasma (the liquid portion of blood).The diagnosis cannot be made with testing of the urine because excess protoporphyrin is not excreted into the urine.Genetic testing may be done.Family members may also be tested to determine whether they also have the gene mutation.Treatment Relief of symptoms of attacks Treat gallstones and liver problems Acute skin symptoms may be alleviated by cold baths or wet towels, analgesics, and topical and/or oral corticosteroids.Symptoms can take up to a week to resolve.If these measures are ineffective, doctors sometimes give heme and/or blood transfusions.Several other medications such as afamelanotide, bile acids, cholestyramine resin, and charcoal are also effective.People who develop gallstones that contain protoporphyrin and develop symptoms of cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder wall) may need to have the gallbladder surgically removed.Porphyrin accumulation in red blood cells and the condition of the liver should be monitored yearly by testing blood, urine, and stool samples.Vaccination against hepatitis A and B may help prevent liver damage.Liver damage, if severe, may necessitate liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the surgical removal of a healthy liver or sometimes a part of a liver from a living person and then its transfer into a person whose liver no longer functions.Because sunlight provides needed vitamin D and people with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria avoid sunlight, they may need to take vitamin D supplements to prevent vitamin D deficiency.Stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder.Prevention of Attacks Extreme care should be taken to avoid exposure to sunlight.People should use protective clothing, hats, and light-opaque sunscreens containing titanium dioxide or zinc oxide.Accidental sun exposure is given the same treatment as is Sunburn results from a brief (acute) overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light.Overexposure to ultraviolet light causes sunburn.The medication afamelanotide helps people better tolerate sunlight.However, sunlight should still be avoided.Medications that trigger acute porphyrias do not cause erythropoietic protoporphyria and need not be avoided.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5086, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Dyslipidemia is elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), or both, or a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary.Diagnosis is by measuring plasma levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and individual lipoproteins.Treatment involves dietary changes, exercise, and lipid-lowering drugs. There is no natural cutoff between normal and abnormal lipid levels because lipid measurements are continuous.A linear relation probably exists between lipid levels and cardiovascular risk, so many people with “normal” cholesterol levels benefit from achieving still lower levels.Consequently, there are no numeric definitions of dyslipidemia; the term is applied to lipid levels for which treatment has proven beneficial.Proof of benefit is strongest for lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels.In the overall population, evidence is less strong for a benefit from lowering elevated TG and increasing low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels.HDL levels do not always predict cardiovascular risk.For example, high HDL levels caused by some genetic disorders may not protect against cardiovascular disorders, and low HDL levels caused by some genetic disorders may not increase the risk of cardiovascular disorders.Although HDL levels predict cardiovascular risk in the overall population, the increased risk may be caused by other factors, such as accompanying lipid and metabolic abnormalities, such as hypertriglyceridemia, rather than the HDL level itself.Classification of Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemias were traditionally classified by patterns of elevation in lipids and lipoproteins (Fredrickson phenotype—see table Lipoprotein Patterns Lipoprotein Patterns (Fredrickson Phenotypes) ).A more practical system categorizes dyslipidemias as primary or secondary and characterizes them by Increases in cholesterol only (pure or isolated hypercholesterolemia) Increases in TGs only (pure or isolated hypertriglyceridemia), Increases in both cholesterol and TGs (mixed or combined hyperlipidemias) This system does not take into account specific lipoprotein abnormalities (eg, low HDL or high LDL) that may contribute to disease despite normal cholesterol and TG levels.Table Etiology of Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemias may be Primary: Genetic Secondary: Caused by lifestyle and other factors Both primary and secondary causes contribute to dyslipidemias in varying degrees.For example, in familial combined hyperlipidemia, expression may occur only in the presence of significant secondary causes.Primary causes Primary causes are single or multiple gene mutations that result in either overproduction or defective clearance of triglycerides and LDL, or in underproduction or excessive clearance of HDL  Dyslipidemias Genetic (Primary) Dyslipidemias ).The names of many primary disorders reflect an old nomenclature in which lipoproteins were detected and distinguished by how they separated into alpha (HDL) and beta (LDL) bands on electrophoretic gels.Table Secondary causes Secondary causes contribute to many cases of dyslipidemia in adults.The most important secondary cause of dyslipidemia in high-resource countries is A sedentary lifestyle with excessive dietary intake of total calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats Trans fats are polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids to which hydrogen atoms have been added; they are used in some processed foods and are as atherogenic as saturated fat.Other common secondary causes of dyslipidemia include Diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemiaChronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal functionAlcohol overuse Alcohol Use Disorder and Rehabilitation Alcohol use disorder involves a pattern of alcohol use that typically includes craving and manifestations of tolerance and/or withdrawal along with adverse psychosocial consequencesHypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency.Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skinOverview of Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is urinary excretion of > 3 g of protein/day due to a glomerular disorder plus edema and hypoalbuminemia.Diabetes is an especially significant secondary cause because patients tend to have an atherogenic combination of high TGs; high small, dense LDL fractions; and low HDL (diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemic hyperapo B).Patients with type 2 diabetes are especially at risk.The combination may be a consequence of obesity, poor control of diabetes, or both, which may increase circulating free fatty acids (FFAs), leading to increased hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production.TG-rich VLDL then transfers TG and cholesterol to LDL and HDL, promoting formation of TG-rich, small, dense LDL and clearance of TG-rich HDL.Diabetic dyslipidemia is often exacerbated by the increased caloric intake and physical inactivity that characterize the lifestyles of some patients with type 2 diabetes.Women with diabetes may be at special risk of cardiac disease as a result of this form of dyslipidemia.Symptoms and Signs of Dyslipidemia itself usually causes no symptoms but can lead to symptomatic vascular disease, including coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromasCAD), stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficitPeripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia.High levels of triglycerides (> 500 mg/dL [> 5.65 mmol/L]) can cause acute pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake.Very high triglyceride levels can also cause hepatosplenomegaly, paresthesias, dyspnea, and confusion.High levels of LDL can cause arcus corneae and tendinous xanthomas at the Achilles, elbow, and knee tendons and over metacarpophalangeal joints.Other clinical findings that occur in patients with high LDL (eg, in familial hypercholesterolemia) include xanthelasma (lipid rich yellow plaques on the medial eyelids).Patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia may have arcus corneae, tendinous xanthomas and xanthelasma plus planar or tuberous xanthomas.Planar xanthomas are flat or slightly raised yellowish patches.Tuberous xanthomas are painless, firm nodules typically located over extensor surfaces of joints.Patients with severe elevations of TGs can have eruptive xanthomas over the trunk, back, elbows, buttocks, knees, hands, and feet.Patients with the rare dysbetalipoproteinemia can have palmar and tuberous xanthomas.Severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 2000 mg/dL [> 22.6 mmol/L]) can give retinal arteries and veins a creamy white appearance (lipemia retinalis).Extremely high lipid levels also give a lactescent (milky) appearance to blood plasma.Symptoms can include paresthesias, dypsnea, and confusion.Xanthoma Manifestations Eruptive Xanthoma (Skin) Eruptive xanthomas are skin manifestations of elevated triglyceride levels.Image provided by Thomas Habif,

H.Davidson, MD.Diagnosis of Dyslipidemia Serum lipid profile (measured total cholesterol, TG, and HDL cholesterol and calculated LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol) Dyslipidemia is suspected in patients with characteristic physical findings or complications of dyslipidemia (eg, atherosclerotic disease).Primary lipid disorders are suspected when patients have Physical signs of dyslipidemia such as tendon xanthomas, which are pathognomonic for familial hypercholesterolemia Onset of premature atherosclerotic disease (men < 55 years, women < 60 years) A family history of premature atherosclerotic disease or severe hyperlipidemia Serum cholesterol > 190 mg/dL (> 4.9 mmol/L) Dyslipidemia is diagnosed by measuring serum lipids.Routine measurements (lipid profile) include total cholesterol (TC), TGs, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol.Lipid profile measurement Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol are measured directly.TC and TG values reflect cholesterol and TGs in all circulating lipoproteins, including chylomicrons, VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL, and HDL.TC values can vary by 10% and TGs by up to 25% day-to-day even in the absence of a disorder.TC and HDL cholesterol can be measured in the nonfasting state, but most patients should have all lipids measured while fasting (usually for 12 hours) for maximum accuracy and consistency.Pearls & Pitfalls Total and HDL cholesterol can be measured in the nonfasting state, but most patients should have all lipids measured while fasting (usually for 12 hours) for maximum accuracy and consistency.Testing should be postponed until after resolution of acute illness because TG and lipoprotein(a) levels increase and cholesterol levels decrease in inflammatory states.Lipid profiles can vary for about 30 days after an acute myocardial infarction (MI); however, results obtained within 24 hours after MI are usually reliable enough to guide initial lipid-lowering therapy.LDL cholesterol values are most often calculated as the amount of cholesterol not contained in HDL and VLDL.VLDL is estimated by TG ÷ 5 because the cholesterol concentration in VLDL particles is usually one fifth of the total lipid in the particle.Thus, This calculation is valid only when TGs are < 400 mg/dL (< 4.5 mmol/L) and patients are fasting because eating increases TGs.The calculated LDL cholesterol value incorporates measures of all non-HDL, nonchylomicron cholesterol, including that in IDL and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)].LDL can also be measured directly using plasma ultracentrifugation, which separates chylomicrons and VLDL fractions from HDL and LDL, and by an immunoassay method.Direct measurement may be useful in some patients with elevated TGs, but these direct measurements are not routinely necessary.The role of apo B testing is under study because values reflect all non-HDL cholesterol (in VLDL, IDL, and LDL) and may be more predictive of CAD risk than LDL cholesterol.Non-HDL cholesterol (TC − HDL cholesterol) may also be more predictive of CAD risk than LDL cholesterol, especially in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.Other tests Patients with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease with normal or near-normal lipid levels, or high LDL levels refractory to drug therapy should have Lp(a) levels measured.Lp(a) levels may also be directly measured in patients with borderline high LDL cholesterol levels to determine whether drug therapy is warranted.C-reactive protein may be measured in the same populations.Measurements of LDL particle number or apoprotein B-100 (apo B) may be useful in patients with elevated TGs and the metabolic syndrome.Apo B provides similar information to LDL particle number because there is one apo B molecule for each LDL particle.Apo B measurement includes all atherogenic particles, including remnants and Lp(a).Secondary causes Tests for secondary causes of dyslipidemia should be done in most patients with newly diagnosed dyslipidemia and when a component of the lipid profile has inexplicably changed for the worse.Such tests include measurements of Creatinine Fasting glucose Liver enzymes Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Urinary protein Screening is done using a fasting lipid profile (TC, TGs, HDL cholesterol, and calculated LDL cholesterol).Different medical societies have different recommendations on when to begin screening.Lipid measurement should be accompanied by assessment for other cardiovascular risk factors, including Cigarette use Diabetes mellitus Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemiaFamily history of CAD Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromasHypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothScreening in children Most physicians recommend screening per the 2012 National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents as follows Children with risk factors (eg, diabetes Mellitus in Children and Adolescents Diabetes mellitus involves absence of insulin secretion (type 1) or peripheral insulin resistance (type 2), causing hyperglycemia.A definite age after which patients no longer require screening has not been established, but evidence supports screening of patients into their 80s, especially in the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Patients with an extensive family history of heart disease should also be screened by measuring Lp(a) levels.Treatment of Dyslipidemia Risk assessment by explicit criteria Lifestyle changes (eg, exercise, dietary modification) For high LDL cholesterol, statins, bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors For high TG, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and sometimes other measures General principles The main indication for dyslipidemia treatment is prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including acute coronary syndromes Overview of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) Acute coronary syndromes result from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryOverview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficitPeripheral Arterial Disease Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower) causing ischemia.Treatment is indicated for all patients with ASCVD (secondary prevention) and for some without (primary prevention).Treatment of children is controversial; dietary changes may be difficult to implement, and no data suggest that lowering lipid levels in childhood effectively prevents heart disease in adulthood.Moreover, the safety and effectiveness of long-term lipid-lowering treatment are questionable.Children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia should be treated beginning at age 8 to 10.Children with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia require diet, drugs, and often LDL apheresis to prevent premature death; treatment is begun when the diagnosis is made.Treatment options depend on the specific lipid abnormality, although different lipid abnormalities often coexist.In some patients, a single abnormality may require several therapies; in others, a single treatment may be adequate for several abnormalities.Treatment should always include treatment of hypertension Treatment Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothTreatment Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemiaSmoking Cessation Most smokers want to quit and have tried doing so with limited success.In general, treatment options for men and women are the same.Elevated LDL cholesterol treatment For all individuals, the prevention of ASCVD requires an emphasis on a heart-healthy lifestyle, particularly diet and exercise.Other options to lower LDL cholesterol in all age groups include drugs, dietary supplements, procedural interventions, and experimental therapies.Many of these options are also effective for treating other lipid abnormalities.Dietary changes include Decreasing intake of saturated fats and cholesterol Increasing the proportion of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates Maintaining ideal body weight Referral to a dietitian is often useful, especially for older people.Exercise lowers LDL cholesterol in some people and also helps maintain ideal body weight.Dietary changes and exercise should be used whenever feasible, but AHA/ACC guidelines recommend also using drug treatment for certain groups of patients after discussion of the risks and benefits of statin therapy.For drug treatment in adults, the 2018 AHA/ACC/ Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommends treatment with a statin for 4 groups of patients, comprised of those with any of the following: Clinical ASCVD LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75, with diabetes and LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75, LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), and estimated 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥ 7.5% Risk of ASCVD is estimated using the pooled cohort risk assessment equations, which replace previous risk calculation tools.This new risk calculator is based on sex, age, race, total and HDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure , diabetes and smoking status, and use of antihypertensives or statins.When considering whether to give a statin, clinicians may also take into account other factors, including LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L), family history of premature ASCVD (ie, age of onset < 55 in male 1st degree relative, or < 65 in female 1st degree relative), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L (≥ 19 nmol/L), coronary artery calcium score ≥ 300 Agatston units (or ≥ 75th percentile for the patient's demographic), ankle-brachial index < 0.9, and increased lifetime risk.Increased lifetime risk (identified using the ACC/AHA risk calculator) is relevant because 10-year risk may be low in younger patients, in whom longer-term risk should be taken into account.Statins are the treatment of choice for LDL cholesterol reduction because they demonstrably reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, leading to up-regulation of LDL receptors and increased LDL clearance.They reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 60% and produce small increases in HDL and modest decreases in TGs.Statins also appear to decrease intra-arterial inflammation, systemic inflammation, or both by stimulating production of endothelial nitric oxide and may have other beneficial effects.Other classes of lipid-lowering drugs are not the first choice because they have not demonstrated equivalent efficacy for decreasing ASCVD.Statin treatment is classified as high, moderate, or low intensity and is given based on treatment group and age .The choice of statin may depend on the patient's co-morbidities, other drugs, risk factors for adverse events, statin intolerance, cost, and patient preference.Adverse effects with statins are uncommon but include liver enzyme elevations and myositis or Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome involving the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue.Liver enzyme elevations are uncommon, and serious liver toxicity is extremely rare.Muscle problems occur in up to 10% of patients taking statins and may be dose-dependent.Muscle symptoms can occur without enzyme elevation.Adverse effects are more common among older patients, patients with several disorders, and patients taking several drugs.In some patients, changing from one statin to another or lowering the dose (after temporarily discontinuing the drug) relieves the problem.Muscle toxicity seems to be most common when some of the statins are used with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P3A4 (eg, macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals, cyclosporine) and with fibrates, especially gemfibrozil.Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.In patients with ASCVD, the more that LDL-C is reduced by statin therapy the greater the risk reduction.Thus, initial treatment is a statin at maximally tolerated dose to lower LDL cholesterol by > 50% (high-intensity therapy).For very high risk ASCVD patients (eg, those with a recent myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryUnstable Angina Unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction.Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresisMellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemiaLDL-C level > 70 mg/dL (> 1.2 mmol/L) despite maximal statin therapy should prompt the addition of ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor (eg, evolocumab, alirocumab).Table The adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase inhibitor, bempedoic acid, is a first-in-class oral drug that impairs cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases LDL receptors.It lowers LDL cholesterol by 15 to 17%.Bempedoic acid is especially useful in patients with statin-associated muscle adverse effects because it does not cause muscle pain or weakness.It can be used as monotherapy or as an add-on to other lipid-lowering therapy.It is also commercially available in combination with ezetimibe.Risks include hyperuricemia and tendon rupture.Bile acid sequestrants block intestinal bile acid reabsorption, forcing up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors to recruit circulating cholesterol for bile synthesis.They are proved to reduce cardiovascular mortality.Bile acid sequestrants are usually used with statins or with nicotinic acid Low HDL to augment LDL cholesterol reduction and are the drugs of choice for women who are or are planning to become pregnant.Bile acid sequestrants are safe, but their use is limited by adverse effects of bloating, nausea, cramping, and constipation.They may also increase TGs, so their use is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.Cholestyramine, colestipol, and colesevelam (but to a lesser degree), interfere with absorption of other drugs—notably thiazides, beta-blockers, warfarin, digoxin, and thyroxine—an effect that can be decreased by administration at least 4 hours before or 1 hour after other drugs.Bile acid sequestrants should be given with meals to increase their efficacy.Cholesterol absorption inhibitors, such as ezetimibe, inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol.Ezetimibe usually lowers LDL cholesterol by 15 to 20% and causes small increases in HDL and a mild decrease in triglycerides.Ezetimibe can be used as monotherapy in patients intolerant to statins or added to statins for patients taking maximum statin doses with persistent LDL cholesterol elevation.Adverse effects are infrequent.PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are available as subcutaneous injections given once or twice per month.These drugs keep PCSK9 from attaching to LDL receptors, leading to improved function of these receptors.LDL cholesterol is lowered by 40 to 70%.Dietary supplements that lower LDL cholesterol levels include fiber supplements and commercially available margarines and other products containing plant sterols (sitosterol, campesterol) or stanols.Fiber supplements decrease cholesterol levels in multiple ways, including decreased absorption and increased excretion.Oat-based fiber supplements can decrease total cholesterol by up to 18%.Plant sterols and stanols decrease cholesterol absorption by displacing cholesterol from intestinal micelles and can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 10% without affecting HDL or TGs.Drugs for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia include PCSK9 inhibitors, lomitapide, and evinacumab.Lomitapide is an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that interferes with the secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins in the liver and intestine.Dose is begun low and gradually titrated up about every 2 weeks.Patients must follow a diet with less than 20% of calories from fat.Lomitapide can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, diarrhea, increased hepatic fat, elevated liver enzymes).Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like protein 3, an inhibitor of LPL and endothelial lipase.It can decrease LDL cholesterol (by 47%), TG, and HDL cholesterol.Evinacumab is given by intravenous infusion once monthly.It can cause gout, influenza-like illness, and infusion reactions.Procedural approaches are reserved for patients with severe hyperlipidemia (LDL cholesterol > 300 mg/dL [> 7.74 mmol/L]) and no vascular disease.LDL apheresis may be done in patients with LDL cholesterol > 200 mg/dL (> 5.16 mmol/L) and vascular disease that is refractory to conventional therapy, such as occurs with familial hypercholesterolemia.Options include LDL apheresis (in which LDL is removed by extracorporeal plasma exchange) and, rarely, ileal bypass (to block reabsorption of bile acids) and liver transplantation (which transplants LDL receptors).LDL apheresis is the procedure of choice in most instances when maximally tolerated therapy fails to lower LDL adequately.Apheresis is also the usual therapy in patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia who have limited or no response to drug therapy.Elevated LDL cholesterol in children Childhood risk factors besides family history and diabetes include cigarette smoking, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol (< 35 mg/dL [< 0.9 mmol/L]), obesity, and physical inactivity.For children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends dietary treatment for children with LDL cholesterol > 110 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L).Drug therapy is recommended for children > 8 years and with either of the following: Poor response to dietary therapy, LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L), and no family history of premature cardiovascular disease LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL (≥ 4.13 mmol/L) and a family history of premature cardiovascular disease or ≥ 2 risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease Drugs used in children include many of the statins.Children with familial hypercholesterolemia may require a second drug to achieve LDL cholesterol reduction of at least 50%.Elevated triglycerides Although it is unclear whether elevated TGs independently contribute to cardiovascular disease, they are associated with multiple metabolic abnormalities that contribute to coronary artery disease (eg, diabetes, metabolic syndrome).Consensus is emerging that lowering elevated TGs is beneficial.No target goals exist, but levels < 150 mg/dL (< 1.7 mmol/L) are generally considered desirable.No guidelines specifically address treatment of elevated TGs in children.The overall treatment strategy is to first implement lifestyle changes, including exercise, weight loss, and avoidance of concentrated dietary sugar and alcohol.Intake of 2 to 4 servings/week of marine fish high in omega-3 fatty acids may be effective, but the amount of omega-3 fatty acids is often lower than needed; supplemental doses may be helpful.In patients with diabetes, glucose levels should be tightly controlled.If these measures are ineffective, lipid-lowering drugs should be considered.Patients with very high TG levels (> 1,000 mg/dL [> 11 mmol/L]) may need to begin drug therapy at diagnosis to more quickly reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake.Fibrates reduce TGs by about 50%.They appear to stimulate endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leading to increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver and muscle and decreased hepatic VLDL synthesis.They also increase HDL by up to 20%.Fibrates can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects, including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes.They uncommonly cause cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder.In developed countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 years have gallstones.Fibrates may potentiate muscle toxicity when used with statins and potentiate the effects of warfarin.Statins can be used in patients with TGs < 500 mg/dL (< 5.65 mmol/L) if LDL cholesterol elevations are also present; statins may reduce both LDL cholesterol and TGs through reduction of VLDL.If only TGs are elevated, fibrates are the drug of choice.Omega-3 fatty acids in high doses (1 to 6 g a day of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) can be effective in reducing TGs.The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are the active ingredients in marine fish oil or omega-3 capsules.Adverse effects include eructation and diarrhea.These effects may be decreased by giving the fish oil capsules with meals in divided doses (eg, twice a day or 3 times a day).Omega-3 fatty acids can be a useful adjunct to other therapies.Prescription omega-3 fatty acid preparations are indicated for triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dL (> 5.65 mmol/L).The Apo CIII inhibitor (an antisense inhibitor of apo CIII), volanesorsen, is now available in some countries.It lowers triglyceride levels in patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels, including people with lipoprotein lipase deficiency.It is given as a weekly injection.Low HDL Although higher HDL levels predict lower cardiovascular risk, it is not clear whether treatments to increase HDL cholesterol levels decrease risk of death.Guidelines in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATPIII) define low HDL cholesterol as < 40 mg/dL [< 1.04 mmol/L]; the guidelines do not specify an HDL cholesterol target level and recommend interventions to raise HDL cholesterol only after LDL cholesterol targets have been reached.Treatments for LDL cholesterol and triglyceride reduction often increase HDL cholesterol, and the 3 objectives can sometimes be achieved simultaneously.No guidelines specifically address treatment of low HDL cholesterol in children.Pearls & Pitfalls Although higher HDL levels predict lower cardiovascular risk, it is not clear whether treatments to increase HDL cholesterol levels decrease risk of cardiovascular events or death.Treatment includes lifestyle changes such as an increase in exercise and weight loss.Alcohol raises HDL cholesterol but is not routinely recommended as a therapy because of its many other adverse effects.Drugs may be successful in raising levels when lifestyle changes alone are insufficient, but it is uncertain whether raising HDL levels reduces mortality.Nicotinic acid (niacin) is the most effective drug for increasing HDL.Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it appears to both increase HDL production and inhibit HDL clearance; it may also mobilize cholesterol from macrophages.Niacin also decreases TGs and, in doses of 1500 to 2000 mg/day, reduces LDL cholesterol.Niacin causes flushing, pruritus, and nausea; premedication with low-dose aspirin may prevent these adverse effects.Extended-release preparations cause flushing less often.However, most over-the-counter slow-release preparations are not recommended; an exception is polygel controlled-release niacin.Niacin can cause liver enzyme elevations and occasionally liver failure, insulin resistance, and hyperuricemia and gout.It may also increase homocysteine levels Hyperhomocysteinemia may predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis.The combination of high doses of niacin with statins may increase the risk of myopathy.In patients with average LDL cholesterol and below-average HDL cholesterol levels, niacin combined with statin treatment may be effective in preventing cardiovascular disorders.In patients treated with statins to lower LDL cholesterol to < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L), niacin does not appear to have added benefit and may cause increased adverse effects, including ischemic stroke Ischemic Stroke Ischemic stroke is sudden neurologic deficits that result from focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction (eg, positive results on diffusion-weighted MRI).Fibrates increase HDL.Fibrates may decrease cardiovascular risk in patients with TGs > 200 mg/dL (> 2.26 mmol/L) and HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL (< 1.04 mmol/L).Cholesterol ester transport protein (CETP) inhibitors raise HDL levels by inhibiting CETP.Several studies have not shown a benefit.Studies with infusion of recombinant apo A1 Milano have not shown benefit.Elevated Lp(a) The upper limit of normal for Lp(a) is about 30 mg/dL (75 nmol/L), but values in African Americans run higher.Few data exist to guide the treatment of elevated Lp(a) or to establish treatment efficacy.Niacin is the only drug that directly decreases Lp(a); it can lower Lp(a) by > 20% at higher doses.The usual approach in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to lower LDL cholesterol aggressively.LDL apheresis has been used to lower Lp(a) in patients with high Lp(a) levels and progressive vascular disease.An antisense inhibitor of apo (a) is in development.Secondary causes of dyslipidemia Treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia should always involve lifestyle changes and statins to reduce LDL cholesterol.To decrease the risk of pancreatitis, fibrates can be used to decrease TGs when levels are > 500 mg/dL (> 5.65 mmol/L).Metformin lowers TGs, which may be a reason to choose it over other oral antihyperglycemic drugs when treating diabetes.Some thiazolidinediones (TZDs) increase both HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.Some TZDs also decrease TGs.These antihyperglycemic drugs should not be chosen over lipid-lowering drugs to treat lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes but may be useful adjuncts.Patients with very high TG levels and less than optimally controlled diabetes may have a better response to insulin than to oral antihyperglycemic drugs.Treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency.Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skinChronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Abnormal lipid levels in patients with low-normal thyroid function (high-normal TSH levels) improve with hormone replacement.Reducing the dosage of or stopping drugs that cause lipid abnormalities should be considered.Monitoring treatment Lipid levels should be monitored periodically after starting treatment.No data support specific monitoring intervals, but measuring lipid levels 2 to 3 months after starting or changing therapies and once or twice yearly after lipid levels are stabilized is common practice.Liver and severe muscle toxicity with statin use occurs in 0.5 to 2% of all users.Routine monitoring of liver enzyme levels is not necessary, and routine measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is not useful to predict the onset of rhabdomyolysis.Muscle enzyme levels need not be checked regularly unless patients develop myalgias or other muscle symptoms.If statin-induced muscle damage is suspected, statin use is stopped and CK may be measured.When muscle symptoms subside, a lower dose or a different statin can be tried.If symptoms do not subside within 1 to 2 weeks of stopping the statin, another cause should be sought for the muscle symptoms (eg, polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyalgia Rheumatica Polymyalgia rheumatica is a syndrome closely associated with giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).It affects adults > 55.Key Points Elevated lipid levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and thus can lead to symptomatic coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease.Causes of dyslipidemia include a sedentary lifestyle with excessive dietary intake of calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fats and/or genetic (familial) abnormalities of lipid metabolism.Diagnose using serum lipid profile (measured total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and calculated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]).Screening tests should be done at age 9 to 11 years and again at age 17 to 21 years (age 2 to 8 if there is a strong family history of severe hyperlipidemia or premature coronary artery disease or other risk factors); adults are screened every 5 years beginning at age 20.Treatment with a statin is indicated to reduce risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for all patients in 4 major risk groups as defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and for those without who have certain other combinations of risk factors and elevated lipid levels.Optimize adherence, lifestyle changes, and statin usage before adding a non-statin drug; if a patient has an LDL cholesterol level > 70 mg/dL (> 1.8 mmol/L) with high risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adding ezetimibe or PSCK9 inhibitor is reasonable.Other treatment depends on the specific lipid abnormality but should always include lifestyle changes, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, and in some patients with increased risk of myocardial infarction or death due to coronary artery disease, daily low-dose aspirin.",

{"text": "【0】 Cough is a sudden, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs.It is one of the most common reasons people see a doctor.The function of a cough is to clear material from the airways and to protect the lungs from particles that have been inhaled.People may cough on purpose (voluntarily) or spontaneously (involuntarily). The materials may be particles that have been inhaled or substances from the lungs and/or airways.Coughs vary considerably.A cough may be characterized as dry (unproductive) or productive, bringing up blood or sputum (also called phlegm).Sputum is a mixture of mucus, debris, and cells expelled by the lungs.It may be clear, yellow, green, or streaked with blood.People who cough very hard may strain their rib muscles or cartilage, causing pain in the chest, particularly when they breathe in, move, or cough again.Cough may be very distressing and interfere with sleep.However, if coughing increases slowly over decades, as it may in smokers, people may hardly be aware of it.Causes of Cough occurs when the airways are irritated.Likely causes of cough depend on whether the cough has lasted less than 4 weeks (acute) or 4 weeks or longer (chronic).Common causes For acute cough, the most common causes are An upper respiratory infection Common Cold The common cold is a viral infection of the lining of the nose, sinuses, and throat.Many different viruses cause colds.Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.For chronic cough, less common causes include Use of blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors  Lung cancer Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking.It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved.In dysphagia, foods and/or liquids do not move normally from the throat (pharynx) to the stomach.As a result, they may aspirate small amounts of food and drink, saliva, or stomach contents into their windpipe (trachea).These people may repeatedly aspirate small amounts of these materials without their caregiver’s knowledge and may then develop a chronic cough.asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli.Rarely, the main symptom of asthma is cough rather than wheezing.This type of asthma is called cough-variant asthma.Evaluation of Cough Not every cough requires immediate evaluation by a doctor.The following information can help people decide whether a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.Warning signs In people with a cough, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.They include Shortness of breath Coughing up blood Weight loss Fever that lasts longer than about 1 week Risk factors for Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic contagious infection caused by the airborne bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved.Then, a delay of a week or so is not harmful.People who may have inhaled something should also see a doctor right away.People with an acute cough but no warning signs can wait a few days to see whether the cough stops or becomes less severe, particularly if they also have a congested nose and sore throat, which suggest that the cause may be a upper respiratory infection (URI).People who have had a chronic cough but no warning signs should see a doctor at some point, but a delay of a week or so is unlikely to be harmful.What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.Doctors then do a physical examination.What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the cough and the tests that need to be done .Some obvious findings are less helpful in making a diagnosis because they can occur in several disorders that cause cough.For example, whether sputum is yellow or green or thick or thin does not help distinguish bacterial infection from other possible causes.Wheezing may occur with bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the windpipe (trachea) and the airways that branch off the trachea (bronchi) caused by infection.A cough that brings up blood may be caused by bronchitis, tuberculosis, or lung cancer Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking.Table Testing The need for tests depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination, particularly whether warning signs are present.If people have any warning signs, tests usually include Measurement of oxygen levels in the blood with a sensor placed on a finger (pulse oximetry) A chest x-ray Skin tests, chest x-ray, and sometimes computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.If no warning signs are present, doctors can often make a diagnosis based on the history and physical examination and begin treatment without doing tests.In some people, the examination suggests a diagnosis, but tests are done to confirm it .If the examination does not suggest a cause of a cough and no warning signs are present, many doctors try giving people a drug to treat one of three common causes of cough: An antihistamine/decongestant combination or a nasal corticosteroid or nasal muscarinic antagonist spray (for postnasal drip) A proton pump inhibitor or histamine-2 (H2) blocker (for gastroesophageal reflux disease) An inhaled corticosteroid or short-acting beta-2-agonist bronchodilator (for asthma) If these drugs relieve cough, further testing is usually unnecessary.If cough is not relieved, doctors typically do tests in the following order until a test suggests a diagnosis: A chest x-ray Pulmonary function tests to check for asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli.If the cough produces blood, doctors typically send a sputum sample to the laboratory.There, technicians try to grow bacteria in the sample (sputum culture) and use a microscope to check the sample for cancer cells (cytology).Often, if doctors suspect lung cancer (for example, in middle-aged or older people who have smoked for a long time and who have lost weight or have other general symptoms), they also do CT of the chest and sometimes bronchoscopy.Treatment of Cough The best way to treat cough is to treat the underlying disorder.For example, antibiotics can be used for pneumonia, and inhalers containing drugs that widen airways (bronchodilators) or corticosteroids can be used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.Generally, because coughing plays an important role in bringing up sputum and clearing the airways, a cough should not be suppressed.However, if the cough is severe, interferes with sleep, or has certain causes, various treatments may be tried.There are two basic approaches to people who are coughing: Cough suppressants (antitussive therapy), which reduce the urge to cough Expectorants, which are meant to thin the mucus blocking the airways to the lungs and make mucus easier to cough up (but evidence of effectiveness is lacking) Cough suppressants Cough suppressants include the following: Opioids Dextromethorphan Benzonatate All opioids suppress cough because they reduce the responsiveness of the cough center in the brain.Codeine is the opioid used most often for cough.Codeine and other opioid cough suppressants may cause nausea, vomiting, and constipation and may be addictive.They can also cause drowsiness, particularly when a person is taking other drugs that reduce concentration (such as alcohol, sedatives, sleep aids, antidepressants, or certain antihistamines).Thus, opioids are not always safe, and doctors usually reserve them for special situations, such as cough that persists despite other treatments and that interferes with sleep.Dextromethorphan is related to codeine but is technically not an opioid.It also suppresses the cough center in the brain.Dextromethorphan is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription cough preparations.It is not addictive and, when used correctly, causes little drowsiness.However, it is frequently abused by people, particularly adolescents, because in high doses, it causes euphoria.Overdose causes hallucinations, agitation, and sometimes coma.Overdose is particularly dangerous for people who are taking drugs for depression called serotonin reuptake inhibitors Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes.Benzonatate is a local anesthetic taken by mouth.It numbs receptors in the lungs that respond to stretching and thus makes the lungs less sensitive to irritation that triggers cough.Certain people, especially those who are coughing up a large amount of sputum, should limit their use of drugs that suppress cough.Expectorants Some doctors recommend expectorants (sometimes called mucolytics) to help loosen mucus by making bronchial secretions thinner and easier to cough up.Expectorants do not suppress a cough, and evidence indicating effectiveness of these drugs is lacking.The most commonly used expectorants are over-the-counter preparations that contain guaifenesin.This drug does not seem to have an effect in people with chronic bronchitis.Also, inhaling a saline (salt) solution or inhaling acetylcysteine (for up to a few days) sometimes helps thin excessively thick and troublesome mucus.Other drugs Antihistamines, which dry the respiratory tract, have little or no value in treating a cough, except when it is caused by an allergy involving the nose, throat, and windpipe.When coughs have other causes, such as bronchitis, the drying action of antihistamines can be harmful, thickening respiratory secretions and making them difficult to cough up.Decongestants (such as phenylephrine) that relieve a stuffy nose are only useful for relieving a cough that is caused by postnasal drip.Other treatments Steam inhalation (for example, using a vaporizer) is commonly thought to reduce cough.Other topical treatments, such as cough drops, are also popular, but there is no convincing evidence that these other treatments are effective.Key Points Most coughs are caused by minor respiratory infections or postnasal drip.Warning signs in people with a cough include shortness of breath, coughing up blood, weight loss, fever that lasts longer than about 1 week, and risk factors for HIV infection or tuberculosis.Doctors can usually make a diagnosis based on results of the medical history and physical examination.Drugs (cough suppressants and expectorants) should be used to treat cough only when appropriate—for example, a cough suppressant only when cough is severe or when a doctor recommends it.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6389, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Hemochromatosis is a hereditary disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron, causing iron to build up in the body and damage organs.In the United States, over 1 million people have hemochromatosis.Men are affected more often than women.The disorder is potentially fatal but is usually treatable. People absorb iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.Most of the iron is contained in red blood cells.Iron can accumulate in and damage any part of the body.People may develop liver disorders or diabetes or simply feel tired.Blood tests identify people who require genetic testing, which can confirm the disorder.Removing blood (phlebotomy), done periodically, can prevent further damage.Causes of Hemochromatosis is hereditary.It can be caused by several different genetic mutations.The most common mutation causes Type 1 hemochromatosis Type 1 hemochromatosis involves mutation of the HFE (homeostatic iron regulator) gene.It occurs most commonly in people of Northern European ancestry.The person must inherit a mutated gene from both parents to be affected.The HFE gene makes a protein that senses the amount of iron in the body.A mutation in the gene allows too much iron to be absorbed from the diet.Other mutations cause similar disorders Type 2 hemochromatosis (sometimes called juvenile hemochromatosis) Type 3 hemochromatosis (also called transferrin receptor 2 [TFR2] mutation hemochromatosis) Type 4 hemochromatosis (also called ferroportin disease) Hypotransferrinemia Aceruloplasminemia TFR2 mutations impair the body's ability to control iron absorption into certain cells.Although the types of hemochromatosis vary in age at which they appear, the symptoms and complications of iron overload are the same in all.Symptoms of Hemochromatosis Usually, symptoms develop gradually, and the disorder may not be noticed until iron accumulation is excessive.Often no symptoms appear until middle age or later.Sometimes the first symptoms are vague, such as fatigue or weakness, and may not be noticed or may be attributed to some other disorder.In women, symptoms usually start after menopause because of the loss of iron during menstrual bleeding and the increased requirement for iron during pregnancy.Symptoms vary because iron accumulation can damage any part of the body, including the brain, liver, pancreas, lungs, or heart.The first symptoms, particularly in men, may be those of cirrhosis Symptoms Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.Or, the first symptoms, particularly in women, may be vague and affect the whole body.Fatigue is an example.Liver disease is the most common problem.Erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. Hemochromatosis can worsen neurologic disorders that are already present.Diagnosis of Hemochromatosis Blood tests Genetic testing Sometimes liver biopsy or liver MRI Identifying hemochromatosis based on symptoms may be difficult.However, blood tests can identify people who should have further evaluation.These tests measure blood levels of Iron Ferritin, a protein that stores iron Transferrin, the protein that carries iron in blood when iron is not inside red blood cells If the ferritin level and the percentage of iron in transferrin (transferrin saturation) are high, genetic testing is usually done to confirm the diagnosis.A liver biopsy of the Liver Doctors can obtain a sample of liver tissue during exploratory surgery, but more often they obtain a sample by inserting a hollow needle through the person's skin and into the liver.Genetic testing is recommended for people with hemochromatosis, and all of their first-degree relatives (siblings, parents, and children) should be screened for hemochromatosis by measuring their iron levels.Treatment of Hemochromatosis Removing blood (phlebotomy) Usually, removing blood (phlebotomy) is the best treatment.It prevents additional organ damage but does not reverse existing damage.Phlebotomy is initially done once or sometimes every other week.Each time, about 500 milliliters (1 pint or 1 unit) of blood is removed until the iron level and percentage of iron in transferrin are normal.Phlebotomy is then done periodically to keep iron stores at normal levels.People should be treated if they have diabetes Symptoms Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. People with cirrhosis should have a liver ultrasound every 6 months to screen for liver cancer Overview of Liver Tumors Liver tumors may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).People can eat a normal, healthy diet, including iron-containing foods.Doctors may tell people to limit alcohol consumption because alcohol can increase iron absorption and also increases the risk of cirrhosis Symptoms Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.With early diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis, a long, healthy life is expected.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5516, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Nerve root disorders result from sudden or long-term pressure on the spinal nerve root.Nerve root disorders usually result from a herniated disk or osteoarthritis in the spine.These disorders can cause pain, abnormal sensations, and/or muscle weakness in the area of the body they supply.Doctors diagnose nerve root disorders based on results of imaging tests, electrodiagnostic testing, and tests to identify the cause.Doctors treat the cause if possible and give drugs to relieve the pain, including over-the-counter pain relievers (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen) and corticosteroids. Spinal nerves exit the spinal cord along the length of the spine.Each spinal nerve contains two nerve roots: one motor and one sensory.(Motor nerve roots contain nerve fibers that carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to muscles.Sensory nerve roots contains nerve fibers that carry sensory information about such things as touch, position, pain, and temperature from the body to the spinal cord.) After exiting the spinal cord, the two nerve roots join to form a single spinal nerve.Each spinal nerve then goes between two back bones (vertebrae) in the spine to connect to a specific area of the body.The surface of the skin is divided based on these specific areas, which are called dermatomes.A dermatome is an area of skin whose sensory nerves all come from a single spinal nerve root.The Spine A column of bones called vertebrae make up the spine (spinal column).The vertebrae protect the spinal cord (a long, fragile structure contained in the spinal canal), which runs through the center of the spine.Between the vertebrae are disks composed of cartilage, which help cushion the spine and give it some flexibility.Spinal nerves: Emerging from the spinal cord between the vertebrae are 31 pairs of spinal nerves.Each nerve emerges in two short branches (roots)—motor and sensory—which join to form a spinal nerve.The motor roots carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body, particularly to skeletal muscles.The sensory roots carry information to the brain from other parts of the body.Cauda equina: The spinal cord ends about three fourths of the way down the spine, but a bundle of nerves extends beyond the cord.This bundle is called the cauda equina because it resembles a horse's tail.The cauda equina carries nerve impulses to and from the legs, lower intestine, and bladder.Dermatomes The surface of the skin is divided into specific areas, called dermatomes.A dermatome is an area of skin whose sensory nerves all come from a single spinal nerve root.Sensory nerves carry information about such things as touch, pain, temperature, and vibration from the skin to the spinal cord.Spinal roots come in pairs—one of each pair on each side of the body.There are 31 pairs: There are 8 pairs of sensory nerve roots for the 7 cervical vertebrae.Each of the 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, and 5 sacral vertebrae has one pair of spinal nerve roots.In addition, at the end of the spinal cord, there is a pair of coccygeal nerve roots, which supply a small area of the skin around the tailbone (coccyx).There are dermatomes for each of these nerve roots.Sensory information from a specific dermatome is carried by sensory nerve fibers to the spinal nerve root of a specific vertebra.For example, sensory information from a strip of skin along the back of the thigh, is carried by sensory nerve fibers to the 2nd sacral vertebra (S2) nerve root.Causes The most common cause of nerve root disorders is A herniated disk Herniated Disk A herniated disk occurs when the tough covering of a disk in the spine tears or ruptures.The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering.Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints.In osteoarthritis, bone in the spine can overgrow and narrow the opening between the vertebrae that the nerve root goes through.Less commonly, a tumor or other mass (such as an abscess) puts pressure on a nerve root.Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.Infections, such as tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic contagious infection caused by the airborne bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.It usually affects the lungs, but almost any organ can be involved.It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health.Symptoms of nerve root disorders depend on which nerve root is affected.Pain, abnormal sensations, and/or muscle weakness occur in the area of the body supplied by the nerve root.The pain may feel like an electric shock that radiates through the affected area.Muscles may waste away and/or twitch.Affected muscles may become paralyzed.Pain may be worsened by movement, including moving the back, coughing, and sneezing.If the lowest roots of the spinal cord (the cauda equina Cauda Equina Syndrome Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the bundle of nerves that extends from the bottom of the spinal cord is compressed or damaged.Men may have trouble having an erection.This disorder, called cauda equina syndrome, is a medical emergency.The problem—such as a herniated disk, an abscess, a tumor, or a blood clot—that is putting pressure on the cauda equina must be corrected to prevent permanent nerve damage.Diagnosis Imaging tests Sometimes electrodiagnostic tests Doctors ask about symptoms and do a physical examination.The findings provide clues to the diagnosis and help doctors determine where the problem is.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is done to confirm the diagnosis.MRI shows the spinal cord, as well as abnormalities in the soft tissues around the cord, such as abscesses, hematomas (collections of blood), tumors, and ruptured disks, and in bone, such as tumors, fractures, osteoarthritis, and cervical spondylosis Cervical Spondylosis Cervical spondylosis is degeneration of the bones in the neck (vertebrae) and the disks between them, putting pressure on (compressing) the spinal cord in the neck.If MRI cannot be done and if results of CT are unclear, myelography is done.For myelography, a radiopaque contrast agent (which can be seen on x-rays) is injected into the space around the spinal cord, and x-rays are taken.CT myelography may also be done.CT myelography can provide detailed images of the spinal cord and surrounding bone.Electrodiagnostic tests (electromyography and nerve conduction studies Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.However, these tests cannot always identify the cause.If imaging tests do not identify a cause, a spinal tap is done, and doctors analyze the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) to check for infections.Doctors also measure the blood glucose level after people have fasted to check for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.Treatment of the cause Treatment of pain Surgery (usually as a last resort) Causes of nerve root disorders are treated when possible.For sudden, immediate pain, pain relievers (analgesics), such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs Nonopioid Pain Relievers Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.If symptoms are not relieved, corticosteroids may be given by mouth or by injection into the space between the spine and the outer layer of tissue covering the spinal cord (called an epidural injection).However, with corticosteroids, pain relief tends to be modest and temporary.For long-lasting (chronic) pain Chronic Pain Chronic pain is pain that lasts or recurs for months or years.Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often only partly effective, and taking NSAIDs for a long time has substantial risks.Opioid pain relievers Opioid Pain Relievers Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.Doctors choose a pain reliever based

{"text": "【0】 Bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal [GI]) tract, from the mouth to the anus.Blood may be easily seen by the naked eye (overt), or blood may be present in amounts too small to be visible (occult).Occult bleeding is detected only by testing a stool specimen with special chemicals Stool Occult Blood Tests Bleeding in the digestive system can be caused by something as insignificant as a little irritation or as serious as cancer.Hematemesis is blood that is visible in vomit (hematemesis), which indicates the bleeding is coming from the upper GI tract, usually from the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine.When blood is vomited, it may be bright red if bleeding is brisk and ongoing.Alternatively, vomited blood may have the appearance of coffee grounds.It results from bleeding that has slowed or stopped, and the blood looks like coffee grounds because it has been partially digested by acid in the stomach.Blood may also be passed from the rectum: As black, tarry stools (melena) As bright red blood (hematochezia) In apparently normal stool if bleeding is less than a few teaspoons per day Melena is more likely when bleeding comes from the esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.The black color of melena is caused by blood that has been exposed for several hours to stomach acid and enzymes and to bacteria that normally reside in the large intestine.Melena may continue for several days after bleeding has stopped.Hematochezia is more likely when bleeding comes from the large intestine, although it can be caused by very rapid bleeding from the upper portions of the digestive tract as well.People who have lost only a small amount of blood may feel well otherwise.However, serious and sudden blood loss may be accompanied by a rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and reduced urine flow.A person may also have cold, clammy hands and feet.Severe bleeding may reduce the flow of blood to the brain, causing confusion, disorientation, sleepiness, and even extremely low blood pressure (shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow to the organs is low, decreasing delivery of oxygen and thus causing organ damage and sometimes death.Slow, chronic blood loss may cause symptoms and signs of low blood count (anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.People with underlying ischemic heart disease may develop chest pain (angina) or a have a heart attack (myocardial infarction) because of decreased blood flow through the heart. system are called digestive disorders.Causes of Gastrointestinal Bleeding The causes of GI bleeding are divided into three areas: Upper GI tract Lower GI tract Small intestine ( Home.See table Some Causes and Features of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Some Causes and Features of Gastrointestinal Bleeding ).The most common causes are difficult to specify because causes vary by the area that is bleeding and the person's age.However, in general, the most common causes of upper GI bleeding are Ulcers or erosions of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.The tear can be caused by forceful vomiting.Symptoms include blood in vomit.Some polyps are caused by hereditary conditions.The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure.Abdominal pain and bloody stools are common.Bleeding from the small intestine is rare but can result from blood vessel abnormalities, tumors, or a Meckel diverticulum Meckel Diverticulum A Meckel diverticulum is a saclike outpouching of the wall of the small intestine that is present in some children at birth.Bleeding from any cause is more likely, and potentially more severe, in people who have chronic liver disease Overview of Liver Disease Liver disease can manifest in many different ways.Liver disease makes bleeding more likely because a poorly functioning liver produces fewer of the proteins that help blood clot (blood clotting factors Blood clotting factors Hemostasis is the body's way of stopping injured blood vessels from bleeding.Hemostasis includes clotting of the blood.Drugs that can cause or worsen bleeding include anticoagulants (such as heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban), those that affect platelet function (such as aspirin and certain other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and clopidogrel), and those that affect the stomach's protective barrier against acid (such as NSAIDs).Evaluation of Gastrointestinal Bleeding GI bleeding typically requires evaluation by a doctor.The following information can help people decide when a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.Warning signs In people with GI bleeding, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.They include Fainting Light-headedness (near syncope) is a sense that one is about to faint.If people with such findings have no warning signs and feel otherwise well, a delay of a day or two is not harmful.What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.Doctors then do a physical examination.What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the GI bleeding and the tests that may need to be done ( Home.see table Some Causes and Features of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Some Causes and Features of Gastrointestinal Bleeding ).The history is focused on finding out exactly where the bleeding is coming from, how rapid it is, and what is causing it.Doctors need to know how much blood (for instance, a few teaspoons or several clots) is being passed and how often blood is being passed.People with hematemesis are asked whether blood was passed the first time they vomited or only after they vomited a few times with no blood.Doctors ask people with rectal bleeding whether pure blood was passed; whether it was mixed with stool, pus, or mucus; or whether blood simply coated the stool.People with bloody diarrhea are asked about recent travel or other possible forms of exposure to other agents that can cause digestive tract illness (for instance, food poisoning).Doctors then ask about symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and easy bleeding or bruising and symptoms of anemia (such as weakness, easy exhaustion [fatigability], and dizziness).Doctors need to know about any current or past digestive tract bleeding and the results of any previous colonoscopy (examination of the entire large intestine, the rectum, and the anus using a flexible viewing tube).People should tell doctors whether they have inflammatory bowel disease Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In inflammatory bowel diseases, the intestine (bowel) becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal pain and diarrhea.The physical examination is focused on the person’s vital signs (such as pulse, breathing rate, blood pressure, and temperature) and other indicators of shock or a decrease in the volume of circulating blood (hypovolemia—rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, pallor, sweating, little urine production, and confusion) and anemia.Doctors also look for small purplish red (petechiae) and bruise-like (ecchymoses) spots on the skin, which are signs of bleeding disorders.Doctors also look for signs of chronic liver disease (such as spider angiomas, fluid in the abdominal cavity [ ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen.Doctors do a rectal examination to look at stool color and check it for blood and to search for tumors and fissures Anal Fissure An anal fissure is a tear or ulcer in the lining of the anus (the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body).Doctors also examine the anus to look for Hemorrhoids are dilated, twisted blood vessels located in the wall of the lower rectum and anus.The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure.Table Testing The need for tests depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination, particularly whether warning signs are present.There are four main testing approaches to GI bleeding: Blood tests and other laboratory studies Upper endoscopy for suspected upper GI tract bleeding Colonoscopy for lower GI tract bleeding (unless clearly caused by hemorrhoids) Angiography if bleeding is rapid or severe The person’s blood count helps indicate how much blood has been lost.A low platelet count is a risk factor for bleeding.Other blood tests include prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and liver tests, all of which help detect problems with blood clotting.Doctors often do not do blood tests on people who have minor bleeding caused by hemorrhoids.If the person has vomited blood or dark material (which may represent partially digested blood), the doctor sometimes passes a small, hollow plastic tube through the person’s nose down into the stomach (nasogastric tube— Home.see page Intubation of the Digestive Tract Intubation of the Digestive Tract Intubation of the digestive tract is the process of passing a small, flexible plastic tube (nasogastric tube) through the nose or mouth into the stomach or small intestine.Bloody or pink contents indicate active upper GI bleeding, and dark or coffee-ground material indicates that bleeding is slow or has stopped.Sometimes, there is no sign of blood even though the person was bleeding very recently.A nasogastric tube may be inserted in anyone who has not vomited but has passed a large amount of blood from the rectum (if not from an obvious hemorrhoid) because this blood may have originated in the upper digestive tract.If the nasogastric tube reveals signs of active bleeding, or the person’s symptoms strongly suggest the bleeding is originating in the upper digestive tract, the doctor usually does upper endoscopy.Upper endoscopy is an examination of internal structures using a flexible viewing tube (endoscope).An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to see the bleeding source and often treat it and is often done without a nasogastric tube being passed.People with symptoms typical of hemorrhoids may need only sigmoidoscopy (examination of the lower part of the large intestine, the rectum, and anus using an endoscope).All other people with hematochezia should have colonoscopy (examination of the entire large intestine, the rectum, and the anus using an endoscope).Occasionally, endoscopy (both upper and lower) and colonoscopy do not show the cause of bleeding.There are still other options for finding the source of the bleeding.Doctors may do endoscopy of the small bowel (enteroscopy).If bleeding is rapid or severe, doctors sometimes do angiography In angiography, x-rays are used to produce detailed images of blood vessels.During angiography, doctors use a catheter to inject an artery with a contrast agent that can be seen on x-rays.Angiography helps doctors diagnose upper digestive tract bleeding and allows them to do certain treatments (such as embolization and vasoconstrictor infusion— Home.see page Stopping the bleeding Stopping the bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal [GI]) tract, from the mouth to the anus.Doctors may also inject the person with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker (radionuclide scanning Radionuclide Scanning In radionuclide scanning, radionuclides are used to produce images.With the use of a special scanning camera, the radioactive marker can sometimes show the approximate location of the bleeding.Before doing angiography or surgery, doctors may also do a test called CT angiography CT angiography In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.During this procedure, a type of imaging called computed tomography (CT) and a radiopaque contrast agent are used to produce images of blood vessels and sometimes can show the location of the bleeding.Doctors may do a small-bowel follow-through, which is a series of detailed x-rays of the small intestine.Another option is video capsule endoscopy Video Capsule Endoscopy Video capsule endoscopy (wireless video endoscopy) is a procedure in which the person swallows a battery-powered capsule.Video capsule endoscopy is especially useful in the small intestine, but it is not very useful in either the colon or stomach because these organs are easier to see using endoscopy.Treatment of Gastrointestinal Bleeding There are two goals to treating people with GI bleeding: Replace lost blood with fluid given by vein (intravenously) and sometimes with a blood transfusion Stop any ongoing bleeding Hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena should be considered an emergency.People with severe GI bleeding should be admitted to an intensive care unit Types of units People who need specific types of care may be put in special care units.Intensive care units (ICUs) are for people who are seriously ill.Replacing fluids and blood People with sudden, severe blood loss require intravenous fluids and sometimes an emergency blood transfusion Overview of Blood Transfusion A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or a blood component from one healthy person (a donor) to a sick person (a recipient).Stopping the bleeding Most GI bleeding stops without treatment.Sometimes, however, it does not.The type and location of bleeding tells the doctors what treatment to use.For example, doctors can often stop peptic ulcer bleeding during endoscopy by using a device that uses an electrical current to produce heat (electrocautery), heater probes, or injections of certain drugs.If endoscopy does not stop the bleeding, surgery may be needed.For esophageal varices Esophageal Varices Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, which can cause major bleeding.People with esophageal varices may be given injections of the drug octreotide to help stop the bleeding.Antibiotics may also be given.Doctors can sometimes control severe, ongoing lower GI bleeding caused by diverticula or angiodysplasias during colonoscopy by using clips, an electrocautery device, coagulation with a heater probe, or injection with epinephrine.Polyps can be removed by a wire snare or electrocautery.If these methods do not work or are impossible, doctors do angiography Testing during which they may pass a catheter into the bleeding vessel and then inject a chemical, fragments of a gelatin sponge, or a wire coil to block the blood vessel and thereby stop the bleeding (embolization) or inject vasopressin to reduce blood flow to the bleeding vessel.People with continued bleeding may need surgery, so it is important for doctors to know the location of the bleeding site.Doctors may give people with upper GI bleeding a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) by vein (intravenously) to help control the bleeding.Internal hemorrhoid bleeding stops spontaneously in most cases.For people whose bleeding does not stop without treatment, doctors do anoscopy and may place rubber bands around the hemorrhoids or inject them with substances that stop bleeding or do electrocautery or surgery  The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure.Essentials for Older People In older people, Hemorrhoids are dilated, twisted blood vessels located in the wall of the lower rectum and anus.The swollen vessels are caused by an increase in pressure.Peptic ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.Bleeding from enlarged veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices Esophageal Varices Esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus, which can cause major bleeding.Older people poorly tolerate massive GI bleeding.Doctors must diagnosis older people quickly, and treatment must be started sooner than in younger people, who can better tolerate repeated episodes of bleeding.Key Points about Gastrointestinal Bleeding Rectal bleeding may result from upper or lower GI bleeding.Most people stop bleeding spontaneously.Endoscopy is usually the first treatment choice for people whose bleeding will not stop without treatment.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3514, "dataset":

some of them may cause microvascular thrombosis and loss of vascular integrity with further edema formation.Some mediators trigger apoptosis, resulting in accelerated cell death.Symptoms and Signs In critically or terminally ill patients, cardiac arrest is often preceded by a period of clinical deterioration with rapid, shallow breathing, arterial hypotension, and a progressive decrease in mental alertness.In sudden cardiac arrest, collapse occurs without warning, occasionally accompanied by a brief (< 5 seconds) seizure.Diagnosis Clinical evaluation Cardiac monitoring and electrocardiography (ECG) Sometimes testing for cause (eg, echocardiography, chest imaging [x-ray, ultrasonography], electrolyte testing) Diagnosis of cardiac arrest is by clinical findings of apnea, pulselessness, and unconsciousness.Arterial pressure is not measurable.Pupils dilate and become unreactive to light after several minutes.A cardiac monitor should be applied; it may indicate ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions.It causes immediate syncope and death within minutesVF), ventricular tachycardia Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute.Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and deathVT), or asystole.Sometimes a perfusing rhythm (eg, extreme bradycardia) is present; this rhythm may represent true pulseless electrical activity (previously termed electromechanical dissociation) or extreme hypotension with failure to detect a pulse.The patient is evaluated for potentially treatable causes;

however, there is no firm proof that ongoing vasopressor administration during cardiac arrest improves survival.In addition to treatment of cause, postresuscitative care typically includes methods to optimize oxygen delivery, rapid coronary angiography in patients with suspected cardiac etiology, and targeted temperature management (32 to 36° C in adults) and therapeutic normothermia (36 to 37.5° C in children and infants–– 1, 2 Treatment references Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9475, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Wound hygiene (eg, cleansing, irrigation, and debridement), including thorough examination of the wound and surrounding tissues, promotes uncomplicated healing of traumatic skin wounds and is required prior to wound closure.Wound healing is impaired by various factors (eg, bacterial contamination, foreign bodies, wound ischemia, host factors).All traumatic wounds are assumed to be contaminated.The goal of wound hygiene is to reduce the contaminant burden without causing further tissue damage or introducing more contaminants.Diagnosis and management of foreign bodies in wounds are a critical part of wound hygiene.Occasionally, identified or suspected foreign bodies are deeply seated, requiring referral to a surgical specialist. How To Clean, Debride, and Dress Lacerations VIDEO .) Indications Traumatic skin wounds Contraindications Absolute contraindications None Relative contraindications Wounds of highly vascularized skin (eg, scalp and face) may not need irrigation.Deep wounds or those with sinuses or fistulas should be carefully evaluated* before irrigation to avoid causing deeper seeding of bacteria or foreign material.Puncture wounds should be irrigated and debrided at the surface, particularly if secondary to cat bites given their high likelihood of infection.However, the value of deep probing, irrigation, and coring is not certain.Actively bleeding wounds should not be irrigated, because irrigation may disturb clot formation; hemostasis must precede irrigation.Wounds involving deep structures (eg, nerves, blood vessels, ducts, joints, tendons, bones) and those covering large areas require specific repair techniques that may necessitate referral to a surgical specialist.Hand lacerations or injuries, particularly high-pressure injections or those requiring microscopic repair procedures, need surgical evaluation.Facial lacerations, deep or complex wounds, or wounds involving the eyelids also need specialist consultation or evaluation.* Imaging studies (eg, x-rays Conventional Radiography Conventional radiography involves the use of x-rays; the term “plain x-rays” is sometimes used to distinguish x-rays used alone from x-rays combined with other techniques (eg, CT)In ultrasonography, a signal generator is combined with a transducer.CT Computed Tomography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle diseaseMRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sagittal T1-weighted image of the brain shows normal midline structures.Complications Infection, the risk of which is increased by insufficient cleansing or debridement, foreign body retention (especially wood splinters or other organic material), or overly aggressive debridement of viable tissue Further tissue damage or deeper inoculation of bacteria and foreign material due to overly aggressive wound hygiene Equipment Wound hygiene and closure techniques need not be sterile procedures.Although instruments that touch the wound (eg, forceps, needles, suture) must be sterile, clean nonsterile gloves as well as clean but not sterile water may be used in immunocompetent patients.Some operators prefer the better fit and better barrier protection of sterile gloves.Clean procedure, barrier protection Face mask and safety glasses (or a face shield), head cap, gown, gloves (sterile if preferred, but these are nonsterile procedures) Sterile drapes, towels (for wound debridement and suturing) Wound cleansing, inspection, debridement (not all items are required for simple repairs) Overhead procedure light Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine) Sterile gauze squares (eg, 10 cm × 10 cm [4 inch × 4 inch]) Pneumatic tourniquet (or blood pressure cuff), commercial hemostatic agent, as needed to assist hemostasis Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000, 25-gauge needle): Do not use epinephrine in extremities affected by peripheral vascular disease, in digits, the penis, or tip of the nose, or at distal sites when a compression tourniquet is also being used.Local anesthetics are discussed in Lacerations are tears in soft body tissue.For certain patients (eg, children), topical anesthetic (eg, proprietary emulsions of 2.5% lidocaine plus 2.5% prilocaine) Sterile saline for irrigation (sterile water or clean, potable water are permissible substitutes) 35-mL and/or 60-mL syringes Irrigation shield (syringe attachment to block splashing) Plastic catheter (eg, 18- or 19-gauge standard catheter) or commercially available splash guard device Basin Fine-pore sponge (eg, 90 pores per inch) Tissue forceps (eg, Adson forceps), tissue hook, probe, hemostat, splinter forceps (fine-tipped), and suture scissors (single blunt-tip, double sharp edge) Scalpel (#10 for large incisions, #15 for precise incisions, #11 for small stab incisions), iris scissors, or curette Wound dressing Antibiotic ointment: Topical antibiotic ointments continue to be recommended for sutured wounds because they help keep wound edges moist and prevent dressings from sticking.However, they have not been proven to reduce infection or enhance healing.Sterile nonadherent, absorbent, and/or occlusive dressing Gauze roll and tape or gauze sleeve Sometimes splints or other materials to restrict motion or skin tension that may pull on the wound Additional Considerations Adequate anesthesia is important because these procedures may be painful, and insufficient anesthesia may result in insufficient cleansing, inspection, and debridement.Always do the neurovascular examination (distal to the wound) before giving anesthesia.Intradermal anesthetic injection itself is painful.Subdermal (subcutaneous) injection causes less pain and is preferred.Nerve blocks Local anesthesia for laceration treatment and procedural sedation Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are often agitated, confused, and uncomfortable.They can become delirious (ICU delirium)Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are often agitated, confused, and uncomfortable.They can become delirious (ICU delirium).Hair removal is generally not recommended, except when closure using adhesive strips is anticipated.To remove hair, clip rather than shave it.Eyebrows must remain intact to achieve accurate alignment of wound edges during suturing.Wound tissue can be vulnerable to further injury during cleansing and closure.Do not use excessive force during irrigation and scrubbing.To avoid crushing tissue, never grasp it with a hemostat.A retained foreign body in a wound is suggested by pain or foreign-body sensation (enhanced by motion) in the absence of infection.Suspected foreign bodies can often be identified using ultrasonography In ultrasonography, a signal generator is combined with a transducer.Some foreign bodies (eg, small fragments of glass or metal in a puncture wound) may be allowed to remain in a wound if removal would incur additional tissue damage and further impair healing.Patients should be told that a retained foreign body is possible and given wound care instructions that include watching for signs of infection.Dressings should keep wounds moist—but not too moist.Typically, a nonstick porous dressing is placed directly over the wound, followed sometimes by an absorbent dressing sufficient to absorb the wound's secretions, followed lastly by an occlusive dressing.The dressing contacting the wound must not dry and adhere to the wound because fragile granulation tissue would be ripped from the healing wound bed when the dressing is removed for changing.Tetanus vaccination and immune globulin may be needed depending on the wound type and patient's vaccination history .Positioning Position the patient comfortably reclined or supine.Allow space for a basin to be placed under the wound during irrigation.Adjust the stretcher height so that you will be comfortable either sitting or standing at the bedside.The wound should be well lit, preferably with an overhead procedure light.Step-by-Step Description of Procedure  Preliminary tasks Place all equipment on a tray within your—but not the patient's—reach.Wear gloves and a face shield or protective eyewear and a mask.Initially wash heavily contaminated wounds, eg, using tap water and a gentle hand soap.Depending on wound location, patients can do this themselves; local anesthesia may be needed.Hemostasis: Direct pressure to the site is the primary technique.Use finger pressure or gauze pads (may be moistened with sterile saline) to hold external pressure on the wound.Elevate the area if possible, and, if needed, use other means (eg, inflated blood pressure cuff, brief application of a proximal tourniquet, injected or topical 1% epinephrine with lidocaine) to attain hemostasis.Elevation and use of a proximally placed compression tourniquet are often helpful in achieving hemostasis of hand wounds.Avoid clamping blood vessels to avoid inadvertently clamping tendons, nerves, or other important structures.Wound evaluation Lacerations are tears in soft body tissueDocument the wound's history, location, size, degree of contamination, foreign bodies, associated injuries (eg, fractures and muscle and tendon disruptions), and neurovascular status distal to the wound.Check range of motion in all appropriate joints, particularly if a tendon injury is possible.Plain x-rays are sensitive for glass (≥ 1 mm) and most inorganic material (eg, stones).Most organic materials (eg, wood splinters, plastic) are radiolucent but can be detected by ultrasonography or CT Computed Tomography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle diseaseMRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sagittal T1-weighted image of the brain shows normal midline structures.Skin cleansing: Proceed from the wound edges outward, wiping in concentric circles with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine solution followed by alcohol solution.Do not introduce a cleansing agent directly into the wound because many are toxic to tissues and may interfere with wound healing.Local infiltration anesthesia Hold the local anesthetic syringe at a shallow angle to the skin.Insert the needle directly into the exposed subdermal layer of the wound edge (ie, do not insert the needle percutaneously) and advance the needle to the hub.Pull back on the plunger to exclude intravascular placement.Then inject the anesthetic, minimizing the pressure of injection while slowly withdrawing the needle.Continue to anesthetize the circumference of the wound, subdermally inserting the needle into regions already anesthetized, advancing the needle into contiguous unanesthetized tissue, and injecting while withdrawing the needle.Repeat around the entire wound.Wound cleansing Dirty wounds may require scrubbing (as described below) before irrigation.Irrigation Irrigate the laceration using sterile saline in a 35- or 60-mL syringe (preferably with a splash guard attached but otherwise via a plastic catheter).Use a tissue forceps or probe to expose the tissue, and irrigate the entire depth and full extent of the wound.Press down on the plunger with the thumbs of both hands in order to produce enough pressure to remove particulate matter and bacteria.The volume of the fluid required varies with the size of the wound and the degree of contamination.Typically, 50 to 100 mL per centimeter of wound length is used, but for relatively clean wounds, 30 to 50 mL per centimeter is usually adequate.Continue irrigation until the wound is visibly clean.If irrigation is ineffective in removing visible particles, scrubbing (described below) is required.Scrubbing Scrub gently, using a fine-pore sponge (if available) to minimize tissue abrasion.Use a portion of the sponge to first scrub the skin surface around the wound to remove foreign material that could enter the wound.Use the remaining sponge to scrub the internal surface of the wound.Use care when scrubbing because the sponge may damage the internal tissues and provoke inflammation.After scrubbing, irrigate the wound as described above.Wound exploration Place a fenestrated drape over the wound.Examine the wound under good lighting and after bleeding has been controlled.Use a tissue forceps or probe to expose the wound tissue, and explore the entire depth and full extent of the wound to locate foreign bodies, particulate matter, bone fragments, and injuries to underlying structures.Do not explore the wound with your finger, because sharp foreign bodies may cause injury.Use the forceps or #15 scalpel to remove visible objects from the wound.Use gauze to remove particulate matter.Sometimes you may need to extend the wound edges or occasionally its depth to see adequately.After inspecting and removing matter from the wound, irrigate the wound.Wound debridement Debride all devitalized and necrotic tissue: Stabilize the wound edge with forceps, then cut away the devitalized tissue with a scalpel or iris scissors.Make the cuts perpendicular to the skin surface, not on an angle (to maximize dermal apposition during closure).Wound edge contamination that cannot be removed by irrigation and scrubbing (eg, grease and grit from power tool injury) may need to be removed by debridement.To debride a fistula or through-and-through puncture wound, moisten some gauze and gently pull it through the tract in the direction opposite to the puncture using a forceps or hemostat.After debridement, irrigate the wound again to remove any remaining debris.The wound is now prepared for closure and dressing. For wounds that require closure, the closure can be done using simple interrupted sutures How To Repair a Laceration With Simple Interrupted Sutures Uncomplicated epidermal closure is most often done using simple interrupted suturesHow To Repair a Laceration With Glue Wound glue or adhesives—or biodegradable bonding agents—can be used to close small, straight, superficial, low-tension woundsHow To Repair a Laceration With Stapling devices are used to rapidly close straight, sharp-edged lacerations when cosmetic closure is not needed.Wound dressing* Gently wipe away any remaining cleansing agent and dried blood or skin debris using moistened gauze.If the wound has been closed with sutures, many operators apply topical antibiotic to keep the sutures from adhering to the dressing.Place a nonadherent dressing on the wound.If significant oozing or bleeding seems possible, apply a sterile absorbent dressing over the nonadherent dressing.Use a thick layer if considerable drainage is anticipated.Follow wounds at risk of heavy bleeding closely.For wounds in locations subject to significant soilage, apply a sterile occlusive dressing.Apply adhesive tape or a circumferential gauze wrap to keep the dressing in place.Be careful not to place circumferential wraps too tightly, which may lead to excessive compression and subsequent ischemia.* Some wounds typically are not dressed (eg, facial lacerations and those within areas that have hair).Aftercare Instruct the patient to keep the dressing dry and in place and to return in 2 days for a wound check or, if delayed closure is anticipated, in 3 to 5 days.Prophylactic oral antibiotics may be given to prevent infection of dirty (especially organically contaminated) wounds, particularly for diabetic and immunocompromised patients.Warnings and Common Errors Proper wound care must include thorough examination regardless of anticipated closure method; a common error is to do cursory exploration and no debridement because a noninvasive closure not requiring local anesthesia is planned.Wounds with possible retained foreign bodies, joint penetration, or damage to underlying structures such as tendons require full wound exploration and observation through the range of motion of adjoining joints.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8547, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Light microscopy can be done quickly, but accuracy depends on the experience of the microscopist and quality of equipment.Regulations often limit physicians’ use of microscopy for diagnostic purposes outside a certified laboratory.Microscopic examination of tissue may be required to distinguish invasive disease from surface colonization—a distinction not easily achieved by culture methods.Most specimens are treated with stains that color pathogens, causing them to stand out from the background, although wet mounts Wet mounts Light microscopy can be done quickly, but accuracy depends on the experience of the microscopist and quality of equipment.The clinician orders a stain based on the likely pathogens.However, no stain is 100% specific (ie, different organisms may stain similarly).Most samples are treated with Gram stain Gram stain Light microscopy can be done quickly, but accuracy depends on the experience of the microscopist and quality of equipmentAcid-fast and modified acid-fast stains Light microscopy can be done quickly, but accuracy depends on the experience of the microscopist and quality of equipment.However, some pathogens are not easily visible using these stains; if these pathogens are suspected, different stains or other identification methods are required.Because microscopic detection usually requires a microbe concentration of at least about 1 ×104-5/mL, most body fluid specimens (eg, cerebrospinal fluid) are concentrated (eg, by centrifugation) before examination.Gram stain The Gram stain does the following: Classifies bacteria according to whether they retain crystal violet stain (gram-positive—blue) or not (gram-negative—red) Highlights cell morphology (eg, bacilli, cocci) and cell arrangement (eg, clumps, chains, diploids) Identifies polymorphonuclear leukocytes, indicating bacterial infection rather than colonization Such characteristics can direct antibiotic therapy pending definitive identification.Finding a mixture of microorganisms with multiple morphologies and staining characteristics on Gram stain suggests a contaminated specimen or a polymicrobial bacterial infection.Finding many squamous cells in a sputum specimen suggests that the specimen is contaminated with saliva and thus is of limited diagnostic usefulness.To do a Gram stain, technicians heat-fix specimen material to a slide and stain it by sequential exposure to Gram crystal violet, iodine, decolorizer, and counterstain (typically safranin).Acid-fast and modified acid-fast stains These stains are used to identify the following: Acid-fast organisms (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungsModerately acid-fast organisms (primarily Nocardia Nocardiosis is an acute or chronic, often disseminated, suppurative or granulomatous infection caused by various aerobic soil saprophytes of the gram-positive bacilli genus NocardiaRhodococcus and related genera Oocysts of some parasites (eg, Cryptosporidium

symptomsCyclospora Cyclosporiasis is infection with the protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis.Symptoms include watery diarrhea with gastrointestinal and systemic symptomsBalantidium coli) Although detection of mycobacteria in sputum requires at least 10,000 organisms/mL, mycobacteria are often present in lower levels, so sensitivity is limited.Usually, several mL of sputum are decontaminated with sodium hydroxide and concentrated by centrifugation for acid-fast staining.Specificity is better, although some moderately acid-fast organisms are difficult to distinguish from mycobacteria.Fluorescent stains Fluorescent stains allow detection at lower concentrations (< 1 × 104 cells/mL).Examples are Acridine orange (bacteria and fungi) Auramine-rhodamine and auramine O (mycobacteria) Calcofluor white (fungi, especially dermatophytes) Coupling a fluorescent dye to an antibody directed at a pathogen (direct or indirect immunofluorescence) should theoretically increase sensitivity and specificity.However, these tests are difficult to read and interpret, and few (eg, Pneumocystis and Legionella direct fluorescent antibody tests) are commercially available and commonly used.Wet mounts Wet mounts of unstained samples can be used to detect the following via darkfield microscopy: Fungi Overview of Fungal Infections Fungal infections are often classified as either Opportunistic Primary Opportunistic infections are those that develop mainly in immunocompromised hostsParasites Approach to Parasitic Infections Human parasites are organisms that live on or

{"text": "【0】 Acute bronchitis is inflammation of the windpipe (trachea) and the airways that branch off the trachea (bronchi) caused by infection.Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection.Symptoms are a cough that may or may not produce mucus (sputum).The diagnosis is based primarily on symptoms.Treatments, such as drugs to reduce fever and cough, may be used to make the person more comfortable until the episode ends.Antibiotics are rarely needed.Bronchitis can be either Acute Chronic Acute bronchitis usually lasts days to a few weeks.Bronchitis that lasts for months or years is usually classified as chronic bronchitis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders.When people say \"bronchitis,\" they usually mean acute bronchitis, and only acute bronchitis is discussed here.When people with chronic bronchitis have decreased airflow from the lungs when they breathe out (airflow obstruction), they are considered to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders.If people who have COPD, or other chronic lung disorders such as bronchiectasis is an irreversible widening (dilation) of portions of the breathing tubes or airways (bronchi) resulting from damage to the airway wall.Causes of Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is caused by infection due to Viruses (most common) Bacteria Understanding Bronchitis occurs most often during the winter.Viral bronchitis may be caused by a number of common viruses, including the influenza virus Influenza (Flu) Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses.Many different viruses cause colds.Acute bronchitis can also occur as part of the SARS-CoV-2 infection COVID-19 COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness that can be severe and is caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.Symptoms of COVID-19 vary significantly.Even after a viral infection has cleared up, the irritation it causes can continue to cause symptoms for weeks.Bacteria cause less than one in 20 cases of bronchitis.Mycoplasma pneumoniae Mycoplasmas are bacteria that cause infections in the respiratory tract and the urinary and genital tracts.Bacterial causes of acute bronchitis are more likely when many people in the same area are affected at the same time (an outbreak).Cough in adults Cough in Adults Cough is a sudden, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs.It is one of the most common reasons people see a doctor.Cough in children Cough in Children Cough helps clear materials from the airways and prevent them from going to the lungs.The materials may be particles that have been inhaled or substances from the lungs and/or airways.Bronchitis VIDEO Symptoms of Acute Bronchitis Infections causing acute bronchitis typically begin with the symptoms of a common cold: runny nose, sore throat, and fatigue.In addition, in people with COVID-19, fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and loss of smell and taste are more common.After several days, cough begins (usually dry at first).People may cough up small amounts of thin, white mucus.This mucus often changes from white to green or yellow and becomes thicker.Occasionally, the sputum contains a small amount of blood.Neither the color change nor the presence of blood indicates there is a bacterial infection.Color change means only that cells associated with inflammation have moved into the airway and are coloring the sputum.People do not usually have a high fever or chills unless the bronchitis was caused by a more serious infection such as influenza (Flu) Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses. Coughing up yellow or green-colored sputum does not mean the infection is caused by bacteria.Because bronchitis can temporarily narrow the airways, people may develop wheezing and/or shortness of breath, similar to what happens in an asthma attack Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli.Acute bronchitis itself does not cause serious complications.However, some infections that cause bronchitis such as influenza (Flu) Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses.Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.Diagnosis of Acute Bronchitis A doctor's evaluation Sometimes a chest x-ray Doctors usually make a diagnosis of acute bronchitis based on the symptoms.Doctors may do a chest x-ray to look for pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide.Doctors rarely do tests to find the cause of acute bronchitis, and blood tests are not helpful.However, in the current pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV2 may be done.Also, if a cough persists for more than 2 weeks, a chest x-ray is done to make sure that pneumonia has not developed or a different lung disease is not causing the cough.Treatment of Acute Bronchitis Treatments to relieve symptoms People may take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce fever and general feelings of illness and should drink plenty of fluid.Antibiotics do not help viral bronchitis.Since most acute bronchitis is viral, doctors give antibiotics only when the infection is clearly caused by bacteria (for example, during an outbreak).When an antibiotic is used, doctors typically give a drug such as azithromycin or clarithromycin. Acute bronchitis is usually treated best without using an antibiotic.In children, very mild symptoms may be helped with cool-mist humidifiers or steam vaporizers.Children and adults who are wheezing may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators Treatment , which help open the airways and reduce wheezing.Cough medicines Cough suppressants Cough is a sudden, forceful expulsion of air from the lungs.It is one of the most common reasons people see a doctor.However, the degree of effectiveness of these drugs is not clear.Expectorants are over-the-counter drugs that may help thin secretions and make them easier to cough up, but whether this measure is helpful is not clear.Cough suppressants and expectorants are usually not recommended in young children  The materials may be particles that have been inhaled or substances from the lungs and/or airways.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4511, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Tubulointerstitial nephritis is inflammation that affects the tubules of the kidneys and the tissues that surround them (interstitial tissue).This disorder may be caused by diseases, drugs, and toxins that damage the kidneys.People may have excessive urination, urinate at night, or have fever and/or a rash.Laboratory tests of blood and urine are done as well as usually imaging tests and sometimes a kidney biopsy.Stopping exposure to harmful drugs and toxins and treating underlying disorders improve kidney function.The glomeruli are made up of many microscopic clusters of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) with small pores.Tubulointerstitial nephritis may be Acute (sudden) Chronic (gradual) Tubulointerstitial nephritis often results in kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.It may be caused by various diseases, drugs, toxins, or radiation that damages the kidneys.Damage to the tubules results in changes in the amounts of electrolytes (for example, sodium and potassium) in the blood or in problems with the kidney's ability to concentrate urine, resulting in urine that is too dilute.Problems concentrating urine causes an increase in daily urine volume (polyuria Excessive or Frequent Urination Most people urinate about 4 to 6 times a day, mostly in the daytime.Normally, adults pass between 3 cups (700 milliliters) and 3 quarts (3 liters) of urine a day.The Nephrons, Glomeruli, and Tubules VIDEO Secondary Causes of Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Diseases Kidney infection (pyelonephritis Kidney Infection Pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of one or both kidneys.The kidneys grow larger but have less functioning tissue. Antibiotics such as penicillin and the sulfonamides, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—including aspirin—may trigger an allergic reaction.The interval between the exposure to the allergen that caused the reaction and the development of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis varies usually from 3 days to 5 weeks.Drugs can also cause tubulointerstitial nephritis through nonallergic mechanisms.For example, NSAIDs can directly damage the kidney, taking up to 18 months to cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis.Infection of the kidneys Kidney Infection Pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of one or both kidneys.Kidney failure is unlikely unless inflammation causes a blockage in the urinary tract or pyelonephritis occurs in both kidneys.Tubulointerstitial nephritis may be caused by immunologic disorders that primarily affect the kidney such as anti-tubular basement membrane (anti-TBM) Goodpasture Syndrome Goodpasture syndrome is an uncommon autoimmune disorder in which bleeding into the lungs and progressive kidney failure occur.Symptoms Some people have few or no symptoms.When symptoms develop, they are highly variable and may develop suddenly or gradually.Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis When tubulointerstitial nephritis develops suddenly, the amount of urine produced may be normal or less than normal.Sometimes the amount of urine produced is excessive and people urinate more frequently and waken during the night to urinate (nocturia).If the cause is pyelonephritis, symptoms may include fever, painful urination, and pain in the lower back or side (flank).If the cause is an allergic reaction, symptoms may include fever and a rash.Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis When tubulointerstitial nephritis develops gradually, the first symptoms to appear are those of kidney failure, Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.Blood pressure is normal or only slightly above normal in the early stages of the disease.The amount of urine produced may be greater than normal.Diagnosis Laboratory tests Sometimes imaging tests Laboratory tests (kidney function tests Kidney Function Tests Doctors can assess kidney function by doing tests on blood and urine samples.Creatinine, a waste product, is increased in the blood when kidney function is decreased by a large amount.A kidney biopsy Tissue and Cell Sampling Site-specific biopsies and cell sampling are also used in the evaluation of people with suspected kidney and urinary tract disorders. When tubulointerstitial nephritis develops suddenly, the urine may be almost normal, with only a trace of protein or pus, but often the abnormalities are striking.The urine may show large numbers of white blood cells, including eosinophils.Eosinophils do not normally appear in the urine, but when they do, a person may have acute tubulointerstitial nephritis caused by an allergic reaction.In such cases, blood tests may show that the number of eosinophils in the blood is increased.A doctor may order ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, or both.When an allergic reaction is the cause, the kidneys usually are large because of inflammation caused by the allergic reaction.This enlargement can be seen with radionuclide scanning or ultrasonography, which are imaging studies done to differentiate acute tubulointerstitial nephritis from other sudden kidney disorders.Prognosis Kidney function usually improves when an offending drug is stopped or treatment of the underlying disorder is effective, although some kidney scarring is common.The prognosis tends to be worse when the offending drug is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.When the inflammation occurs gradually, kidney damage may develop at different rates in different portions of the kidney.The person may develop abnormalities characteristic of damage to different portions of the kidney at different times.However, kidney damage usually progresses to involve most or all of both kidneys and becomes irreversible.Treatment Treating the cause Corticosteroids Dialysis or kidney transplantation Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis The first step in treating acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is to stop whatever drug is causing the kidney damage and treat the underlying disorder.Treatment with a corticosteroid may speed the recovery of kidney function when tubulointerstitial nephritis is caused by certain disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls.If kidney function worsens and kidney failure develops, dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly.In some cases, the damage is irreversible, and kidney failure becomes chronic.Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is treated by stopping the causative drug or treating the underlying disorder.Supportive care such as controlling blood pressure is often used.Drugs may be used to try to slow progression of kidney disease.Irreversible severe kidney damage, whatever the cause, results in the need for dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly.Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the removal of a healthy kidney from a living or recently deceased person and then its transfer into a person with end-stage kidney failure.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3844, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments.Calcium is one of the body's electrolytes Overview of Electrolytes Well over half of the body's weight is made up of water.Doctors think about the body's water as being restricted to various spaces, called fluid compartments.The body carefully controls the amount of calcium Overview of Calcium's Role in the Body Calcium is one of the body's electrolytes, which are minerals that carry an electric charge when dissolved in body fluids such as blood, but most of the body's calcium is uncharged.Causes of Hypercalcemia Causes of hypercalcemia include the following: Hyperparathyroidism: One or more of the four parathyroid glands secrete too much parathyroid hormone, which helps control the amount of calcium in blood.Too much calcium intake: Occasionally, hypercalcemia develops in people with peptic ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.The resulting disorder is called the milk-alkali syndrome.Too much vitamin D intake: If people take very high daily doses of vitamin D over several months, the amount of calcium absorbed from the digestive tract increases substantially.Cancer: Cells in kidney, lung, and ovary cancers may secrete large amounts of a protein that, like parathyroid hormone, increases the calcium level in blood.These effects, called humoral hypercalcemia of cancer, are considered a paraneoplastic syndrome Paraneoplastic Syndromes Paraneoplastic (associated with cancer—see also Overview of Cancer) syndromes occur when a cancer causes unusual symptoms due to substances that circulate in the bloodstream.Calcium can also be released into the blood when cancer spreads (metastasizes) to bone and destroys bone cells.Such bone destruction occurs most commonly with prostate, breast, and lung cancers.Multiple myeloma Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells in which abnormal plasma cells multiply uncontrollably in the bone marrow and occasionally in other parts of the body.Other cancers can increase the calcium level in blood by means not yet fully understood.Bone disorders: If bone is broken down (resorbed) or destroyed, calcium is released into the blood, sometimes causing hypercalcemia.In Paget disease Paget Disease of Bone Paget disease of bone is a chronic disorder of the skeleton in which areas of bone undergo abnormal turnover, resulting in areas of enlarged and softened bone.However, the calcium level can become too high in people with Paget disease who become dehydrated or spend too much time sitting or lying down—when the bones are not bearing weight.Severe hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions.Inactivity: Rarely, people who are immobilized, such as those who are paralyzed, or people who must remain in bed for a long time, develop hypercalcemia because calcium in bone is released into the blood when bones do not bear weight for long periods of time.Granulomatous disorders, drugs, endocrine disorders, and some other disorders may also cause hypercalcemia. Lack of mobility can make the calcium level high because bones weaken and release calcium into the blood.Hyperparathyroidism  in the blood to become elevated.The parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, which Increases the absorption of calcium from the digestive tract Causes the kidneys to excrete less calcium Causes bones to release stored calcium Parathyroid hormone causes the kidneys to excrete more phosphate, but it also causes the bones to release phosphate into the blood.The balance between these two effects determines whether the phosphate level remains normal or decreases.If the parathyroid glands release too much parathyroid hormone, hyperparathyroidism results.People with hyperparathyroidism have too much calcium and a normal or low level of phosphate in their blood.Primary hyperparathyroidism In primary hyperparathyroidism, an abnormality causes the release of too much parathyroid hormone.In about 90% of people with primary hyperparathyroidism, the abnormality is a noncancerous tumor (adenoma) in one of the parathyroid glands.In the remaining 10%, the glands simply enlarge and produce too much hormone.Rarely, cancers of the parathyroid glands cause hyperparathyroidism.Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common among women than among men.It is more likely to develop in older people and in people who have received radiation therapy to the neck.Sometimes it occurs as part of the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes , a rare hereditary disorder.Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually treated by surgically removing one or more of the parathyroid glands.The goal is to remove all parathyroid tissue that is producing excess hormone.Surgery is successful in almost 90% of cases.Secondary hyperparathyroidism In secondary hyperparathyroidism, excess parathyroid hormone is released in response to a large decrease in the calcium level in blood, as can occur in chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood.Some disorders can also cause the deficiency.Treatment depends on the cause.Tertiary hyperparathyroidism In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, excess parathyroid hormone is released regardless of the amount of calcium in the blood.Tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually occurs in people who have had long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism.Treatment depends on the cause.Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia The syndrome of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a hereditary disorder that results from the parathyroid glands underestimating the amount of calcium in the blood and, in response, mistakenly secreting too much parathyroid hormone.Parathyroid surgery is not useful in this disorder, and other treatment is usually not needed.Symptoms of Hypercalcemia often causes few symptoms.The earliest symptoms of hypercalcemia are usually constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.People may excrete abnormally large amounts of urine, resulting in dehydration and increased thirst.Very severe hypercalcemia often causes brain dysfunction with confusion, emotional disturbances, delirium, hallucinations, and coma.Muscle weakness may occur, and abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart.Long-term or severe hypercalcemia commonly results in kidney stones in the Urinary Tract Stones (calculi) are hard masses that form in the urinary tract and may cause pain, bleeding, or an infection or block of the flow of urine.Less commonly, kidney failure develops, but it usually resolves with treatment.However, if enough calcium accumulates within the kidneys, damage is irreversible.Diagnosis of Hypercalcemia Measurement of calcium level in the blood Hypercalcemia is usually detected during routine blood tests.Once hypercalcemia is detected, additional testing may be needed to determine the cause.Additional blood tests and urine tests may be done.A chest x-ray may also be needed to look for cancer or a lung disorder that can cause hypercalcemia.Genetic testing may be done when doctors are looking for a hereditary cause.Treatment of Hypercalcemia Fluids and drugs to increase excretion of calcium When hypercalcemia is not severe, correcting the cause is often sufficient.If people have mild hypercalcemia or conditions that can cause hypercalcemia and if their kidney function is normal, they are usually advised to drink plenty of fluids.Fluids stimulate the kidneys to excrete calcium and help prevent dehydration.Doctors may advise people to take mineral supplements containing phosphate, which helps prevent calcium absorption.If the calcium level is very high or if symptoms of brain dysfunction or muscle weakness appear, fluids and diuretics are given by vein (intravenously) as long as kidney function is normal.Dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly.Several other drugs (including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, corticosteroids, and, rarely, plicamycin) can be used to treat hypercalcemia.These drugs work primarily by slowing the release of calcium from bone.Hypercalcemia caused by cancer is particularly difficult to treat.Sometimes a drug called denosumab is helpful.If the cancer cannot be controlled, hypercalcemia usually returns despite the best treatment.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6182, "dataset":

{"text": "【0】 Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) are testes that remain in the abdomen or the groin instead of descending into the scrotum.Retractile testes (hypermobile testes) have descended into the scrotum but can move back (retract) into the inguinal canal easily as a reflex response to stimulation.In the fetus, the testes (testicles) develop within the abdomen.After the testes develop, but typically before birth (usually in the last third of pregnancy—the third trimester), they descend through a tunnel from the abdomen into the groin (the inguinal canal) and then down into the scrotum.The Testes and Scrotum VIDEO After the testes descend, the tunnel usually closes.If the tunnel does not close completely, an inguinal hernia Inguinal Hernia An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of a piece of intestine or another abdominal organ through an opening in the abdominal wall in the groin.The inguinal hernia rarely causes symptoms, but doctors can often feel it.Sometimes, fluid from the abdomen accumulates around the testes and is trapped in the scrotum after the tunnel closes.This trapped fluid forms a soft lump called a hydrocele, which usually goes away in the first year of life. on one or both sides may be a symptom of a urinary tract disorder.Undescended testes About 3 of every 100 boys who are born at full term (9 months) have an undescended testis at birth.However, about 30 of every 100 boys born prematurely Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.Boys whose family members had undescended testes also are more likely to have the condition.Usually only one testis fails to descend, but in about 10% both testes are affected.Usually the undescended testis is in the inguinal canal but sometimes it is within the abdomen.About two thirds of undescended testes descend on their own by 4 months of age in full-term infants or, for premature infants, by 4 months after the date they would have been born if they were not premature.Testes that remain in the abdomen at birth are much less likely to descend on their own.Undescended Testis Undescended testes rarely cause symptoms.However, undescended testes can impair sperm production later in life and increase the risk of testicular cancer Testicular Cancer Testicular cancer occurs in the testes, the two small organs in males that make sperm.Testicular cancer is most common among young men but usually curable.Undescended testes in the abdomen can become twisted (testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is the twisting of a testis on its spermatic cord so that the blood supply to the testis is blocked.Most newborns who have an undescended testis also have an inguinal hernia.Doctors do a physical examination of the scrotum to detect the testes at birth and at each annual well-child visit Preventive Health Care Visits in Children Scheduled visits to the doctor (also called well-child visits) provide parents with information about their child's growth and development.If they cannot feel one or both testes, they make sure that the testes are not simply retracted into the inguinal canal  are testes that remain in the abdomen or the groin instead of descending into the scrotum.If doctors are not able to feel both testes in a newborn, they do blood and other tests to determine whether the baby has a disorder affecting normal development of the genitals.Most boys are diagnosed with undescended testes in infancy, but some may be diagnosed later in childhood usually after a growth spurt.If the testes are not in the scrotum, children should be seen by a urologist (a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract and male reproductive system).Rarely, doctors do ultrasonography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.  If the testis has not descended by about 6 months of age in full-term infants and by 1 year of age in premature infants, surgery is needed.Depending on the location of the testis, it may be brought down into the scrotum via a surgical procedure through an open incision or by laparoscopy (in which doctors look inside the abdominal cavity using an endoscope).If the infant has an inguinal hernia, that is also repaired.Because children who have undescended testes are at an increased risk of developing testicular cancer Testicular Cancer Testicular cancer occurs in the testes, the two small organs in males that make sperm.Testicular cancer is most common among young men but usually curable.Retractile testes Retractile testes (hypermobile testes) are descended testes that easily move back and forth between the scrotum and the inguinal canal.The testes retract as a reflex response to touch, temperature, fear, or laughter.Such a response is common, particularly in infants and children.Retractile testes do not lead to cancer or other complications.Doctors examine the testes during well-child visits Preventive Health Care Visits in Children Scheduled visits to the doctor (also called well-child visits) provide parents with information about their child's growth and development.The testes usually stop retracting into the groin by puberty because they grow larger.Retractile testes do not require surgery or other treatment.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4412, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 What is a miscarriage? Miscarriage is when you lose your baby before 20 weeks of pregnancy.Most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.Bleeding and cramping are common signs of miscarriage If you were pregnant and didn't know it yet, you can have a miscarriage and think it was just your period To tell if you’ve had a miscarriage, doctors will check your cervix (the lower part of your uterus) Doctors will also do an ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays)Many women who’ve had one miscarriage get pregnant again and deliver healthy babies However, your chances of miscarriage go up each time: the more miscarriages you have, the more likely you are to have another one If you’ve had several miscarriages, you may want to see a doctor before you get pregnant again Doctors can try to make your next pregnancy more successful What causes a miscarriage? Doctors don't always know what causes you to miscarry.Miscarriage is not caused by a sudden emotional shock, such as getting bad news.Also, minor injuries like slipping and falling do not cause miscarriage.However, major injuries like a bad car crash can cause miscarriage.Causes in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy A problem with your baby, such as a birth defect or an inherited disorder Sometimes the baby has a defect that is so severe that the baby (fetus) can't live more than a month or two inside you.A severe defect causes most miscarriages in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.Causes in weeks 13 through 20 of pregnancy Often, doctors never figure out the cause of miscarriage at this stage.But sometimes they can pinpoint one of these as the cause: Problems with your reproductive organs, such as fibroids A fibroid is a tumor in a woman's uterus (womb).The uterus is the organ where babies grow before they are bornA baby whose blood doesn’t mix well with your blood (Rh incompatibility Rh Incompatibility The Rh factor is a protein that some people have on the surface of their red blood cellsCertain health problems that aren’t taken care of during pregnancy, such as diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar (glucose) levels are too high.You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working rightHypothyroidism Your thyroid is a gland below the Adam’s apple in your neck.Your thyroid releases thyroid hormones.The hormones control how fast your body’s chemical functions work (metabolic rate)High Blood Pressure Each heart beat pushes blood through your arteries.Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteriesCauses of repeated miscarriages If you have had several miscarriages, doctors will look for problems such as: Blood that clots too easily in the woman Abnormal chromosomes in the baby from either parent What are the symptoms of a miscarriage? A miscarriage early in pregnancy may just seem like a normal period.If you didn't know you were pregnant, you probably wouldn't think you were having a miscarriage.Other times there are obvious symptoms: Bright or dark red blood Cramping Passing large clots and bits of tissue At first you may have only a small amount of bleeding, similar to having your period.As the miscarriage continues, the bleeding usually gets worse.The blood may be bright or dark red.Sometimes you'll also pass blood clots.You'll have cramps that may get worse as your uterus (womb) pushes out bits and pieces of the pregnancy.Call your doctor right away if you have any bleeding during your pregnancy.Not all bleeding during pregnancy means you're having a miscarriage.About half the time, the pregnancy continues just fine.However, your doctor needs to check to see whether you had a miscarriage or not.If you pass large clots or bits of tissue, put them in a container or wrap them in a towel for the doctor to look at.How can doctors tell if I've had a miscarriage? If you've had bleeding or cramping during the first 20 weeks of your pregnancy, doctors will: Do a pelvic exam: They look inside your vagina (birth canal) to check your cervix (the lower part of your uterus where your baby comes out)—if your cervix is open, a miscarriage is likely Do an ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays)This test uses sound waves to create moving pictures of the inside of your uterus—it can show if your baby is still alive Do blood tests: Doctors check your levels of the pregnancy hormone hCG How do doctors treat a miscarriage? If the fetus and the placenta (the organ that feeds your unborn baby) are no longer in your body, you won't need any treatment.The bleeding and cramps will stop soon.If bits and pieces of the pregnancy are still in your body, doctors might: Watch to see if your uterus will empty itself, as long as you don’t have a fever or seem sick Do a procedure to remove the rest of the pregnancy If doctors need to remove pieces of your pregnancy from your uterus, they'll give you medicine to make you sleepy.The procedure you have depends on how far along the pregnancy is: In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy: Remove pieces using a suction instrument put into your uterus through your vagina Between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy: Remove pieces using surgical instruments put into your uterus through your vagina If close to 20 weeks of pregnancy: You may be given a medicine to start labor to pass the rest of the pregnancy How can I prevent a miscarriage? You can't really prevent a miscarriage.If you've had some bleeding or cramping during the first 20 weeks of your pregnancy, your doctor may tell you to avoid too much physical activity and stay off your feet.But there's no proof these things help.How can I feel better after a miscarriage? It's normal to feel grief, anger, and guilt after a miscarriage.Consider talking with another person if you feel sad and are grieving the loss of your baby Remind yourself that it’s very unlikely you did something to cause your miscarriage If you’re worried about having another miscarriage, talk to a doctor who can discuss possible tests Remember that many women who miscarry get pregnant again and give birth to healthy babies", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6538, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.Depending on when they are born, preterm newborns have underdeveloped organs, which may not be ready to function outside of the uterus.A previous preterm birth, multiple births, poor nutrition during pregnancy, late prenatal care, infections, assisted reproductive techniques (such as in vitro fertilization), and high blood pressure can increase the risk of a preterm birth.Because many organs are underdeveloped, preterm newborns may have difficulty breathing and feeding and are prone to bleeding in the brain, infections, and other problems.The earliest and smallest preterm newborns are at far greater risk of having problems, including developmental problems.Although some preterm newborns grow up with permanent problems, the majority of survivors have mild or no long-term problems.Early prenatal care may decrease the risk of a preterm birth.Preterm birth can sometimes be delayed for a brief period by giving the mother medications to slow or stop contractions.When an infant is expected to be delivered significantly early, doctors can give the mother injections of a corticosteroid to speed the development of the fetus’s lungs and help prevent bleeding in the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage).Gestational age refers to how far along the fetus is.The gestational age is the number of weeks between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery.This time frame is often adjusted according to other information doctors receive, including the results of early ultrasound scans, which give additional information regarding the gestational age.The baby is estimated to be due (the due date) at 40 weeks of gestation.Newborns are classified by gestational age as preterm if they are delivered before 37 weeks of gestation.Preterm infants are further categorized as Extremely preterm: Delivered before 28 weeks of gestation Very preterm: Delivered at 28 to before 32 weeks of gestation Moderately preterm: Delivered at 32 to before 34 weeks of gestation Late preterm: Delivered at 34 to before 37 weeks of gestation About 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States is born before full term.Greater degrees of prematurity are associated with greater risks of serious and even life-threatening complications.Extreme prematurity is the single most common cause of death in newborns.Also, newborns born very prematurely are at increased risk of long-term problems, especially delayed development Definition of Developmental Disorders Developmental disorders are better called neurodevelopmental disorders.Nonetheless, most infants who are born prematurely grow up with no long-term difficulties.Causes of Preterm Birth The causes of preterm birth are frequently unknown.However, there are many known risk factors for preterm birth.Adolescents and older women, women of lower socioeconomic status, and women who have less formal education are at increased risk of preterm birth.Risk factors from a previous pregnancy: Previous preterm birth (biggest risk factor) Previous multiple pregnancies Multiple Births The term multiple births refers to the presence of more than one fetus in the uterus.The number of twin, triplet, and other multiple births has been increasing during the last two decades.A pregnancy may be ended by surgically removing the contents of the uterus or by taking certain drugs.  The number of twin, triplet, and other multiple births has been increasing during the last two decades.Usually, kidney disorders worsen only in pregnant women who have high blood pressure that is not well-controlled.After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows.Early prenatal care may decrease the risk of preterm birth.Symptoms of Preterm Newborns Preterm newborns usually weigh less than 5½ pounds (2.5 kilograms), and some weigh as little as 1 pound (½ kilogram).Symptoms often depend on immaturity of various organs.Late preterm newborns, on the other hand, may have only a few organ systems, if any, that need time to mature.Late preterm newborns may stay in the hospital until they can regulate their body temperature and the level of sugar (glucose) in their blood, eat well, and gain weight.The immune system in any preterm newborn is also underdeveloped, and therefore preterm newborns are prone to infections.Physical Features of a Preterm Newborn Small size Large head relative to rest of the body Little fat under the skin Thin, shiny, pink skin Veins visible beneath the skin Few creases on soles of feet Scant hair Soft ears, with little cartilage Underdeveloped breast tissue Boys: Small scrotum with few folds; testes may be undescended Testes and Retractile Testes Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) are testes that remain in the abdomen or the groin instead of descending into the scrotum.The risk of complications increases with the degree of prematurity.Risk of complications also depends in part on the presence of certain causes of prematurity, such as infection, diabetes, high blood pressure, or preeclampsia.Underdeveloped brain Several problems arise when an infant is born before the brain is fully developed.Difficulty coordinating feeding and breathing: The parts of the brain that control reflexes involving the mouth and throat are immature, so preterm newborns may not be able to suck and swallow normally, resulting in difficulty coordinating feeding with breathing.Bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain: Newborns born very prematurely are at increased risk of bleeding in the brain Bleeding in and around the brain Birth injury is damage that occurs as a result of physical pressure during the birthing process, usually during transit through the birth canal.Underdeveloped digestive tract and liver An underdeveloped digestive tract and liver can cause several problems, including the following: Frequent episodes of spitting-up: Initially, preterm newborns may have difficulty with feedings.Not only do they have immature sucking and swallowing reflexes, but their small stomach empties slowly, which can lead to frequent episodes of spitting up (reflux Gastroesophageal Reflux in Children Gastroesophageal reflux is the backward movement of food and acid from the stomach into the esophagus and sometimes into the mouth.Frequent episodes of not tolerating feedings: The intestines of preterm newborns move very slowly, and preterm newborns frequently have difficulty passing stools.Because of the slow movement of the intestinal tract, preterm infants do not easily digest the breast milk or formula they are given.Intestinal damage: Very preterm newborns may develop a serious condition in which part of the intestine becomes severely damaged and may cause infection (called necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Necrotizing enterocolitis is injury to the inner surface of the intestine.This disorder occurs most often in newborns who are premature and/or seriously ill.Hyperbilirubinemia: Preterm newborns are prone to developing hyperbilirubinemia Jaundice in the Newborn Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream.In hyperbilirubinemia, the newborn's liver is slow in clearing bilirubin (the yellow bile pigment that results from the normal breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood.Thus, the yellow pigment accumulates, giving the skin and the whites of the eyes a yellow color (jaundice).Preterm newborns tend to become jaundiced in the first few days after birth.Usually, jaundice is mild and resolves as newborns take in larger amounts during feedings and have more frequent bowel movements (bilirubin is removed in the stool, giving it its bright yellow color at first).Rarely, very high levels of bilirubin accumulate and put newborns at risk of developing kernicterus.Kernicterus Complications of jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream.Antibodies from the mother cross the placenta late in the pregnancy and help protect the newborn from infection at birth.Preterm newborns have fewer of their mother's protective antibodies and therefore are at higher risk of developing infections, especially infection in the blood (sepsis in the newborn Sepsis in Newborns Sepsis is a serious bodywide reaction to infection spread through the blood.The use of invasive devices for treatment, such as catheters in blood vessels and breathing tubes (endotracheal tubes), further increases the risk of developing serious bacterial infections.Underdeveloped kidneys Before delivery, waste products produced in the fetus are removed by the placenta and then excreted by the mother’s kidneys.After delivery, the newborn’s kidneys must take over these functions.Kidney function is diminished in very preterm newborns but improves as the kidneys mature.Newborns with underdeveloped kidneys may have difficulty regulating the amount of salt and other electrolytes as well as water in the body.Underdeveloped lungs The lungs of preterm newborns may not have had enough time to fully develop before birth.The tiny air sacs called alveoli that absorb oxygen from the air and remove carbon dioxide from the blood are not formed until about the beginning of the last third of pregnancy (third trimester).In addition to this structural development, the tissues of the lungs must make a fatty material called surfactant.Surfactant coats the inside of the air sacs and allows them to remain open throughout the breathing cycle, making it easy to breathe.Without surfactant, the air sacs tend to collapse at the end of each breath, making breathing very difficult.Usually, the lungs do not make surfactant until about 32 weeks of pregnancy, and production is typically not adequate until about 34 to 36 weeks.Newborns with breathing problems may need help with breathing with a ventilator Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.The more preterm the newborn, the less surfactant is available, and the greater the likelihood that respiratory distress syndrome will develop.There is no treatment to make the lung structure mature more rapidly, but with adequate nutrition, the lungs continue to mature over time.There are two approaches to increase the amount of surfactant and reduce the likelihood and severity of respiratory distress: Before birth: Corticosteroid medications such as betamethasone increase surfactant production in the fetus and are given to the mother by injection when a preterm delivery is anticipated, typically 24 to 48 hours before delivery.After birth: Doctors may give surfactant directly into the newborn's windpipe (trachea).Most infants who have BPD have had respiratory distress syndrome and needed treatment with a ventilator.In BPD, the lungs develop scar tissue and the infant needs continued help with breathing, sometimes with a ventilator.In most cases, the infant very slowly recovers from the disease.Underdeveloped eyes The retina Structure and Function of the Eyes The structures and functions of the eyes are complex.The retina is nourished by blood vessels on its surface.The blood vessels grow from the center of the retina to the edges during the course of the pregnancy and do not finish growing until near term.In preterm infants, particularly the least mature infants, the blood vessels may stop growing and/or grow abnormally.Many preterm infants need extra oxygen, and this also can cause the blood vessels of the retina to grow abnormally.The abnormal vessels can bleed or cause scar tissue that can pull on the retina.This disorder is called retinopathy of prematurity Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Retinopathy of prematurity is a disorder of premature infants in which the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina) grow abnormally.In the most severe cases, the retina detaches from the back of the eye and causes blindness.Preterm infants, particularly those born before 31 weeks of gestational age, typically have periodic eye examinations so doctors can look for abnormal development of the blood vessels.If there is a high risk of retinal detachment, doctors may use laser treatments or give a medication called bevacizumab.Preterm newborns are also at increased risk of developing other eye problems, such as nearsightedness Causes (myopia), misalignment of the eyes (strabismus is an intermittent or constant misalignment of an eye so that its line of vision is not pointed at the same object as the other eye.Difficulty regulating blood sugar levels Because preterm newborns have difficulty feeding and maintaining normal blood sugar (glucose) levels, they are often treated with glucose solutions given by vein (intravenously) or given small, frequent feedings.Without regular feedings, preterm newborns may develop low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood.Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes.Most newborns with hypoglycemia do not develop symptoms.Other newborns become listless with poor muscle tone, feed poorly, or become jittery.Rarely, seizures develop.Preterm newborns are also prone to developing high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) if they have an infection or bleeding in the brain or receive too much glucose intravenously.However, hyperglycemia rarely causes symptoms and can be controlled by limiting the amount of glucose given to the newborn or by using insulin for a short period of time.Heart problems A common issue among less mature infants is a patent ductus arteriosus Patent Ductus Arteriosus In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta (ductus arteriosus) fails to close as it usually does shortly after birth.The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel in the fetus that connects the two large arteries leaving the heart, the pulmonary artery and the aorta  Some are severe, but many are not.In a full-term infant, the muscle wall of the ductus arteriosis closes the blood vessel in the first few hours or days of life.In preterm infants, however, the blood vessel may stay open, resulting in excessive blood flow through the lungs and requiring more work from the heart.In most preterm infants, the PDA eventually closes on its own, but medications are sometimes given to help the PDA close more quickly.In some cases, a surgical procedure to close the PDA is done.Difficulty regulating body temperature Body temperature is maintained by the brain.Because preterm newborns do not have a mature brain, they have trouble regulating their body temperature.Preterm newborns have a large skin surface area relative to their weight compared to full-term newborns, so they tend to lose heat rapidly and have difficulty maintaining normal body temperature, especially if they are in a cool room, there is a draft, or they are near a window when it is cold outside.If the baby is not kept warm, the body temperature falls (called hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature) is often regarded as a cold injury, because it can be caused or made worse by exposure to cold surroundings.Newborns who have hypothermia gain weight poorly and may have a number of other complications.Diagnosis of Preterm Newborns Appearance of the newborn Gestational age Doctors usually know whether a baby is born prematurely based on the newborn's calculated gestational age and physical features observed after birth.They examine the newborn and do any needed blood, laboratory, hearing, eye, and imaging tests as part of the routine newborn evaluation Physical Examination of the Newborn The doctor usually gives the newborn a thorough physical examination within the first 24 hours of life.These screenings may need to be repeated frequently as the newborn grows and before discharge from the hospital.Prognosis for Preterm Newborns Over recent decades, the survival and overall outcome of preterm newborns has improved dramatically, but problems such as delayed development, cerebral palsy Cerebral Palsy (CP) Cerebral palsy refers to a group of symptoms that involve difficulty moving and muscle stiffness (spasticity).The most important factors in determining outcome are Birthweight Degree of prematurity Whether the mother was given corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours before a preterm delivery Complications that arise after birth The sex of the baby also affects the likelihood of a good outcome: girls have a better prognosis than boys who have the same degree of prematurity.Survival itself is rare if infants are born at less than 23 weeks of gestation.Infants born at 23 to 24 weeks may survive, but few survive without some degree of neurologic injury.Most infants born after 27 weeks of gestation survive without neurologic problems.Prevention of Preterm Birth Regular prenatal care Medical Care During Pregnancy Ideally, a couple who is thinking of having a baby should see a doctor or other health care practitioner to discuss whether pregnancy is advisable.Usually, pregnancy is very safe.However, many of the conditions that increase the risk of prematurity cannot be avoided.In all cases, women who think they may be in preterm labor or have had rupture of the membranes should contact their obstetrician immediately to arrange for appropriate evaluation and treatment.Assisted reproductive techniques Assisted Reproductive Technologies Assisted reproductive technologies involve working with sperm and eggs or embryos in a laboratory (in vitro) with the goal of producing a pregnancy. These pregnancies have a significantly increased risk of preterm delivery and its complications.However, a technique called elective single embryo transfer, which is the implantation of a single embryo, reduces the risk of a multiple pregnancy and may be considered a good option for some women.Treatment of Preterm Newborns Treatment of complications Treatment of prematurity involves managing the complications resulting from underdeveloped organs.All specific disorders are treated as needed.For instance, preterm newborns may be given treatments that help with breathing problems (such as mechanical ventilation for lung disease and surfactant treatment), antibiotics for infections, blood transfusions for anemia, and laser surgery for eye disease or they may need special imaging studies like echocardiography Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.It uses no x-rays.Parents are encouraged to visit and interact with their newborn as much as possible.Parents of all infants should remove fluffy materials including blankets, quilts, pillows, and stuffed toys from the infant's crib at home because these items may increase the risk of sudden unexplained infant death Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) Sudden infant death syndrome is the sudden, unexpected death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy infant between 1 month and 1 year of age.Infants at home should be placed on their back and not their stomach to sleep because sleeping on the stomach also increases the risk of SUID .Very preterm newborns Very preterm newborns may need to be hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit for days, weeks, or months.They may require a breathing tube and a machine that helps air get in and out of the lungs (ventilator Mechanical Ventilation Mechanical ventilation is use of a machine to aid the movement of air into and out of the lungs.They receive nutrition into their veins until they can tolerate feedings into their stomach through a feeding tube Feeding Tube feeding may be used to feed people whose digestive tract is functioning normally but who cannot eat enough to meet their nutritional needs.The mother’s breast milk is the best food for preterm infants.Use of breast milk decreases the risk of developing an intestinal problem called necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Necrotizing enterocolitis is injury to the inner surface of the intestine.This disorder occurs most often in newborns who are premature and/or seriously ill.Because breast milk is low in some nutrients like calcium, it may need to be mixed with a fortifying solution for newborns who have a very low birthweight.Infant formulas made specifically for preterm infants that are high in calories also can be used when necessary.Very preterm newborns may require a medication that prompts them to breathe, such as caffeine, until the part of the brain that controls regular breathing has matured.To keep warm, these newborns need to be kept in an incubator until they are able to maintain a normal body temperature.Extremely preterm newborns Extremely preterm newborns require all the same care as very preterm newborns.Like very preterm newborns, these newborns cannot be released from the hospital until they are able to breathe on their own, take oral feedings, maintain a normal body temperature, and gain weight.Discharge from the hospital Preterm infants typically remain hospitalized until their medical problems are under satisfactory control and they are Taking an adequate amount of milk without special assistance Gaining weight steadily Able to maintain a normal body temperature in a crib No longer having pauses in breathing (apnea of prematurity) Most preterm infants are ready to go home when they are at 35 to 37 weeks of gestational age and weigh 4 to 5 pounds (2 to 2.5 kilograms).However, there is wide variation.The length of time the infant stays in the hospital does not affect the long-term prognosis.Because preterm newborns are at risk of stopping breathing (apnea), and having low levels of oxygen in the blood and a slow heart rate while in a car seat, many hospitals in the United States do a car seat challenge test before preterm babies are discharged.The test is done to determine whether babies are stable in the semi-reclined position of a car seat.This test is usually done using the car seat provided by the parents.Preterm babies, including those who pass the test, should be observed by a non-driving adult during all car seat travel until the babies have reached the due date and have remained consistently able to tolerate being in the car seat.Because the baby's color should be observed, travel should be limited to daylight hours.Long trips should be broken up into 45- to 60-minute segments so that the baby can be taken out of the car seat and repositioned.Surveys show that most car seats are not installed optimally, so a check of the car seat by a certified car seat inspector is recommended.Inspection sites can be found here.Some hospitals offer an inspection service, but casual advice provided by an uncertified hospital staff member should not be considered equivalent to inspection by a certified car seat expert.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that car seats be used only for vehicular transportation and not as an infant seat or bed at home.Many doctors also recommend that parents do not put preterm infants in swings or bouncy seats for the first few months at home.After discharge, preterm infants are carefully monitored for developmental problems and receive physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy as needed.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6169, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Although children < 10 years have the lowest rate of spinal cord injuries, such injuries are not rare.Most spinal injuries in children occur in the neck.In children < 8 years, cervical spine injuries occur most commonly above C4 and are most commonly caused by motor vehicle crashes, falls, and child abuse.In children > 8 years, injuries at C5 to C8 are more common and are due to motor vehicle crashes and sports injuries, particularly gymnastics, diving, horseback riding, American football, and wrestling.Compared with adults, children have distinct anatomic features (eg, larger head size-to-body, elasticity of spinal ligament capsules) that predispose them to hypermobility of the spinal column without apparent bony injury.Children with spinal cord injury may have transient symptoms such as paresthesias and weakness.Children may also have lancinating pains down the spine or extremities.In about 25% of affected children, onset of neurologic signs (such as partial neurologic deficits, complete paralysis) is delayed from 30 minutes to 4 days after injury, making immediate diagnosis difficult.Spinal cord injury without evidence of radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) is related to direct spinal cord traction, spinal cord impingement, spinal cord concussion, and vascular injury.This type of injury occurs almost exclusively in children and often occurs in the cervical spine.In spinal cord injury without evidence of radiologic abnormality, the patient has neurologic findings suggestive of spinal cord injury (eg, paresthesias, weakness) but normal anatomic alignment, and no bone abnormalities are seen on imaging studies (plain x-rays, CT, and/or MRI).Children immobilized by SCIWORA or other spinal cord injuries are at risk for complications due to immobility, including decubitus ulcers Pressure Injuries Pressure injuries are areas of necrosis and often ulceration (also called pressure ulcers) where soft tissues are compressed between bony prominences and external hard surfaces.Patients may have dyspnea or respiratory failure if atelectasis is extensive.They may also develop pneumoniaOverview of Pneumonia is acute inflammation of the lungs caused by infection.Initial diagnosis is usually based on chest x-ray and clinical findingsSymptoms and Signs Neurogenic bladder is bladder dysfunction (flaccid or spastic) caused by neurologic damage.Symptoms can include overflow incontinence, frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and retentionUrinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infectionVesicoureteral Reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severityChronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. Occasionally, the spinal nerves are affected.The anatomy of the spinal column is reviewed elsewhere Diagnosis X-rays (cross-table lateral view, anteroposterior view, and open-mouth odontoid view) Usually CT, particularly for bony or ligamentous injury MRI to confirm injury site and level within the spinal cord Spinal cord injury should be suspected in any child who has been in a motor vehicle crash, has fallen from a height ≥ 3 meters, or has had a submersion injury.Spinal cord injury without evidence of radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) is suspected in children who have even transient symptoms of neurologic dysfunction or lancinating pains down the spine or extremities and a mechanism of injury compatible with spinal cord injury.SCIWORA is a common phenomenon originally described in the 1980s, when there was a lack of MRI scanners capable of detecting the causative radiologic abnormalities.The term SCIWORA is less commonly used currently because MRI scanners are more readily available in hospitals in the US and can identify the causative radiologic abnormalities.Depending on local imaging resource availability, imaging usually begins with x-rays, including cross-table lateral, anteroposterior, and open-mouth odontoid views.If fracture, dislocation, or subluxation is suspected based on x-ray findings or a very high-risk mechanism of injury, CT is usually done.MRI is usually done with any of the following: Spinal cord injury is suspected based on x-ray or CT Spinal cord injury is suggested by neurologic deficits on examination Spinal cord injury is suggested by a history of even transient neurologic deficits Treatment Immobilization Maintenance of oxygenation and spinal cord perfusion Supportive care Surgical stabilization when appropriate Long-term symptomatic care and rehabilitation Children with a spinal injury should be transferred to a pediatric trauma center.Acute treatment is similar to treatment in adults Treatment Trauma to the spine may cause injuries involving the spinal cord, vertebrae, or both.Occasionally, the spinal nerves are affected.The anatomy of the spinal column is reviewed elsewhere.Surgical stabilization is less frequently indicated in children than adults with spinal cord injury; because spinal ligaments tend to be more lax in spinal cord injury without evidence of radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA) and bone fractures and complete ligamentous avulsion are absent, there may be no suitable target structure for stabilization.Historically, high-dose corticosteroids have been used at various dosing schedules and regimens, but multiple clinical trials in adults have failed to demonstrate any added clinical benefit but have shown increased risk of wound infection, pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvisSeptic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection.Thus, for children with spinal cord injury, centers in the US tend to avoid long-term use of corticosteroids, although some clinicians use short courses of high-dose steroids in the perioperative setting only.Long-term treatments for pediatric SCIWORA are similar to treatments for adult spinal cord injury, with focus on both intensive physical rehabilitation of neurologically affected extremities and medical support for various common medical complications that occur with prolonged immobilization or weakness.Rehabilitation is multidisciplinary with involvement of physical therapists for gait training and lower extremity strengthening, occupational therapists for cervical cord injuries affecting upper extremity motor function that can result in contractures, and even speech therapists to assist with swallowing and secretion-clearance issues that affect high cervical injuries.Regular medical care and visits are necessary for severe spinal cord injury patients who are nonambulatory due to high risks of developing complications resulting from immobility.Prognosis is directly related to initial neurologic function after injury.Children achieve better neurologic outcomes than adult patients with spinal cord injury (1, 2 Treatment references Although children < 10 years have the lowest rate of spinal cord injuries, such injuries are not rare.Most spinal injuries in children occur in the neck.Key Points Most spinal injuries in children involve the neck.Neurologic symptoms and signs may be delayed from 30 minutes to 4 days after injury in about 25% of affected children.Children may have spinal cord injury without evidence of radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA).SCIWORA should be suspected with even transient symptoms of neurologic dysfunction or lancinating pains down the spine or extremities.Do MRI in all patients who had neurologic symptoms, neurologic deficits on examination, or spinal injury detected on other imaging studies.Surgical stabilization is less frequently indicated in children than adults with spinal cord injury.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7125, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are rare hereditary disorders of connective tissue that result in unusually flexible joints, very elastic skin, and fragile tissues.These syndromes are caused by a defect in one of several genes that control the production of connective tissue.Typical symptoms include flexible joints, a humpback, flat feet, and elastic skin.The diagnosis is based on symptoms and results of a physical examination.Most people with this syndrome have a normal life span.There is no cure for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are caused by an abnormality in one of the genes that controls the production of connective tissue.Connective tissue Overview of Connective Tissue Disorders in Children Connective tissue is the tough, often fibrous tissue that binds the body's structures together and provides support and elasticity.Tissues VIDEO There are 6 major types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and 7 less common types.They involve different genes and vary widely in severity.Although the types have slightly different symptoms, they all result in abnormally fragile connective tissue, which causes problems in joints and bones and may weaken internal organs.Symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes People with an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have very flexible joints, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, fragile blood vessels, and very elastic skin.The skin can be stretched up to several inches but returns to its normal position when released.Some people develop small, hard, round lumps under the skin.In a small number of people, the blood does not clot normally, so bleeding from minor wounds may be difficult to stop.Complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes Ehlers-Danlos syndromes may alter the body’s response to injuries.Minor injuries may result in wide gaping wounds.Although these wounds usually do not bleed excessively, they leave wide scars.Sprains and dislocations develop frequently.Some people develop a chest deformity, a humpback with an abnormal curve of the spine (kyphoscoliosis Scheuermann Disease Kyphosis is an abnormal curving of the spine that causes a humpback. The upper back normally curves forward somewhat.Most adults have flat feet Pes planus (flat feet) Clubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a birth defect in which the foot and ankle are twisted out of shape or position.The intestines can bulge through the abdominal wall (called a hernia Abdominal Wall Hernias A hernia is the bulge of an organ through the muscle or tissue that holds it in place.There are many different types of hernias.Sometimes weak tissue in a heart valve causes the valve to leak.If a pregnant woman has an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, delivery may be premature Preterm Labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy is considered preterm.Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems.The diagnosis of preterm labor is usually obvious.The mother's fragile tissues increase risk that her uterus may rupture during labor.Poor skin healing may make an episiotomy or cesarean delivery (C-section) problematic.If the fetus has an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the amniotic sac may rupture early (prelabor rupture of membranes Prelabor Rupture of the Membranes (PROM) Prelabor rupture of the membranes is the leaking of amniotic fluid from around the fetus at any time before labor starts.After the membranes rupture, labor often soon follows.A mother or baby who has an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can bleed excessively before, during, and after delivery.Diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes A doctor's evaluation Genetic testing Skin biopsy Imaging tests to detect complications A doctor bases the diagnosis of an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome on the symptoms and results of a physical examination.To confirm the diagnosis, genetic tests are usually done.The doctor can identify some of the types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome by taking a sample of skin to examine under a microscope (biopsy).Other tests are done to check for conditions that are associated with complications.For example, echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.It uses no x-rays.Prognosis for Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes Despite the many and varied complications people with an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may have, their life span is usually normal.However, potentially fatal complications (usually bleeding) occur in certain types.Treatment of Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes Injury prevention There is no way to cure an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or to correct the abnormalities in the connective tissue.Injuries can be treated, but it may be difficult for a doctor to stitch cuts because stitches tend to tear out of the fragile tissue.Usually, using an adhesive tape or medical skin glue closes cuts more easily and leaves less scarring.Special precautions should be taken to prevent injuries.For example, children with severe forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes can wear protective clothing and padding.Surgery requires special techniques that minimize injury and ensure that a large supply of blood is available for transfusion.An obstetrician (a doctor who specializes in childbirth and in caring for and treating women who are giving birth) must supervise pregnancy and delivery.Genetic counseling for family members is suggested.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4107, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Persistent erection (priapism) is a painful, persistent, abnormal erection unaccompanied by sexual desire or excitation.It is most common in boys aged 5 to 10 years and in men aged 20 to 50 years. The penis is composed of three cylindrical spaces (sinuses) of tissue through which blood can flow (called erectile tissue).The larger two sinuses, the corpora cavernosa, occur side by side.The third sinus (the corpus spongiosum) surrounds the urethra and ends as the cone-shaped end of the penis (glans penis).When these sinuses fill with blood, the penis becomes larger and rigid (erect).Muscles then tighten around the veins of the groin, preventing blood from flowing out of the penis and keeping the penis erect. Erections can last a long time and become painful.A boy or man with a prolonged, painful erection should see a doctor immediately.Ischemic priapism Most cases of persistent erection involve failure of blood to flow out of the penis.Blood backs up, preventing new oxygen-rich blood from entering the penis.As a result, the penis can become starved of oxygen.This condition is known as ischemic priapism or low-flow priapism.Severe pain occurs if an erection lasts longer than 4 hours.The penis may be erect while the glans penis may be soft.Prolonged priapism can lead to erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. Stuttering priapism is a recurring form of ischemic priapism in which episodes of erection alternate with periods when the penis is not erect.Nonischemic priapism Less commonly, priapism is due to uncontrolled flow of blood into the penis.Such abnormal blood flow usually results from an injury to an artery in the groin area.Nonischemic priapism is also known as high-flow priapism.It is less painful than ischemic priapism and does not lead to tissue death.The penis is erect but not fully rigid.Subsequent erectile dysfunction is much less common than in ischemic priapism.The Penis and Urethra VIDEO Causes of a Persistent Erection Priapism probably results from abnormalities of blood vessels, red blood cells, or nerves that cause blood to become trapped in the erectile tissue of the penis.Sometimes doctors are not able to determine the cause of priapism.Common causes differ somewhat based on age.In men, the most common cause is Drugs taken to treat erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow.The risk of prostate cancer increases as men age.Warning signs In boys and men with priapism, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.They include Severe pain Age less than 10 years Recent injury to the penis or groin area Fever and night sweats When to see a doctor All boys and men who have priapism should see a doctor immediately for treatment.If warning signs are present, further evaluation may be necessary to determine whether the cause of priapism is something unusual or serious.What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about symptoms and medical history and then do a physical examination.What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of priapism and the tests that may need to be done .Doctors may also do a neurologic examination to look for signs of a spinal cord disorder.Table Testing The need for testing depends on what doctors find during the history and physical examination.Often, the type of priapism (ischemic or nonischemic) and cause are obvious, such as the use of a drug to treat erectile dysfunction Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. If it is not clear whether priapism is ischemic or nonischemic, doctors may take a sample of blood from the penis to test for the presence of oxygen and other gases (arterial blood gas measurement).They may also do duplex ultrasonography (ultrasonography that measures blood flow and shows structure of the blood vessels through which the blood is flowing).These tests help differentiate ischemic from nonischemic priapism.Ultrasonography may also show the blood flow patterns in priapism and the anatomic abnormalities contributing to priapism.If the cause is still not obvious, doctors test for blood disorders and urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present.Testing includes A complete blood count Urinalysis and Urine Culture Urinalysis, the testing of urine, may be necessary in the evaluation of kidney and urinary tract disorders and can also help evaluate bodywide disorders such as diabetes or liver problems.Because some boys and men may be embarrassed to admit they have used recreational drugs, doctors sometimes do drug screening.Occasionally, magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder.  Treatment of a Persistent Erection Simple measures that can be taken immediately include applying ice, climbing stairs, or both.However, priapism is an emergency.Treatment should begin as soon as possible, preferably by a urologist in an emergency department.Doctors give boys and men who have significant pain a pain killer (analgesic).Other measures are usually needed if priapism is ischemic.After numbing the penis with a local anesthetic, doctors may inject the penis with a drug that causes the blood vessels carrying blood to the penis to narrow (for example, phenylephrine), decreasing blood flow to the penis and causing the swelling to subside.Doctors may also draw blood out of the penis using a needle and syringe (aspiration).Drawing out blood helps reduce pressure and swelling.Sometimes doctors also flush the veins of the penis with a salt water (saline) solution to help remove oxygen-depleted blood or blood clots.These measures may be repeated.If they are still not effective, doctors may create a surgical shunt.A shunt is a passageway that is surgically inserted into the penis to divert excess blood flow and allow circulation in the penis to return to normal.Key Points Priapism is an emergency that requires urgent evaluation and treatment.Drugs, including those used to treat erectile dysfunction, and sickle cell disease are the most common causes.Treatment usually involves injecting a drug into the penis and removing the excess blood from it.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3725, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 A gastrinoma is a tumor usually in the pancreas The pancreas is an organ that contains two types of glandular tissue: Pancreatic acini Islets of Langerhans  The acini produce digestive enzymes.These tumors arise from cells in the pancreas that produce gastrin.Symptoms are similar to those caused by peptic ulcers, including pain and bleeding.Diagnosis includes blood and imaging tests.The survival rate is high if the tumor is completely removed.Treatment includes drugs to reduce acid in the stomach and sometimes surgery and chemotherapy.Gastrinomas are a type of pancreatic endocrine tumor Overview of Pancreatic Endocrine Tumors The pancreas is an organ located in the upper part of the abdomen.It produces digestive juices that are secreted into the digestive tract.Most people with gastrinomas have several tumors clustered in or near the pancreas or the duodenum.About half of the tumors are cancerous.The Pancreas VIDEO Symptoms of Gastrinoma The excess gastrin secreted by the gastrinoma causes the stomach to produce far too much acid.This overproduction of acid can results in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a person has symptoms of aggressive peptic ulcers Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.However, as many as 25% of people with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may not have an ulcer when the diagnosis is made.Rupture, bleeding, and obstruction of the intestine can occur and can be life threatening.For more than half of the people with a gastrinoma, symptoms are no worse than those experienced by people with ordinary peptic ulcer disease.In 25 to 40% of people, diarrhea resulting from the excess acid production is the first symptom.Diagnosis of Gastrinoma Blood tests Imaging tests A doctor suspects a gastrinoma when a person has frequent peptic ulcers or several peptic ulcers that do not respond to the usual ulcer treatments.Blood tests to detect abnormally high levels of gastrin are the most reliable diagnostic tests.These tumors may be difficult to find, however, because usually they are small.Prognosis of Gastrinoma If the tumor is completely surgically removed, people have a greater than 90% chance of surviving 5 to 10 years.If the tumor is not completely removed, people have a 43% chance of surviving 5 years and a 25% chance of surviving 10 years.Treatment of Gastrinoma Methods to reduce levels of stomach acid Sometimes surgical removal Sometimes chemotherapy High doses of proton pump inhibitors, which are acid-reducing drugs Drug Treatment of Stomach Acid Stomach acid plays a role in a number of disorders of the stomach, including peptic ulcer, gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).see table Drug Treatment of Stomach Acid Drug Treatment of Stomach Acid Stomach acid plays a role in a number of disorders of the stomach, including peptic ulcer, gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).If these drugs are not effective enough, injections of octreotide may help.If there is only one tumor and the person does not have multiple endocrine neoplasia, doctors usually do surgery to remove the gastrinoma.In such cases, surgical removal cures about 20% of people.If these treatments do not work, an operation to remove the stomach completely (total gastrectomy) may be necessary.This operation does not remove the tumor, but the gastrin can no longer create ulcers after the acid-producing stomach is removed.If the stomach is removed, daily iron and calcium supplements taken by mouth and monthly injections of vitamin B12 are needed, because absorption of these nutrients is impaired when stomach juices that prepare these nutrients for absorption are no longer available.If cancerous tumors have spread to other parts of the body, chemotherapy may help reduce the number of tumor cells and the levels of gastrin in the blood.However, such therapy does not cure the cancer, which is ultimately fatal.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3945, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Acute porphyrias result from deficiency of certain enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, resulting in accumulation of heme precursors that cause intermittent attacks of abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms.Attacks are precipitated by certain medications and other factors.Diagnosis is based on elevated levels of the porphyrin precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine during attacks.Attacks are treated with glucose or, if more severe, IV heme.Symptomatic treatment, including analgesia, is given as necessary. Acute porphyrias include, in order of decreasing prevalence: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) Variegate porphyria (VP) Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)–deficiency porphyria (exceedingly rare) Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, with or without neurovisceral symptoms, may develop bullous eruptions especially on the hands, forearms, face, neck, or other areas of the skin exposed to sunlight.Among heterozygotes, acute porphyrias are rarely expressed clinically before puberty; after puberty, they are expressed in only about 2 to 4%.Among homozygotes and compound heterozygotes, onset typically is in childhood, and symptoms are often severe.Precipitating Factors Many precipitating factors exist, typically accelerating biosynthesis of heme precursors above the catalytic capacity of the defective enzyme.Accumulation of the porphyrin precursors porphobilinogen (PBG) and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), or in the case of ALAD-deficiency porphyria, ALA alone, results.Attacks probably result from several, sometimes unidentifiable, factors.Identified precipitating factors include Hormonal changes in women, especially during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle Medications Low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diets Alcohol Exposure to organic solvents Infections and other illnesses Surgery Emotional stress Hormonal factors are important.Women are more prone to attacks than men, particularly during periods of hormonal change (eg, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, during oral contraceptive use, during the early weeks of gestation, in the immediate postpartum period).Nevertheless, pregnancy is not contraindicated.Other factors include medications, particularly those that induce hepatic ALA synthase and cytochrome P-450 enzymes.Attacks usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to a precipitating medication.Many medications are problematic, particularly barbiturates, hydantoins, other antiseizure medications, trimethoprim, and reproductive hormones (progesterone and related steroids).However, the degree of risk and the level of certainty vary considerably; current information should be sought from online databases such as www.drugs-porphyria.org and the American Porphyria Foundation.Exposure to sunlight precipitates cutaneous symptoms in variegate porphyria and rarely also in hereditary coproporphyria.Symptoms and Signs of Acute Porphyrias Symptoms and signs of acute porphyrias involve the nervous system, abdomen, or both (neurovisceral).Attacks develop over hours or days and can last up to several weeks.Most gene carriers experience no, or only a few, attacks during their lifetime.Others experience recurrent symptoms.In some women, recurrent attacks often coincide with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.The acute porphyric attack The symptoms and signs of attacks are nonspecific and can mimic many other disease processes.Constipation, fatigue, mental status changes (often described as \"fogginess\"), and insomnia typically precede an acute attack.The most common symptoms of an attack are Abdominal pain Vomiting Abdominal pain may be excruciating and is disproportionate to abdominal tenderness or other physical signs.Abdominal manifestations may result from effects on visceral nerves.Usually, there is no inflammation, the abdomen is not tender, and there are no peritoneal signs.A minority of patients with acute hepatic porphyrias also develop acute pancreatitis Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis is acute inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues).The most common triggers are gallstones and alcohol intake.Temperature and white blood cell count are usually normal or only slightly increased.Bowel distention may develop as a result of paralytic ileus.The urine is red or reddish brown and strongly positive for porphobilinogen during an attack.All components of the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system may be involved.Motor neuropathy is common with severe and prolonged attacks.Muscle weakness usually begins in the extremities but can involve any motor neuron or cranial nerve and proceed to tetraplegia.Bulbar involvement can cause respiratory failure.Central nervous system involvement may cause seizures or mental disturbances (eg, apathy, delirium, depression, agitation, frank psychosis, hallucinations).Seizures, psychotic behavior, and hallucinations may be due to or exacerbated by hyponatremia or hypomagnesemia.Hyponatremia may occur during an acute attack due to excessive vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) release and/or administration of hypotonic IV solutions (5% or 10% dextrose in water), a standard therapy for acute attacks.The cause of hypomagnesemia is poorly understood.Excess catecholamines generally cause restlessness and tachycardia.Rarely, catecholamine-induced arrhythmias cause sudden death.Labile hypertension with transiently high blood pressure may cause vascular changes progressing to irreversible hypertension if untreated.Chronic kidney disease in acute porphyria is multifactorial; acute hypertension (possibly leading to chronic hypertension) is likely a main precipitating factor.However, genetic factors, especially a genetic variation in the peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) gene, which encodes a peptide and amino acid transporter that can affect reabsorption of ALA in the proximal tubule, have been found in patients with acute intermittent porphyria who have developed chronic kidney disease.Specifically, carriers of the higher affinity variant (PEPT2*1*1) have been found to have more severe renal dysfunction than carriers of the lower affinity variants.Subacute and chronic symptoms Some patients have prolonged symptoms of lesser intensity (eg, obstipation, fatigue, headache, back or thigh pain, paresthesias, tachycardia, dyspnea, insomnia, depression, anxiety or other disturbances of mood, seizures).Many patients experience daily symptoms.Skin symptoms in variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria Fragile skin and bullous eruptions may develop on sun-exposed areas, even in the absence of neurovisceral symptoms.Often patients are not aware of the connection to sun exposure.Cutaneous manifestations are identical to those of porphyria cutanea tarda Porphyria Cutanea Tarda Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a comparatively common hepatic porphyria affecting mainly the skin.Liver disease is also common.Late complications of acute porphyrias Motor involvement during acute attacks may lead to persistent muscle weakness and muscle atrophy between attacks.Diagnosis of Acute Porphyrias Urine screen for porphobilinogen (PBG) and creatinine If urine results are positive, quantitative urinary ALA and PBG and creatinine determinations For confirmation of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) and to determine type, genetic analysis Prior to the wide-spread availability of accurate genetic testing, measurement of activity of PBG deaminase [aka HMBS] in red blood cells was used for confirmation of the diagnosis of AIP.However, because ~5% of persons with AIP have normal activity of PBG deaminase in red cells, and because as many as 20% have borderline levels of activity, which overlap with those of normals.it is no longer recommended that such testing be performed routinely for confirmation of the diagnosis.It may still rarely be needed when biochemical testing shows elevated urinary ALA and PBG/creatinine yet genetic testing has failed to unveil a causative mutation.The latter occurs rarely [~ 1/500].Acute attack Misdiagnosis is common because the acute attack is confused with other causes of acute abdomen Acute Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain is common and often inconsequential.Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is almost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease.However, in patients previously diagnosed as gene carriers or who have a positive family history, porphyria should be suspected.Still, even in known gene carriers, other causes must be considered.Red or reddish brown urine, not present before onset of symptoms, is a cardinal sign and is often present during full-blown attacks.A urine specimen should be examined in patients with abdominal pain of unknown cause, especially if severe constipation, vomiting, tachycardia, muscle weakness, bulbar involvement, or psychiatric symptoms occur.If porphyria is suspected, the urine is analyzed for PBG using a rapid qualitative or semiquantitative determination.A positive result or high clinical suspicion necessitates quantitative urinary ALA, PBG, and creatinine measurements, preferentially obtained from the same specimen.PBG and ALA levels, normalized to urinary creatinine concentration, > 5 times normal indicate an acute porphyric attack unless patients are gene carriers in whom porphyrin precursor excretion occurs at similar levels even during the latent phase of the disorder.If urinary PBG/creatinine and ALA/creatinine ratios are normal, an alternative diagnosis must be considered.Measurement of urinary total porphyrins and high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of these porphyrins are helpful.Elevated urinary ALA and coproporphyrin with normal or slightly increased PBG suggests lead poisoning Lead Poisoning Lead poisoning often causes minimal symptoms at first but can cause acute encephalopathy or irreversible organ damage, commonly resulting in cognitive deficits in childrenALAD)-deficiency porphyria, or hereditary tyrosinemia type 1.Analysis of a 24-hour urine specimen is not necessary.Instead, a random urine specimen is used, and PBG and ALA levels are corrected for dilution by relating to the creatinine level of the sample.Electrolytes, including magnesium, should be measuredSIADH).Determination of acute porphyria type Because treatment does not depend on the type of acute porphyria, identification of the specific type is valuable mainly for finding gene carriers among relatives.When the type and mutation are already known from previous testing of relatives, the diagnosis is clear but may be confirmed by gene analysis.Activity of the enzyme ALAD in the red blood cells is readily measurable and can be helpful for establishing the diagnosis in ALAD-deficiency porphyria, in which ALAD activity is severely decreased (< 10% of normal).Similarly, PBG deaminase activity in red blood cells can be measured to help diagnose acute intermittent porphyria, which is suggested by red blood cell PBG deaminase levels that are approximately 50% of normal.However, in approximately 5% of patients with acute intermittent porphyria, PBG deaminase activity in red blood cells is normal.Thus, in many centers, genetic testing is replacing measurements of enzyme activity in red blood cells.If there is no family history to guide the diagnosis, the different forms of acute porphyria are distinguished by characteristic patterns of porphyrin (and precursor) accumulation and excretion in plasma, urine, and stool.When special testing reveals increased levels of ALA and PBG, fecal porphyrins may be measured.Fecal porphyrins are usually normal or minimally increased in acute intermittent porphyria but elevated in hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria.Often, fecal porphyrins are not present in the quiescent phase of acute porphyria.Plasma fluorescence emission after excitation with Soret band of light (~ 410 nm) can be used to differentiate hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria, which have different peak emissions.Specifically, there is a unique peak fluorescence at 626 nm in variegate porphyria, which is useful for establishing the correct diagnosis.This simple and useful test is not available in many large reference laboratories.Family studies in acute porphyrias Children of a gene carrier for an autosomal dominant form of acute porphyria (acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria) have a 50% risk of inheriting the disorder.In contrast, children of patients with ALAD-deficiency porphyria (autosomal recessive inheritance) are obligate carriers but are very unlikely to develop clinical disease.Because early diagnosis followed by counseling reduces the risk of morbidity, children in affected families should be tested before the onset of puberty.Genetic testing is strongly preferred first in the index case and then repeated with targeted genetic testing in all first-degree relatives.In the rare instances when genetic testing has failed to unveil a pathogenic mutation, pertinent red blood cell enzyme activities may be measured.However, genetic testing is preferred for making a definitive diagnosis because of overlap of activities of RBC PBG deaminase, as already described, and because measurements of activities of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) or protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) in white blood cells are difficult and no longer available, either at commercial or research laboratories.Measurement of enzyme activity in red blood cells is subject to variations in how samples are processed and shipped.There is overlap between activity of PBG deaminase in people without porphyria and patents with AIP.About 5% of patients with AIP have normal PBG deaminase activity in red blood cells.Gene analysis can be used for in utero diagnosis (using amniocentesis All procedures used to diagnose genetic disorders, except ultrasonography, are invasive and involve slight fetal riskChorionic Villus Sampling All procedures used to diagnose genetic disorders, except ultrasonography, are invasive and involve slight fetal risk.Prognosis for Acute Porphyrias Advances in medical care and self-care have improved the prognosis of acute porphyrias for symptomatic patients.Still, some patients develop recurrent crises or progressive disease with permanent paralysis or renal failure.Also, frequent need for opioid analgesics may give rise to opioid dependence.Treatment of Acute Porphyrias Eliminate triggers if possible Dextrose (oral or IV) Narcotic and other analgesics for the severe pain Ondansetron and/or promethazine for nausea and vomiting Heme (IV) Givosiran (subcutaneously) Treatment of the acute attack is identical for all the acute porphyrias.Possible triggers (eg, excessive alcohol use, medications) are identified and eliminated.Unless the attack is mild, patients are hospitalized in a darkened, quiet, private room.Heart rate, blood pressure, and fluid and electrolyte balance are monitored.Neurologic status, bladder function, muscle and tendon reflex function, respiratory function, and oxygen saturation are continuously monitored.Symptoms (eg, pain, vomiting) are treated with nonporphyrinogenic medications as needed.Dextrose 300 to 500 g daily down-regulates hepatic ALA synthase (ALAS 1) and relieves symptoms.Dextrose can be given by mouth if patients are not vomiting; otherwise, it is given IV.The usual regimen is 3 L of 10% dextrose solution, given by a central venous catheter over 24 hours (125 mL/hour).However, to avoid overhydration with consequent hyponatremia, 1 L of 50% dextrose solution can be used instead.IV heme is more effective than dextrose and should be given immediately in severe attacks, electrolyte imbalance, or muscle weakness.Heme usually resolves symptoms in 3 to 4 days.If heme therapy is delayed, nerve damage is more severe and recovery is slower and possibly incomplete.Heme is available in the US as lyophilized hematin to be reconstituted in a glass vial with sterile water.The usual dose is 3 to 4 mg/kg IV once a day for 4 days.An alternative is heme arginate, which is given at the same dose, except that it is diluted in 5% dextrose or half-normal or quarter-normal saline.Hematin and heme arginate may cause venous thrombosis and/or thrombophlebitis.Risk of these adverse events appears to be lower if the heme is administered bound to human serum albumin.Such binding also decreases the rate of development of hematin aggregates.Anecdotal experience indicates that tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor blocker, is helpful in the management of hyponatremia during acute attacks.Givosiran can be used to treat adults with acute hepatic porphyria.When given at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg subcutaneously once a month, it reduces the frequency and severity of recurrent attacks of AIP.Givosiran is taken up by hepatocytes where it decreases activity of ALA synthase-1, leading to marked decreases in plasma and urinary concentrations of ALA and PBG, fewer acute attacks, less need for \"rescue\" IV heme, and improved quality of life.Givosiran has generally been well-tolerated, with only a few patients experiencing elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (without jaundice) severe enough to require temporary or permanent cessation of the medication.It also has been associated with mild increases in serum creatinine levels and variable increases in plasma homocysteine levels.Others have described severe fatigue due to givosiran.Treatment of seizures is problematic, because many commonly used antiseizure medications would worsen an attack.Levetiracetam is an antiseizure medication that appears to be safe to use.Recurrent attacks In patients with severe recurrent attacks despite optimal chronic treatment with or intolerance to givosiran, who are at risk of renal damage or permanent neurologic damage, liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation.Successful liver transplantation leads to permanent cure of acute intermittent porphyria.Survival at 1 and 5 years was 92% and 82%, respectively, which is similar to survival rates for liver transplantation for other metabolic disorders.Survival was lower in patients with advanced neurologic impairment at the time of transplant.No patient had AIP attacks after liver transplant, except for one patient who received an auxiliary graft, with her native liver left in place.Liver transplantation has not been described in hereditary coproporphyria.Although not recognized in the latest American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Practice Guideline as a distinct indication for liver transplantation, the hepatic porphyrias would accurately be included within the liver-based metabolic conditions with systemic manifestations.In the absence of standardized Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception points, liver transplantation for AIP would rely upon petition to the regional review board within the transplant center's United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) region.Patients with acute porphyrias should not serve as liver donors even though their liver may appear structurally normal (ie, no cirrhosis) because recipients without previously diagnosed porphyria have developed acute porphyric syndromes; such an outcome helped establish that the acute porphyrias are hepatic disorders.Kidney transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation.9.Thunell S, Henrichson A, Floderus Y, et al: Liver transplantation in a boy with acute porphyria due to aminolaevulinate dehydratase deficiency.Eur J Clin Chem Clin Biochem 30: 599–606, 1992.Prevention of Acute Porphyrias Carriers of acute porphyria should avoid the following: Potentially harmful medications  Heavy alcohol use Smoking Physical or emotional stress or exhaustion Exposure to organic solvents (eg, in herbicides, painting or dry cleaning products) Crash diets Periods of starvation Diets for obesity should provide gradual weight loss and be adopted only during periods of remission.Carriers of variegate porphyria or hereditary coproporphyria should minimize sun exposure; sunscreens that block only ultraviolet B light are ineffective, but opaque zinc oxide or titanium dioxide preparations are beneficial.Support associations, such as the United Porphyrias Association, American Porphyria Foundation and the European Porphyria Network (Epnet), can provide written information and direct counseling.Patients should be identified prominently in the medical record as carriers and should carry a card and wear medical alert jewelry verifying the carrier state and precautions to be observed.A high-carbohydrate diet may decrease the risk of acute attacks.Some patients can sometimes treat mild acute attacks by increasing their intake of dextrose or glucose.Prolonged use should be avoided in order to decrease risk of obesity and dental caries.To prevent renal damage, chronic hypertension should be treated Treatment Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Patients with evidence of impaired renal function are referred to a nephrologist.The incidence of hepatocellular cancer is high among carriers of acute porphyria, especially in patients with active disease.Patients who are > 49 years should undergo yearly or twice yearly surveillance, including liver screening with ultrasonography.Early intervention can be curative and increases life expectancy.Recurrent or predictable attacks Patients who experience recurrent and predictable attacks (typically women with attacks related to the menstrual cycle) can be given monthly givosiran at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight by subcutaneous injection.Frequent premenstrual attacks in some women are aborted by administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist plus low-dose estrogen.Low-dose oral contraceptives are sometimes used successfully, but the progestin component is likely to exacerbate the porphyria.3.Sardh E, Harper P, Balwani M, et al: Phase 1 trial of an RNA interference therapy for acute intermittent porphyria.N Engl J Med 380(6): 549–558, 2019.4.Wang B, Rudnick S, Cengia, Bonkovsy HL: Acute hepatic porphyrias: Review and recent progress.Hepatol Commun 3:193−206, 2019.Key Points Acute porphyrias cause intermittent attacks of abdominal pain and neurologic symptoms; some types also have cutaneous manifestations that are triggered by sun exposure.Attacks have many triggers, including hormones, medications, low-calorie and low-carbohydrate diets, and alcohol ingestion.Attacks typically involve severe abdominal pain (with a non-tender abdomen) and vomiting; any component of the peripheral and central nervous system may be affected but muscle weakness is common.Urine is often reddish-brown during an attack.Do a qualitative urine test for porphobilinogen (PBG) and confirm a positive result with quantitative delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and PBG measurements.Treat acute attacks with oral or IV dextrose and, for severe attacks, IV heme.Treat patients with recurrent acute attacks with IV heme, givosiran, or, in some cases, liver

{"text": "【0】 Connective tissue is the tough, often fibrous tissue that binds the body's structures together and provides support and elasticity.Bones serve as rigid structures to the body and as shields to protect delicate internal organs.The elastic fibers allow the ligaments to stretch to some extent.Tendons firmly attach each end of a muscle to a bone.Connective tissue is also present in other parts of the body, such as the skin and internal organs.The characteristics of connective tissue and the types of cells it contains vary, depending on where it is found in the body.Connective tissue is strong and thus able to support weight and tension.There are over 200 disorders that involve connective tissue.Specific disorders discussed here include Chondromalacia patellae Chondromalacia Patellae Chondromalacia patellae is softening of the cartilage under the kneecap (patella), causing knee pain.Chondromalacia patellae typically develops in adolescents.This disorder is caused by mutations in certain genes.Certain hereditary disorders cause connective tissue throughout the body to form abnormally.In general, hereditary connective tissue disorders develop in childhood but last throughout life.Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation X-rays Biopsy Analysis of genes Most hereditary connective tissue disorders are diagnosed based on their symptoms and findings during a physical examination.X-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease.A biopsy (removal of a tissue sample for examination under a microscope) can also help.The tissue is usually removed using a local anesthetic, which numbs the area.Analysis of genes, usually from a sample of blood, may help doctors diagnose some hereditary disorders.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4964, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Pain in and around the teeth is a common problem, particularly among patients with poor oral hygiene.Pain may be constant, felt after stimulation (eg, heat, cold, sweet food or drink, chewing, brushing), or both. Etiology of Toothache The most common causes of toothache  are Dental caries Pulpitis Periapical abscess Trauma Erupting wisdom tooth (causing pericoronitis) Toothache is usually caused by dental caries and its consequences.Caries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities.The symptoms—tender, painful teeth—appear late.Pain usually occurs after stimulation from cold, heat, sweet food or drink, or brushing; these stimuli cause fluid to move within dentinal tubules to induce a response in the pulp.As long as the discomfort does not persist after the stimulus is removed, the pulp is likely healthy enough to be maintained.This is referred to as normal dentinal sensitivity, reversible pulpalgia, or reversible pulpitis.Pulpitis is inflammation of the dental pulp resulting from untreated caries, trauma, or multiple restorations.Its principal symptom is pain.It may be reversible or irreversible.Pressure necrosis frequently results from pulpitis.Pain may be spontaneous or in response to stimulation, particularly heat or cold.In both cases, pain lingers for a minute or longer.Once the pulp becomes necrotic, pain ends briefly (hours to weeks).Subsequently, periapical inflammation (apical periodontitis) or an abscess develops.Periapical abscess may follow untreated caries or pulpitis.The tooth is extremely sensitive to percussion (eg, tapping with a metal dental probe or tongue blade) and chewing.The abscess may point intraorally and eventually drain or may become a cellulitis.Tooth trauma can damage the pulp.The damage may manifest soon after the injury or up to decades later.Pericoronitis is inflammation and infection of the tissue between the tooth and its overlying flap of gingiva (operculum).It usually occurs in an erupting wisdom tooth (almost always a lower one).Complications Rarely, sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactions.More commonly, pain resulting from a sinus infection is perceived as originating in the unaffected teeth adjacent to the sinus, mistakenly creating the impression of a dental origin.Rarely, cavernous sinus thrombosis Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare, typically septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, usually caused by nasal furuncles or bacterial sinusitisLudwig angina (submandibular space infection Submandibular Space Infection Submandibular space infection is acute cellulitis of the soft tissues below the mouth.Symptoms include pain, dysphagia, and potentially fatal airway obstruction.Table Evaluation of Toothache History of present illness should identify the location and duration of the pain and whether it is constant or present only after stimulation.Specific triggering factors to review include heat, cold, sweet food or drink, chewing, and brushing.Any preceding trauma or dental work should be noted.Review of systems should seek symptoms of complications, including face pain, swelling, or both (dental abscess, sinusitis); pain below the tongue, difficulty swallowing, and tongue elevation or protrusion (submandibular space infection); pain with bending forward (sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactionsCavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare, typically septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, usually caused by nasal furuncles or bacterial sinusitis.Past medical history should note previous dental problems and treatment.Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed for fever.The examination focuses on the face and mouth.The face is inspected for swelling and is palpated for induration and tenderness.The oral examination includes inspection for gum inflammation and caries and any localized swelling at the base of a tooth that may represent a pointing apical abscess.If no tooth is clearly involved, teeth in the area of pain are percussed for tenderness with a tongue depressor.Also, an ice cube can be applied briefly to each tooth, removing it immediately once pain is felt.In healthy teeth, the pain stops almost immediately.Pain lingering more than a few seconds indicates pulp damage (eg, irreversible Pulpitis is inflammation of the dental pulp resulting from untreated caries, trauma, or multiple restorations.Its principal symptom is pain.The floor of the mouth is palpated for induration and tenderness, suggesting a deep space infection.Neurologic examination, concentrating on the cranial nerves, should be done in patients with fever, headache, or facial swelling.Red flags Findings of particular concern are Headache Fever Swelling or tenderness of floor of the mouth Cranial nerve abnormalities Interpretation of findings Red flag finding of headache suggests sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactions.However, presence of vision symptoms or abnormalities of the pupils or of ocular motility suggests cavernous sinus thrombosis.Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare, typically septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, usually caused by nasal furuncles or bacterial sinusitisFever is unusual with routine dental infection unless there is significant local extension.Bilateral tenderness and swelling of the floor of the mouth suggest Ludwig angina Submandibular Space Infection Submandibular space infection is acute cellulitis of the soft tissues below the mouth.Symptoms include pain, dysphagia, and potentially fatal airway obstruction.Difficulty opening the mouth (trismus) can occur with any lower molar infection but is common only with pericoronitis Symptoms and Signs .Isolated dental condition: Patients without red flag findings or facial swelling likely have an isolated dental condition, which, although uncomfortable, is not serious.Clinical findings, particularly the nature of the pain, help suggest a cause .Because of its innervation, the pulp can perceive stimuli (eg, heat, cold, sweets) only as pain.An important distinction is whether there is continuous pain or pain only on stimulation and, if pain is only on stimulation, whether the pain lingers after the stimulus is removed.Swelling at the base of a tooth, on the cheek, or both indicates infection, either cellulitis or abscess.A tender, fluctuant area at the base of a tooth suggests a pointing abscess.Table Testing Dental x-rays are the mainstay of testing but can be deferred to a dentist.The rare cases in which cavernous sinus

angina Submandibular Space Infection Submandibular space infection is acute cellulitis of the soft tissues below the mouth.Symptoms include pain, dysphagia, and potentially fatal airway obstructionCT or MRI.Treatment of Toothache Topical or oral analgesics Sometimes rinses or systemic antibiotics Analgesics .For severe dental pain, local nerve block injections with bupivacaine hydrochloride and epinephrine 1:200,000 may relieve pain for many hours until the patient receives definitive dental care.A patient who is seen frequently for emergencies but who never receives definitive dental treatment despite availability may be seeking opioids.How To Do Dental Nerve Blocks How To Do a Supraperiosteal Infiltration Procedure demonstrated by Scott Solow, DDS, Pediatric Dentistry and

Adequate anesthesia is important.Postprocedure dry socket is to be prevented Antibiotics directed at oral flora are given for most disorders beyond irreversible pulpitis (eg, necrotic pulp, abscess, cellulitis).Patients with pericoronitis may also receive an antibiotic.However, antibiotics can be deferred if patients can be seen the same day by a dentist, who may be able to treat the infection by removing the source (eg, by extraction, pulpectomy, or curettage).When antibiotics are used, penicillin or amoxicillin is preferred, with clindamycin the alternative for patients allergic to penicillin.An abscess associated with well-developed (soft) fluctuance is typically drained through an incision with a #15 scalpel blade at the most dependent point of the swelling.A rubber drain, held by a suture, may be placed. Pericoronitis or erupting 3rd molars are treated with chlorhexidine 0.12% rinses or hypertonic salt-water soaks (1 tbsp salt mixed in a glass of hot water—no hotter than the coffee or tea a patient normally drinks).The salt water is held in the mouth on the affected side until it cools and then is expectorated and immediately replaced with another mouthful.Three or 4 glasses of salt water a day may control inflammation and pain pending dental evaluation.Teething pain in young children may be treated with weight-based doses of acetaminophen or ibuprofen.Topical treatments can include chewing hard crackers (eg, biscotti) and chewing on anything cold (eg, gel-containing teething rings).Topical benzocaine can result in methemoglobinemia if used repeatedly or in large amounts and so is usually not recommended.The rare patient with cavernous sinus thrombosis Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a very rare, typically septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, usually caused by nasal furuncles or bacterial sinusitisLudwig angina Submandibular Space Infection Submandibular space infection is acute cellulitis of the soft tissues below the mouth.Symptoms include pain, dysphagia, and potentially fatal airway obstruction.Geriatrics Essentials Older patients are more prone to caries of the root surfaces, usually because of gingival recession and drug-induced xerostomia.Periodontitis often begins in young adulthood; if untreated, tooth pain and loss are common in old age.Key Points Most toothache involves dental caries or its complications (eg, pulpitis, abscess).Symptomatic treatment and dental referral are usually adequate.Antibiotics are given if signs of an abscess, necrotic pulp, or more severe conditions are present and if same-day dental care is not available.Very rare but serious complications include extension of dental infection to the floor of the mouth or to the cavernous sinus.Dental infections rarely cause sinusitis, but sinus infection may cause pain perceived as originating in the teeth.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8004, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Hypertensive retinopathy is retinal vascular damage caused by hypertension.Signs usually develop late in the disease.Funduscopic examination shows arteriolar constriction, arteriovenous nicking, vascular wall changes, flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, yellow hard exudates, and optic disk edema.Treatment is directed at controlling blood pressure and, when vision loss occurs, treating the retina.Pathophysiology of Hypertensive Retinopathy Acute blood pressure elevation typically causes reversible vasoconstriction in retinal blood vessels, and hypertensive crisis may cause optic disk edema.More prolonged or severe hypertension leads to exudative vascular changes, a consequence of endothelial damage and necrosis.Other changes (eg, arteriole wall thickening, arteriovenous nicking) typically require years of elevated blood pressure to develop.Smoking compounds the adverse effects of hypertensive retinopathy.Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothCentral Retinal Artery Occlusion and Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion Central retinal artery occlusion occurs when the central retinal artery becomes blocked, usually due to an embolus.It causes sudden, painless, unilateral, and usually severe vision lossCentral Retinal Vein Occlusion and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion Central retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the central retinal vein by a thrombus.It causes painless vision loss, ranging from mild to severe, and usually occurs suddenly.Also, hypertension combined with diabetes greatly increases risk of vision loss.Patients with hypertensive retinopathy are at high risk of hypertensive damage to other end organs.Symptoms and Signs of Hypertensive Retinopathy Symptoms usually do not develop until late in the disease and include blurred vision or visual field defects.In the early stages, funduscopy identifies arteriolar constriction, with a decrease in the ratio of the width of the retinal arterioles to the retinal venules.Chronic, poorly controlled hypertension causes the following: Permanent arterial narrowing Arteriovenous crossing abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking) Arteriosclerosis with moderate vascular wall changes (copper wiring) to more severe vascular wall hyperplasia and thickening (silver wiring) Sometimes total vascular occlusion occurs.Arteriovenous nicking is a major predisposing factor to the development of a branch retinal vein occlusion.If acute disease is severe, the following can develop: Superficial flame-shaped hemorrhages Small, white, superficial foci of retinal ischemia (cotton-wool spots) Yellow hard exudates Optic disk edema Hypertensive Retinopathy Hypertensive Retinopathy (Moderate) Moderate hypertensive retinopathy is characterized by thinned, straight arteries, intraretinal hemorrhages, and yellow hard exudates.RALPH C.EAGLE, JR./SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Hypertensive Retinopathy (Copper Wiring) This image shows retinal arteriolar narrowing due to thickening and opacification of arteriolar walls (copper wiring) caused by hypertensive arteriosclerosis.© Springer Science+Business Media Hypertensive Retinopathy (Star-Shaped Exudates and Papilledema) The cardinal funduscopic feature of malignant hypertension is optic disk swelling, which appears as blurring and elevation of disk margins.The image also shows a characteristic star-shaped macular lesion caused by leaking retinal vessels.© Springer Science+Business Media Yellow hard exudates represent intraretinal lipid deposition from leaking retinal vessels.These exudates can develop a star shape within the macula, particularly when hypertension is severe.In severe hypertension, the optic disk becomes congested and edematous (papilledema indicating hypertensive crisis Hypertensive Emergencies A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with signs of damage to target organs (primarily the brain, cardiovascular system, and kidneys).Diagnosis of Hypertensive Retinopathy Diagnosis is by history (duration and severity of hypertension) and funduscopy.Treatment of Hypertensive Retinopathy Hypertensive retinopathy is managed primarily by controlling hypertension.Other vision-threatening conditions should also be aggressively controlled.If vision loss occurs, treatment of the retinal edema with laser or with intravitreal injection of corticosteroids or antivascular endothelial growth factor drugs (eg, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, bevacizumab) may be useful.Key Points Chronic hypertension progressively damages the retina, causing few or no symptoms until changes are advanced.Chronic hypertensive retinopathy is recognized by permanent arterial narrowing, arteriovenous crossing abnormalities (arteriovenous nicking), arteriosclerosis with moderate vascular wall changes (copper wiring), or more severe vascular wall hyperplasia and thickening (silver wiring).Hypertensive crisis can cause retinopathy with superficial flame-shaped hemorrhages;

{"text": "【0】 Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.Other monitoring is ongoing and continuous, provided by complex devices that require special training and experience to operate.Most such devices generate an alarm if certain physiologic parameters are exceeded.Every intensive care unit (ICU) should strictly follow protocols for investigating alarms.Monitoring usually includes measurement of vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate), quantification of all fluid intake and output, and often intracranial pressure and/or daily weight.Blood pressure may be recorded by an automated sphygmomanometer, or an arterial catheter can be used for continuous blood pressure monitoring.A transcutaneous sensor for pulse oximetry is used as well.Blood Tests Although frequent blood draws can destroy veins, cause pain, and lead to anemia, ICU patients typically have routine daily blood tests to help detect problems early.Placement of a central venous catheter Central Venous Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheterArterial Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter.Generally, patients need a daily set of electrolytes and a complete blood count (CBC).Patients should also have magnesium, phosphate, and ionized calcium levels measured.Patients receiving total parenteral nutrition need weekly liver tests and coagulation profiles.Other tests (eg, blood culture for fever, serial CBCs for possible active blood loss]) are done as needed.Point-of-care testing uses miniaturized, highly automated devices to do certain blood tests at the patient’s bedside or unit (particularly ICU, emergency department, and operating room).Commonly available tests include blood chemistries, glucose, arterial blood gases (ABGs), CBC, cardiac markers, and coagulation tests.Many are done in < 2 minutes and require < 0.5 mL blood.Cardiac Monitoring Most critical care patients have cardiac activity monitored by a 3-lead system; signals are usually sent to a central monitoring station by a small radio transmitter worn by the patient.Automated systems generate alarms for abnormal rates and rhythms and store abnormal tracings for subsequent review.Some specialized cardiac monitors track advanced parameters associated with coronary ischemia, although their clinical benefit is unclear.These parameters include continuous ST segment monitoring and heart rate variability.Loss of normal beat-to-beat variability signals a reduction in autonomic activity and possibly coronary ischemia and increased risk of death.Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC) Monitoring Use of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC, or Swan-Ganz catheter) is becoming less common in ICU patients.This balloon-tipped, flow-directed catheter is inserted via central veins through the right side of the heart into the pulmonary artery.The catheter typically contains several ports that can monitor pressure or inject fluids.Some PACs also include a sensor to measure central (mixed) venous oxygen saturation.Data from PACs are used mainly to determine cardiac output and preload.Preload is most commonly estimated by the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary artery wedge pressure) Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.However, preload may be more accurately determined by right ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is measured using fast-response thermistors gated to heart rate.Despite longstanding use, PACs have not been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.Rather, PAC use has been associated with excess mortality.This finding may be explained by complications of PAC use and misinterpretation of the data obtained.Nevertheless, some physicians believe PACs, when combined with other objective and clinical data, aid in the management of certain critically ill patients.As with many physiologic measurements, a changing trend is typically more significant than a single abnormal value.Possible indications for PACs are listed in the table Potential Indications for Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Potential Indications for Pulmonary Artery Catheterization .Table Potential Indications for Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Cardiac disorders Acute valvular regurgitation Cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac fillingComplicated heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunctionComplicated myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryVentricular septal rupture Hemodynamic instability* Assessment of volume status Shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and deathHemodynamic monitoring Cardiac surgery Postoperative care in critically ill patients Surgery and postoperative care in patients with significant heart disease Pulmonary disorders Complicated pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvisPulmonary hypertension Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathicParticularly if inotropic drugs are required.Procedure The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is inserted through a special catheter in the subclavian (usually left), internal jugular (usually right), or, less often, a femoral vein with the balloon (at the tip of the catheter) deflated.Once the catheter tip reaches the superior vena cava, inflation of the balloon permits blood flow to guide the catheter.The position of the catheter tip is usually determined by pressure monitoring  or occasionally by fluoroscopy when available.Entry into the right ventricle is indicated by a sudden increase in systolic pressure to about 30 mm Hg; diastolic pressure remains unchanged from right atrial or vena caval pressure.When the catheter enters the pulmonary artery, systolic pressure does not change, but diastolic pressure rises above right ventricular end-diastolic pressure or central venous pressure (CVP); ie, the pulse pressure (the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures) narrows.Further movement of the catheter wedges the balloon in a distal pulmonary artery.Once in place in the pulmonary artery, the balloon should be deflated.A chest x-ray confirms proper placement.Pulmonary Artery Catheter Insertion VIDEO Table The systolic pressure (normal, 15 to 30 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (normal, 5 to 13 mm Hg) are recorded with the catheter balloon deflated.The diastolic pressure corresponds well to the occlusion pressure, although diastolic pressure can exceed occlusion pressure when pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated secondary to primary pulmonary disease (eg, pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, causes progressive pulmonary fibrosisPulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathic.Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary artery wedge pressure) With the balloon inflated, pressure at the tip of the catheter reflects the static back pressure of the pulmonary veins.The balloon must not remain inflated for > 30 seconds to prevent pulmonary infarction.Normally, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) approximates mean left atrial pressure, which in turn approximates left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).LVEDP reflects left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV).The LVEDV represents preload, which is the actual target parameter.Many factors cause PAOP to reflect LVEDV inaccurately.These factors include mitral stenosis Mitral Stenosis Mitral stenosis is narrowing of the mitral orifice that impedes blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.The usual cause is rheumatic feverH2O), and changes in left ventricular compliance (eg, due to myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Technical difficulties result from excessive balloon inflation, improper catheter position, alveolar pressure exceeding pulmonary venous pressure, or severe pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.It has many secondary causes; some cases are idiopathic.Elevated PAOP occurs in left-sided heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Decreased PAOP occurs in hypovolemia or decreased preload.Mixed venous oxygenation Mixed venous blood comprises blood from the superior and inferior vena cava that has passed through the right heart to the pulmonary artery.The blood may be sampled from the distal port of the PAC, but some catheters have embedded fiberoptic sensors that directly measure oxygen saturation.Causes of low mixed venous oxygen content (SmvO2) include anemia, pulmonary disease, carboxyhemoglobin, low cardiac output, and increased tissue metabolic needs.The ratio of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) to (SaO2 − SmvO2) determines the adequacy of oxygen delivery.The ideal ratio is 4:1, whereas 2:1 is the minimum acceptable ratio to maintain aerobic metabolic needs.Cardiac output (CO) Cardiac output is measured by intermittent bolus injection of ice water or, in newer catheters, continuous warm thermodilution .The cardiac index divides the cardiac output by body surface area to correct for patient size .Other variables can be calculated from cardiac output.They include systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular stroke work (RVSW) and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW).Table Complications Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) may be difficult to insert.Pulmonary infarction secondary to overinflated or permanently wedged balloons, pulmonary artery perforation, intracardiac perforation, valvular injury, and endocarditis Infective Endocarditis Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci or staphylococci) or fungi.Rarely, the catheter may curl into a knot within the right ventricle (especially in patients with heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or increased pulmonary pressure).Pulmonary artery rupture occurs in < 0.1% of PAC insertions.This catastrophic complication is often fatal and occurs immediately on wedging the catheter either initially or during a subsequent occlusion pressure check.Thus, many physicians prefer to monitor pulmonary artery diastolic pressures rather than occlusion pressures.Noninvasive Cardiac Output Assessment Other methods of determining cardiac output, such as point-of-care ultrasonography, esophageal Doppler monitoring, and thoracic bioimpedance, can be used to avoid the complications of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs).Although these methods are potentially useful, none is yet as reliable as a PAC.Point-of-care ultrasonography Point-of-care ultrasonography has become indispensable in critical care for rapid diagnosis of functional as well as anatomic abnormalities.Hand-held ultrasound devices are portable and thus save time and obviate the need to move the patient.The quality of information obtained from point-of-care ultrasonography sometimes matches or exceeds that provided by more expensive and labor-intensive imaging techniques.Judicious use of ultrasonography decreases exposure to ionizing radiation.In acute care, point-of-care ultrasonography is particularly useful for evaluating the abdomen, thorax, and heart.It can sometimes be used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis.Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to identify free (extravascular) fluid, typically as part of focused assessment with sonography for trauma Testing Injury is the number one cause of death for people aged 1 to 44.In the US, there were 278,345 trauma deaths in 2020, about 70% of which were accidentalFAST—usually done during trauma evaluation and resuscitation).Free fluid in a hypotensive trauma patient is likely to be blood, an indication for surgical intervention.Other abdominal organs can also be evaluated.Cardiac ultrasonography is essential for evaluating anatomy as well as hemodynamic status by assessing chamber size, wall motion, contractility, and ejection fraction.A focused rapid echocardiographic evaluation (FREE) is one example of a structured ultrasound assessment.FREE is done using the 4 standard echocardiographic windows: the parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical, and subxyphoid windows.FREE evaluates left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI) and allows for the evaluation of patients with hypotension (1 Noninvasive cardiac output assessment reference Some monitoring of critical care patients depends on direct observation and physical examination and is intermittent, with the frequency depending on the patient’s illness.In evaluating patients with hypotension, ultrasonography is indispensable in confirming the following: Hypovolemia: Even if the inferior vena cava looks full (as can occur in a hypovolemic ventilated patient), hypovolemia is suggested by a hyperdynamic left ventricle with almost no blood at the end of systole and little at the end of diastole.Left ventricular dysfunction: Left ventricular dysfunction is suggested by wall motion abnormalities and decreased ejection fraction that is either measured or estimated (by an experienced operator who assesses the overall size and apparent contractility and inward movement and thickening of the various segments of the left ventricular wall).Right ventricular failure: The right ventricle should be 60% the size of the left ventricle, triangular, and have a rough inside surface.Right ventricular failure may suggest pulmonary embolism.Pericardial effusions and tamponade Thoracic ultrasonography can be used to identify pleural fluid and pneumothorax with higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than with plain x-rays.For example, loss of lung sliding in an area spanning over 3 intercostal spaces and A-lines (horizontal artifacts) are each nearly 100% sensitive, and, when combined, appear highly specific.The echogenicity of pleural fluid and changes in the pleura and adjacent lung parenchyma also help determine the etiology of pleural fluid. Point-of-care ultrasonography ) Point-of-care ultrasonography is also useful for looking for deep venous thrombosis and evaluating intra-abdominal organs.Esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) This device is a soft 6-mm catheter that is passed nasopharyngeally into the esophagus and positioned behind the heart.A Doppler flow probe at its tip allows continuous monitoring of cardiac output and stroke volume.Unlike the invasive PAC, the esophageal Doppler monitor (EDM) does not cause pneumothorax, arrhythmia, or infection.An EDM may actually be more accurate than a PAC in patients with cardiac valvular lesions, septal defects, arrhythmias, or pulmonary hypertension.However, the EDM may lose its waveform with only a slight positional change and produce dampened, inaccurate readings.Thoracic bioimpedance These systems use topical electrodes on the anterior chest and neck to measure electrical impedance of the thorax.This value varies with beat-to-beat changes in thoracic blood volume and hence can estimate cardiac output.The system is harmless and provides values quickly (within 2 to 5 minutes); however, the technique is very sensitive to alteration of the electrode contact with the patient.Thoracic bioimpedance is more valuable in recognizing changes in cardiac output in a given patient than in precisely measuring its absolute value.Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Intracranial pressure monitoring is standard for patients with severe closed head injury and is occasionally used for some other brain disorders, such as in selected cases of hydrocephalus is accumulation of excessive amounts of CSF, causing cerebral ventricular enlargement and/or increased intracranial pressureCerebral Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs) Arteriovenous malformation (AVMs) are tangled, dilated blood vessels in which arteries flow directly into veins.These devices are used to monitor ICP (normally 5 to 15 mm Hg) and to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure (mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure).Typically, the cerebral perfusion pressure should be kept > 60 mm Hg.Several types of intracranial pressure monitors are available.Extraventricular drain (EVD) is the most useful method; a catheter is placed through the skull into a cerebral ventricle (ventriculostomy catheter).This device is preferred because the catheter can also drain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and hence decrease intracranial pressure.However, the EVD is also the most invasive method, has the highest infection rate, and is the most difficult to place.Occasionally, the EVD becomes occluded due to severe brain edema.Other types of intracranial devices include an intraparenchymal monitor, subarachnoid bolt, subdural bolt, and an epidural bolt inserted between the skull and the dura through which a pressure sensor is passed.Of these, the intraparenchymal monitor is more commonly used.All intracranial pressure devices should usually be changed or removed after 5 to 7 days because infection is a risk.Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) NIRS is a noninvasive method of continuously monitoring end organ oxygenation and perfusion.NIRS sensors are usually placed on the skin above the target tissue to monitor mitochondrial cytochrome redox states, which reflect tissue perfusion.NIRS may help diagnose acute compartment syndromes (eg, in trauma) or ischemia after free tissue transfer and may be helpful in postoperative monitoring of lower-extremity vascular bypass grafts.NIRS monitoring of small-bowel pH may be used to gauge the adequacy of resuscitation.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9126, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells.Most of the > 100 subtypes infect cutaneous epithelium and cause skin warts; some types infect mucosal epithelium and cause anogenital warts.Skin or anogenital warts are diagnosed based on clinical appearance and are usually treated with topical medications or cytodestructive treatments.Genital warts may persist and spread widely in patients with decreased cell-mediated immunity (eg, due to pregnancy or HIV infection).Some types that infect mucosal epithelium can lead to anogenital or oropharyngeal cancer.Pap tests and/or HPV testing is recommended to screen for cervical cancer and anal cancer in high-risk patients.Vaccines are available to protect against many of the HPV strains that can cause genital warts and cancer HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI).HPV is so common that 80% of sexually active unvaccinated people get the virus at some point in their life (1 General reference Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells.In the US, about 14 million people become newly infected with HPV each year; before the HPV vaccine became available, each year roughly 340,000 to 360,000 patients sought care for genital warts caused by HPV.Most HPV infections clear spontaneously within 1 to 2 years, but some persist.General reference 1.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Human papillomavirus (HPV).Accessed July 6, 2022.Etiology of HPV Infection There are > 100 known types of HPV.Some infect cutaneous epithelium and cause common skin warts are common, benign, epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection.They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies.Diagnosis is by examination.Some infect primarily the mucosa of the anogenital region, as well as the oropharyngeal and laryngeal areas.Important manifestations of anogenital HPV include Genital warts (condyloma acuminatum) Intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or penis Laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers Bowenoid papulosis Some data suggest HPV plays a role in the pathogenesis of some bladder cancers.Condylomata acuminata are benign anogenital warts most often caused by HPV types 6 and 11, as are laryngeal and oropharyngeal warts.Low- and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma may be caused by HPV.Virtually all cervical cancer Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma.The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infectionHPV; about 70% is caused by types 16 and 18, and many of the rest result from types 31, 33, 45.52, and 58 (1 Reference Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells.HPV types that affect mainly the anogenital area can be transmitted to the oropharynx by orogenital contact; type 16 appears responsible for many cases of oropharyngeal cancer Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oropharyngeal cancer refers to cancer of the tonsil, base and posterior one third of the tongue, soft palate, and posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls.HPV types 16 and 18 can also cause cancer in other areas, including the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis.Pearls & Pitfalls Virtually all cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).HPV is transmitted from lesions during contact with skin or mucosa.The types that affect the anogenital region are usually transmitted sexually by vaginal or anal intercourse, but digital, oral, and nonpenetrative genital contact may be involved.Genital warts are more common among immunocompromised patients.Growth rates vary, but pregnancy, immunosuppression, or maceration of the skin may accelerate the growth and spread of warts.Symptoms and Signs of HPV Infection Warts caused by HPV appear after an incubation period of 1 to 6 months.Visible anogenital warts are usually soft, moist, minute pink or gray polyps (raised lesions) that Enlarge May become pedunculated Have rough surfaces May occur in clusters The warts are usually asymptomatic, but some patients have itching, burning, or discomfort.In men, warts occur most commonly under the foreskin, on the coronal sulcus, within the urethral meatus, and on the penile shaft.They may occur around the anus and in the rectum, especially in men who have sex with men.In women, warts occur most commonly on the vulva, vaginal wall, cervix, and perineum; the urethra and anal region may be affected.HPV types 16 and 18 usually cause endocervical or anal intraepithelial lesions that are difficult to see and diagnose clinically.Images of Genital Warts Genital Warts This photo shows small, soft, pink genital warts on the penile shaft.© Springer Science+Business Media Genital Warts (Coronal Sulcus) This photo shows pink and raised genital warts (arrows) at the coronal sulcus of the penis.© Springer Science+Business Media Genital Warts (Glans) This photo shows the typical rough, pedunculated appearance of genital warts on the glans.© Springer Science+Business Media Genital Warts (Male) Image courtesy of Dr.M.F.Rein via the Public Health Image Library of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Genital Warts (Vulva) Genital warts on the vulva may be raised and light-colored with an irregular, rough surface.Image courtesy of Joe Millar via the Public Health Image Library of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Diagnosis of HPV Infection Physical examination HPV testing Cervical, and sometimes anal, cytology (Pap test) Sometimes colposcopy, anoscopy, or both Genital warts are usually diagnosed with gross visual inspection.Their appearance usually differentiates them from condyloma lata Secondary syphilis of secondary syphilis (which are flat-topped) and from carcinomas.However, serologic tests for syphilis Diagnostic tests for syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum and is characterized by 3 sequential symptomatic stages separated by periods of asymptomatic latent infectionSTS) should be done initially and after 3 months.Biopsies of atypical, bleeding, ulcerated, or persistent warts may be necessary to exclude carcinoma.Cervical and anal intraepithelial lesions can be visualized only by colposcopy and anoscopy.Applying a 3 to 5% solution of acetic acid for a few minutes before colposcopy causes lesions to whiten and enhances visualization and detection of small lesions.Screening for cervical cancer Diagnosis Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma.The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infectionTHE MANUAL.In low-resource settings without access to routine Pap tests or colposcopy, screening and evaluation for cervical cancer include HPV testing and/or visual inspection with use of acetic acid or Lugol iodine (1 Diagnosis references Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cellsDiagnosis references Human papillomavirus (HPV) infects epithelial cells.Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for oncogenic HPV subtypes are used as part of routine cervical cancer screening in women.Initial tests typical detect any one of at l3 common high-risk types.Follow-up HPV genotype tests may be done to detect the most high-risk types, typically 16, 18, or 45.No HPV testing for men is available for clinical use.Clinicians should check for malignant oral lesions potentially caused by HPV during routine examination of the mouth and oral cavity The mouth and oral cavity The first routine dental examination should take place by age 1 year or when the first tooth erupts.Diagnosis references 1.World Health Organization (WHO): Human papillomavirus (‎HPV)‎ nucleic acid amplification tests (‎NAATs)‎ to screen for cervical pre-cancer lesions and prevent cervical cancer;

patient preference; cost of treatment; convenience; adverse effects; and the practitioner's experience .Genital warts may be treated with Caustics Topical medications Cryotherapy Electrocauterization Laser Surgical excision A local or general anesthetic is used depending on the size and number to be removed.Extensive vulvovaginal warts may require laser ablation.For anal warts, removal with a resectoscope may be the most effective treatment; a general anesthetic is used.Topical treatments include antimitotics (eg, podophyllotoxin, podophyllin, 5-fluorouracil), caustics (eg, trichloroacetic acid), interferon inducers (eg, imiquimod), and sinecatechins (a botanical product with an unknown mechanism).These are widely used but usually require multiple applications over weeks to months and are frequently ineffective.Before topical treatments are applied, surrounding tissue should be protected with petroleum jelly.Patients should be warned that after treatment, the area may be painful.Interferon alfa (eg, interferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-n3), intralesionally or IM, has cleared intractable lesions on the skin and genitals, but optimal administration and long-term effects are unclear.Also, in some patients with bowenoid papulosis of the genitals (caused by type 16 HPV), lesions initially disappeared after treatment with interferon alfa but reappeared as invasive cancers.By removing the moist underside of the prepuce, circumcision may prevent recurrences in uncircumcised men.Current sex partners of people with genital warts should be examined and, if infected, treated.For intraurethral lesions, thiotepa (an alkylating medication), instilled in the urethra, is effective.In men, 5-fluorouracil applied 2 to 3 times a day is highly effective for urethral lesions, but rarely, it causes swelling, leading to urethral obstruction.Intraurethral lesions are typically managed by a urologist.Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is monitored with excisional biopsy Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma.The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.Vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia are treated with surgical excision.Sex partners of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma and of patients with bowenoid papulosis should be counseled and screened regularly for HPV-related lesions.A similar approach can be used for HPV in the rectum.Management of cancers caused by HPV is discussed elsewhere in THE MANUALHuman Papillomavirus Vaccination for Adults: Updated Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.) A 9-valent vaccine and a quadrivalent vaccine protect against the 2 types of HPV (types 6 and 11) that cause > 90% of visible genital warts.These vaccines also protect against the 2 types of HPV (types 16 and 18) that cause most cervical cancers.The 9-valent vaccine also protects against other types of HPV (types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) that cause about 15% of cervical cancers.A bivalent vaccine protects against only types 16 and 18.Only the 9-valent vaccine is available in the US.The current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control are as follows: For both females and males up to age 26 years: HPV vaccine is recommended at age 11 or 12 years (can start at age 9 years) and for previously unvaccinated or not adequately vaccinated patients up through age 26 years.For adults 27 to 45 years: Clinicians should engage in a shared decision-making discussion with patients to determine whether they should be vaccinated.Because HPV can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, condoms do not fully protect against infection.Key Points Anogenital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly types 6 and 11.HPV types 16 and 18 cause about 70% of cervical cancers and can cause cancer in other areas, including the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx.Diagnose warts by inspection; HPV testing is available to screen for cervical cancer.Treat warts with cytodestructive treatments, topical medications, or surgical excision.Treat cervical, vaginal, vulvar, or anal intraepithelial neoplasia with ablation or excision or manage with close surveillance.HPV vaccination is recommended for children and young adults.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9280, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.These layers form the myelin sheath.Much like the insulation around an electrical wire, the myelin sheath enables nerve signals (electrical impulses) to be conducted along the nerve fiber with speed and accuracy.When the myelin sheath is damaged (called demyelination), nerves do not conduct electrical impulses normally.Sometimes primary demyelinating disorders develop after a viral infection or vaccination against a viral infection.A likely explanation is that the virus or another substance somehow triggers the immune system to attack the body’s own tissues (autoimmune reaction Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues.What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known.The autoimmune reaction results in inflammation, which damages the myelin sheath and the nerve fiber under it.Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed.Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) This rare type of inflammation leads to demyelination Overview of Demyelinating Disorders Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.These layers form the myelin sheath.Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is more common among children than among adults.Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis usually develops after a viral infection.Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is thought to be a misguided immune reaction triggered by the virus.In the United States, this disorder usually results from some types of influenza (Flu) Influenza (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses.Enterovirus infections are caused by many different viruses.The virus is spread through kissing.Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that causes various cold-like symptoms and a characteristic rash.Measles is caused by a virus.Typically, the inflammation develops 1 to 3 weeks after the viral illness begins.Symptoms of ADEM Symptoms of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis appear rapidly.At first, people may have a fever, a headache, nausea, and vomiting and feel tired.When the disorder is severe, it can cause seizures and coma.Vision in one or both eyes may be lost.Muscles may become weak, and coordination may be impaired, making walking difficult.People may become paralyzed.Sensation may be lost in parts of the body, making them feel numb.Mental function (including thinking, judgment, and learning) may be affected.Most people recover within days, and within 6 months, most have totally or almost totally recovered.Other people may remain impaired the rest of their life.Muscles may remain weak, and areas of the body may remain numb.People may not recover their vision or mental function.Diagnosis of ADEM A doctor's evaluation Doctors may be able to diagnose acute disseminated encephalomyelitis based on symptoms and results of a physical examination.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done.A spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.Blood tests may be done to check for other disorders that cause similar symptoms.Treatment of ADEM Corticosteroids Immune globulin or plasma exchange Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can be treated with corticosteroids given intravenously.Immune globulin and plasma exchange Plateletpheresis (platelet donation) In addition to normal blood donation and transfusion, special procedures are sometimes used.In plateletpheresis, a donor gives only platelets rather than whole blood.These treatments may be used with or without corticosteroids.Immune globulin consists of antibodies obtained from the blood of people with a normal immune system.For plasma exchange, blood is withdrawn, abnormal antibodies are removed from it, and the blood is returned to the person.Nerve Cells and Fibers VIDEO Adrenoleukodystrophy and Adrenomyeloneuropathy Adrenoleukodystrophy X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy Peroxisomal disorders are a group of hereditary metabolic disorders that occur when peroxisomes are missing or do not function correctly in the body.In these disorders, fats are not broken down as they normally are.These fats accumulate mainly in the brain, spinal cord, and adrenal glands.In the brain, they cause demyelination of nerves.Adrenoleukodystrophy affects young boys, usually between the ages of 4 and 8.A milder, more slowly developing form of the disorder can begin during adolescence or young adulthood.Adrenomyeloneuropathy is a milder form.It begins when men are in the 20s or 30s, In these disorders, widespread demyelination Overview of Demyelinating Disorders Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.These layers form the myelin sheath.They are endocrine glands, which secrete hormones into the bloodstream.Each adrenal gland has two parts.Boys have behavioral problems and problems with hearing and vision.Eventually, mental deterioration, involuntary and uncoordinated muscle contractions (spasticity), and blindness occur.Some boys with adrenoleukodystrophy are totally disabled or die 2 to 3 years after diagnosis.Often, adults with adrenomyeloneuropathy first notice a problem when their legs become weak and stiff, they lose control of their bladder or bowels (incontinence), and/or erectile dysfunction develops.The diagnosis of adrenoleukodystrophy or adrenomyeloneuropathy is confirmed by genetic testing.No cure for either disorder is known.Dietary supplements with glycerol trioleate and glycerol trierucate (known as Lorenzo’s oil) may help, but further study is needed.When the adrenal gland (but not the brain) is affected, treatment with adrenal hormones may be lifesaving.Many experts now recommend stem cell transplantation Stem Cell Transplantation Stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder.Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy Leber hereditary optic neuropathy causes demyelination Overview of Demyelinating Disorders Most nerve fibers inside and outside the brain are wrapped with many layers of tissue composed of a fat (lipoprotein) called myelin.These layers form the myelin sheath.Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is more common among men.Usually, symptoms begin between the ages of 15 and 35.This disorder is inherited through the mother, and the defective genes seem to be located in mitochondria (structures in cells that provide energy for the cell).Vision may become blurred in one eye or in both eyes at the same time.But if vision in one eye is affected, vision in the other eye begins to be lost within weeks or months.The sharpness of vision (acuity) and color vision deteriorate over time.Some people also have heart problems or muscle symptoms (such as involuntary muscle contractions, muscle weakness, or muscle spasms), which may resemble symptoms of multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed.Doctors can often diagnose Leber hereditary optic neuropathy based on symptoms and results of a physical examination.Testing can identify some of the abnormal genes responsible for the disorders.Electrocardiography Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.It uses no x-rays.There is no established treatment for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.However, some evidence suggests that the drugs idebenone and ubiquinone may improve sight in people with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, but they cannot reverse damage already done to the optic nerve.Gene therapy is being studied.It involves injecting the normal gene into the eye.Limiting consumption of alcohol and not using tobacco products may help.Alcohol and

{"text": "【0】 Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which infect the lining of the urethra, cervix, rectum, or throat, or the membranes that cover the front part of the eye (conjunctiva and cornea).Gonorrhea is usually spread through sexual contact.People usually have a discharge from the penis or vagina and may need to urinate more frequently and urgently.Microscopic examination, culture, or DNA tests of a sample of vaginal or penile discharge or DNA tests of urine can detect the infection.Antibiotics can cure the infection, but resistance to the antibiotics used to treat gonorrhea is becoming more common.Using condoms during genital sex can help prevent passing gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from one person to another.Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 1 million new infections occur in the United States each year.Gonorrhea is almost always spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact.After one episode of vaginal intercourse without a condom, the chance of spread from an infected woman to a man is about 20%.The chance of spread from an infected man to a woman and from a man to a man may be higher.If a pregnant woman is infected, the bacteria can spread to the eyes of the newborn during birth, causing conjunctivitis in the newborn Conjunctivitis in Newborns Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane that lines the eyelid and covers the white of the eye.However, in most high-resource countries, infection is prevented because all newborns are routinely treated after delivery with medicated eye ointment.People with gonorrhea are at increased risk of other STIs, such as chlamydia and Other Nongonococcal Infections Chlamydial infections include sexually transmitted infections of the urethra, cervix, and rectum that are caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis.It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health. If a pregnant woman has gonorrhea, the eyes of the newborn may become infected during birth, so newborns are routinely treated to prevent this infection.Symptoms of Gonorrhea Usually, gonorrhea causes symptoms only at the sites of initial infection, most commonly the cervix, penis, urethra, or throat.In a few people, infection spreads through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially to the skin, joints, or both.Some men (about 25%) have minimal symptoms.Symptoms begin within about 2 to 14 days after infection.Men feel mild discomfort in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body).This discomfort is followed a few hours later by mild to severe pain during urination, a yellow-green discharge of pus from the penis, and a frequent urge to urinate.The opening at the tip of the penis may become red and swollen.Some women (about 10 to 20%) have minimal or no symptoms.Thus, gonorrhea may be detected only during routine screening or after diagnosis of the infection in their partner.Symptoms typically do not begin until at least 10 days after infection.Some women feel only mild discomfort in the genital area and have a yellow or green vaginal discharge.However, other women have more severe symptoms, such as a frequent urge to urinate or pain during urination.These symptoms develop when the urethra is also infected.The infection may spread up the reproductive tract and infect the uterus, the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes), and sometimes the area around the ovaries.In some women, the infection spreads to the lining of the pelvis and abdominal cavity (peritoneum), causing peritonitis.These infections are called pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the upper female reproductive organs (the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries).Sometimes infection concentrates in the area around the liver, in the upper right part of the abdomen, causing pain, fever, and vomiting—called the Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome.Anal sex with an infected partner may result in gonorrhea of the rectum (gonococcal proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum (rectal mucosa).The inflammation has many causes ranging from infection to radiation therapy.This infection usually causes no symptoms, but it may make bowel movements painful.Other symptoms include constipation, itching, bleeding, and a discharge from the rectum.The area around the anus may become red and raw, and stool may be coated with mucus and pus.When a doctor examines the rectum with a viewing tube (anoscope), mucus and pus may be visible on the wall of the rectum.Oral sex with an infected partner may result in gonorrhea of the throat (gonococcal pharyngitis).Usually, these infections cause no symptoms, but the throat may be sore.If infected fluids come into contact with the eyes, gonococcal conjunctivitis may develop, causing swelling of the eyelids and a discharge of pus from the eyes.In adults, often only one eye is infected.Newborns usually have infection in both eyes.Blindness may result if the infection is not treated early.Rarely, disseminated gonococcal infection (arthritis-dermatitis syndrome) develops.It occurs when the infection spreads through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially the skin and joints; rarely, infection spreads to the heart.Joints become swollen, tender, and extremely painful, limiting movement.The skin over infected joints may be red and warm.People typically have a fever, feel generally ill, and develop joint pain (due to arthritis) in one or more joints.Small, red spots may appear on the skin, usually on the arms and legs.The spots are slightly painful and may be filled with pus.Joint, bloodstream, and heart infections can be treated, but recovery from arthritis may be slow.Gonococcal septic arthritis is a form of disseminated gonococcal infection that causes painful arthritis.Usually, it affects one or two large joints, such as the knees, ankles, wrists, or elbows, Symptoms often begin suddenly.People usually have a fever.Infected joints are painful and swollen, and movement is limited.The skin over the infected joints may be warm and red.In children, gonorrhea is usually a sign of sexual abuse.In girls, the genital area (vulva) may be irritated, red, and swollen, and they may have a discharge from the vagina.If the urethra is infected, children, mainly boys, may have pain during urination.Diagnosis of Gonorrhea Usually, testing of a sample of discharge from the cervix, vagina, penis, throat, or rectum or of a sample of urine To diagnose gonorrhea, doctors collect a sample of discharge and send it to a laboratory.Highly sensitive tests can be done to detect the DNA of gonococci and of chlamydiae (which are often also present).Laboratories can test for both infections in a single sample.For some of these tests (called nucleic acid amplification tests, or NAATS), techniques that increase the amount of the bacteria's genetic material are used.Because these techniques make the organisms easier to detect, urine samples can be used.Thus, these tests are convenient for screening people who have no symptoms or who do not want to have samples of fluid taken from their genitals.Sometimes, the sample is also sent for culture (to grow the organisms).For men, gonorrhea may be diagnosed rapidly (within 1 hour) by examining samples of the discharge and identifying the bacteria (gonococci), if the facility has the appropriate equipment and trained personnel.If a discharge is obvious, doctors touch a swab or slide to the end of the penis to collect the sample.If there is no obvious discharge, doctors insert a small swab a half inch or more into the urethra to collect a sample.Men are asked to refrain from urinating for at least 2 hours before the sample is collected.Diagnosing gonorrhea in women is more difficult than in men, because identifying bacteria in a sample of discharge from the cervix is more difficult than from a penis.The bacteria in a sample taken from the cervix can be seen under the microscope in only about half of infected women.Because people may have more than one STI, doctors may test samples of blood and genital fluids for other STIs, such as syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health.If a joint is red and swollen, doctors draw fluid from the joint using a needle.The fluid is sent for culture and other tests.Screening for gonorrhea Certain people who have no symptoms are screened for gonorrhea because they are at increased risk of this infection.If screening is recommended, it is done even if a person uses condoms consistently.Tests are done using samples taken from the rectum, the urethra, or, if the person engaged in oral sex, the throat.For example, women are screened annually if they are sexually active and under age 25 or if they are 25 years or older, sexually active, and have one or more of the following risk factors: A previous STI Risky sexual activities (such as having many sex partners or multiple sex partners, using condoms inconsistently when not in a mutually monogamous relationship, or engaging in sex work) A history of incarceration Have a sex partner who participates in risky sexual activities or has an STI Pregnant women are screened during their first prenatal visit and again during their 3rd trimester if they are at high risk.Men who have sex with women are not routinely screened, but screening is available if a person requests it and is often offered to all people at adolescent clinics, STI clinics, and correctional facilities.Men who have sex with men are screened as follows: If they are sexually active: At least once a year If they are at increased risk (those with HIV infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.For example, all people with a cervix who are under age 25 are screened annually.If they are 25 years or older, people with a cervix should be screened annually if at increased risk.Rectal swab screening is done on transgender and gender diverse people based on reported sexual behaviors and exposure.Treatment of Gonorrhea An antibiotic Testing and treatment of sex partners Doctors usually give people with gonorrhea a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone into a muscle.If gonorrhea has spread through the bloodstream, people are usually treated in the hospital and given antibiotics intravenously or by injection into a muscle.If symptoms recur or persist after treatment, doctors may take samples for culture to determine whether people are cured and may do tests to determine whether the gonococci are resistant to the antibiotics used.People with gonorrhea should abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed to avoid infecting sex partners.Sex partners All sex partners who have had sexual contact with infected people in the past 60 days should be tested for gonorrhea and other STIs and, if the tests are positive, should be treated.If sex partners were exposed to gonorrhea within the past 2 weeks, they are treated for it without waiting for test results.Expedited partner therapy is an option doctors sometimes use to make it easier for sex partners to be treated.This approach involves giving people with gonorrhea a prescription or medications to give to their partner.Thus, the sex partner is treated, even if they have not yet seen a doctor.Seeing a doctor is better because then the doctor can check for allergies to medications and the presence of other STIs.However, if the partner is unlikely to see a doctor, expedited partner therapy is useful.Prevention of Gonorrhea The following general measures can help prevent gonorrhea (and other STIs): Safer sex practices, including using a condom Condoms Barrier contraceptives physically block the sperm’s access to a woman’s uterus.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6623, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version":

{"text": "【0】 Ventricular tachycardia is ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular beats at a rate ≥ 120 beats/minute.Symptoms depend on duration and vary from none to palpitations to hemodynamic collapse and death.Diagnosis is by electrocardiography.Treatment of more than brief episodes is with cardioversion or antiarrhythmics, depending on symptoms.If necessary, long-term treatment is with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator Some experts use a cutoff rate of ≥ 100 beats/minute for ventricular tachycardia (VT).Repetitive ventricular rhythms at slower rates are called accelerated idioventricular rhythms or slow VT; they are usually benign and are not treated unless patients have hemodynamic symptoms.Most patients with VT have a significant heart disorder, particularly prior myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryOverview of Cardiomyopathies A cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscle.Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia is serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) caused by a deficit in total body potassium stores or abnormal movement of potassium into cells.8 mg/dL (< 0.70 mmol/L)VT, torsades de pointes Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia is a specific form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with a long QT interval.Ventricular tachycardia may be monomorphic or polymorphic and nonsustained or sustained.Monomorphic VT: Single abnormal focus or reentrant pathway and thus regular, identical-appearing QRS complexes Polymorphic VT: Several different foci or pathways and thus irregular, varying QRS complexes Nonsustained VT: Lasts < 30 seconds Sustained VT: Lasts ≥ 30 seconds or is terminated sooner because of hemodynamic collapse Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a genetic disorder affecting intracellular calcium regulation in cardiac tissue.Patients are predisposed to atrial and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, particularly during increased adrenergic activity.VT frequently deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) Ventricular fibrillation causes uncoordinated quivering of the ventricle with no useful contractions.It causes immediate syncope and death within minutesCardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow.Symptoms and Signs of Ventricular Tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia of short duration or slow rate may be asymptomatic.Sustained VT is almost always symptomatic, causing palpitations, symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, or sudden cardiac death.Diagnosis of Ventricular Tachycardia Electrocardiography (ECG) Diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is by ECG .Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) should be considered VT until proved otherwise.Pearls & Pitfalls Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) should be considered VT until proved otherwise.Diagnosis is supported by ECG findings of dissociated P-wave activity, fusion or capture beats, uniformity of QRS vectors in the V leads (concordance) with discordant T-wave vector (opposite QRS vectors), and a frontal-plane QRS axis in the northwest quadrant.Differential diagnosis includes supraventricular tachycardia Reentrant Supraventricular Tachycardias (SVT) Including Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome Reentrant supraventricular tachycardias (SVT) involve reentrant pathways with a component above the bifurcation of the His bundle.However, because some patients tolerate VT surprisingly well, concluding that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin is a mistake.Using medications appropriate for supraventricular tachycardia (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) in patients with VT may cause hemodynamic collapse and death.Pearls & Pitfalls Because some patients tolerate ventricular tachycardia surprisingly well, it is a mistake to conclude that a well-tolerated wide QRS complex tachycardia must be of supraventricular origin.Broad QRS ventricular tachycardia The QRS duration is 160 millisecond.An independent P wave can be seen in II (arrows).There is a leftward mean frontal axis shift.Treatment of Ventricular Tachycardia Acute: Sometimes synchronized direct current cardioversion, sometimes class I or class III antiarrhythmics Long-term: Usually an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Acute Treatment of acute ventricular tachycardia depends on symptoms and duration of VT.Stable sustained VT can be treated with synchronized direct current cardioversion Direct Current (DC) Cardioversion-Defibrillation The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Stable sustained VT can also be treated with intravenous class I or class III antiarrhythmic drugs .Lidocaine acts quickly but is frequently ineffective.If lidocaine is ineffective, IV procainamide may be given, but it may take up to 1 hour to work.IV amiodarone is frequently used but does not usually work quickly.Failure of IV procainamide or IV amiodarone is an indication for cardioversion.Nonsustained VT does not require immediate treatment unless the runs are frequent or long enough to cause symptoms.In such cases, antiarrhythmics are used as for sustained VT.Long-term The primary goal is preventing sudden death, rather than simply suppressing the arrhythmia.It is best accomplished by use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD) The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causesICD).However, the decision about whom to treat is complex and depends on the estimated probability of life-threatening VTs and the severity of underlying heart disorders .Long-term treatment is not required when the index episode of ventricular tachycardia resulted from a transient cause (eg, during the 48 hours after onset of myocardial infarction) or a reversible cause (acid-base disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, proarrhythmic drug effect).In the absence of a transient or reversible cause, patients who have had an episode of sustained VT typically require an ICD.Most patients with sustained VT and a significant structural heart disorder should also receive a beta-blocker.If an ICD cannot be used, amiodarone may be the preferred antiarrhythmic for prevention of sudden death.Because nonsustained VT is a marker for increased risk of sudden death in patients with a structural heart disorder, such patients (particularly those with an ejection fraction < 0.35) require further evaluation.Such patients should receive an ICD.When prevention of VTs is important (usually in patients who have an ICD and are having frequent episodes of VT), antiarrhythmics or transcatheter or surgical ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Any class Ia, Ib, Ic, II, or III antiarrhythmic drug Medications for Arrhythmias The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Because beta-blockers are safe, they are the first choice unless contraindicated.If an additional drug is required, sotalol is commonly used, then amiodarone.Transcatheter ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causesVT with well-defined syndromes (eg, right ventricular outflow tract VT or left septal VT [Belhassen VT, verapamil-sensitive VT]) and otherwise healthy hearts.Overview of Ventricular Tachycardia VIDEO Key Points Any wide-complex (QRS ≥ 0.12 second) tachycardia should be considered ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proved otherwise.Patients who do not have a pulse should be cardioverted.Synchronized cardioversion or antiarrhythmic drugs may be tried if the patient is stable.Patients who had an episode of sustained VT without a transient or reversible cause typically require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).",

{"text": "【0】 A Lisfranc injury is a fracture and/or dislocation of the midfoot that disrupts one or more tarsometatarsal joints.Diagnosis is by x-rays and often CT.Treatment requires referral to an orthopedic surgeon and usually open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or sometimes fusion of the midfoot. Most fractures result from a single, significant force applied to normal bone Lisfranc injuries are common.The usual mechanism is a direct blow or an indirect twisting force applied to a foot in plantar flexion (eg, fall on a foot in plantar flexion), as may occur in football players, motorcyclists, and horseback riders.The Lisfranc joint complex consists of the 5 tarsometatarsal joints that connect the forefoot and midfoot.There are multiple ligaments in this complex.The Lisfranc ligament itself is the ligament that attaches the base of the 2nd metatarsal to the 1st cuneiform.Lisfranc complex injuries vary widely in severity from strains to dislocation of one or more tarsometatarsal joints with or without fracture.When fracture occurs, it often involves the 2nd metatarsal .Lisfranc injuries often cause instability of the midfoot.Fracture of the 2nd metatarsal base with tarsometatarsal joint dislocation Fracture of the 2nd metatarsal base may disrupt one or more of the tarsometatarsal joints.In this figure, the 2nd metatarsal fracture displaces the 3rd through 5th metatarsals laterally.Symptoms and Signs of Lisfranc Injury Severity of Lisfranc injury varies widely.Some injuries cause only mild swelling and pain in the midfoot; others cause severe soft-tissue pain and swelling, deformity, a hematoma on the sole of the midfoot, and sometimes paresthesias.The foot may appear shortened.Complications (eg, osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation)Compartment Syndrome Compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia.The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury.Diagnosis of Lisfranc Injury X-rays Sometimes CT Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique x-rays of the foot are taken, but findings may be subtle, leading to misdiagnosis.Up to 20% of these fractures are missed at the initial presentation.X-rays can show a fracture at the base of the 2nd metatarsal or chip fractures of the cuneiform but may not show disruption of the tarsometatarsal joint, which should be suspected even if it is not visible on plain x-rays.Normally in this joint, the medial aspect of the 2nd cuneiform aligns directly with the medial aspect of the 2nd metatarsal.Comparison views or CT may be necessary to identify disruption of the joint.Pearls & Pitfalls If the midfoot is extremely swollen and tender, closely examine the x-ray to determine whether the medial aspect of the 2nd cuneiform directly aligns with the medial aspect of the 2nd metatarsal.If CT is not readily available, stress x-rays can be used.X-rays are taken while the foot is under stress (eg, the patient is standing on the foot).The patient's body weight can cause the space between the 1st and 2nd metatarsals to widen, making the diagnosis much easier.However, CT is more sensitive than stress x-rays and so is preferred in equivocal cases.Treatment of Lisfranc Injury Urgent orthopedic consultation Usually, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or sometimes fusion of the midfoot Dislocations often spontaneously reduce.Nonetheless, because these injuries usually compromise foot function and cause residual pain and arthritis, patients should be immediately referred to an orthopedic specialist, usually for surgery.Typically, definitive treatment is ORIF or fusion of the midfoot.After ORIF, CT is usually done to confirm correct alignment.If surgery is not considered necessary, patients are immobilized, ultimately with a cast, with no weight-bearing for ≥ 6 weeks.Key Points Lisfranc injuries (fracture-dislocation) involve disruption of ≥ 1 ligaments that stabilize the midfoot, sometimes disrupting ≥ 1 tarsometatarsal joints.Complications (eg, compartment syndrome, chronic pain, disability) may be serious.Because x-ray findings may be subtle, stress x-rays or CT may be needed.Refer patients to an orthopedic surgeon; usually, ORIF or fusion of the midfoot is required.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7948, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

Intracranial epidural abscesses and subdural empyemas may result from a sinus or an ear infection or from conditions that allow bacteria to enter the skull, such as a head injury or head surgery Fever, headache, sleepiness, vomiting, seizures, a stiff neck, and other signs of brain dysfunction may develop over several days.Without treatment, symptoms progress rapidly, leading to coma and death.To diagnose these disorders, doctors do magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography with a contrast agent.Treatment includes surgical drainage, antibiotics, and sometimes drugs to prevent seizures or to reduce pressure within the skull.Intracranial epidural abscesses and subdural empyemas develop outside the brain itself but within the skull (intracranial): Intracranial epidural abscess: Between the dura mater (the outer layer of tissue covering the brain) and the skull Subdural empyema: Between the arachnoid mater (the middle layer of tissue covering the brain) and the dura mater Tissues Covering the Brain Within the skull, the brain is covered by three layers of tissue called the meninges.Causes Epidural abscesses and subdural empyemas may result from A sinus infection Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses, most commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection or by an allergy.Because meningitis is now uncommon in children, epidural abscesses and subdural empyemas are also uncommon in children.Symptoms Like a brain abscess, an epidural abscess or a subdural empyema can cause fever, headache, sleepiness, vomiting, seizures, a stiff neck, and other signs of brain dysfunction.The symptoms can evolve over several days.Meningitis or a brain abscess may develop.Or a blood clot may form in the large veins (venous sinuses) that carry blood from the brain.Without treatment, symptoms progress rapidly, leading to coma and death, particularly in people with a subdural empyema.Diagnosis Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography To diagnose an epidural abscess or a subdural empyema, doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done after gadolinium is injected intravenously.Gadolinium (an MRI contrast agent) makes abscesses and empyemas easier to see on MRI scans.If MRI is not available, computed tomography (CT) is done after a radiopaque contrast agent (which makes abscesses and empyemas easier to see on CT scans) is injected.Samples of blood and tissue are sent to a laboratory so that any bacteria present can be grown (cultured) identified.A spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.If a large abscess, empyema, or other mass is present in the skull, removing spinal fluid during a spinal tap can cause the brain to shift down and be forced through a small natural opening in the tissue that divides the brain into compartments (called brain herniation: The Brain Under Pressure ).The resulting damage can be fatal.Treatment Drainage of the pus Antibiotics and sometimes other drugs In infants, a needle can sometimes be inserted directly into the abscess or empyema through a fontanelle (a soft spot between the skull bones) to drain the pus, relieve pressure, and help doctors make the diagnosis.Epidural abscesses and subdural empyemas must be drained surgically.If the infection occurred because of an abnormality in the sinuses or middle ear, the surgeon may need to repair the abnormality at the same time.Antibiotics (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and vancomycin) are given intravenously.Antiseizure drugs to control seizures and measures to reduce pressure within the skull may be needed.These measures include the following: Use of diuretics, which reduce the amount of fluid in the body Corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation and swelling", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4105, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

some patients froth at the mouth.Frank hemoptysis is uncommon.The pulse is rapid and low volume, and blood pressure (BP) is variable.Marked hypertension indicates significant cardiac reserve; hypotension with systolic BP < 100 mg Hg is ominous.Inspiratory fine crackles are widely dispersed anteriorly and posteriorly over both lung fields.Marked wheezing (cardiac asthma) may occur.Noisy respiratory efforts often make cardiac auscultation difficult; a summation gallop—merger of 3rd (S3) and 4th (S4) heart sounds—may be present.Signs of right ventricular (RV) failure (eg, neck vein distention, peripheral edema) may be present.Diagnosis of Pulmonary Edema Clinical evaluation showing severe dyspnea and pulmonary crackles Chest x-ray Sometimes serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-pro BNP (NT-pro-BNP) ECG, cardiac markers, and other tests for etiology as needed A COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) exacerbation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smokeLV failure or even that due to biventricular failure if cor pulmonale Cor Pulmonale Cor pulmonale is right ventricular (RV) enlargement secondary to a lung disorder that causes pulmonary artery hypertension.Right ventricular failure follows.Pulmonary edema may be the presenting symptom in patients without a history of cardiac disorders, but COPD patients with such severe symptoms usually have a history of COPD, although they may be too dyspneic to relate it.A chest x-ray, done immediately, is usually diagnostic, showing marked interstitial edema.Bedside measurement of serum BNP/NT-proBNP levels (elevated in pulmonary edema; normal in COPD exacerbation) is helpful if the diagnosis is in doubt.ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood tests (cardiac markers, electrolytes, BUN [blood urea nitrogen], creatinine and, for severely ill patients, arterial blood gas [ABG] measurements) are done.Echocardiography may be helpful to determine the cause of the pulmonary edema (eg, myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryOverview of Cardiac Valvular Disorders Any heart valve can become stenotic or insufficient (also termed regurgitant or incompetent), causing hemodynamic changes long before symptomsHg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothDilated Cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy is myocardial dysfunction causing heart failure in which ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction predominate.Hypoxemia can be severe.Carbon dioxide retention is a late, ominous sign of secondary hypoventilation.Treatment of Pulmonary Edema Treatment of cause Oxygen IV diuretic Nitrates IV inotropes Ventilatory assistance Initial treatment of pulmonary edema includes identifying the cause; 100% oxygen by nonrebreather mask; upright position; furosemide 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV or by continuous infusion 5 to 10 mg/hour; nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes, followed by an IV drip at 10 to 20 mcg/minute, titrated upward at 10 mcg/minute every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum 300 mcg/minute if systolic blood pressure is > 100 mm Hg.Morphine, 1 to 5 mg IV once or twice, has long been used to reduce severe anxiety and the work of breathing but is decreasingly used (except in palliative care) due to observational studies suggesting a poorer outcome with its use.Noninvasive ventilatory assistance with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is helpful if hypoxia is significant.Specific additional treatment depends on etiology: For acute myocardial infarction or another acute coronary syndrome, thrombolysis or direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement For severe hypertension, an IV vasodilator For supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, direct-current cardioversion For rapid atrial fibrillation, cardioversion is preferred.To slow the ventricular rate, an IV beta-blocker, IV digoxin, or cautious use of an IV calcium channel blocker In patients with acute MI (myocardial infarction), fluid status before onset of pulmonary edema is usually normal, so diuretics are less useful than in patients with acute decompensation of chronic heart failure and may precipitate hypotension.If systolic blood pressure falls < 100 mm Hg or shock develops, IV dobutamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump (counterpulsation) may be required.Some newer drugs, such as IV brain natriuretic peptide (nesiritide), and calcium-sensitizing inotropic drugs (levosimendan, pimobendan), vesnarinone, and ibopamine, may have initial beneficial effects but do not appear to improve outcomes compared to standard therapy, and mortality may be increased.Serelaxin, a recombinant form of the human pregnancy hormone relaxin-2, has been tried but benefits were not shown in a large international randomized study (1 Treatment references Pulmonary edema is acute, severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous hypertension and alveolar flooding.Omecamtiv mecarbil, an oral cardiac myosin activator, has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients currently or recently hospitalized with decompensated heart failure (2 Treatment references Pulmonary edema is acute, severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous hypertension and alveolar flooding.Once patients are stabilized, long-term HF treatment Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Key Points Acute pulmonary edema can result from acute coronary ischemia, decompensation of underlying heart failure, arrhythmia, an acute valvular disorder, or acute volume overload.Patients have severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, wheezing, and sometimes blood-tinged frothy sputum.Clinical examination and chest x-ray are usually sufficient for diagnosis;

some experts consider it present only when a patient thinks it is a problem.The disorder is greatly underrecognized and underreported.Enuresis after age 3 to 4 years may be a symptom of urethral stenosis in girls, posterior urethral valves in boys, psychologic distress, or, if onset is new, infection.Pneumaturia (air passed with urine) suggests a vesicovaginal, vesicoenteric, or ureteroenteric fistula; the last 2 may be caused by diverticulitis, Crohn disease, abscess, or colon cancer.Pneumaturia could also be due to emphysematous pyelonephritis.Physical Examination of the Urologic Patient Physical examination focuses on the costovertebral angle, abdomen, rectum, groin, and genitals.In women with urinary symptoms, pelvic examination is usually done.Costovertebral angle Pain elicited by blunt striking of the back, flanks, and angle formed by the 12th rib and lumbar spine with a fist (costovertebral tenderness) may indicate pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneysUrinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infectionObstructive Uropathy Obstructive uropathy is structural or functional hindrance of normal urine flow, sometimes leading to renal dysfunction (obstructive nephropathy).Abdomen Visual fullness of the upper abdomen is an extremely rare and nonspecific finding of a kidney or abdominal mass.Dullness to percussion in the lower abdomen suggests bladder distention; normally, even a full bladder cannot be percussed above the symphysis pubis.Bladder palpation can be used to confirm distention and urinary retention.Rectum During digital rectal examination, prostatitis refers to a disparate group of prostate disorders that manifests with a combination of predominantly irritative or obstructive urinary symptoms and perineal pain.Focal nodules and less discrete hard areas must be distinguished from prostate cancer Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma.Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain.The prostate may be symmetrically enlarged, rubbery, and nontender with benign prostatic hyperplasia Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is nonmalignant adenomatous overgrowth of the periurethral prostate gland.Groin and genitals Inguinal and genital examination should be done with patients standing.Inguinal hernia or adenopathy may explain scrotal or groin pain.Gross asymmetry, swelling, erythema, or discoloration of the testes may indicate infection, torsion, tumor, or other mass.Horizontal testicular lie (bell-clapper deformity) indicates increased risk of testicular torsion.Elevation of one testis (normally the left is lower) may be a sign of testicular torsion Testicular Torsion Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply.The penis is examined with and without retracting the foreskin.Inspection of the penis can detect Hypospadias Congenital anomalies of the urethra in boys usually involve anatomic abnormalities of the penis and vice versaCongenital anomalies of the urethra in boys usually involve anatomic abnormalities of the penis and vice versaPeyronie disease Peyronie Disease Peyronie disease is fibrosis of the cavernous sheaths leading to contracture of the investing fascia of the corpora, resulting in a deviated and sometimes painful erectionPriapism is painful, persistent, abnormal erection unaccompanied by sexual desire or excitation.It is most common in boys aged 5 to 10 years and in men aged 20 to 50 yearsPalpation may reveal an inguinal hernia Groin hernias A hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or congenital area of weakness or defect in the wall.Cremasteric reflex may be absent with testicular torsion.Location of masses in relation to the testis and the degree and location of tenderness may help differentiate among testicular masses (eg, spermatoceles, epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, occasionally accompanied by inflammation of the testis (epididymo-orchitis).Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally.If swelling is present, the area can be transilluminated to help determine whether the swelling is cystic or solid.Fibrous plaques felt in the penile shaft are signs of Peyronie disease Peyronie Disease Peyronie disease is fibrosis of the cavernous sheaths leading to contracture of the investing fascia of the corpora, resulting in a deviated and sometimes painful erection.Testing of the Urologic Patient Urinalysis In patients with renal disorders, symptoms and signs may be nonspecific, absent until the disorder is severe, or both.Imaging tests (eg, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) are frequently required.For semen testing, see Sperm Disorders Sperm Disorders Sperm disorders include defects in quality or quantity of sperm produced and defects in sperm emission.Diagnosis is by semen analysis and genetic testing.Bladder tumor antigen testing for transitional cell cancer of the urinary tract is more sensitive than urinary cytology in detecting low-grade cancer; it is not sensitive enough to replace endoscopic examination.Urine cytology is the best test to detect high-grade cancer.Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein with unknown function produced by prostatic epithelial cells.Levels can be elevated in prostate cancer and in some common noncancerous disorders (eg, benign prostatic hyperplasia Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is nonmalignant adenomatous overgrowth of the periurethral prostate gland.PSA is measured to detect recurrence of cancer after treatment; its widespread use for cancer screening Prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma.Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7445, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.The plaques contain lipids, inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, and connective tissue.Risk factors include dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and hypertension.Symptoms develop when growth or rupture of the plaque reduces or obstructs blood flow; symptoms vary by artery affected.Diagnosis is clinical and confirmed by angiography, ultrasonography, or other imaging tests.Treatment includes risk factor, lifestyle, and dietary modification; physical activity; antiplatelet drugs; and antiatherogenic drugs.  Atherosclerosis is the most common form of arteriosclerosis, which is a general term for several disorders that cause thickening and loss of elasticity in the arterial wall.Atherosclerosis is also the most serious and clinically relevant form of arteriosclerosis because it causes coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromasOverview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Nonatheromatous forms of arteriosclerosis include arteriolosclerosis Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis is age-related fibrosis in the aorta and its major branches.Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis Mönckeberg arteriosclerosis Nonatheromatous arteriosclerosis is age-related fibrosis in the aorta and its major branches.Atherosclerosis can affect all large and medium-sized arteries, including the coronary, carotid, and cerebral arteries; the aorta; its branches; and major arteries of the extremities.It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and in most developed countries.Age-related mortality attributable to atherosclerosis has been decreasing, but in 2019, cardiovascular disease, primarily coronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis still caused about 18 million deaths worldwide (> 30% of all deaths [ 1 General references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.In the US, about 558,000 people died of cardiovascular disease in 2019 (2 General references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Atherosclerosis is rapidly increasing in prevalence in low and middle income countries, and as people live longer, incidence will increase.Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death worldwide.Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis The fatty streak is the earliest visible lesion of atherosclerosis; it is an accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells in the intimal layer of the artery.The atherosclerotic plaque is the hallmark of atherosclerosis; it is an evolution of the fatty streak and has 3 major components: Lipids Inflammatory and smooth muscle cells A connective tissue matrix that may contain thrombi in various stages of organization and calcium deposits Atherosclerotic plaque formation All stages of atherosclerosis—from initiation and growth to complication of the plaque (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) —are considered an inflammatory response to injury mediated by specific cytokines.Endothelial injury is thought to have a primary initiating or inciting role.Nonlaminar or turbulent blood flow (eg, at branch points in the arterial tree) leads to endothelial dysfunction and inhibits endothelial production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator and anti-inflammatory molecule.Such blood flow also stimulates endothelial cells to produce adhesion molecules, which recruit and bind inflammatory cellsMellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemiaHg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothII, and systemic infection and inflammation also inhibit nitric oxide production and stimulate production of adhesion molecules, proinflammatory cytokines, chemotactic proteins, and vasoconstrictors; exact mechanisms are unknown.The net effect is endothelial binding of monocytes and T cells, migration of these cells to the subendothelial space, and initiation and perpetuation of a local vascular inflammatory response.Monocytes in the subendothelium transform into macrophages.Lipids in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, also bind to endothelial cells and are oxidized in the subendothelium.Uptake of oxidized lipids and macrophage transformation into lipid-laden foam cells result in the typical early atherosclerotic lesions called fatty streaks.Degraded erythrocyte membranes that result from rupture of vasa vasorum and intraplaque hemorrhage may be an important additional source of lipids within plaques.Macrophages elaborate proinflammatory cytokines that recruit smooth muscle cell migration from the media and that further attract and stimulate growth of macrophages.Various factors promote smooth muscle cell replication and increase production of dense extracellular matrix.The result is a subendothelial fibrous plaque with a fibrous cap, made of intimal smooth muscle cells surrounded by connective tissue and intracellular and extracellular lipids.A process similar to bone formation causes calcification within the plaque.A link between infection and atherosclerosis has been observed, specifically an association between serologic evidence of certain infections (eg, Chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus) and coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromasCAD).Putative mechanisms include indirect effects of chronic inflammation in the bloodstream, cross-reactive antibodies, and inflammatory effects of infectious pathogens on the arterial wall.However, evidence in favor of such a link is conflicting, and infection likely plays a minor role in atherosclerosis.Plaque stability and rupture Atherosclerotic plaques may be stable or unstable.Stable plaques regress, remain static, or grow slowly over several decades until they may cause stenosis or occlusion.Unstable plaques are vulnerable to spontaneous erosion, fissure, or rupture, causing acute thrombosis, occlusion, and infarction long before they cause hemodynamically significant stenosis.Most clinical events result from unstable plaques, which are often not hemodynamically significant on angiography; thus, plaque stabilization may be a way to reduce morbidity and mortality.The strength of the fibrous cap and its resistance to rupture depend on the relative balance of collagen deposition and degradation.Plaque rupture involves secretion of metalloproteinases, cathepsins, and collagenases by activated macrophages in the plaque.These enzymes digest the fibrous cap, particularly at the edges, causing the cap to thin and ultimately rupture.T cells in the plaque contribute by secreting cytokines.Cytokines inhibit smooth muscle cells from synthesizing and depositing collagen, which normally reinforces the plaque.Once the plaque ruptures, plaque contents are exposed to circulating blood, triggering thrombosis; macrophages also stimulate thrombosis because they contain tissue factor, which promotes thrombin generation in vivo.One of 5 outcomes may occur: The resultant thrombus may organize and be incorporated into the plaque, changing the plaque’s shape and causing its rapid growth.The thrombus may rapidly occlude the vascular lumen and precipitate an acute ischemic event.The thrombus may embolize.The plaque may fill with blood, balloon out, and immediately occlude the artery.Plaque contents (rather than thrombus) may embolize, occluding vessels downstream.Plaque stability depends on multiple factors, including plaque composition (relative proportion of lipids, inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, connective tissue, and thrombus), wall stress (cap fatigue), size and location of the core, and configuration of the plaque in relation to blood flow.By contributing to rapid growth and lipid deposition, intraplaque hemorrhage may play an important role in transforming stable into unstable plaques.In general, unstable coronary artery plaques have a high macrophage content, a thick lipid core, and a thin fibrous cap; they narrow the vessel lumen by < 50% and tend to rupture unpredictably.Unstable carotid artery plaques have the same composition but typically cause problems through severe stenosis and occlusion or deposition of platelet thrombi, which embolize rather than rupture.Low-risk plaques have a thicker cap and contain fewer lipids; they often narrow the vessel lumen by > 50% and may produce predictable exercise-induced stable angina Pectoris Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction.Clinical consequences of plaque rupture in coronary arteries depend not only on that anatomical location of the plaque anatomy but also on relative balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant activity in the blood and on the vulnerability of the myocardium to arrhythmias.Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis There are numerous risk factors for atherosclerosis (1 Risk factor references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteriesRisk Factors for Atherosclerosis Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis ).Certain factors tend to cluster as the metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.This syndrome includes abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state in sedentary patients.Insulin resistance is not synonymous with the metabolic syndrome but may be key in its etiology.Table Dyslipidemia (high total, high LDL, or low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), hypertension, and diabetes promote atherosclerosis by amplifying or augmenting endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory pathways in vascular endotheliumLDL increases; oxidized lipids stimulate production of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines and may be antigenic, inciting a T cell–mediated immune response and inflammation in the arterial wall.Although HDL was previously believed to protect against atherosclerosis via reverse cholesterol transport and by transporting antioxidant enzymes, which can break down and neutralize oxidized lipids, evidence from randomized trials and genetics suggests a much less important role for HDL in atherogenesis.The role of hypertriglyceridemia in atherogenesis is complex, although it may have a small independent effect (2 Risk factor references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.The main determinant for risk of atherogenic cardiovascular disease is the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins, which is best reflected by the apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentration (or by the non-HDL-C concentration, if apoB is unavailable).hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothII–mediated mechanisms.Angiotensin II stimulates endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and macrophages to produce proatherogenic mediators, including proinflammatory cytokines, superoxide anions, prothrombotic factors, growth factors, and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptors.diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia.Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen radicals, generated in diabetes, directly injure the endothelium and promote atherogenesis.Chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal functionA-I levels; and increased lipoprotein(a), homocysteine, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels.Prothrombotic states .Tobacco smoke contains nicotine and other chemicals that are toxic to vascular endothelium.Smoking, including passive smoking, increases platelet reactivity (possibly promoting platelet thrombosis) and plasma fibrinogen levels and hematocrit (increasing blood viscosity).Smoking increases LDL and decreases HDL; it also promotes vasoconstriction, which is particularly dangerous in arteries already narrowed by atherosclerosis.HDL increases rapidly within 1 month of smoking cessation.Lipoprotein (a) Endogenous lipid metabolism [Lp(a)] is pro-atherogenic and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and aortic valve stenosis (3, 4 Risk factor references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.It has a structure similar to LDL, but it also has a hydrophilic apolipoprotein(a) component that is covalently bound to a hydrophobic apolipoprotein B100 (5 Risk factor references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Lp(a) levels are genetically determined and remain fairly stable throughout life.Lp(a) levels above 50 mg/dL are considered pathogenic.Apolipoprotein (B) (apoB) is a particle with two isoforms: apoB-100, which is synthesized in the liver, and apoB-46, which is synthesized in the intestine.ApoB-100 is able to bind the LDL receptor and is responsible for cholesterol transport.It is also responsible for transport of oxidized phospholipids and has proinflammatory properties.Presence of the apoB particle within the arterial wall is thought to be the initiating event for the development of atherosclerotic lesions.A high level of small, dense LDL, characteristic of diabetes, is highly atherogenic.Mechanisms may include increased susceptibility to oxidation and nonspecific endothelial binding.A high C-reactive protein (CRP) level does not reliably predict extent of atherosclerosis but can predict increased likelihood of ischemic events.In the absence of other inflammatory disorders, elevated levels may indicate increased risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ongoing ulceration or thrombosis, or increased activity of lymphocytes and macrophages.CRP itself does not appear to have a direct role in atherogenesis.Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is also observed after thoracic radiation therapy and is likely the result of radiation-induced endothelial injury.C.pneumoniae infection Chlamydia Three species of Chlamydia cause human disease, including sexually transmitted infections and respiratory infectionsHelicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori Infection Helicobacter pylori is a common gastric pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and low-grade gastric lymphoma.Several common and rare genetic variants (eg, near 9p21, LPA and LDLR gene)have been robustly associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events.Although each variant has a small effect individually, genetic risk scores that sum the total number of risk variants have been shown to strongly associate with more advanced atherosclerosis as well as both primary and recurrent cardiovascular events Patients with Hyperhomocysteinemia may predispose to arterial and venous thrombosis.However, because of results from randomized trials of homocysteine lowering therapies that fail to show a decrease in atherosclerotic disease, as well as evidence from Mendelian randomization trials, it is no longer thought that hyperhomocysteinemia itself causes atherosclerosis.The reason for the association between elevated homocysteine levels and atherosclerosis is unclear.Documented vascular disease The presence of atherosclerotic disease in one vascular territory increases the likelihood of disease in other vascular territories.Patients with noncoronary atherosclerotic vascular disease have cardiac event rates comparable to those of patients with known CAD, and they are now considered to have a CAD risk equivalent and should be treated as aggressively.Risk factor references 1.Yusuf S, Hawken S,

asymptomatic, often for decades.Symptoms and signs develop when lesions impede blood flow.Transient ischemic symptoms (eg, stable exertional angina Pectoris Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transient myocardial ischemia without infarction.Vasoconstriction can change a lesion that does not limit blood flow into a severe or complete stenosis.Symptoms of unstable angina Unstable Angina Unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction.Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresisAcute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryIschemic Stroke Ischemic stroke is sudden neurologic deficits that result from focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction (eg, positive results on diffusion-weighted MRI).Atherosclerosis may also cause sudden death without preceding stable or unstable angina pectoris.Atherosclerotic involvement of the arterial wall can lead to aneurysms and arterial dissection, which can manifest as pain, a pulsatile mass, absent pulses, or sudden death.Diagnosis of Atherosclerosis Approach to diagnosis of atherosclerosis depends on the presence or absence of symptoms.Symptomatic patients with symptoms and signs of ischemia are evaluated for the amount and location of vascular occlusion by various invasive and noninvasive tests, depending on the organ involved .Such patients also should be evaluated for atherosclerosis risk factors Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis by using History and physical examination Fasting lipid profile Plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels Patients with documented disease at one site (eg, peripheral arteries) should be evaluated for disease at other sites (eg, coronary and carotid arteries).Noninvasive imaging techniques that can assess plaque morphology and characteristics include Three-dimensional vascular ultrasonography, which can be used to assess plaque in the carotid and other arteries Computed tomography (CT) angiography, which is used clinically to identify significant lesions in the coronary arteries Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, which is used sometimes to image large arteries (eg, aorta) Invasive catheter-based tests are also used.These include Intravascular ultrasonography, which uses an ultrasound transducer on the tip of a catheter to produce images of the arterial lumen and wall Angioscopy, which uses special fiberoptic catheters that can directly visualize the arterial surface Plaque thermography, which is used to detect the increased temperature in plaques with active inflammation Optical coherence tomography, which uses infrared laser light for imaging Elastography, which is used to identify soft, lipid-rich plaques Immunoscintigraphy is a noninvasive alternative that uses radioactive tracers that localize in vulnerable plaque.Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the vasculature is another emerging approach to assess vulnerable plaque.Because not all atherosclerotic plaques have similar risk, various imaging technologies (eg, positron emission tomography) are being studied as a way to identify plaques especially vulnerable to rupture; however, these techniques are not yet used clinically.In addition to the fasting lipid profile and plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1C measurements, some clinicians measure serum markers of inflammation.High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ≥ 3.1 mg/L (≥ 29.5 nmol/L) are highly predictive of cardiovascular events.Asymptomatic patients (screening) In patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis but no symptoms or signs of ischemia, the role of additional testing beyond the lipid profile is unclear.Although imaging studies such as carotid ultrasonography to measure intimal medial thickness and other studies that can detect atherosclerotic plaque are being studied, they do not reliably improve prediction of ischemic events over assessment of risk factors or established prediction tools and are not recommended.An exception is CT imaging for coronary artery calcium (ie, to obtain a calcium score), for which there is more robust evidence for risk reclassification; it may be useful for refining risk estimates and for deciding on statin therapy in select patients (eg, those with intermediate risk, family history of premature cardiovascular disease).Most guidelines recommend lipid profile screening in patients with any of the following characteristics: Men ≥ 40 years Women ≥ 40 years and post-menopausal women Family history of familial hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease (ie, age of onset < 55 years in male 1st degree relative, or < 65 years in female 1st degree relative) Type 2 diabetes Hypertension Metabolic syndrome Chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 3 mg/mmol) Current cigarette smoking Chronic inflammatory conditions HIV infection History of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (preeclampsia or eclampsia) Currently, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends using the pooled cohort risk assessment equations  to estimate lifetime and 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.This calculator has replaced previous risk calculation tools (eg, Framingham score).The new risk calculator is based on sex, age, race, total and HDL cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure (and whether blood pressure is being treated), diabetes, and smoking status (1 Diagnosis references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.The European Cardiovascular Society (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) 2016 guideline suggests using the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE), which calculates risk based on age, gender, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, to estimate the 10-year risk of the first fatal atherosclerotic event (2 Diagnosis references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.For patients deemed at intermediate risk, lipoprotein(a) measurement has been suggested to help refine classification (3, 4 Diagnosis references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Urinary albuminuria (> 30 mg albumin/24 hours) is a marker for renal disorders and their progression, as well as a strong predictor of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, the direct relationship between albuminuria and atherosclerosis has not been established.Treatment of Atherosclerosis Lifestyle changes (diet, smoking, physical activity) Drug treatment of diagnosed risk factors Antiplatelet drugs Statins, possibly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers Treatment involves aggressive modification of risk factors to slow progression and induce regression of existing plaques.Lifestyle changes include diet modification, smoking cessation, and regular participation in physical activity.Drugs to treat dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes are often required.These lifestyle changes and drugs directly or indirectly improve endothelial function, reduce inflammation, and improve clinical outcome.Statins can decrease atherosclerosis-related morbidity and mortality even when serum cholesterol is normal or slightly high.Antiplatelet drugs help all patients with atherosclerosis.Patients with coronary artery disease may benefit additionally from ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.Diet Several changes are beneficial: Less saturated fat No trans fats Fewer refined carbohydrates More fruits and vegetables More fiber Moderate (if any) alcohol Substantial decreases in saturated fat and refined and processed carbohydrates and increases in carbohydrates with fiber (eg, fruits, vegetables) are recommended.These dietary changes are a prerequisite for lipid control and weight reduction and are essential for all patients.Calorie intake should be limited to keep weight within the normal range.Small decreases in fat intake do not appear to lessen or stabilize atherosclerosis.Effective change requires limiting fat intake to 20 g a day, consisting of 6 to 10 g of polyunsaturated fat with omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid) fatty acids in equal proportion, ≤ 2 g of saturated fat, and the rest as monounsaturated fat.Trans fats, which are highly atherogenic, should be avoided.Increasing carbohydrates to compensate for decreasing saturated fats in the diet increases plasma triglyceride levels and reduces HDL levels.Thus, any caloric deficiency should be made up with proteins and unsaturated fats rather than simple carbohydrates.Excessive fat and refined sugar intake should be avoided, especially in people at risk of diabetes, although sugar intake has not been directly related to cardiovascular risk.Instead, consumption of complex carbohydrates (eg, vegetables, whole grains) is encouraged.Fruits and vegetables (5 daily servings) seem to decrease risk of coronary atherosclerosis, but whether this effect is due to phytochemicals or to a proportional decrease in saturated fat intake and increase in fiber and vitamin intake is unclear.Phytochemicals called flavonoids (in red and purple grapes, red wine, black teas, and dark beers) appear especially protective; high concentrations in red wine may help explain why incidence of coronary atherosclerosis in the French is relatively low, even though they use more tobacco and consume more fat than Americans do.But no clinical data indicate that eating flavonoid-rich foods or using supplements instead of foods prevents atherosclerosis.Increased fiber intake decreases total cholesterol and may have a beneficial effect on glucose and insulin levels.Daily intake of at least 5 to 10 g of soluble fiber (eg, oat bran, beans, soy products, psyllium) is recommended; this amount decreases LDL by about 5%.Insoluble fiber (eg, cellulose, lignin) does not appear to affect cholesterol but may confer additional health benefits (eg, reduced risk of colon cancer, possibly by stimulating bowel movement or reducing contact time with dietary carcinogens).However, excessive fiber interferes with the absorption of certain minerals and vitamins.In general, foods rich in phytochemicals and vitamins are also rich in fiber.Alcohol increases HDL and has poorly defined antithrombotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties.These effects appear to be the same for wine, beer, and hard liquor, and occur at moderate levels of consumption; about 30 mL of ethanol (1 oz, contained in about 2 average servings of typical alcoholic beverages) 5 to 6 times a week protects against coronary atherosclerosis.However, at higher doses, alcohol can cause significant health problems.Thus, the relationship between alcohol and total mortality rate is J-shaped; mortality rate is lowest for men who consume < 14 drinks a week and women who consume < 9 drinks a week.People who consume greater amounts of alcohol should cut back.However, clinicians are hesitant to recommend that nondrinkers begin consuming alcohol based on any apparent protective effect.There is little evidence that dietary supplementation with vitamins, phytochemicals, and trace minerals reduces risk of atherosclerosis.The one exception is fish oil supplements Elevated triglycerides .Although alternative medicines and health foods are becoming more popular, and some may have minor effects on blood pressure or cholesterol, these treatments are not always proven safe or effective and may have negative interactions with proven drugs.Levels of coenzyme Q10, which is necessary for the basic functioning of cells, tend to decrease with age and may be low in patients with certain heart and other chronic diseases; thus, coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been used or recommended, but its therapeutic benefit remains controversial.Physical activity Regular physical activity (eg, 30 to 45 minutes of walking, running, swimming, or cycling 3 to 5 times a week) reduces incidence of some risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), coronary artery disease (eg, myocardial infarction), and death attributable to atherosclerosis in patients with and without previous ischemic events.Whether the association is causal or merely indicates that healthier people are more likely to exercise regularly is unclear.Optimal intensity, duration, frequency, and type of exercise have not been established, but most evidence suggests an inverse linear relationship between aerobic physical activity and risk.Walking regularly increases the distance patients with peripheral vascular disease can walk without pain.An exercise program Elevated triglycerides that involves aerobic exercise has a clear role in preventing atherosclerosis and promoting weight loss.Before starting a new exercise program, older people and people who have risk factors for atherosclerosis or who have had recent ischemic events should be evaluated by a physician.Evaluation includes history, physical examination, and assessment of risk factor control.Antiplatelet drugs Oral antiplatelet drugs are essential because most complications result from plaque fissure or rupture, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis.The following are used: Aspirin Thienopyridine drugs such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor Aspirin is most widely used but, despite its proven benefits, remains underused.It is indicated for secondary prevention and may be considered for primary prevention of coronary atherosclerosis in patients at very high risk (eg, patients with diabetes with or without atherosclerosis, patients with ≥ 20% risk of cardiac events within 10 years in whom bleeding risk is not prohibitive, and patients at intermediate risk who have a 10 to 20% risk of cardiac events within 10 years and have low risk of bleeding).Recent evidence suggests that the net-benefit of aspirin in primary prevention is questionable, especially in lower risk individuals, and that careful selection of patients is needed based on patient preferences and after considering the potential risks and benefits of aspirin for each individual (ie, potential harm in patients > 70 years or patients at higher risk for bleeding).Optimal dose and duration are unknown, but aspirin 81 to 325 mg orally once a day indefinitely is commonly used for primary and secondary prevention.However, 81 mg is preferred because this dose may minimize the risk of bleeding, particularly when aspirin is used in combination with other antithrombotic drugs.In about 10 to 20% of patients taking aspirin for secondary prevention, ischemic events recur.The reason may be aspirin resistance; assays to detect lack of thromboxane suppression (indicated by elevated urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2) are being studied for clinical use.Some evidence suggests that ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin’s antithrombotic effect, so other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for patients taking aspirin for prevention.However, all NSAIDs, some more than others, including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors, appear to increase cardiovascular risks.Clopidogrel (usually 75 mg orally once a day) is substituted for aspirin when ischemic events recur in patients taking aspirin and in patients intolerant of aspirin.Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin is effective in treating acute ST-segment and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryPercutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stent insertionPCI) to reduce risk of recurrent ischemic events.Resistance to clopidogrel also occurs.Prasugrel and ticagrelor are newer and more effective drugs than clopidogrel for coronary disease prevention in select patient groups.Ticlopidine is no longer widely used because it causes severe neutropenia in 1% of users and has severe GI adverse effects.Statins primarily lower LDL cholesterol.Other potential beneficial effects include enhanced endothelial nitric oxide production, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced lipid accumulation in the arterial wall, and regression of plaques.Statins are recommended as preventive therapy in 4 groups of patients (1 Treatment references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteriesClinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.92 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75 years, with diabetes and LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.81 to 4.90 mmol/L) Age 40 to 75 years, with LDL cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL, and estimated 10-year risk of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease ≥ 7.5% There is also support for the use of statins in patients with other risk factors, including family history of premature arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ie, age of onset < 55 in male 1st degree relative, or < 65 in female 1st degree relative), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L (19.05 nmol/L), coronary artery calcium score ≥ 300 Agatston units (or ≥ 75th percentile for the patient's demographic), ankle-brachial blood pressure index < 0.9, or chronic kidney disease not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation.Statin treatment is classified as high, moderate, or low intensity and is given based on treatment group and age .Specific LDL cholesterol targets are no longer recommended to guide lipid-lowering therapy.Instead, response to therapy is determined by whether LDL cholesterol levels decrease as expected based on therapy intensity (ie, patients receiving high-intensity therapy should have a ≥ 50% decrease in LDL cholesterol).Other drugs Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have anti-inflammatory properties that reduce risk of atherosclerosis independent of their effects on blood pressure and lipid, and glucose levels.The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban also decreases risk of cardiovascular events although the mechanism of this effect is unknown.ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers inhibit the contributions of angiotensin to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.Ezetimibe also lowers LDL cholesterol by blocking the uptake of cholesterol from the small intestine via inhibition of the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein.Ezetimibe, added to standard statin therapy, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with prior cardiovascular event and LDL cholesterol > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L).PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that keep PCSK9 from attaching to LDL receptors, leading to increased recycling of these receptors to the plasma membrane leading to further clearance of plasma LDL cholesterol to the liver.LDL cholesterol is lowered by 40 to 70%.Long-term clinical trials have shown reduction in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular eventsLDL is not at goal despite maximal medical therapy with statins, and patients who require lipid lowering but have documented objective evidence of statin intolerance.The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice a day decreases risk of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) in patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease when added to aspirin 100 mg daily.The risk of major bleeding was higher in patients on rivaroxaban and aspirin than in patients on aspirin alone (2 Treatment references Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Icosapent ethyl, a highly purified form of eicosapentaoic acid, a key omega-3 fatty acid, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, in addition to statins, in patients with prior cardiovascular disease and elevated triglycerides.The mechanism appears multifactorial (eg reduced inflammation, reduced platelet reactivity, direct anti-atherogenic effects).Thiazolidinediones may control expression of proinflammatory genes, although studies suggest that they increase the risk of coronary events.Folate (folic acid) 0.8 mg orally twice a day has been previously used to treat hyperhomocysteinemia but does not appear to reduce the risk of acute coronary events.Vitamins B6 and B12 also lower homocysteine levels, but current data do not justify their use alone or in combination with folate.Macrolide and other antibiotics given to treat chronic occult C.pneumoniae infections (and thereby suppress inflammation and theoretically alter the course and manifestations of atherosclerosis) have not been shown useful.RNA-based therapies, a new class of drugs block production of key proteins at the mRNA level, often in hepatocytes.Inclisiran (blocks PCSK9), pelacarsen (blocks LPA), olpasiran (blocks LPA), and volanesorsen (blocks apoC3) are examples of these drugs that are currently being evaluated in randomized trials of cardiovascular prevention.Key Points Risk factors for atherosclerosis include dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, family history, and psychosocial factors.Unstable plaques often cause < 50% stenosis, yet are more prone to rupture and cause acute thrombosis or embolic phenomena than are larger, stable plaques.In asymptomatic patients, imaging tests to detect atherosclerosis probably do not help predict ischemic events better than standard assessment of risk factors.Stopping smoking, exercising, eating a diet low in saturated fat and refined carbohydrates and high in fiber and possibly consuming omega-3 fatty acids and moderate amounts of alcohol help in prevention and treatment.Antiplatelet drugs and, depending on patient factors, statins and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors also are helpful.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7152, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",

Dietary intake and renal excretion regulate total body sodium content.When total sodium content and ECF volume are low, the kidneys increase sodium conservation.When total sodium content and ECF volume are high, sodium excretion (natriuresis) increases so that volume decreases.Renal sodium excretion can be adjusted widely to match sodium intake.Renal sodium excretion requires delivery of sodium to the kidneys and so depends on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).Thus, inadequate sodium excretion may be secondary to decreased renal blood flow, as in chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal functionHeart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is the main regulatory mechanism of renal sodium excretion.In volume-depleted states, GFR and chloride delivery to the distal nephrons decreases, causing release of renin.Renin cleaves angiotensinogen (renin substrate) to form angiotensin I.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) then cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II.Angiotensin II does the following: Increases sodium retention by decreasing the filtered load of sodium and enhancing proximal tubular sodium reabsorption Increases blood pressure (has pressor activity) Increases thirst Directly impairs water excretion Stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption via multiple renal mechanisms Angiotensin I can also be transformed to angiotensin III, which stimulates aldosterone release as much as angiotensin II but has much less pressor activity.Aldosterone release is also stimulated by hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L (> 5.5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells.Other natriuretic factors Several other natriuretic factors have been identified, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).ANP is secreted by cardiac atrial tissue.Concentration increases in response to ECF volume overload (eg, heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunctionChronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal functionPrimary Aldosteronism Primary aldosteronism is aldosteronism caused by autonomous production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (due to hyperplasia, adenoma, or carcinoma)Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.Decreases have occurred in the subset of patients with nephrotic syndrome who have presumed ECF volume contraction.High concentrations increase sodium excretion and increase GFR even when blood pressure is low.BNP is synthesized mainly in the atria and left ventricle and has similar triggers and effects to ANP.BNP assays are readily available.High BNP concentration is used to diagnose volume overload.CNP, in contrast to ANP and BNP, is primarily vasodilatory.Sodium depletion and excess Sodium depletion requires inadequate sodium intake plus abnormal losses from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or kidneys (defective renal sodium conservation).Defective renal sodium conservation may be caused by primary renal disease, adrenal insufficiency Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency Secondary adrenal insufficiency is adrenal hypofunction due to a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).Sodium overload requires higher sodium intake than excretion; however, because normal kidneys can excrete large amounts of sodium, sodium overload generally reflects defective regulation of renal blood flow and sodium excretion (eg, as occurs in heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunctionChronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 6988, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 The skin and the tissues under it are kept at a constant temperature (about 98.6° F, or 37° C) by the circulating blood and other mechanisms.The blood gets its heat mainly from the energy given off by cells when they burn (metabolize) food—a process that requires a steady supply of food and oxygen.A normal body temperature is necessary for proper functioning of all the cells and tissues in the body.In a person with low body temperature, most organs, especially the heart and brain, become sluggish and eventually stop working.Body temperature falls when the skin is exposed to colder surroundings.In response to this fall in temperature, the body uses several protective mechanisms to generate additional heat.For example, the muscles produce additional heat through shivering.Also, the small blood vessels in the skin narrow (constrict), so that more blood is diverted to vital organs, such as the heart and brain.However, as less warm blood reaches the skin, body parts such as the fingers, toes, ears, and nose cool more rapidly.If body temperature falls much below about 88° F (about 31° C), these protective mechanisms stop working, and the body cannot warm itself.If body temperature falls below 83° F (about 28° C), death may occur.The risk of cold injuries increases in the following circumstances: When the flow of blood is too slow When food intake is inadequate When dehydration or exhaustion occurs When the environment is wet or when a body part contacts something wet When the person comes into contact with a metal surface When insufficient oxygen is available, as occurs at high altitude Cold injuries are less likely to occur, even in extremely cold weather, if the skin, fingers, toes, ears, and nose are well protected or are exposed only briefly.Prevention of Cold Injuries Keeping warm in a cold environment requires several layers of clothing, preferably wool or synthetics such as polypropylene, because these materials insulate even when wet.Because the body loses a large amount of heat from the head, a warm hat is essential.Eating enough food and drinking enough fluids (particularly warm fluids) also help.Food provides fuel to be burned, and warm fluids directly provide heat and prevent dehydration.Alcoholic beverages should be avoided because alcohol widens (dilates) blood vessels in the skin, which makes the body temporarily feel warm but actually causes greater heat loss. Drinking alcoholic beverages actually makes the body colder because the widening of blood vessels that makes a person feel warm allows more heat to escape from the body.Cold injuries include Frostbite is a cold injury in which an area of the body is frozen.Extreme cold may freeze tissues, destroying them and sometimes the surrounding tissuesHypothermia (dangerously low body temperature) is often regarded as a cold injury, because it can be caused or made worse by exposure to cold surroundingsNonfreezing tissue injuries Nonfreezing Tissue Injuries In nonfreezing tissue injuries, parts of the skin are chilled but not frozen.Nonfreezing tissue injuries include frostnip, immersion foot, and chilblainsIn nonfreezing tissue injuries, parts of the skin are chilled but not frozen.Nonfreezing tissue injuries include frostnip, immersion foot, and chilblainsIn nonfreezing tissue injuries, parts of the skin are chilled but not frozen.Nonfreezing tissue injuries include frostnip, immersion foot, and chilblainsImmersion (trench) foot In nonfreezing tissue injuries, parts of the skin are chilled but not frozen.Nonfreezing tissue injuries include frostnip, immersion foot, and chilblainsPhysical Allergy A physical allergy is an allergic reaction triggered by a physical stimulus..", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5452, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Phenylketonuria is a disorder of amino acid metabolism Overview of Amino Acid and Organic Acid Metabolism Disorders The kidneys actively reabsorb significant amounts of amino acids.Defects of amino acid transport in the renal tubule include cystinuria and Hartnup disease, which are discussed elsewhere.The primary cause is deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.Diagnosis is by detecting high phenylalanine levels and normal or low tyrosine levels.Treatment is lifelong dietary phenylalanine restriction.Prognosis is excellent with treatment.Phenylketonuria (PKU) may occur in all ethnic groups but is relatively less common among Ashkenazi Jews and Black people.Inheritance is autosomal recessive Autosomal Recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understoodWhite people.For information on other related amino acid disorders, see table Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Metabolism Disorders Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Metabolism Disorders .See also Approach to the Patient With a Suspected Inherited Disorder of Metabolism Approach to the Patient With a Suspected Inherited Disorder of Metabolism Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.Pathophysiology of PKU Excess dietary phenylalanine (ie, that not used for protein synthesis) is normally converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase; tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for this reaction.When one of several gene mutations results in deficiency or absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase, dietary phenylalanine accumulates; the brain is the main organ affected, possibly due to disturbance of myelination.Some of the excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenylketones, which are excreted in the urine, giving rise to the term phenylketonuria.The degree of enzyme deficiency, and hence severity of hyperphenylalaninemia, varies among patients depending on the specific mutation.Variant forms Although nearly all cases (98 to 99%) of PKU result from phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, phenylalanine can also accumulate if BH4 is not synthesized because of deficiencies of dihydrobiopterin synthase or not regenerated because of deficiencies of dihydropteridine reductase.Additionally, because BH4 is also a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, which is involved in the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin, BH4 deficiency alters synthesis of neurotransmitters, causing neurologic symptoms independently of phenylalanine accumulation.Symptoms and Signs of PKU Most children with phenylketonuria are normal at birth but develop symptoms and signs slowly over several months as phenylalanine accumulates.The hallmark of untreated PKU is severe intellectual disability.Children also manifest extreme hyperactivity, gait disturbance, and psychoses and often exhibit an unpleasant, mousy body odor caused by phenylacetic acid (a breakdown product of phenylalanine) in urine and sweat.Children also tend to have a lighter skin, hair, and eye color than unaffected family members, and some may develop a rash similar to infantile eczema.Diagnosis of PKU Routine neonatal screening Phenylalanine levels  In the US and many developed countries, all neonates are screened Screening Tests for Newborns Screening recommendations for newborns vary by clinical context and state requirementsInitial testing Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.In classic PKU, neonates often have phenylalanine levels > 20 mg/dL (1.2 mM/L).Those with partial deficiencies typically have levels < 8 to 10 mg/dL while on a normal diet (levels > 6 mg/dL require treatment); distinction from classic PKU requires a mutation analysis identifying mild mutations in the gene or, less often, liver phenylalanine hydroxylase activity assay showing activity between 5% and 15% of normal.BH4 deficiency is distinguished from other forms of PKU by elevated concentrations of biopterin or neopterin in urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or all 3; genetic testing also can be used.Recognition is important, and the urine biopterin profile should be determined routinely at initial diagnosis because standard PKU treatment does not prevent neurologic damage.Children in families with a positive family history can be diagnosed prenatally by using direct mutation studies after chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.Prognosis for PKU Adequate treatment begun in the first days of life prevents the severe manifestations of the disease.However, mild cognitive deficits and mental health issues may still occur even with even with good dietary control.Treatment begun after 2 to 3 years may be effective only in controlling the extreme hyperactivity and intractable seizures.Children born to mothers with poorly controlled PKU (ie, they have high phenylalanine levels) during pregnancy are at high risk of microcephaly and developmental deficit.Treatment of PKU Dietary phenylalanine restriction Treatment of phenylketonuria is lifelong dietary phenylalanine restriction.All natural protein contains about 4% phenylalanine.Therefore dietary staples include Low-protein natural foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, certain cereals) Protein hydrolysates treated to remove phenylalanine-free elemental amino acid mixtures Examples of commercially available phenylalanine-free products include PKU Anamix® (for infants), XPhe Maxamaid® (for children 1 to 8 years), XP Maxamum® (for children > 8 years); Phenex®-1 and Phenex®-2; Phenyl-Free® 1 and Phenyl-Free® 2; PhenylAde® (varieties); PKU Lophlex®LQ; and Phlexy-10® (multiple formulations).Some phenylalanine is required for growth and metabolism; this requirement is met by measured quantities of natural protein from milk or low-protein foods.Frequent monitoring of plasma phenylalanine levels is required; recommended targets for all children are between 2 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL (120 to 360 micromol/L).Dietary planning and management need to be initiated in women of childbearing age before pregnancy to ensure a good outcome for the child.Tyrosine supplementation is increasingly used because it is an essential amino acid in patients with PKU.In addition, all patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency should be given a trial of sapropterin to determine benefit.For those with BH4 deficiency, treatment also includes tetrahydrobiopterin 1 to 5 mg/kg orally 3 times a day; levodopa, carbidopa, and 5-OH tryptophan; and folinic acid 10 to 20 mg orally once a day in cases of dihydropteridine reductase deficiency.However, treatment goals and approach are the same as those for PKU.Key Points PKU is caused by one of several gene mutations that result in deficiency or absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase so that dietary phenylalanine accumulates; the brain is the main organ affected, possibly because of disturbance of myelination.PKU causes a clinical syndrome of intellectual disability with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities; if untreated, the intellectual disability is severe.In the US and many developed countries, all neonates are screened for phenylketonuria 24 to 48 hours after birth with one of several blood tests; abnormal results are confirmed by directly measuring phenylalanine levels.Treatment is lifelong dietary phenylalanine restriction; adequate treatment begun in the first days of life prevents many manifestations of the disease.Although prognosis is excellent with treatment, frequent monitoring of plasma phenylalanine levels is required; recommended targets are between 2 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL (120 to 360 micromol/L) for all children.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7846, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

result from drugs, kidney transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation.Autoimmune disease with hypergammaglobulinemia, particularly Sjögren syndrome Sjögren Syndrome Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown causeRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid

hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architectureSickle cell anemia Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestryPotassium level may be high in patients with chronic obstructive uropathy or sickle cell anemia.Type 2 (proximal) RTA Type 2 is impairment in bicarbonate resorption in the proximal tubules, producing a urine pH > 7 if plasma bicarbonate concentration is normal, and a urine pH < 5.5 if plasma bicarbonate concentration is already depleted as a result of ongoing losses.This syndrome may occur as part of a generalized dysfunction of proximal tubules and patients can have increased urinary excretion of glucose, uric acid, phosphate, amino acids, citrate, calcium, potassium, and protein.Osteomalacia or osteopenia (including rickets in children) may develop.Mechanisms may include hypercalciuria, hyperphosphaturia, alterations in vitamin D metabolism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.Type 2 RTA is very rare and most often occurs in patients who have one of the following: Fanconi syndrome Fanconi Syndrome Fanconi syndrome consists of multiple defects in renal proximal tubular reabsorption, causing glucosuria, phosphaturia, generalized aminoaciduria, and bicarbonate wastingVarious drug exposures (usually acetazolamide, sulfonamides, ifosfamide, outdated tetracycline, or streptozocin) It sometimes has other etiologies, including vitamin D deficiency, chronic hypocalcemia with secondary hyperparathyroidism, kidney transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation.Heavy Metal Nephropathy Exposure to heavy metals and other toxins can result in tubulointerstitial disorders.Wilson disease Wilson Disease Wilson disease results in accumulation of copper in the liver and other organs.Hepatic or neurologic symptoms developLowe syndrome], cystinosis).Type 4 (generalized) RTA Type 4 results from aldosterone deficiency or unresponsiveness of the distal tubule to aldosterone.Because aldosterone triggers sodium resorption in exchange for potassium and hydrogen, there is reduced potassium excretion, causing hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L (> 5.5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells.Urine pH is usually appropriate for serum pH (usually < 5.5 when there is serum acidosis).Plasma bicarbonate is usually > 17 mEq/L (17 mmol/L).This disorder is the most common type of RTA.It typically occurs sporadically secondary to impairment in the renin-aldosterone-renal tubule axis (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism), which occurs in patients with the following: Diabetic nephropathy Diabetic Nephropathy Diabetic nephropathy is glomerular sclerosis and fibrosis caused by the metabolic and hemodynamic changes of diabetes mellitusChronic interstitial nephritis Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal functionOther factors that can contribute to type 4 RTA include the following: ACE inhibitor use Aldosterone synthase type I or II deficiency Angiotensin II receptor blocker use

retain too much potassium but excrete too much sodium and water, leading to hypotensionI or II) Volume expansion (eg, in acute glomerulonephritis or chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal functionSymptoms and Signs of RTA is usually asymptomatic.Severe electrolyte disturbances are rare but can be life threatening.Nephrolithiasis Urinary Calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infectionRTA.Signs of extracellular fluid volume depletion may develop from urinary water loss accompanying electrolyte excretion in type 2 RTA.People with type 1 or type 2 RTA may show symptoms and signs of hypokalemia is serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) caused by a deficit in total body potassium stores or abnormal movement of potassium into cells.Bony involvement (eg, bone pain and osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children) may occur in type 2 and sometimes in type 1 RTAH) with normal anion gap.Type 4 RTA should be suspected in patients who have persistent hyperkalemia with no obvious cause, such as potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, or chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling is done to help confirm RTA and to exclude respiratory alkalosis as a cause of compensatory metabolic acidosis.Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and urine pH are measured in all patients.Further tests and sometimes provocative tests are done, depending on which type of RTA is suspected: Type 1 RTA is confirmed by a urine pH that remains > 5.5 during systemic acidosis.The acidosis may occur spontaneously or be induced by an acid load test (administration of ammonium chloride 100 mg/kg orally).Normal kidneys reduce urine pH to < 5.2 within 6 hours of acidosis.Type 2 RTA is diagnosed by measurement of the urine pH and fractional bicarbonate excretion during a bicarbonate infusion (sodium bicarbonate 0.5 to 1.0 mEq/kg/hour [0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L] IV).In type 2, urine pH rises above 7.5, and the fractional excretion of bicarbonate is > 15%.Because IV bicarbonate can contribute to hypokalemia, potassium supplements should be given in adequate amounts before infusion.Type 4 RTA is confirmed by a history of a condition that could be associated with type 4 RTA, chronically elevated potassium, and normal or mildly decreased bicarbonate.In most cases plasma renin activity is low, aldosterone concentration is low, and cortisol is normal.Treatment of RTA Varies by type Often alkali therapy Treatment of concomitant abnormalities related to potassium, calcium, and phosphate metabolism Treatment consists of correction of pH and electrolyte balance with alkali therapy.Failure to treat RTA in children slows growth.Alkaline agents such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, or sodium citrate help achieve a relatively normal plasma bicarbonate concentration (22 to 24 mEq/L [22 to 24 mmol/L]).Potassium citrate can be substituted when persistent hypokalemia is serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) caused by a deficit in total body potassium stores or abnormal movement of potassium into cells.Vitamin D (eg, ergocalciferol 800 IU orally once/day) and oral calcium supplements (elemental calcium 500 mg orally 3 times/day, eg, as calcium carbonate, 1250 mg orally 3 times/day) may also be needed to help reduce skeletal deformities resulting from osteomalacia or rickets Hypophosphatemic Rickets Hypophosphatemic rickets is a genetic disorder characterized by hypophosphatemia, defective intestinal absorption of calcium, and rickets or osteomalacia unresponsive to vitamin D.Type 1 RTA Adults are given sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate 0.25 to 0.5 mEq/kg (0.25 to 0.5 mmol/L) orally every 6 hours.In children, the total daily dose may need to be as much as 2 mEq/kg (2 mmol/L) every 8 hours; this dose can be adjusted as the child grows.Potassium supplementation is usually not required when the dehydration and secondary aldosteronism are corrected with bicarbonate therapy.Type 2 RTA Plasma bicarbonate cannot be restored to the normal range, but bicarbonate replacement should exceed the acid load of the diet (eg, sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg [1 mmol/L] orally every 6 hours in adults or 2 to 4 mEq/kg [2 to 4 mmol/L] every 6 hours in children) to maintain serum bicarbonate at about 22 to 24 mEq/L (22 to 24 mmol/L) because lower levels risk growth disturbance.However, excess bicarbonate replacement increases potassium bicarbonate losses in the urine.Thus, citrate salts can be substituted for sodium bicarbonate and may be better tolerated.Potassium supplements or potassium citrate may be required in patients who become hypokalemic when given sodium bicarbonate but is not recommended in patients with normal or high serum potassium levels.In difficult cases, treatment with low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally twice/day may stimulate proximal tubule transport functions.In cases of generalized proximal tubule disorder, hypophosphatemia and bone disorders are treated with phosphate and vitamin D supplementation to normalize the plasma phosphate concentration.Type 4 RTA Hyperkalemia is treated with volume expansion, dietary potassium restriction, and potassium-wasting diuretics (eg, furosemide 20 to 40 mg orally once or twice/day titrated to effect).Alkalinization is often unnecessary.A few patients need mineralocorticoid replacement therapy (fludrocortisone 0.1 to 0.2 mg orally once/day, often higher in hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism); mineralocorticoid replacement should be used with caution because it may exacerbate underlying hypertension, heart failure, or edema.Key Points Renal tubular acidosis is a class of disorders in which excretion of hydrogen ions or reabsorption of filtered bicarbonate is impaired, leading to a chronic metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap.RTA is usually due to abnormal aldosterone production or response (type 4), or less often, due to impaired hydrogen ion excretion (type 1) or impaired bicarbonate resorption (type 2).Consider RTA if patients have metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap or unexplained hyperkalemia Check ABG and serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, and urine pH.Do other testing to confirm type of RTA (eg, acid load test for type 1, bicarbonate infusion for type 2).Treat using alkali therapy and measures to correct low serum potassium in type 2 and sometimes type 1 RTA , and using potassium restriction or potassium-wasting diuretics in type 4 RTA; give other electrolytes as needed.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8442, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",

{"text": "【0】 Sore throat is pain in the posterior pharynx that occurs with or without swallowing.Pain can be severe; many patients refuse oral intake.Etiology of Sore Throat Sore throat results from infection; the most common cause is Tonsillopharyngitis Rarely, an abscess or epiglottitis is involved; although uncommon, these are of particular concern because they may compromise the airway.Tonsillopharyngitis is predominantly a viral infection; a lesser number of cases are caused by bacteria.The respiratory viruses Overview of Viral Respiratory Infections Viral infections commonly affect the upper or lower respiratory tractEpstein-Barr virus Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathyHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex viruses (human herpesviruses types 1 and 2) commonly cause recurrent infection affecting the skin, mouth, lips, eyes, and genitalsCMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV, human herpesvirus type 5) can cause infections that have a wide range of severity.A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common.The main bacterial cause is group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS Streptococcal Infections Streptococci are gram-positive aerobic organisms that cause many disorders, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, wound and skin infections, sepsis, and endocarditis.GABHS is a concern because of the possibility of the poststreptococcal sequelae of rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, and abscess.Uncommon bacterial causes include gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeaeMycoplasmas Mycoplasmas are ubiquitous bacteria that differ from other prokaryotes in that they lack a cell wallThree species of Chlamydia cause human disease, including sexually transmitted infections and respiratory infections.Abscess An abscess in the pharyngeal area (peritonsillar Abscess and Cellulitis Peritonsillar abscess and cellulitis are acute pharyngeal infections most common among adolescents and young adultsAbscess A parapharyngeal abscess is a deep neck abscess.Symptoms include fever, sore throat, odynophagia, and swelling in the neck down to the hyoid bone.Diagnosis is by CTAbscess Retropharyngeal abscesses, most common among young children, can cause sore throat, fever, neck stiffness, and stridor.Diagnosis requires lateral neck x-ray or CT.The usual causative organism is GABHS.Epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues that may lead to sudden respiratory obstruction and deathHaemophilus influenzae type B (HiB).Now, because of widespread childhood vaccination against HiB, supraglottitis/epiglottitis has been almost eradicated in children (more cases occur in adults).Causal organisms in children and adults include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, nontypeable H.influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.HiB is still a cause in adults and unvaccinated children.Evaluation of Sore Throat History of present illness should note the duration and severity of sore throat.Review of systems should seek important associated symptoms, such as runny nose, cough, and difficulty swallowing, speaking, or breathing.The presence and duration of any preceding weakness and malaise (suggesting mononucleosis) are noted.Past medical history should seek history of previous documented mononucleosis (recurrence is highly unlikely).Social history should inquire about close contact with people with documented GABHS infection, risk factors for gonorrhea transmission (eg, recent oral-genital sexual contact), and risk factors for HIV acquisition (eg, unprotected intercourse, multiple sex partners, IV drug abuse).Physical examination General examination should note fever and signs of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, stridor, and, in children, the tripod position (sitting upright, leaning forward with neck hyperextended and jaw thrust forward).Pharyngeal examination should not be done in children if supraglottitis/epiglottitis is suspected, because it may trigger complete airway obstruction.Adults with no respiratory distress may be examined but with care.Erythema, exudates, and any signs of swelling around the tonsils or retropharyngeal area should be noted.Whether the uvula is in the midline or appears pushed to one side should also be noted.The neck is examined for presence of enlarged, tender lymph nodes.The abdomen is palpated for presence of splenomegaly.Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Stridor or other sign of respiratory distress Drooling Muffled, “hot potato” voice Visible bulge in pharynx Interpretation of findings Supraglottitis/Epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues that may lead to sudden respiratory obstruction and deathParapharyngeal Abscess A parapharyngeal abscess is a deep neck abscess.Symptoms include fever, sore throat, odynophagia, and swelling in the neck down to the hyoid bone.Diagnosis is by CTTonsillopharyngitis Sore throat is pain in the posterior pharynx that occurs with or without swallowing.Pain can be severe; many patients refuse oral intake.Clinical findings help make this distinction.With supraglottitis/epiglottitis, there is abrupt onset of severe throat pain and dysphagia, usually with no preceding upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms.Children often have drooling and signs of toxicity.Sometimes (more often in children), there are respiratory manifestations, with tachypnea, dyspnea, stridor, and sitting in the tripod position.If examined, the pharynx almost always appears unremarkable.Pharyngeal abscess and tonsillopharyngitis both may cause pharyngeal erythema, exudate, or both.However, some findings are more likely in one condition or another: Pharyngeal abscess: Muffled, “hot potato” voice (speaking as if a hot object is being held in the mouth); visible focal swelling in the posterior pharyngeal area (often with deviation of the uvula) Tonsillopharyngitis: Often accompanied by URI symptoms (eg, runny nose, cough) Although tonsillopharyngitis is easily recognized clinically, its cause is not.Manifestations of viral and GABHS Streptococcal Infections Streptococci are gram-positive aerobic organisms that cause many disorders, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, wound and skin infections, sepsis, and endocarditisURI symptoms are more common with a viral cause.In adults, clinical criteria that increase suspicion of GABHS as a cause include Tonsillar exudate Tender lymphadenopathy Fever (including history) Absence of cough Adults with ≤ 1 criterion reasonably may be presumed to have viral illness.If ≥ 2 criteria are present, the likelihood of GABHS is high enough to warrant testing but probably not high enough to warrant antibiotics, but this decision needs to be patient-specific (ie, threshold for testing and treatment may be lower in those at risk because of diabetes or immunocompromise).In children, testing usually is done.Although this approach is reasonable, not all experts agree on when to test for GABHS and when antibiotic treatment is indicated.Regarding rarer causes of tonsillopharyngitis, infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.Patients with no URI symptoms but recent oral-genital contact may have pharyngeal gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeaeUS).Testing If supraglottitis/epiglottitis is considered possible after evaluation, testing is required.Patients who do not appear seriously ill and have no respiratory symptoms may have plain lateral neck x-rays to look for an edematous epiglottis.However, a child who appears seriously ill or has stridor or any other respiratory symptoms should not be transported to the x-ray suite.Such patients (and those with positive or equivocal x-ray findings) usually should have flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy.(CAUTION: Examination of the pharynx and larynx may precipitate complete respiratory obstruction in children, and the pharynx and larynx should not be directly examined except in the operating room, where the most advanced airway intervention is available.) Pearls & Pitfalls If epiglottitis is considered, directly examine a child's pharynx only in the operating room to minimize the risk of complete airway obstruction.Many abscesses are managed clinically, but if location and extent are unclear, immediate CT of the neck should be done.In tonsillopharyngitis, throat culture is the only reliable way to differentiate viral infection from GABHS.To balance timeliness of diagnosis, cost, and accuracy, one strategy in children is to do a rapid strep screen in the office, treat if positive, and send a formal culture if negative.In adults, because other bacterial pathogens may be involved, throat culture for all bacterial pathogens is appropriate for those meeting clinical criteria described previously.Testing for mononucleosis, gonorrhea, or HIV is done only when clinically suspected.Treatment of Sore Throat Specific conditions are treated.Patients with severe symptoms of tonsillopharyngitis may be started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate) pending culture results.Symptomatic treatments such as warm saltwater gargles and topical anesthetics (eg, benzocaine, lidocaine, dyclonine) may help temporarily relieve pain in tonsillopharyngitis.Patients in severe pain (even from tonsillopharyngitis) may require short-term use of opioids.Corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone, 10 mg IM) are occasionally used, for example, for tonsillopharyngitis that appears to pose a risk of airway obstruction (eg, due to mononucleosis) or very severe tonsillopharyngitis symptoms.Key Points Most sore throats are caused by viral tonsillopharyngitis.It is difficult to clinically distinguish viral from bacterial causes of tonsillopharyngitis.Abscess and epiglottitis are rare but serious causes.Severe sore throat in a patient with a normal-appearing pharynx should raise suspicion of epiglottitis.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9028, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Pulmonary function tests measure the lungs' capacity to hold air, to move air in and out, and to absorb oxygen.Pulmonary function tests are better at detecting the general type and severity of lung disorder than at defining the specific cause of problems; however, these tests can be used to diagnose some specific disorders, such as asthma Asthma Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli. Lung flow rate measurements The assessment of a lung disorder often involves testing how much air the lungs can hold (lung volume) as well as how much and how quickly air can be exhaled (airflow).Airflow measurements are made with a spirometer, which consists of a mouthpiece and tubing connected to a recording device.The person’s lips should be held tightly around the mouthpiece, and nose clips should be worn to ensure that all the air inhaled or exhaled goes through the mouth.A person inhales deeply, then exhales forcefully as quickly as possible through the tubing while measurements are taken.The volume of air inhaled and exhaled and the length of time each breath takes are recorded and analyzed.This measurement is repeated several times to be sure the results are consistent.Often, the tests are repeated after a person takes a drug that opens the airways of the lungs (bronchodilator).In disorders such as asthma Asthma Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli.Using a Spirometer A spirometer consists of a mouthpiece, tubing, and a recording device.To use a spirometer, a person inhales deeply, then exhales vigorously and as quickly as possible through the tubing.The recording device measures the volume of air inhaled or exhaled and the length of time each breath takes.Spirometry: Technique Spirometry is used to test lung function.The person breathes normally, then quickly inhales deeply through a mouthpiece with attached tubing.She next exhales quickly until she has emptied her lungs as much as possible.These breaths are measured by the spirometer (at the right), which has a black plastic attachment that rises and falls with each complete breath.Many modern spirometers are electronic and do not have a piston or bellow that moves as a person breathes.Video from Lahey Clinic Media Center.Spirometry: Recording Spirometry uses a computer (that is, a spirometer) to measure lung function.Normal breathing is recorded on a video monitor as small circles.Next, a deep inhalation is recorded as a larger dotted semicircle on the bottom, and a full exhalation is recorded as a dotted descending curve on top.Video from Lahey Clinic Media Center.A simpler device for measuring how quickly air can be exhaled is the small, hand-held peak flow meter.After inhaling deeply, a person blows into this device as hard as possible.Lung volume measurement Lung volume measurements reflect the stiffness or elasticity of the lungs and rib cage as well as the strength of respiratory muscles Respiratory muscles Breathing is usually automatic, controlled subconsciously by the respiratory center at the base of the brain.Breathing continues during sleep and usually even when a person is unconscious.The lungs are abnormally stiff in disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affects mostly people over the age of 50, usually former smokers.Scoliosis can be present at birth or can develop during adolescence.Various neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that impairs communication between nerves and muscles, resulting in episodes of muscle weakness.Increased stiffness of the lungs causes lower lung volume measurements.In disorders such as COPD, decreased elasticity of the lungs makes it difficult to breathe out.More air is trapped in the lungs, causing higher than expected lung volume measurements.Lung volume measurements made using spirometry are only estimates.More accurate measurements can be made using Body plethysmography Gas dilution In body plethysmography, a person sits inside an airtight plastic box.Because the box is airtight, the volume of air the person breathes in and the change in air pressure during breathing can be measured.A computer calculates lung volumes based on these measurements.Using gas dilution, a person breathes in a known amount of a gas, usually helium.A computer calculates lung volume based on how much gas the person exhales.Flow rate testing Most spirometers can continuously display lung volumes and flow rates during a forced breathing maneuver.These flow rates can be particularly helpful in detecting abnormalities that partially block the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea).Muscle strength assessment The strength of the respiratory muscles can be measured by having the person forcibly inhale and exhale against a pressure gauge.Muscle strength can also be assessed by having the person do spirometry while sitting up and while lying down.Diffusing capacity measurement A diffusing capacity test can estimate how efficiently oxygen is transferred from the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) to the bloodstream.Because the diffusing capacity of oxygen is difficult to measure directly, a person inhales a small amount of carbon monoxide, holds the breath for 10 seconds, and then exhales into a carbon monoxide detector.If the test shows that carbon monoxide is not well absorbed, oxygen will not be exchanged normally between the lungs and the bloodstream either.The diffusing capacity is characteristically abnormal in people with pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affects mostly people over the age of 50, usually former smokers.Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) MVV measures a person's maximum overall ability to breathe.This test is done in the sitting position.A person is instructed to breathe as rapidly and deeply as possible through a spirometer for a predetermined period of time, usually 15 to 30 seconds.The volume of air moved over that period of time is measured.MVV will be decreased in diseases that affect airflow or weaken respiratory muscles.Because this test is dependent upon the ability of a person to cooperate, it is not used as often as other lung function tests.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4841,

{"text": "【0】 Alport syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by nephritic syndrome (ie, hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, eventual renal insufficiency) often with sensorineural deafness and, less commonly, ophthalmologic symptoms.Cause is a gene mutation affecting type IV collagen.Diagnosis is by history, including family history, urinalysis, and biopsy (renal or skin).Treatment is the same as that of chronic kidney disease, sometimes including kidney transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation. Alport syndrome is a nephritic syndrome caused by a mutation in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes that encode the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen and results in altered type IV collagen strands.The mechanism by which collagen alteration causes a glomerular disorder is unknown, but impaired structure and function are presumed; in most families, thickening and thinning of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes occur, with multilamination of the lamina densa in a focal or local distribution (basket-weave pattern).Glomerular scarring and interstitial fibrosis eventually result.The disorder is most commonly inherited in X-linked fashion, although autosomal recessive and, rarely, autosomal dominant varieties exist.Cases with X-linked inheritance may be clinically categorized as Juvenile form: Renal insufficiency develops between 20 and 30 years Adult form: Renal insufficiency develops in people > 30 years Symptoms and Signs Classic X-linked disease in males and autosomal recessive disease are clinically similar.Patients develop renal symptoms and signs similar to those of acute nephritic syndrome (eg, microscopic hematuria, hypertension, eventually gross hematuria with proteinuria) and progress to renal insufficiency between ages 20 and 30 (juvenile forms).Sensorineural hearing loss frequently is present, affecting higher frequencies; it may not be noticed during early childhood.Ophthalmologic abnormalities—cataracts (most common), anterior lenticonus (a regular conical protrusion on the anterior aspect of the lens due to thinning of the lens capsule), spherophakia (spherical lens deformation that can predispose to lens subluxation), nystagmus, retinitis pigmentosa, blindness—also occur but less frequently than hearing loss.X-linked disease occurs in heterozygous women, who, because they have one normal X chromosome, usually have less severe, more slowly progressing symptoms than men.Some men with X-linked disease develop renal insufficiency after age 30 with hearing loss that occurs late or is mild, and autosomal dominant disease typically does not cause renal failure until age ≥ 45 years (adult forms).In patients with X-linked Alport syndrome, sensorineural hearing loss usually manifests in childhood, whereas renal disease often does not manifest until adulthood.Other nonrenal manifestations rarely include polyneuropathy A polyneuropathy is a diffuse peripheral nerve disorder that is not confined to the distribution of a single nerve or a single limb and typically is relatively symmetrical bilaterally.Diagnosis Urinalysis Renal biopsy Molecular genetic analysis Diagnosis is suggested in patients who have microscopic hematuria on urinalysis or recurrent episodes of gross hematuria, particularly if an abnormality of hearing or vision or a family history of chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Urinalysis and usually renal biopsy Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist).In addition to dysmorphic red blood cells, the urine may contain protein, white blood cells, and casts of various types.Nephrotic syndrome occurs rarely.No distinguishing histologic changes are seen on light microscopy.The diagnosis can be confirmed by any of the following: Renal biopsy with immunostaining for the subtypes of type IV collagen Characteristic disorganization of the lamina densa with variable thickening and thinning of the glomerular capillary basement membrane seen using electron microscopy Skin biopsy with immunostaining for the type IV collagen subtypes in a patient with a positive family history Molecular genetic analysis of the COL4A genes A combination of immunostaining and electron microscopy is often needed to distinguish Alport syndrome from some forms of thin basement membrane disease Thin Basement Membrane Disease Thin basement membrane disease is diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane from a width of 300 to 400 nm in normal subjects to 150 to 225 nm.Treatment Same as that for other causes of chronic kidney disease Kidney transplantation Treatment is indicated only when uremia occurs; its management is the same as that for other causes of chronic kidney disease Treatment Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.Anecdotal reports suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers may slow progression of renal disease.Transplantation Kidney Transplantation Kidney transplantation is the most common type of solid organ transplantation.Genetic counseling is indicated.Key Points Consider Alport syndrome if patients have hematuria plus a hearing and/or vision abnormality or a family history of chronic kidney disease.Confirm the diagnosis by biopsy of the kidney or sometimes skin and immunostaining for type IV collagen subtypes or molecular genetic testing.Treat chronic kidney disease and consider transplantation.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7945, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 A tumor is any type of abnormal growth, whether cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).Tumors in the heart may be Primary (noncancerous or cancerous) Metastatic (always cancerous) Primary heart tumors are tumors that originate in the heart.Primary heart tumors are rare, occurring in fewer than 1 of 2,000 people.Most primary heart tumors are noncancerous.Metastatic heart tumors are cancers that developed in another organ and then spread to the heart.Most heart tumors are metastatic cancer, and most are cancers that spread from the lungs. Noncancerous (benign) tumors can be as deadly as cancerous ones if they interfere with the heart's function.Both primary and metastatic tumors may develop in the tissue lining the inside of chambers of the heart (endocardium), the heart muscle (myocardium), the heart valves, or in the sac that surrounds the heart (pericardium).Tumors in the endocardium and heart valves can block blood flow through the heart or cause blood clots that can break off and go to other parts of the body (embolism).Tumors in the pericardium may squeeze (constrict) the heart, preventing it from filling properly.The Heart VIDEO Noncancerous primary heart tumors In adults, about half of noncancerous primary heart tumors are myxomas A myxoma is a noncancerous primary heart tumor, usually irregular in shape and jellylike in consistency.People may feel short of breath or faint, or they may have fever or weight loss.Myxomas usually develop in the heart's left upper chamber (atrium).They may develop from embryonic cells located in the inner layer (lining) of the heart's wall.In infants and children, the most common type of noncancerous primary heart tumor is a rhabdomyoma.Rhabdomyomas, which typically occur in groups, usually grow within the heart wall and develop directly from the heart's muscle cells.Another common noncancerous primary tumors in infants and children are fibromas.Fibromas, which typically occur as a single tumor, usually grow within the heart muscle and develop from the heart's fibrous tissue cells.Several other types of primary heart tumors can develop, but all are rare.Some are cancerous and some benign.Table Cancerous primary heart tumors Cancerous primary heart tumors include Sarcoma Mesothelioma Lymphoma Sarcomas are cancers that develop from connective tissues (blood vessels, nerves, bones, fat, muscles, and cartilage).Sarcomas develop in the right or left atrium and can block blood flow through the heart.Tumors in the right atrium can spread to the lungs.Mesothelioma is cancer of the thin, transparent, two-layered membrane that covers and lines the inside of the chest wall and abdomen.Pericardial mesothelioma can spread to the spine and brain.Lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, which reside in the lymphatic system and in blood-forming organs.Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.Lymphoma usually develops in the lymph nodes, spleen, and/or bone marrow.Lymphoma that develops in the heart is extremely rare.It usually occurs in people who have AIDS and grows rapidly.Metastatic heart tumors Metastatic heart tumors originate in some other part of the body—usually the lungs, breasts, kidneys, blood, or skin—and then spread (metastasize) to the heart.They are always cancerous.Metastatic heart tumors are 30 to 40 times more common than primary heart tumors.About 10% of people who have lung cancer Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking.Melanomas can begin on normal skin or in existing moles.Symptoms of Heart Tumors Heart tumors may cause no symptoms, minor symptoms, or symptoms of life-threatening heart malfunction.Noncancerous tumors can be as deadly as cancerous ones if they interfere with the function of the heart.Very low blood pressure can cause damage to organs, a process called shock.Heart tumors that block the valves, compress the heart, or affect the muscular wall of the heart can lead to heart failure, causing shortness of breath and swelling of the legs.Those affecting the electrical system in the heart can cause abnormal heart rhythms, causing palpitations or fainting.If blood flow through the heart is decreased by a tumor blocking the valves or by a tumor in the pericardium compressing the heart, people may develop low blood pressure Low Blood Pressure Low blood pressure is blood pressure low enough to cause symptoms such as dizziness and fainting.Very low blood pressure can cause damage to organs, a process called shock.Heart tumors, especially myxomas A myxoma is a noncancerous primary heart tumor, usually irregular in shape and jellylike in consistency.People may feel short of breath or faint, or they may have fever or weight loss.Emboli may lodge in small arteries and block blood flow.Also, blood clots that form on the surface of tumors, such as myxomas, may break off as emboli and block arteries.Symptoms due to emboli depend on where the material goes and therefore which tissues or organs are affected by the blocked artery.Diagnosis of Heart Tumors Imaging with echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Primary heart tumors are difficult to diagnose because they are relatively uncommon and because their symptoms resemble those of many other disorders.Doctors may suspect a primary heart tumor in people who have heart murmurs, abnormal heart rhythms Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart.Metastatic heart tumors are suspected when people who have cancer elsewhere in the body come to a doctor with symptoms of heart malfunction.More often, heart tumors are diagnosed when a person is undergoing testing for another medical condition, such as for difficulty breathing.If a tumor is suspected, echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.It uses no x-rays.For this procedure, a probe that emits ultrasound waves is passed over the chest, producing an image of heart structures.If another view of the heart is needed, the probe can be passed down the throat into the esophagus to record signals from just behind the heart.This procedure is called transesophageal echocardiography How echocardiography is done .Unlike with tumors in most other parts of the body, doctors rarely do a heart biopsy (taking a tissue sample to look at it under a microscope).Heart biopsy may be dangerous depending upon the location of the tumor, and doctors can usually tell the difference between benign and cancerous heart tumors from the results of imaging tests.Treatment of Heart Tumors Surgical removal of noncancerous (benign) heart tumors Sometimes chemotherapy or radiation for people with cancerous heart tumors Noncancerous (benign) heart tumors A single small noncancerous primary heart tumor can be surgically removed, usually resulting in a cure.If a large noncancerous primary tumor is significantly reducing blood flow through the heart, removal of the part of the tumor that does not grow into the heart wall may improve heart function.However, if a large part of the heart wall is involved, surgery may be impossible.Rhabdomyomas regress without treatment in most affected newborns and usually do not require treatment.In infants and children, a fibroma that does not affect the wall between the ventricles (septum) may be successfully removed.Tumors that affect this wall usually also affect the electrical conduction system of the heart Tracing the Heart’s Electrical Pathway and cannot be surgically removed.Children with this type of tumor usually die of an abnormal heart rhythm at an early age.Transplantation is very rarely done in either children or adults, and only people with noncancerous tumors are typically considered for heart transplantation.Cancerous heart tumors Primary cancerous tumors cannot be surgically removed and are usually fatal.Chemotherapy or radiation therapy is sometimes used to slow progression of disease.Treatment of metastatic cancer depends on what organ the cancer came from and may include chemotherapy.Pericardial tumors Noncancerous tumors in the pericardium can be removed surgically, but cancerous tumors are not removed because they have usually already spread elsewhere in the body.If the tumor secretes fluid that interferes with heart motion, this fluid can be drained with a small plastic tube inserted by needle into the space between the pericardium and the heart (the pericardial space).Sometimes drugs are injected into the pericardial space to slow the tumor's growth or keep the fluid from building up again.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5401, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name":

{"text": "【0】 Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of epidermal keratinocytes that invades the dermis; this cancer usually occurs in sun-exposed areas.Local destruction may be extensive, and metastases occur in advanced stages.Diagnosis is by biopsy.Treatment depends on the tumor’s characteristics and may involve curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, cryosurgery, or, occasionally, radiation therapy. Squamous cell carcinoma is the 2nd most common type of skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma is a superficial, slowly growing papule or nodule that derives from certain epidermal cells.8 million cases annually in the United States, and 15,000 deaths (1 Reference Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of epidermal keratinocytes that invades the dermis;

not all squamous cell carcinomas of the lip are as highly keratinized.Photo courtesy of Gregory L.Wells, MD.Diagnosis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Biopsy is essential.Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis varies based on the lesion's appearance.Nonhealing ulcers should be differentiated from pyoderma gangrenosum Pyoderma Gangrenosum Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, neutrophilic, progressive skin necrosis of unknown etiology often associated with systemic illness and sometimes skin injury.Diagnosis is clinicalDiagnosis Stasis dermatitis is inflammation, typically of the skin of the lower legs, caused by chronic edema.Symptoms are itching, scaling, and hyperpigmentation.Ulceration can be a complicationWarts are common, benign, epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection.They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies.Diagnosis is by examination.Scaling plaques should be differentiated from basal cell carcinoma Basal Cell Carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma is a superficial, slowly growing papule or nodule that derives from certain epidermal cellsActinic keratoses Chronic affects of sunlight include photoaging, actinic keratoses, and skin cancer.Warts are common, benign, epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection.They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies.Diagnosis is by examinationSeborrheic Keratoses Seborrheic keratoses are superficial, often pigmented, epithelial lesions that are usually warty but may occur as smooth papulesNummular Dermatitis Nummular dermatitis is inflammation of the skin characterized by coin-shaped or discoid eczematous lesions.Diagnosis is clinical.Prognosis for Squamous Cell Carcinoma In general, the prognosis for small lesions removed early and adequately is excellent.Regional and distant metastases of squamous cell carcinomas on sun-exposed skin are uncommon but do occur, particularly with poorly differentiated tumors.Characteristics of more aggressive tumors include Size > 2 cm in diameter Invasion depth of > 2 mm Perineural invasion Location near the ear or vermilion border About one third of lingual or mucosal cancers have metastasized before diagnosis .Late-stage disease, which may require extensive surgery, is far more likely to metastasize.It spreads initially regionally to surrounding skin and lymph nodes and eventually to nearby organs.Cancers that occur near the ears or the vermilion border, in scars, or that have perineural invasion are more likely to metastasize.The overall 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is 34% despite therapy.Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Usually locally destructive techniques Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma is similar to that for basal cell carcinoma Treatment Basal cell carcinoma is a superficial, slowly growing papule or nodule that derives from certain epidermal cells.Treatment and follow-up must be monitored closely because of the greater risk of metastasis compared with a basal cell carcinoma.Squamous cell carcinoma on the lip or other mucocutaneous junction should be excised; at times, cure is difficult.Recurrences and large tumors should be treated aggressively with Mohs microscopically controlled surgery, in which tissue borders are progressively excised until specimens are tumor-free (as determined by microscopic examination during surgery), or by a team approach with surgery and radiation therapy.Because tumors with perineural invasion are aggressive, radiation therapy should be considered after surgery.Metastatic disease is responsive to radiation therapy if metastases can be identified and are isolated.Widespread metastases do not respond well to chemotherapeutic regimens.For inoperable advanced disease or metastatic disease, programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitors (eg, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab) are now an option.Prevention of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Because squamous cell carcinoma seems to be related to ultraviolet (UV) exposure, a number of measures are recommended to limit exposure.Sun avoidance: Seeking shade, minimizing outdoor activities between 10 AM and 4 PM (when sun's rays are strongest), and avoiding sunbathing and the use of tanning beds Use of protective clothing: Long-sleeved shirts, pants, and broad-brimmed hats Use of sunscreen: At least sun protection factor (SPF) 30 with broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection, used as directed (ie, reapplied every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating); should not be used to prolong sun exposure Key Points Squamous cell carcinoma, because of its high frequency of occurrence and highly variable appearance, should be considered in any nonhealing lesion in a sun-exposed area.Metastases are uncommon but are more likely in cancers involving the lingual or mucosal surfaces; that occur near the ears, the vermilion border, or in scars; or that have perineural invasion.Treatment is usually with locally destructive methods, sometimes also with radiation therapy (eg, for tumors that are large, recurrent, or have perineural invasion).PD-1 inhibitors such as cemiplimab and pembrolizumab may be useful in patients with advanced or metastatic disease.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8716, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Blepharitis is inflammation of the edges of the eyelids, possibly with thickening scales, crusts, shallow ulcers, or redness and swelling at the edges of the eyelids.The inflammation is caused by certain infections, allergic reactions, and some skin conditions.The eyelids become irritated, red, and swollen and may burn and itch.Usually the diagnosis is based on symptoms and the appearance of the eyelids.Any underlying disorders are treated, and sometimes antibiotic ointments or drops, antiviral pills, corticosteroid ointment, artificial tears, or a combination is given.Causes of Blepharitis Disorders that may cause blepharitis include bacterial (typically staphylococcal) infection of the eyelids or the ducts of the deeper glands that open at the edges of the eyelids, certain viral infections (usually herpes simplex Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals.The cause is unknown.Another cause is inflamed, blocked oil glands at the edge of the eyelids (called meibomian gland dysfunction), which can be caused by seborrheic dermatitis or rosacea.Eye drops and eye makeup can trigger allergic reactions that cause blepharitis (called contact sensitivity allergic blepharitis).Sometimes the inflammation has no known cause.Symptoms of Blepharitis may cause the feeling that something is in the eye.The eyes and eyelids may itch and burn, and the edges of the eyelids may become red.The eyes may become watery and sensitive to bright light.In some types of blepharitis, such as those caused by bacterial infections, the eyelids may swell, and some of the eyelashes may turn white or even fall out.This type of blepharitis is usually acute.Sometimes, small abscesses containing pus (pustules) develop in the sacs at the base of the eyelashes and eventually form shallow ulcers (ulcerative blepharitis).A crust may form and stick tenaciously to the edges of the eyelids.When the crust is removed, the surface may bleed.During sleep, secretions dry and make the eyelids stick together, so symptoms may be worse upon awakening.In some types of blepharitis, such as those caused by blocked oil (meibomian) glands, the glands become plugged up with hard, waxy deposits.This type of blepharitis can be chronic.The cause is unknown.Styes are usually infected eyelash follicles.Styes are usually infected eyelash follicles.Some people with blepharitis develop dry eyes Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is dryness of the conjunctiva (the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white of the eye) and cornea (the clear layer in front of the iris and pupil).Most types of blepharitis tend to recur and stubbornly resist treatment.Blepharitis is inconvenient and unattractive but usually does not damage the cornea or result in loss of vision.Occasionally, ulcerative blepharitis can result in a loss of the eyelashes, scarring of the eyelid margins, and, rarely, even inflammation affecting the cornea.Chronic blepharitis can also develop in people with Cancer of the eyelid Basal cell carcinoma of the eye Noncancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant) growths can form on the eyelids.A yellow-white lump known as xanthelasma is seen under the eye.A doctor may use a slit lamp What Is a Slit Lamp? to examine the eyelids more closely.Occasionally, a sample of material is taken from the edges of the eyelids and is cultured to identify the type of bacteria causing the infection and determine how sensitive it is to commonly used antibiotics.Treatment of Blepharitis Supportive measures (for example, compresses, eyelid cleansing) Treatment of the cause Certain treatments can help relieve symptoms such as irritation.Artificial tears used during the day and lubricating ointments applied at night may help.Symptoms can also be relieved with wet compresses, typically cool for allergic or contact sensitivity blepharitis and warm for all other causes of blepharitis.Occasionally, if these measures are ineffective, a corticosteroid ointment is used.The problem causing the blepharitis is treated when possible.For example, an eye drop that seems to be causing allergic contact sensitivity blepharitis can be stopped.To treat ulcerative blepharitis caused by bacteria, a doctor may prescribe an antibiotic ointment or drops, such as bacitracin plus polymyxin B, gentamicin, erythromycin, or sulfacetamide, or an antibiotic taken by mouth (such as doxycycline).Corticosteroids typically are not used.Viral blepharitis is treated with antiviral pills (such as valacyclovir) that are effective against herpes simplex Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex virus infection causes recurring episodes of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the skin, mouth, lips (cold sores), eyes, or genitals.For blepharitis caused by seborrheic dermatitis, treatment usually includes keeping the eyelids clean by gently scrubbing the edges of the eyelids twice a day with a wash cloth or cotton swab dipped in a dilute solution of baby shampoo (2 or 3 drops in ½ cup of warm water).When seborrheic dermatitis Overview of Dermatitis is inflammation of the upper layers of the skin, causing itching, blisters, redness, swelling, and often oozing, scabbing, and scaling.Sometimes, punctal plugs (inserts that block the punctum or tear duct and thus decrease tear drainage) help.For meibomian gland dysfunction, warm compresses may help the oil to flow from the meibomian oil glands and relieve inflammation, easing the itching and burning.Eyelid massage may help release the oil from the meibomian glands that help coat the eye.Rosacea Treatment Rosacea is a persistent skin disorder that causes redness, tiny pimples, and noticeable blood vessels, usually on the central area of the face.The cause is unknown.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4030, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Polycystic ovary syndrome is a clinical syndrome typically characterized by anovulation or oligo-ovulation, signs of androgen excess (eg, hirsutism, acne), and multiple ovarian cysts in the ovaries.Insulin resistance and obesity are often present.Diagnosis is by clinical criteria, hormone measurement, and imaging to exclude a virilizing tumor.Treatment is symptomatic.In the US, it is the most common cause of infertility.PCOS is usually defined as a clinical syndrome, not by the presence of ovarian cysts.But typically, ovaries contain many 2- to 6-mm follicular cysts and sometimes larger cysts containing atretic cells.Ovaries may be enlarged with smooth, thickened capsules or may be normal in size.This syndrome involves anovulation or ovulatory dysfunction and androgen excess of unclear etiology.However, some evidence suggests that patients have a functional abnormality of cytochrome P450c17 affecting 17-hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in androgen production); as a result, androgen production increases.Pathogenesis appears to involve environmental and hereditary factors.Complications Polycystic ovary syndrome has several significant potential complications.Infertility is related to ovulatory dysfunction Ovulatory Dysfunction Ovulatory dysfunction is abnormal, irregular (with ≤ 9 menses/year), or absent ovulation.Menses are often irregular or absent.Estrogen levels are elevated, increasing risk of endometrial hyperplasia and, potentially, endometrial cancer Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma.Typically, it manifests as postmenopausal uterine bleeding.Diagnosis is by biopsy.Staging is surgical.Androgen levels are often elevated, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemiaBMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2.Hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance may be present and may contribute to increased ovarian production of androgens.Over the long term, androgen excess increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia.Risk of androgen excess and its complications may be just as high in women who are not overweight as in those who are.Calcification of coronary arteries and thickening of the carotid intima media is more common among women with PCOS, suggesting possible subclinical atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries.Studies indicate that PCOS is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and that women with PCOS are at increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes.eCollection 2019.Symptoms and Signs of PCOS Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome typically begin during puberty and worsen with time.Ovulatory dysfunction is usually present at puberty, resulting in primary amenorrhea; thus, polycystic ovary syndrome is unlikely if regular menses occurred for a time after menarche.Premature adrenarche is common, caused by excess dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and often characterized by early growth of axillary hair, body odor, and microcomedonal acne.Typical symptoms include irregular menses, usually oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) can be primary or secondary.However, in up to half of women with PCOS, weight is normal, and some women are underweight.Body hair may grow in a male pattern (eg, on the upper lip, chin, back, thumbs, and toes; around the nipples; and along the linea alba of the lower abdomen).Some women have acne, and some have signs of virilization, such as temporal hair thinning.Other symptoms may include weight gain (sometimes seemingly hard to control), fatigue, low energy, sleep-related problems (including sleep apnea), mood swings, depression, anxiety, and headaches.In some women, fertility is impaired.Symptoms vary from woman to woman.Areas of thickened, darkened skin (acanthosis nigricans) may appear in the axillae, on the nape of the neck, in skinfolds, and on knuckles and/or elbows; the cause is high insulin levels due to insulin resistance.If women with PCOS become pregnant and if obesity is present, risk of pregnancy complications is increased.These complications include gestational diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy , preterm delivery Preterm Labor (contractions resulting in cervical change) that begins before 37 weeks gestation is considered pretermEclampsia Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation.Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia.Diagnosis of PCOS Clinical criteria Pelvic ultrasonography Tests to exclude other endocrinologic disorders, such as measurement of serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels PCOS is suspected if women have at least two typical symptoms (eg, irregular menses, hirsutism).The diagnosis requires at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: Ovulatory dysfunction causing menstrual irregularity Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism > 10 follicles per ovary (detected by pelvic ultrasonography), usually occurring in the periphery and resembling a string of pearls Testing includes pregnancy testing and measurement of FSH, prolactin, and TSH to exclude other possible causes of symptoms.Transvaginal ultrasonography is done to detect polycystic ovaries and exclude other possible causes of symptoms.However, transvaginal ultrasonography is not done in adolescent girls .The diagnosis is not based on measurement of serum androgens.For patients who meet diagnostic criteria, other causes of hirsutism or virilization (eg, androgen-secreting tumors) should be excluded by measuring serum androgens including Total testosterone Early-morning serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is measured to exclude adrenal virilism Adrenal Virilism Adrenal virilism is a syndrome in which excessive adrenal androgens cause virilizationDHEAS, if abnormal, women are evaluated as for amenorrhea Evaluation Amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) can be primary or secondarySerum free testosterone is more sensitive than total testosterone but is technically more difficult to measure .Normal to mildly increased testosterone and normal to mildly decreased FSH levels suggest PCOS.Also, serum cortisol is measured to exclude Cushing syndrome Cushing Syndrome Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids.Pearls & Pitfalls Polycystic ovary syndrome is unlikely if regular menses occurred for a time after menarche.In adolescents with symptoms of PCOS, measure testosterone levels.Diagnosing PCOS in adolescent girls Diagnosing PCOS in adolescents is complicated because physiologic changes during puberty (eg, hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity) are similar to features of PCOS.These criteria require that both of the following conditions be present: Abnormal uterine bleeding pattern (abnormal for age or gynecologic age or symptoms that persist for 1 to 2 years) Evidence of hyperandrogenism (based on persistently elevated testosterone levels above adult norms [the best evidence], moderate-to-severe hirsutism, or moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris as an indication to test for hyperandrogenemia) Often, a 17-hydroxyprogesterone test is also done to screen adolescents for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia Overview of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders, each characterized by inadequate synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both.Pelvic ultrasonography is usually indicated only if serum androgen levels or degree of virilization suggests an ovarian tumor.Transvaginal ultrasonography is usually not used to diagnose PCOS in adolescent girls because it detects polycystic morphology in < 40% of girls and, used alone, does not predict the presence or development of PCOS.Treatment of PCOS Usually estrogen/progestin contraceptives or progestins Sometimes metformin or other insulin sensitizers Management of hirsutism and, in adult women, long-term risks of hormonal abnormalities Infertility treatments in women who desire pregnancy Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome aims to Manage hormonal and metabolic abnormalities and thus reduce risks of estrogen excess (eg, endometrial hyperplasia) and androgen excess (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders) Relieve symptoms Treat infertility Hormonal medications are used to cause regular shedding of the endometrium and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.Women are usually given an intermittent progestin (eg, medroxyprogesterone 5 to 10 mg orally once a day for 10 to 14 days every 1 to 2 months) or combination oral contraceptives to.These treatments also reduce circulating androgens and usually help make menstrual cycles more regular.Hormonal contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, and acne in women who have PCOS and who do not desire pregnancy.Lifestyle changes and pharmacologic approaches are used to manage insulin insensitivity.If obesity is present, weight loss and regular exercise are encouraged.These measures may help induce ovulation, make menstrual cycles more regular, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism.Weight loss may also help improve fertility.However, weight loss is unlikely to benefit normal-weight women with PCOS.Metformin 500 to 1000 mg twice a day is used to help increase insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, irregular menses, and diabetes or insulin resistance if lifestyle modifications are ineffective or if they cannot take or cannot tolerate hormonal contraceptives.Metformin can also reduce free testosterone levels.When metformin is used, serum glucose should be measured, and kidney and liver function tests should be done periodically.Because metformin may induce ovulation, contraception is needed if pregnancy is not desired.Metformin helps correct metabolic and glycemic abnormalities and makes menstrual cycles more regular, but it has little or no beneficial effect on hirsutism, acne, or infertility.Many patients with PCOS have infertility, and those who desire pregnancy should be referred to infertility specialists.Infertility treatments Treatment Ovulatory dysfunction is abnormal, irregular (with ≤ 9 menses/year), or absent ovulation.Menses are often irregular or absent.Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility.Weight loss may also be helpful.Hormone therapy that may have contraceptive effects is avoided.The aromatase inhibitor letrozole can also be used to stimulate ovulation.Other fertility medications may also be tried.They include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the ovaries, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist to stimulate the release of FSH, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger ovulation.If clomiphene and other medications are unsuccessful or if there are other indications for laparoscopy, laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be considered; however possible long-term complications of drilling (eg, adhesions, ovarian insufficiency) must be considered.Ovarian drilling involves using electrocautery or a laser to drill holes in small areas of the ovaries that produce androgens.Ovarian wedge resection is not recommended.Because women with PCOS-associated obesity have a higher risk of pregnancy complications (including gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia), preconception assessment of body mass index, blood pressure, and oral glucose tolerance is recommended.Eflornithine cream 13.9% twice a day may help remove unwanted facial hair.In adult women who do not desire pregnancy, hormone therapy that decreases androgen levels or spironolactone can be tried.Spironolactone 50 to 100 mg twice a day is effective, but because this medication may have teratogenic effects, effective contraception is needed.Cyproterone, an antiandrogen (not available in the US), reduces the amount of unwanted body hair in 50 to 75% of affected women.Weight reduction decreases androgen production in women with obesity and thus may slow hair growth.GnRH agonists and antagonists are being studied as treatment for unwanted body hair.Both types of medications inhibit the production of sex hormones by the ovaries.But both can cause bone loss and lead to osteoporosis.Systemic isotretinoin is used only for severe cases.Management of comorbidities Because risk of depression and anxiety is increased in PCOS, women and adolescents with PCOS should be screened for these problems based on history, and if a problem is identified, they should be referred to a mental health care practitioner and/or treated as needed.Because PCOS can increase the risk of cardiovascular disorders, referral to a cardiovascular specialist for prevention of cardiovascular disorders is necessary if women with PCOS have any of the following: A family history of early-onset cardiovascular disorders Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Dyslipidemia Sleep apnea Abdominal obesity (as for metabolic syndrome Diagnosis Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemiaClinicians should evaluate cardiovascular risk by determining body mass index (BMI), measuring fasting lipid and lipoprotein levels, and identifying risk factors for metabolic syndrome.Adult women with PCOS are evaluated for metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.Tests for coronary artery calcification and thickened carotid intima media should be done to check for subclinical atherosclerosis.Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should be screened for endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma using endometrial biopsy and/or transvaginal ultrasonography or office hysteroscopy.Epub 2008 Feb 5.Key Points Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common cause of ovulatory dysfunction.Suspect PCOS in women who have irregular menses, are mildly obese, and are slightly hirsute, but be aware that weight is normal or low in many women with PCOS.Test for serious disorders (eg, Cushing syndrome, tumors) that can cause similar symptoms and for complications (eg, metabolic syndrome) If pregnancy is not desired, treat women with hormonal contraceptives and recommend lifestyle modifications; if lifestyle modifications are ineffective, add metformin or other insulin sensitizers.If women with PCOS are infertile and desire pregnancy, refer them to reproductive infertility specialists.Screen for comorbidities, such as endometrial cancer, mood and anxiety disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension and hyperlipidemia).", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8921, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

About 50% of nail dystrophies are caused by a fungal infection (onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails. The remainder result from various causes, including nail injuries Fingernail and Toenail Injury Fingernails and toenails can be damaged by injuries.Even a minor injury to the finger or toe may cause changes in the nail.However, their meanings are slightly different.Drugs, infections, and diseases can cause discoloration of the nails (chromonychia).For example, infection with Pseudomonas bacteria can cause a greenish discoloration ( Home.see page Green Nail Syndrome Green Nail Syndrome Green nail syndrome is infection with Pseudomonas, a type of bacteria. The doctor can often make the diagnosis of nail dystrophies caused by a fungus by examining the nails.However, to confirm the diagnosis, the doctor may need to take fungal scrapings and do a culture (the process of growing the organisms in a laboratory) or do a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to look for genetic material from a fungus.To diagnose nail dystrophies that are not caused by a fungus, doctors may do a biopsy of the nail plate (the hard part of the nail) or nail matrix (located at the base of the nail and where nail growth originates).If the nail’s appearance does not improve with treatment of the underlying disorder, manicurists may be able to hide deformities and some dystrophies with appropriate trimming and polishes.Birth deformities of the nail Some babies are born without nails (anonychia).In nail-patella syndrome Nail-Patella Syndrome Nail-patella syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder that results in abnormalities of the kidneys, bones, joints, toenails, and fingernails.Darier disease causes red and white streaks on the nails and V-shaped notches to form on the tips of the nails.In pachyonychia congenita, nail beds (the parts of the nail unit that attach the nail to the finger) are thickened and discolored and are curved from side to side, forming a pincer nail deformity Pincer nail deformity The terms deformities and dystrophies are often used interchangeably, sometimes even by doctors.However, their meanings are slightly different.Nail deformities and dystrophies associated with systemic diseases Sometimes, diseases that involve other organs (systemic diseases) can cause changes in the nails as well, including the following: Iron deficiency Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.This deformity is particularly characteristic of Plummer-Vinson syndrome Esophageal Webs Esophageal webs are thin membranes that grow across the inside of the upper part of the esophagus and may cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).Kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.This dystrophy can also occur in healthy people.Cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.Intensely white nails, also called Terry nails, can be present not only in people with cirrhosis but also in those with chronic heart failure or diabetes.Low blood levels of the protein albumin (which may occur in people with cirrhosis) can cause horizontal white lines to form on the nails.Terry nails may sometimes occur as part of normal aging.Some lung diseases, often accompanied by lymphedema is the accumulation of lymph in tissues,

to complete loss of the nail.They can occur after an infection, injury, systemic illness, or chemotherapy.White horizontal lines across part of the nail (leukonychia) may appear after an injury.However, lines that run horizontally all of the way across the nail (Mees lines) may be associated with more serious health problems, including cancer or heart failure, chemotherapy, or

People with onycholysis are at risk of infection with yeast and fungus.Keeping the nail dry and applying antifungal preparations to the nail unit can help.Pincer nail deformity In pincer nail deformity, the nail is overcurved horizontally (side-to-side).It is most often caused by a fungal infection (onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails. The deformity can also occur in people who have lupus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls.The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown but may be associated with an infection.Sometimes it develops in older people and in those with arthritis in their fingers.People often have pain where the nail plate curves into the tips of the fingers.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4921, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Trichomoniasis is infection of the vagina or male genital tract with Trichomonas vaginalis.It can be asymptomatic or cause urethritis, vaginitis, or occasionally cystitis, epididymitis, or prostatitis.Diagnosis is by direct microscopic examination, dipstick tests, or nucleic acid amplification tests of vaginal secretions or by urine or urethral culture.Patients and sex partners are treated with metronidazole or tinidazole Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated, sexually transmitted protozoan that more often infects women than men; in the US in 2013–2016, among individuals ages 14 to 59 years, prevalence was 2.1% among women and 0.5% among men (1 Reference Trichomoniasis is infection of the vagina or male genital tract with Trichomonas vaginalis.Infection may be asymptomatic in either sex.In men, the organism may persist for long periods in the genitourinary tract without causing symptoms and may be transmitted to sex partners.Trichomoniasis may account for up to 5% of nongonococcal, nonchlamydial urethritis in men in some areas.Coinfection with gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeaeSTIs) is common.Symptoms and Signs of Trichomoniasis In women, symptoms of trichomoniasis range from none to copious, yellow-green, frothy vaginal discharge with a fishy odor, and soreness of the vulva and perineum, dyspareunia, and dysuria.Asymptomatic infection may become symptomatic at any time as the vulva and perineum become inflamed and edema develops in the labia.The vaginal walls and surface of the cervix may have punctate, red “strawberry” spots.Urethritis and possibly cystitis may also occur.Men are usually asymptomatic; however, sometimes urethritis results in a discharge that may be transient, frothy, or purulent or that causes dysuria and frequency, usually early in the morning.Often, urethritis is mild and causes only minimal urethral irritation and occasional moisture at the urethral meatus, under the foreskin, or both.Epididymitis and prostatitis are rare complications.Diagnosis of Trichomoniasis Vaginal testing with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), wet-mount microscopic examination, rapid-antigen dipstick tests, or sometimes culture or cervical cytology Culture of urine or urethral swabs from men Trichomoniasis should be suspected in women with vaginitis, in men with urethritis, and in their sex partners.Suspicion is high if symptoms persist after patients have been evaluated and treated for other infections such as gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeaeChlamydia and Mycoplasmal Mucosal Infections Sexually transmitted urethritis, cervicitis, proctitis, and pharyngitis (that are not due to gonorrhea) are caused predominantly by chlamydiae and less frequently by mycoplasmas.In women, one of the following diagnostic tests of vaginal secretions may be done: NAAT Vaginal pH and wet mount microscopy Immunochromatographic flow dipstick test NAATs are more sensitive than microscopic examination or culture for diagnosis of trichomoniasis in women.Immunochromatographic flow dipstick tests are also available for point of care testing in women.Cervical cytology (Pap test) is not used to test for trichomoniasis, but infection is sometimes detected incidentally.Microscopic examination enables clinicians to evaluate for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow.Vaginal secretions are obtained from the posterior fornix.The pH is measured.Secretions are then placed on 2 slides; they are diluted with 10% potassium hydroxide on one slide (KOH wet mount) and with 0.9% sodium chloride on the other (saline wet mount).For the whiff test, the KOH wet mount is checked for a fishy odor, which results from amines produced in bacterial vaginosis Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Bacterial vaginosis is vaginitis due to a complex alteration of vaginal flora in which lactobacilli decrease and anaerobic pathogens overgrow.The saline wet mount is examined microscopically as soon as possible to detect trichomonads, which can become immotile and more difficult to recognize within minutes after slide preparation.(Trichomonads are pear-shaped with flagella, often motile, and average 7 to 10 micrometers—about the size of white blood cells—but occasionally reach 25 micrometers.)

{"text": "【0】 Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm.Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope.Atrial thrombi may form, causing a significant risk of embolic stroke.Diagnosis is by electrocardiography.Treatment involves rate control with drugs, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulation, and sometimes conversion to sinus rhythm by drugs or cardioversion Atrial fibrillation has been attributed to multiple wavelets with chaotic reentry within the atria.However, in many cases, firing of an ectopic focus within venous structures adjacent to the atria (usually the pulmonary veins) is responsible for initiation and perhaps maintenance of atrial fibrillation.In atrial fibrillation, the atria do not contract, and the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system is bombarded with many electrical stimuli, causing inconsistent impulse transmission and an irregularly irregular ventricular rate, which is usually in the tachycardia rate range.Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, affecting between 3 and 6 million adults in the US.Men and White people are more likely to have atrial fibrillation than women and Black people.Prevalence increases with age; almost 10% of people > 80 years are affected.Atrial fibrillation tends to occur in patients with an underlying heart disorder.Complications of atrial fibrillation The absent atrial contractions predispose to thrombus formation; annual risk of cerebrovascular embolic events is about 7%.Risk of stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Systemic emboli can also cause malfunction or necrosis of other organs (eg, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, eyes) or a limb.Atrial fibrillation also may impair cardiac output; loss of atrial contraction can lower cardiac output at normal heart rate by about 10%.Such a decrease is usually well tolerated except when the ventricular rate becomes too fast (eg, > 140 beats/minute), or when patients have borderline or low cardiac output to begin with.In such cases, heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.Etiology of Atrial Fibrillation The most common causes of atrial fibrillation are Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or bothCoronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromasCardiomyopathy Overview of Cardiomyopathies A cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscleValvular heart disorders: mitral stenosis Mitral Stenosis Mitral stenosis is narrowing of the mitral orifice that impedes blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.The usual cause is rheumatic feverMitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation (MR) is incompetency of the mitral valve causing flow from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium during ventricular systoleTricuspid Regurgitation Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficiency of the tricuspid valve causing blood flow from the right ventricle to the right atrium during systoleHyperthyroidism is characterized by hypermetabolism and elevated serum levels of free thyroid hormonesBinge alcohol drinking (holiday heart) Less common causes of atrial fibrillation include Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the occlusion of pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the legs or pelvisAtrial septal defects Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an opening in the interatrial septum, causing a left-to-right shunt and volume overload of the right atrium and right ventricleChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smokeMyocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium with necrosis of cardiac myocytesPericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial spaceLone atrial fibrillation is atrial fibrillation without an identifiable cause in patients < 60 years.Overview of Atrial Fibrillation VIDEO Classification of Atrial Fibrillation Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is atrial fibrillation that lasts < 1 week having converted spontaneously or by an intervention to normal sinus rhythm.Episodes may recur.Persistent atrial fibrillation is continuous atrial fibrillation that lasts > 1 week.Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation lasts > 1 year, but there is still the possibility of restoring sinus rhythm.Permanent atrial fibrillation cannot be converted to sinus rhythm (the term also includes patients for whom a decision has been made not to attempt conversion to sinus rhythm).The longer atrial fibrillation is present, the less likely is spontaneous conversion and the more difficult is cardioversion because of atrial remodeling (rapid atrial rate-induced changes in atrial electrophysiology that are dominated by a decrease in atrial refractoriness and may also include increase in spatial dispersion of atrial refractoriness, slowed atrial conduction velocity, or both).Symptoms and Signs of Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic, but many patients have palpitations, vague chest discomfort, or symptoms of heart failure (eg, weakness, light-headedness, dyspnea), particularly when the ventricular rate is very rapid (often 140 to 160 beats/minute).Patients may also present with symptoms and signs of acute stroke or of other organ damage due to systemic emboli.The pulse is irregularly irregular with loss of a waves in the jugular venous pulse.A pulse deficit (the apical ventricular rate is faster than the rate palpated at the wrist) may be present because left ventricular stroke volume is not always sufficient to produce a peripheral pressure wave for a beat closely coupled to the previous beat.Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation Electrocardiography (ECG) Echocardiography Thyroid function tests Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is by ECG .Findings include Absence of P waves Presence of f (fibrillatory) waves between QRS complexes; f waves are irregular in timing, irregular in morphology; baseline undulations at rates > 300/minute, usually best seen in lead V1 and not always apparent in all leads Irregularly irregular R-R intervals Atrial fibrillation Other irregular rhythms may resemble atrial fibrillation on ECG but can be distinguished by the presence of discrete P or flutter waves, which can sometimes be made more visible with vagal maneuvers.Muscle tremor or electrical interference may resemble f waves, but the underlying rhythm is regular.Atrial fibrillation may also cause a phenomenon that mimics ventricular extrasystoles or ventricular tachycardia (Ashman phenomenon).This phenomenon typically occurs when a short R-R interval follows a long R-R interval; the longer interval lengthens the refractory period of the infra-Hisian conduction system, and the subsequent QRS complex(es) are conducted aberrantly, typically with right bundle branch morphology.Echocardiography This photo shows a patient having echocardiography.This image shows all 4 cardiac chambers and the tricupsid and mitral valvesLaboratory Testing of Thyroid Function The thyroid gland, located in the anterior neck just below the cricoid cartilage, consists of 2 lobes connected by an isthmus.Echocardiography is done to assess structural heart defects (eg, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggesting past or present ischemia, valvular disorders, cardiomyopathy) and to identify additional risk factors for stroke (eg, atrial blood stasis or thrombus, complex aortic plaque).Atrial thrombi are more likely in the atrial appendages, where they are best detected by transesophageal rather than transthoracic echocardiography.Pearls & Pitfalls Atrial fibrillation with a wide QRS complex may indicate Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Atrial Fibrillation and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) In Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, antegrade conduction occurs over an accessory pathwayAV node-blocking medications may be fatal.Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation Rate control with medications or AV node ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causesSometimes rhythm control with synchronized cardioversion Rhythm control , medications, or atrial fibrillation substrate ablation Prevention of thromboembolism If a significant underlying disorder is suspected, patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation may benefit from hospitalization.Patients with recurrent episodes do not require hospitalization unless other symptoms suggest the need for it.Once causes have been managed, treatment of atrial fibrillation focuses on ventricular rate control, rhythm control, and prevention of thromboembolism.Ventricular rate control Patients with atrial fibrillation of any duration require rate control (typically to < 100 beats/minute at rest) to control symptoms and prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.For acute paroxysms of rapid rate (eg, 140 to 160 beats/minute), IV AV node blockers are used (for doses, see table Antiarrhythmic Drugs Antiarrhythmic Drugs (Vaughan Williams Classification) ).CAUTION: AV node blockers should not be used in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome when an accessory AV pathway is involved (indicated by wide QRS duration); these drugs increase frequency of conduction via the bypass tract, possibly causing ventricular fibrillation.Beta-blockers (eg, metoprolol, esmolol) are preferred if excess catecholamines are suspected (eg, in thyroid disorders, exercise-triggered cases).Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) are also effective.Digoxin is the least effective but may be preferred if heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.These medications may be used orally for long-term rate control.When beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and digoxin—separately or in combination—are ineffective, amiodarone may be required.Rhythm control In patients with heart failure or other hemodynamic compromise directly attributable to new-onset atrial fibrillation, restoration of normal sinus rhythm is indicated to improve cardiac output.In other cases, conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm is optimal, but the antiarrhythmic medications for Arrhythmias The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causesIa, Ic, III) have a risk of adverse effects and may increase mortality.Conversion to sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation.For acute conversion, synchronized cardioversion Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Before conversion is attempted, the ventricular rate should be controlled to < 120 beats/minute, and, many patients should be anticoagulated (for criteria and methods, see Prevention of thromboembolism during rhythm control Rhythm control Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm.Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope.If atrial fibrillation has been present > 48 hours, patients should typically be given an oral anticoagulant (conversion, regardless of method used, increases risk of thromboembolism).Anticoagulation should be maintained for > 3 weeks before conversion or can be given for a shorter time before conversion if transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) does not show left atrial thrombus.Anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks after cardioversion.Many patients need chronic anticoagulation  Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope.Pearls & Pitfalls When possible, give anticoagulation before attempting to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.Conversion to sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation in patients who meet criteria for it.Synchronized cardioversion (100 joules, followed by 200 and 360 joules as needed) converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in 75 to 90% of patients, although recurrence rate is high.Efficacy and maintenance of sinus rhythm after the procedure is improved with use of class Ia, Ic, or III antiarrhythmic medications for Arrhythmias The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Cardioversion is more effective in patients with shorter duration of atrial fibrillation, lone atrial fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation with a reversible cause; it is less effective when the left atrium is enlarged (> 5 cm), atrial appendage flow is low, or a significant underlying structural heart disorder is present.Medications for conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm include class Ia (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide), Ic (flecainide, propafenone), and III (amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, ibutilide, sotalol, vernakalant) antiarrhythmics  ).All are effective in about 50 to 60% of patients, but adverse effects differ.These medications should not be used until rate has been controlled by a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.The converting medications with oral formulations are also used for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (with or without previous cardioversion).Choice depends on patient tolerance.However, for paroxysmal AF that occurs only or almost only at rest or during sleep when vagal tone is high, medications with vagolytic effects (eg, disopyramide) may be particularly effective.Exercise-induced AF may be better prevented with a beta-blocker.For certain patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who also can identify its onset by symptoms, some clinicians provide a single oral loading dose of flecainide (300 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 200 mg) or propafenone (600 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 450 mg) that patients carry and self-administer when palpitations develop (“pill-in-the-pocket” approach).This approach must be limited to patients who have no sinoatrial or AV node dysfunction, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease.Its hazard (estimated at 1%) is the possibility of converting atrial fibrillation to a slowish atrial flutter that conducts 1:1 in the 200 to 240 beat/minute range.This potential complication can be reduced in frequency by coadministration of an AV nodal suppressing drug (eg, a beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist).Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone blockers may attenuate the myocardial fibrosis that provides a substrate for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure, but the role of these drugs in routine atrial fibrillation treatment has yet to be defined.Ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation For patients who do not respond to or cannot take rate-controlling medications, ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causesAV node may be done to cause complete heart block; insertion of a permanent pacemaker Cardiac Pacemakers The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.Treatment is directed at causes.Ablation of only one AV nodal pathway (AV node modification) reduces the number of atrial impulses reaching the ventricles and eliminates the need for a pacemaker, but this approach is considered less effective than complete ablation and is rarely used.Ablation procedures that accomplish electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins from the left atrium can prevent atrial fibrillation without causing AV block.In comparison to other ablation procedures, pulmonary vein isolation has a lower success rate (60 to 80%) and a higher complication rate (1 to 5%).Accordingly, this procedure is often reserved for the best candidates (eg, younger patients who have no significant structural heart disease, patients without other options such as those with medication-resistant AF, or patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure.Randomized clinical trials addressing the need for continued long-term oral anticoagulation after an apparently successful ablation procedure are underway.Prevention of thromboembolism Prevention of thromboembolism is an important goal in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score CHA2DS2-VASc Score and specific cardiac factors to guide thromboembolic therapy.Long-term measures to prevent thromboembolism are taken for certain patients with atrial fibrillation depending on their estimated risk of stroke versus risk of bleeding (eg, as per the and the tool).Conversion of atrial fibrillation with either an antiarrhythmic drug or with DC cardioversion conveys a higher risk for thromboembolic events.When a patient with atrial fibrillation who is not anticoagulated is to undergo cardioversion additional considerations are required.If urgent cardioversion is required because of hemodynamic compromise, cardioversion is done and anticoagulation is started as soon as is practical and continued for at least 4 weeks.If the onset of the current episode of atrial fibrillation is clearly within 48 hours, cardioversion may proceed without prior or subsequent anticoagulation in men with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 and in women with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (class IIb recommendation).If the onset of the current episode of atrial fibrillation is not clearly within 48 hours, the patient should be anticoagulated for 3 weeks before and at least 4 weeks after cardioversion regardless of the patient's predicted risk of a thromboembolic event (class I recommendation).Alternatively, therapeutic anticoagulation is started, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is done, and, if no left atrial or left atrial appendage clot is seen, cardioversion may be done, followed by at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation therapy (class IIa recommendation).Table The guidelines for antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation differ in different regions.The current guidelines in the United States are as follows: Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, mechanical artificial heart valve, and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of ≥ 2 in men and ≥ 3 in women (class of recommendation I) and may be considered for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of ≥ 1 in men and ≥ 2 in women (class of recommendation IIb).No antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 0 in men and 1 in women (class of recommendation IIa).Patients with atrial fibrillation and a mechanical heart valve(s) are treated with warfarin.Patients with atrial fibrillation and significant mitral stenosis are treated with warfarin.For patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are to be treated with an oral anticoagulant, a class I recommendation is given for warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.For patients eligible for anticoagulant therapy with either a vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, such as warfarin, or a non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, the non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants are preferred (class I recommendation).These general guidelines are altered in patients with more than moderate renal impairment.The left atrial appendage may be surgically ligated or closed with a transcatheter device when appropriate antithrombotic therapy is absolutely contraindicated.An individual patient's risk of bleeding may be estimated with any of a number of prognostic tools, of which the most commonly used is HAS-BLED .The HAS-BLED score serves best in identifying conditions that, if modified, reduce bleeding risk rather than in identifying patients with a higher risk of bleeding who should not receive anticoagulation.Table Key Points Atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm that may be episodic or continuous; paroxysms of tachycardia may occur.QRS complexes are typically narrow; a wide complex may occur with intraventricular conduction defects or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.Patients should have electrocardiography, echocardiography, and thyroid function testing.Heart rate is controlled typically to < 100 beats/minute at rest; first-line medications include beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem).Restoration of sinus rhythm is not as important as rate control and does not eliminate the need for anticoagulation but may help patients with continuing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise (eg, heart failure); synchronized cardioversion or medication can be used.Anticoagulation is usually necessary before cardioversion.Long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke is required for patients with risk factors for thromboembolism.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7185, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

You have a higher chance of having esophageal cancer if you: Use tobacco or drink alcohol Have HPV infection Genital Warts HPV is a virus that causes warts.There are many types of HPVHad head or neck cancer Had radiation therapy to your esophagus to treat other nearby cancers Had untreated reflux disease (called GERD Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD) GERD (acid reflux) is a disease caused by your stomach contents and stomach acid flowing back up your esophagus.Your esophagus is the tube that connects your throat to your stomachWhat are the symptoms of esophageal cancer? You may not notice symptoms right away.Early symptoms include: Having a hard time swallowing food, because your esophagus gets narrower as the cancer grows Weight loss Chest pain, which you may also feel in your back Later symptoms include: Having trouble swallowing liquids and saliva Hoarse voice Pain in your spine Hiccups Shortness of breath Eventually, the cancer blocks your esophagus, which stops you from swallowing and causes saliva to build up in your mouth.How can doctors tell if I have esophageal cancer? Doctors suspect esophageal cancer from your symptoms.To know for sure, they'll do tests, such as: Endoscopy Endoscope is an instrument doctors use to look inside your body.Endoscopes can also be used to do tests and treat diseasesBiopsy (taking out part of the tissue to look at under a microscope) Barium x-ray (x-rays taken after you swallow barium, which helps doctors see details in your digestive tract) CT (computed tomography) scan Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles.A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your bodyUltrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays)How do doctors treat esophageal cancer? If the cancer is small, doctors may be able to burn it or cut it out with surgery to try to cure you.Most of the time the cancer cannot be cured, so treatments for esophageal cancer help with symptoms such as pain and problems swallowing.Treatments include: Surgery for Cancer surgery is when doctors operate on you to cut out your cancerChemotherapy is a medicine that destroys cancer cells.Chemotherapy works by shutting down cell growthRadiation therapy Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses beams of radiation to destroy cancer cells and shrink cancer tumorsUsing a stent (a flexible metal mesh tube) to keep your esophagus open Burning the cancer with a laser to widen the opening Getting enough nutrition is important.If you can swallow, you may get special liquid nutrition shakes.If you can’t swallow, you may need to be fed through a tube in your belly.Having esophageal cancer can be scary and upsetting.Your doctor may offer you support to help you deal with your symptoms and emotions and plan for the end of your life, such as making a living will Advance Directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4117, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Percutaneous cannulation of the internal jugular vein uses anatomic landmarks to guide venipuncture and a Seldinger technique to thread a central venous catheter through the internal jugular vein and into the superior vena cava.Three approaches (central, anterior, and posterior) are used; the central approach is described here.An internal jugular central venous catheter (CVC) or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) Peripheral Vein Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheterCVC (which has a higher risk of bleeding and pneumothorax) or a femoral CVC (which has a higher risk of infection).Ultrasonographic guidance for placement of internal jugular lines increases the likelihood of successful cannulation and reduces the risk of complications.When ultrasonographic guidance and trained personnel are available, this method of placement is preferred.

cardiorespiratory insufficiency or increased intracranial or intraocular pressure (patients will be compromised by Trendelenburg [head down] positioning) History of prior catheterization of the intended central vein Uncooperative patient (should be sedated if necessary) Left bundle branch block (a guidewire or catheter in the right ventricle can induce complete heart block) * Therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, for pulmonary embolism) increases the risk of bleeding with internal jugular vein cannulation, but this must be balanced against the increased risk of thrombosis (eg, stroke) if anticoagulation is reversed.Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient.Complications of Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter Complications include Arterial puncture Hematoma Pneumothorax Damage to the vein Hemothorax Air embolism Catheter misplacement* Arrhythmias or atrial perforation, typically caused by guidewire or catheter Nerve damage Infection Thrombosis * Rare complications due to catheter misplacement include arterial catheterization, hydrothorax, hydromediastinum, and damage to the tricuspid valve.Guidewire or catheter embolism also rarely occurs.To reduce the risk of venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis, CVCs should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.Equipment for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Sterile procedure, barrier protection Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, alcohol) Large sterile drapes, towels Sterile head caps, masks, gowns, gloves Face shields Seldinger (catheter-over-guidewire) technique Cardiac monitor Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, about 5 mL) Small anesthetic needle (eg, 25 to 27 gauge, about 1 inch [3 cm] long) Large anesthetic/finder* needle (22 gauge, about 1.5 inches [4 cm] long) Introducer needle (eg, thin-walled, 18 or 16 gauge, with internally beveled hub, about 2.5 inches [6 cm] long) 3- and 5-mL syringes (use slip-tip syringes for the finder and introducer needles) Guidewire, J-tipped Scalpel (#11 blade) Dilator Central venous catheter (adult: 8 French or larger, minimum length for internal jugular catheter is 15 cm for right side, 20 cm for left side) Sterile gauze (eg, 4 × 4 inch [10 × 10 cm] squares) Sterile saline for flushing catheter port or ports Nonabsorbable nylon or silk suture (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) Chlorhexidine patch, transparent occlusive dressing * A finder needle is a thinner needle used for locating the vein before inserting the introducer needle.It is generally recommended for nonultrasound–guided internal jugular vein cannulation.Having an assistant or two is helpful.Additional Considerations Cannulation attempts sometimes fail.Do not exceed 2 or 3 attempts (which increases the risk of complications), and use new equipment with each attempt (ie, do not re-use needles, catheters, or other equipment because they may have become blocked with tissue or blood).During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood.If the internal jugular artery is errantly cannulated by either the tissue dilator or the CVC, leave the dilator or catheter in place and obtain surgical consultation for possible surgical removal.Relevant Anatomy for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation The anterior cervical triangle is bordered by the clavicle inferiorly and by the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle medially and laterally.The carotid artery is usually palpated near the lateral side of the sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid, and the internal jugular vein usually lies superficial and lateral (often minimally lateral) to the carotid artery.However, variant orientation of these vessels occurs regularly (in 9 to 19% of patients).The orientation of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein to each other also may change if the position of the patient’s head changes.Most commonly, the central approach to the internal jugular vein is used, which may decrease the chance of pleural or carotid arterial puncture.The introducer needle is inserted at about a 30 to 40° angle to the skin at the apex (superior angle) of the anterior cervical triangle, aiming toward the ipsilateral nipple.The right internal jugular vein is usually preferred over the left for cannulation because it has a larger diameter and affords a straighter path to the superior vena cava.Positioning for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Raise the bed to a comfortable height for you (ie, so you may stand straight while doing the procedure).Place the patient supine and in Trendelenburg position (bed tilted head down 15 to 20°) to distend the internal jugular vein and prevent air embolism.Turn the patient's head only slightly (or not at all) to the contralateral side to expose the internal jugular vein but not cause overlap with the carotid artery.Stand at the head of the bed.Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Do a preliminary inspection (nonsterile) to identify the anterior cervical triangle, palpate the carotid arterial pulse, and (optionally) mark the lateral border of the carotid.Attach the cardiac monitor to the patient and turn it on.Prepare the equipment Place sterile equipment on sterilely covered equipment trays.Dress in sterile garb and use barrier protection.Draw the local anesthetic into a syringe.Attach a finder needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.Attach the introducer needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.Align the bevel of the needle with the volume markings on the syringe.Pre-flush all lines of the CVC with 3 to 5 mL of sterile saline and then close the ports with caps or syringes.When flushing a central line, use a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and do not push too hard to avoid rupturing the line.Prepare the sterile field Swab a broad area of skin with antiseptic solution, encompassing the side of the neck, clavicle, and anterior chest to below the ipsilateral nipple.Allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute.Place sterile towels around the site, keeping the ipsilateral nipple exposed.Place large sterile drapes (eg, a full-body drape) to establish a large sterile field.Establish the needle insertion path (internal jugular vein, central approach) Gently palpate the carotid arterial pulse using 3 fingers to appreciate the course of the artery.Palpate gently so as not to compress the adjacent internal jugular vein (a compressed venous lumen is difficult to cannulate).The needle insertion path: Insert procedural needles (local anesthetic, finder, and introducer needles) into the apical area (superior angle) of the anterior cervical triangle, just lateral to the carotid pulse, at a 30 to 40° angle into the skin, aiming toward the ipsilateral nipple.Maintain carotid artery palpation during needle insertions and keep the needle lateral to the artery to avoid impaling the artery.Anesthetize the cannulation site Place a wheal of anesthetic at the needle entry site and then inject anesthetic into the skin and soft tissues along the anticipated needle insertion path.Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance to identify intravascular placement and prevent an intravascular injection.If blood returns into the syringe, stop advancing, hold the syringe in place, and now regard this needle as a finder needle.Insert the finder needle Insert the finder needle along the needle insertion path.Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance the needle.Stop advancing when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe (you may feel the needle pop through the wall as it enters the lumen).Hold the syringe motionless in this spot.Even a slight movement may displace the needle tip from the vein.If no flash of blood appears in the barrel after about 3 to 5 cm of insertion, withdraw the needle slowly.If the needle had initially passed completely through the vein, a flash of blood may now appear as you withdraw the needle tip back into the lumen.If a flash still does not appear, withdraw the needle almost to the skin surface, change direction (usually slightly medially), and try again to advance the needle into the vein.Do not change the direction of the needle while it is fully inserted.Assess the blood return Continue to hold the syringe motionless.Securely grasp the needle hub and also hold it motionless.Remove the syringe from the needle hub and briefly let blood flow out to confirm that the blood is venous (ie, dark red and flowing but not pulsatile).Then immediately cover the hub with your thumb to stop the blood flow and prevent air embolism.However, if the blood is bright red and pulsatile (arterial), terminate the procedure.Remove the needle and use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.Percutaneous Cannulation of the Internal Jugular Vein VIDEO Insert the introducer needle, using the finder needle as a guide Hold the introducer syringe with the needle bevel facing up.Use one of two insertion methods: Either remove the finder needle and immediately insert the introducer needle along the same path, or keep the finder needle in place and insert the introducer needle underneath and roughly parallel to it (at a slightly shallower angle to the skin).Stop advancing the introducer needle when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe.Hold the syringe motionless in this spot.If the finder needle has not been removed, remove it now.Insert the guidewire Carefully rotate the introducer syringe such that the bevel of the needle now faces medially (ie, toward the heart and away from the subclavian vein).Insert the J-curved end of the guidewire into the introducer needle, with the J curve facing medially (ie, in the same direction as the needle bevel).Advance the guidewire through the needle and into the vein.Do not force the wire; it should slide smoothly.Advance the wire 10 to 15 cm for a right-sided internal jugular insertion, 15 to 20 cm for a left-sided insertion, or until ectopic heartbeats occur (withdraw from this point until ectopy stops).If you feel any resistance as you advance the guidewire, stop advancing it.Try to gently withdraw the wire slightly, rotate it slightly, and then readvance it, or try to gently withdraw the wire entirely, reestablish the needle tip within the vein (confirmed by venous blood return), and then reinsert the wire.However, if you feel any resistance as you withdraw the wire, terminate the procedure and withdraw the needle and guidewire together as a unit (to prevent the needle tip from shearing through the guidewire within the patient).Then use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.Once the guidewire has been inserted, continue to hold it securely in place with one hand and maintain control of it throughout the remainder of the procedure.Remove the introducer needle (after successful guidewire insertion) First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle and pull the needle from the skin.Then, securely hold the guidewire at the skin surface and slide the needle down the remaining length of the guidewire to remove the needle.Widen the insertion tract Extend the skin insertion site: Using the scalpel, make a small stab incision (about 4 mm) into the skin insertion site, avoiding contact with the guidewire, to enlarge the site and allow it to accommodate the larger diameters of the tissue dilator and the catheter.Advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire: First, grasp the guidewire at the skin and slide the dilator down the length of the wire to the skin.Then grasp the wire just distal to the dilator, hold the dilator near the skin surface, and use a corkscrew motion as needed to stepwise insert the entire length of the dilator.Maintain your grasp on the wire at all times during the insertion.Remove the dilator: First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the dilator and pull the dilator from the skin.When the guidewire is visible at the skin surface, completely remove the dilator by sliding it down the remaining length of the guidewire.Maintain your grasp on the guidewire at the skin surface.Place the catheter Advance the catheter over the guidewire to the skin surface: Hold the guidewire fixed at the skin surface, thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire, and slide the catheter down to the skin surface.The distal end of the guidewire should now be protruding from the port hub.If the distal end of the guidewire is not protruding from the port hub, inch the guidewire outward from the skin surface while holding the catheter tip close to the skin surface until the guidewire protrudes.Continue to advance the catheter into the vein: Grasp and control the guidewire where it protrudes from the hub.Hold the catheter near its tip and insert the tip through the skin.Then, in increments of several centimeters and using a corkscrew motion as necessary, stepwise advance the internal jugular catheter.If ectopic heartbeats occur, slowly withdraw the catheter until ectopy stops.Maintain your grasp on both the guidewire and the catheter.Remove the guidewire: Withdraw the guidewire while holding the catheter securely in place at the skin surface.Flush each catheter port with saline: First, draw any air from the line and confirm venous blood flow into the hub.Then, using a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and nonexcessive force, push 20 mL of saline into the line to clear it.Dress the site If the patient is awake or minimally sedated, use 1% lidocaine to numb the skin at the planned suture locations.Place a chlorhexidine-impregnated disk on the skin at the catheter insertion point.Suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter.To prevent pulling on the insertion site, suture the catheter at a second site so that a curved or looped segment of catheter lies between the two sites.Apply a sterile occlusive dressing.Transparent membrane dressings are commonly used.Aftercare for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Do a chest x-ray to confirm that the tip of a jugular (or subclavian) CVC lies in the superior vena cava near its junction with the right atrium (the catheter can be advanced or retracted if not in the appropriate position) and to confirm that pneumothorax has not occurred.Warnings and Common Errors The tip of a CVC must never lie in the right atrium because the atrium is thin-walled and easily perforated.Cardiac ectopy may be induced by a guidewire or catheter in the right atrium or ventricle.Never lose grasp of the guidewire.During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood.To help prevent air embolism, CVCs should be inserted (and removed) with the vascular cannulation site positioned dependant to the heart.Tips and Tricks for Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation A thin (finder, scout) needle often is used to first find the internal jugular vein (before inserting the larger introducer needle) so that less bleeding and hematoma result if the needle aberrantly impales the carotid artery.(Ultrasound guidance eliminates the need for a finder needle.) The orientation of the carotid artery and internal jugular vein to each other may change if the position of the patient’s head changes; thus, to avoid impaling the artery, you should gently palpate the carotid pulse during the needle insertions included in this procedure.The size of the internal jugular vein varies with respiration (maximum diameter in patients not intubated occurs just prior to inspiration [prior to expiration in intubated patients]) and is increased by the Trendelenburg position, the Valsalva maneuver, humming, and external abdominal compression.To increase your chance of successful internal jugular cannulation, advance the introducer at moments of increased jugular diameter.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8027, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Dysphagia is difficulty swallowing.The condition results from impeded transport of liquids, solids, or both from the pharynx to the stomach.Dysphagia should not be confused with globus sensation Lump in Throat Lump in the throat is the sensation of a lump or mass in the throat, unrelated to swallowing, when no mass is present. The swallowing apparatus consists of the pharynx, upper esophageal (cricopharyngeal) sphincter, the body of the esophagus, and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).The upper third of the esophagus and the structures proximal to it are composed of skeletal muscle; the distal esophagus and LES are composed of smooth muscle.These components work as an integrated system that transports material from the mouth to the stomach and prevents its reflux into the esophagus.Physical obstruction or disorders that interfere with motor function (esophageal motility disorders Esophageal Motility Disorders Esophageal motility disorders involve dysfunction of the esophagus that causes symptoms such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain.Etiology of Dysphagia is classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal, depending on where it occurs.Oropharyngeal dysphagia Oropharyngeal dysphagia is difficulty emptying material from the oropharynx into the esophagus; it results from abnormal function proximal to the esophagus.Patients complain of difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and tracheal aspiration followed by coughing.Most often, oropharyngeal dysphagia occurs in patients with neurologic conditions or muscular disorders that affect skeletal muscles.Table Some Causes of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia Mechanism Examples Neurologic Stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficitMultiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cordBulbar poliomyelitis Giant cell arteritis Giant Cell Arteritis Giant cell arteritis involves predominantly the thoracic aorta, large arteries emerging from the aorta in the neck, and extracranial branches of the carotid arteriesMuscular Myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptorsCricopharyngeal incoordination Esophageal dysphagia Esophageal dysphagia is difficulty passing food down the esophagus.It results from either a motility disorder or a mechanical obstruction.Table Some Causes of Esophageal Dysphagia Mechanism Examples Motility disorder Achalasia is a neurogenic esophageal motility disorder characterized by impaired esophageal peristalsis and a lack of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation during swallowingMechanical obstruction Peptic stricture Esophageal cancer Esophageal Cancer The most common malignant tumor in the proximal two thirds of the esophagus is squamous cell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma is the most common in the distal one thirdEsophageal rings Lower Esophageal Ring A lower esophageal ring is a 2- to 4-mm mucosal stricture that causes a ringlike narrowing of the distal esophagus at the squamocolumnar junction that often causes dysphagiaEsophageal webs Esophageal Web An esophageal web is a thin mucosal membrane that grows across the lumen of the upper esophagus and may cause dysphagia.Radiation stricture Extrinsic compression (eg, caused by an enlarged left atrium, an aortic aneurysm, an aberrant subclavian artery [termed dysphagia lusoria Dysphagia Lusoria Dysphagia lusoria is caused by compression of the esophagus from any of several congenital vascular abnormalities.Caustic ingestion Complications Oropharyngeal dysphagia can lead to tracheal aspiration of ingested material, oral secretions, or both.Aspiration can cause acute pneumonia Aspiration Pneumonitis and Pneumonia Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are caused by inhaling toxic and/or irritant substances, most commonly large volumes of upper airway secretions or gastric contents, into the lungs.Prolonged dysphagia often leads to inadequate nutrition and weight loss.Esophageal dysphagia can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, tracheal aspiration of ingested material, and in severe cases food impaction.Food impaction puts patients at risk of spontaneous esophageal perforation, which can lead to sepsis and even death.Evaluation of Dysphagia History of present illness begins with duration of symptoms and acuity of onset.Patients should describe what substances cause difficulty and where they feel the disturbance is located.Specific concerns include whether patients have difficulty swallowing solids, liquids, or both; whether food comes out their nose; whether they drool or have food spill from their mouth; whether they have had food impaction; and whether they cough or choke while eating.Review of symptoms should focus on symptoms suggestive of neuromuscular, gastrointestinal (GI), and connective tissue disorders and on the presence of complications.Important neuromuscular symptoms include weakness and easy fatigability, gait or balance disturbance, tremor, and difficulty speaking.Important GI symptoms include heartburn or other chest discomfort suggestive of reflux.Symptoms of connective tissue disorders include muscle and joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon, and skin changes (eg, rash, swelling, thickening).Past medical history should ascertain known diseases that may cause dysphagia .Physical examination focuses on findings suggestive of neuromuscular, GI, and connective tissue disorders and on the presence of complications.General examination should evaluate nutritional status (including body weight).A complete neurologic examination is essential, with attention to any resting tremor, the cranial nerves (note the gag reflex may normally be absent; this absence is thus not a good marker of swallowing dysfunction), and muscle strength.Patients who describe easy fatigability should be observed performing a repetitive action (eg, blinking, counting aloud) for a rapid decrement in performance suggestive of myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is characterized by episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by autoantibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors.The patient’s gait should be observed, and balance should be tested.Skin is examined for rash and thickening or texture changes, particularly on the fingertips.Muscles are inspected for wasting and fasciculations and are palpated for tenderness.The neck is evaluated for thyromegaly or other mass.Red flags Any dysphagia is of concern, but certain findings are more urgent: Symptoms of complete obstruction (eg, drooling, inability to swallow anything) Dysphagia resulting in weight loss New focal neurologic deficit, particularly any objective weakness Recurrent aspiration pneumonia Interpretation of findings Dysphagia that occurs in conjunction with an acute neurologic event is likely the result of that event; new dysphagia in a patient with a stable, long-standing neurologic disorder may have another etiology.Dysphagia for solids alone suggests mechanical obstruction; however, a problem with both solids and liquids is nonspecific.Drooling and spilling food from the mouth while eating or nasal regurgitation suggests an oropharyngeal disorder.Regurgitation of a small amount of food on lateral compression of the neck is virtually diagnostic of pharyngeal diverticulum.Patients who complain of difficulty getting food to leave the mouth or of food sticking in the lower esophagus are usually correct about the condition’s location; the sensation of dysphagia in the upper esophagus is less specific.Many findings suggest specific disorders  but are of varying sensitivity and specificity and thus do not rule in or out a given cause; however, they can guide testing.Table Testing Upper endoscopy Barium swallow Patients with dysphagia should always have upper endoscopy, which is extremely important to rule out cancer.During endoscopy, esophageal biopsies should also be done to look for eosinophilic esophagitis.A barium swallow (with a solid bolus, usually a marshmallow or tablet) can be done if the patient is unable to undergo an upper endoscopy, or if upper endoscopy with biopsy does not identify a cause.If the barium swallow is negative and the upper endoscopy is normal, esophageal motility studies should be done.Other tests for specific causes are done as suggested by findings.Impedance planimetry Impedance Planimetry .This procedure allows measurements of esophageal distensibility and may be helpful in the evaluation of patients with dysphagia.Treatment of Dysphagia Treatment of dysphagia is directed at the specific cause.If complete obstruction occurs, emergent upper endoscopy is essential.If a stricture, ring, or web is found, careful endoscopic dilation is done.Pending resolution, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia may benefit from evaluation by a rehabilitation specialist.Sometimes patients benefit from changing head position while eating, retraining the swallowing muscles, doing exercises that improve the ability to accommodate a food bolus in the oral cavity, or doing strength and coordination exercises for the tongue.Patients with severe dysphagia and recurrent aspiration may require a gastrostomy tube.Geriatrics Essentials: Dysphagia Chewing, swallowing, tasting, and communicating require intact, coordinated neuromuscular function in the mouth, face, and neck.Oral motor function in particular declines measurably with aging, even in healthy people.Decline in function may have many manifestations: Reduction in masticatory muscle strength and coordination is common, especially among patients with partial or complete dentures, and may lead to a tendency to swallow larger food particles, which can increase the risk of choking or aspiration.Drooping of the lower face and lips caused by decreased circumoral muscle tone and, in edentulous people, reduced bone support, is an aesthetic concern and can lead to drooling, spilling of food and liquids, and difficulty closing the lips while eating, sleeping, or resting.Sialorrhea (saliva leakage) is often the first symptom.Swallowing difficulties increase.It takes longer to move food from mouth to oropharynx, which increases the likelihood of aspirationOverview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficitMultiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cord.Iatrogenic causes also contribute.Drugs (eg, anticholinergics, diuretics), radiation therapy to the head and neck, and chemotherapy can greatly impair saliva production.Hyposalivation is a major cause of delayed and impaired swallowing.Oral motor dysfunction is best managed with a multidisciplinary approach.Coordinated referrals to specialists in prosthetic dentistry, rehabilitative medicine, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and gastroenterology may be needed.Key Points All patients complaining of dysphagia should undergo upper endoscopy to rule out cancer.If the upper endoscopy does not reveal structural causes for symptoms, biopsies should be obtained to rule out eosinophilic esophagitis.Treatment of dysphagia is geared toward the cause.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8355, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

Doctors will ask you questions about your symptoms and health.They’ll do an exam, including a breast exam Breast examination Breast disorders may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).Most are noncancerous and not life threatening.Often, they do not require treatment.To tell if your breast lump is cancer, doctors often do more tests, such as: Ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays)Mammogram Mammography Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast become abnormal and divide uncontrollablyDepending on your symptoms and the results of these tests, your doctor may: Put a needle in the lump and take out fluid or a sample of tissue Make a cut in the skin to take out part of the lump and look at it under a microscope (biopsy) How do doctors treat breast lumps? If your breast lumps are fibrocystic changes Fibrocystic Changes of the Breast Fibrocystic changes are a set of breast symptoms that include pain, cysts, and general lumpiness in your breasts.The word fibrocystic comes from the terms fibrous tissue and cystDrain your cyst with a needle Tell you to wear a soft, supportive bra, such as a sports bra Tell you to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lessen pain If your breast lumps are fibroadenomas, doctors may: Do surgery to remove them Leave them alone but schedule check-ups to look for any changes If your breast lumps are breast cancer Breast Cancer is when cells grow abnormally.Cancer cells don't look or work like normal cells and keep multiplying out of control.Cancer cells can invade and destroy nearby healthy tissue.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3461, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}

{"text": "【0】 Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Exact cause is unknown but probably involves heredity, changes in neurotransmitter levels, altered neuroendocrine function, and psychosocial factors.Diagnosis is based on history.Treatment usually consists of drugs, psychotherapy, or both and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy or rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The term depression is often used to refer to any of several depressive disorders.Some are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) by specific symptoms: Major depressive disorder Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activitiesPersistent depressive disorder Persistent depressive disorder Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activitiesOther specified or unspecified depressive disorder Other depressive disorder Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activitiesOthers are classified by etiology: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activitiesDepressive disorder due to another medical condition Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorders occur at any age but typically develop during the mid teens, 20s, or 30s .In primary care settings, as many as 30% of patients report depressive symptoms, but < 10% have major depression.Overview of Depression VIDEO Demoralization and grief The term depression is often used to describe the low or discouraged mood that results from disappointments (eg, financial calamity, natural disaster, serious illness) or losses (eg, death of a loved one).However, better terms for such moods are demoralization and grief.The negative feelings of demoralization and grief, unlike those of depression, do the following: Occur in waves that tend to be tied to thoughts or reminders of the inciting event Resolve when circumstances or events improve May be interspersed with periods of positive emotion and humor Are not accompanied by pervasive feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing The low mood usually lasts days rather than weeks or months, and suicidal thoughts and prolonged loss of function are much less likely.However, events and stressors that cause demoralization and grief can also precipitate a major depressive episode Major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.In a small but substantial number of patients, grief may become persistent and disabling.This condition is termed prolonged grief disorder Prolonged grief disorder Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Etiology of Depressive Disorders Exact cause of depressive disorders is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors contribute.Heredity accounts for about half of the etiology (less so in late-onset depression).Thus, depression is more common among 1st-degree relatives of depressed patients, and concordance between identical twins is high.Also, genetic factors probably influence the development of depressive responses to adverse events.Other theories focus on changes in neurotransmitter levels, including abnormal regulation of cholinergic, catecholaminergic (noradrenergic or dopaminergic), glutamatergic, and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine) neurotransmission (1 Etiology reference Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Neuroendocrine dysregulation may be a factor, with particular emphasis on 3 axes: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid, and hypothalamic-pituitary-growth hormone.Psychosocial factors also seem to be involved.Major life stresses, especially separations and losses, commonly precede episodes of major depression; however, such events do not usually cause lasting, severe depression except in people predisposed to a mood disorder.People who have had an episode of major depression are at higher risk of subsequent episodes.People who are less resilient and/or who have anxious tendencies may be more likely to develop a depressive disorder.Such people often do not develop the social skills to adjust to life pressures.The presence of other mental disorders increases risks for major depressive disorder.Women are at higher risk, but no theory explains why.Possible factors include the following: Greater exposure to or heightened response to daily stresses Higher levels of monoamine oxidase (the enzyme that degrades neurotransmitters considered important for mood) Higher rates of thyroid dysfunction Endocrine changes that occur with menstruation and at menopause In peripartum-onset depression, symptoms develop during pregnancy or within 4 weeks after delivery (postpartum depression Postpartum Depression Postpartum depression is depressive symptoms that last > 2 weeks after delivery and meet criteria for major depression.Postpartum depression occurs in 10 to 15% of women after delivery.In seasonal affective disorder, symptoms develop in a seasonal pattern, typically during autumn or winter; the disorder tends to occur in climates with long or severe winters.Depressive symptoms or disorders may accompany various physical disorders, including thyroid disorders Overview of Thyroid Function The thyroid gland, located in the anterior neck just below the cricoid cartilage, consists of 2 lobes connected by an isthmusOverview of Intracranial Tumors Intracranial tumors may involve the brain or other structures (eg, cranial nerves, meninges)Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficitMultiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by disseminated patches of demyelination in the brain and spinal cordSome Causes of Symptoms of Depression and Mania Some Causes of Symptoms of Depression and Mania* ).Certain drugs, such as corticosteroids, some beta-blockers, interferon, and reserpine, can also result in depressive disorders.Abuse of some recreational drugs (eg, alcohol Toxicity and Withdrawal Alcohol (ethanol) is a central nervous system depressant.Large amounts consumed rapidly can cause respiratory depression, coma, and death.Toxic effects or withdrawal of drugs may cause transient depressive symptoms.Symptoms and Signs of Depressive Disorders Depression causes cognitive, psychomotor, and other types of dysfunction (eg, poor concentration, fatigue, loss of sexual desire, loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities that were previously enjoyed, sleep disturbances), as well as a depressed mood.People with a depressive disorder frequently have thoughts of suicide Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Other mental symptoms or disorders (eg, anxiety Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxietyPanic Attacks and Panic Disorder A panic attack is the sudden onset of a discrete, brief period of intense discomfort, anxiety, or fear accompanied by somatic and/or cognitive symptoms.Patients with all forms of depression are more likely to abuse alcohol or other recreational drugs in an attempt to self-treat sleep disturbances or anxiety symptoms; however, depression is a less common cause of alcoholic use disorder and other substance use disorders than was once thought.Patients are also more likely to become heavy smokers and to neglect their health, increasing the risk of development or progression of other disorders (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is airflow limitation caused by an inflammatory response to inhaled toxins, often cigarette smokeCOPD]).Depression may reduce protective immune responses.Depression increases risk of cardiovascular disorders, myocardial infarctions Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) Acute myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from acute obstruction of a coronary arteryMIs), and stroke Overview of Stroke Strokes are a heterogeneous group of disorders involving sudden, focal interruption of cerebral blood flow that causes neurologic deficit.Major depression (unipolar disorder) Patients may appear miserable, with tearful eyes, furrowed brows, down-turned corners of the mouth, slumped posture, poor eye contact, lack of facial expression, little body movement, and speech changes (eg, soft voice, lack of prosody, use of monosyllabic words).In some patients, depressed mood is so deep that tears dry up; they report that they are unable to experience usual emotions and feel that the world has become colorless and lifeless.Nutrition may be severely impaired, requiring immediate intervention.Some depressed patients neglect personal hygiene or even their children, other loved ones, or pets.For diagnosis of major depression, ≥ 5 of the following must have been present nearly every day during the same 2-week period, and one of them must be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure: Depressed mood most of the day Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities for most of the day Significant (> 5%) weight gain or loss or decreased or increased appetite Insomnia (often sleep-maintenance insomnia) or hypersomnia Psychomotor agitation or retardation observed by others (not self-reported) Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, a suicide attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide Persistent depressive disorder Depressive symptoms that persist for ≥ 2 years without remission are classified as persistent depressive disorder (PDD), a category that consolidates disorders formerly termed chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.Symptoms typically begin insidiously during adolescence and may persist for many years or decades.The number of symptoms often fluctuates above and below the threshold for major depressive episode.Affected patients may be habitually gloomy, pessimistic, humorless, passive, lethargic, introverted, hypercritical of self and others, and complaining.Patients with PDD are also more likely to have underlying anxiety disorders Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxietySubstance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its useOverview of Personality Disorders Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment.For diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, patients must have had a depressed mood for most of the day for more days than not for ≥ 2 years plus ≥ 2 of the following: Poor appetite or overeating Insomnia or hypersomnia Low energy or fatigue Low self-esteem Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions Feelings of hopelessness Premenstrual dysphoric disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder involves mood and anxiety symptoms that are clearly related to the menstrual cycle, with onset during the premenstrual phase and a symptom-free interval after menstruation.Symptoms must be present during most menstrual cycles during the past year.The disorder may begin any time after menarche; it may worsen as menopause approaches but ceases after menopause.Prevalence is estimated at 2 to 6% of menstruating women in a given 12-month interval.For diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, patients must have ≥ 5 symptoms during the week before menstruation.Symptoms must begin to remit within a few days after onset of menses and become minimal or absent in the week after menstruation.Symptoms must include ≥ 1 of the following: Marked mood swings (eg, suddenly feeling sad or tearful) Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, or an on-edge feeling In addition, ≥ 1 of the following must be present: Decreased interest in usual activities Difficulty concentrating Low energy or fatigue Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia Feeling overwhelmed or out of control Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a feeling of being bloated, and weight gain Prolonged grief disorder Prolonged grief is persistent sadness following the loss of a loved one.It is distinct from depression in that the sadness relates to the specific loss rather than the more general feelings of failure associated with depression.In contrast to normal grief this condition may be highly disabling and require therapy specifically designed for prolonged grief disorder.Prolonged grief is considered present when the grief response (typified by persistent longing or yearning and/or preoccupation with the deceased) lasts a year or longer and is persistent, pervasive, and exceeding cultural norms.It also must be accompanied by ≥ 3 of the following for the last month to a degree that causes distress or disability: Disbelief Intense emotional pain Feeling of identity confusion Avoidance of reminders of the loss Feelings of numbness Intense loneliness Feelings of meaninglessness Difficulty engaging in ongoing life Some useful screening tools include the Inventory of Complicated Grief and the Brief Grief Questionnaire.Other depressive disorder Clusters of symptoms with characteristics of a depressive disorder that do not meet the full criteria for other depressive disorders but that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning are classified as other depressive (specified or unspecified) disorder.Included are recurrent periods of dysphoria with ≥ 4 other depressive symptoms that last < 2 weeks in people who have never met criteria for another mood disorder (eg, recurrent brief depression) and depressive periods that last longer but that include insufficient symptoms for diagnosis of another depressive disorder.Specifiers Major depression and persistent depressive disorder may include one or more specifiers that describe additional manifestations during a depressive episode: Anxious distress: Patients feel tense and unusually restless; they have difficulty concentrating because they worry or fear that something awful may happen, or they feel that they may lose control of themselves.Mixed features: Patients also have ≥ 3 manic or hypomanic symptoms (eg, elevated mood, grandiosity, greater talkativeness than usual, flight of ideas, decreased sleep).Patients who have this type of depression are at increased risk of developing bipolar disorder Bipolar Disorders Bipolar disorders are characterized by episodes of mania and depression, which may alternate, although many patients have a predominance of one or the other.Melancholic: Patients have lost pleasure in nearly all activities or do not respond to usually pleasurable stimuli.They may be despondent and despairing, feel excessive or inappropriate guilt, or have early morning awakenings, marked psychomotor retardation or agitation, and significant anorexia or weight loss.Atypical: Patients' mood temporarily brightens in response to positive events (eg, a visit from children).They also have ≥ 2 of the following: overreaction to perceived criticism or rejection, feelings of leaden paralysis (a heavy or weighted-down feeling, usually in the extremities), weight gain or increased appetite, and hypersomnia.Psychotic: Patients have delusions and/or hallucinations.Delusions often involve having committed unpardonable sins or crimes, harboring incurable or shameful disorders, or being persecuted.Hallucinations may be auditory (eg, hearing accusatory or condemning voices) or visual.If only voices are described, careful consideration should be given to whether the voices represent true hallucinations.Catatonic: Patients have severe psychomotor retardation, engage in excessive purposeless activity, and/or withdraw; some patients grimace and mimic speech (echolalia) or movement (echopraxia).Peripartum onset: Onset is during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks after delivery.Psychotic features may be present; infanticide is often associated with psychotic episodes involving command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed.Seasonal pattern: Episodes occur at a particular time of year, most often fall or winter.Diagnosis of Depressive Disorders Clinical criteria (DSM-5) Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, and folate levels to rule out physical disorders that can cause depression Diagnosis of depressive disorders is based on identification of the symptoms and signs and the clinical criteria described above.Specific closed-ended questions help determine whether patients have the symptoms required by DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis of major depression.To help differentiate depressive disorders from ordinary mood variations, there must be significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.Severity is determined by the degree of pain and disability (physical, social, occupational) and by duration of symptoms.A physician should gently but directly ask patients about any thoughts and plans to harm themselves or others, any previous threats of and/or attempts at suicide Suicidal Behavior Suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.Psychosis and catatonia indicate severe depression.Melancholic features indicate severe or moderate depression.Coexisting physical conditions, substance use disorders Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its useOverview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.Differential diagnosis Depressive disorders must be distinguished from demoralization and grief.Other mental disorders (eg, anxiety disorders Overview of Anxiety Disorders Everyone periodically experiences fear and anxiety.Sometimes more than one disorder is present.Major depression (unipolar disorder) must be distinguished from bipolar disorder Bipolar Disorders Bipolar disorders are characterized by episodes of mania and depression, which may alternate, although many patients have a predominance of one or the other.In older patients, depression can manifest as dementia of depression (formerly called pseudodementia), which causes many of the symptoms and signs of dementia is chronic, global, usually irreversible deterioration of cognition.Diagnosis is clinical; laboratory and imaging tests are usually used to identify treatable causes.However, early dementia may cause depression.In general, when the diagnosis is uncertain, treatment of a depressive disorder should be tried.Differentiating chronic depressive disorders, such as dysthymia, from substance use disorders Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use.Physical disorders must also be excluded as a cause of depressive symptoms.Hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone deficiency.Symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain.Signs may include a typical facial appearance, hoarse slow speech, and dry skin.A thorough neurologic examination Introduction to the Neurologic Examination The neurologic examination begins with careful observation of the patient entering the examination area and continues during history taking.Screening Several brief questionnaires are available for screening for depression.They help elicit some depressive symptoms but cannot be used alone for diagnosis.However, many of these tools are useful in identifying at-risk people who need more detailed evaluation.Some of the more widely used screening tools include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).Testing No laboratory findings are pathognomonic for depressive disorders.However, laboratory testing is necessary to exclude physical conditions that can cause depression .Tests include complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and routine electrolyte, vitamin B12, and folate levels and, in older men, testosterone levels.Testing for illicit drug use is sometimes appropriate Symptoms may remit spontaneously, particularly when they are mild or of short duration.Mild depression may be treated with general support and psychotherapy.Moderate to severe depression is treated with drugs, psychotherapy, or both and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Some patients require a combination of drugs.Improvement may not be apparent until after 1 to 4 weeks of drug treatment.Depression, especially in patients who have had > 1 episode, is likely to recur; therefore, severe cases often warrant long-term maintenance drug therapy.Most people with depression are treated as outpatients.Patients with significant suicidal ideation, particularly when family support is lacking, require hospitalization, as do those with psychotic symptoms or physical debilitation.In patients with substance use disorders Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use.Antidepressant treatment is much less likely to be effective while substance use continues.If a physical disorder or drug toxicity could be the cause, treatment is directed first at the underlying disorder.However, if the diagnosis is in doubt or if symptoms are disabling or include suicidal ideation or hopelessness, a therapeutic trial with an antidepressant or a mood-stabilizing drug may help.Prolonged grief disorder may benefit from psychotherapy specifically tailored to this disorder.Initial support Until definite improvement begins, a physician may need to see patients weekly or biweekly to provide support and education and to monitor progress.Telephone calls may supplement office visits.Patients and loved ones may be worried or embarrassed about the idea of having a mental disorder.The physician can help by explaining that depression is a serious medical disorder caused by biologic disturbances and requires specific treatment and that the prognosis with treatment is good.Patients and loved ones should be reassured that depression does not reflect a character flaw (eg, laziness, weakness).Telling patients that the path to recovery often fluctuates helps them put feelings of hopelessness in perspective and improves adherence.Encouraging patients to gradually increase simple activities (eg, taking walks, exercising regularly) and social interactions must be balanced with acknowledging their desire to avoid activities.The physician can suggest that patients avoid self-blame and explain that dark thoughts are part of the disorder and will go away.Psychotherapy Numerous controlled trials have shown that psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, is effective in patients with major depressive disorder, both to treat acute symptoms and to decrease the likelihood of relapse.Patients with mild depression tend to have better outcomes than those with more severe depression, but the magnitude of improvement is greater in those with more severe depression.Otherwise, SSRIs are often the initial drugs of choice.Although the different SSRIs are equally effective for typical cases, certain properties of the drugs make them more or less appropriate for certain patients .Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) ECT involves the electrical induction of a seizure under controlled conditions.Its mechanism of action is uncertain but the production of seizure activity appears to be integral to its antidepressant effects.Modern ECT, delivered under heavy sedation/general anesthesia, is typically well tolerated but confusion and memory impairment may occur acutely.Much of this improves and is resolved by 6 months following a course of ECT, but retrograde amnesia may persist for the long term.This is particularly so for memories from the several months preceding ECT.Patients with baseline cognitive deficits, those receiving bilateral treatments, older patients, and patients receiving lithium are at higher risk for memory impairment and confusion.The following are often treated with ECT if drugs are ineffective: Severe suicidal depression with agitation or psychomotor retardation Delusional depression during pregnancy Patients who have stopped eating may need ECT to prevent death.ECT is particularly effective for psychotic depression.Response to 6 to 10 ECT treatments is usually dramatic and may be lifesaving.Relapse after ECT is common, and drug therapy is often maintained after ECT is stopped.Phototherapy is best known for its effects on seasonal depression but appears to be equally effective for nonseasonal depression.Treatment can be provided at home with a special light unit that provides 2500 to 10,000 lux at a distance of 30 to 60 cm that patients look at for 30 to 60 minutes/day (longer with a less intense light source).In patients who go to sleep late at night and rise late in the morning, phototherapy is most effective in the morning, sometimes supplemented with 5 to 10 minutes of exposure between 3 PM and 7 PM.For patients who go to sleep and rise early, phototherapy is most effective between 3 PM and 7 PM.Other therapies Psychostimulants (eg, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate) are sometimes used, often with antidepressants.A number of controlled trials support their use in depressive disorders (1 Treatment references Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Medicinal herbs are used by some patients.St.John’s wort St.John’s Wort The flowers of St.John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (SJW) contain its biologically active ingredients, hypericin and hyperforin.St.John’s wort may interact with other antidepressants and other drugs.Some placebo-controlled studies of omega-3 supplementation, used as augmentation or as monotherapy, have suggested that eicosapentaenoic acid 1 to 2 g once a day has useful antidepressant effects.Vagus nerve stimulation involves intermittently stimulating the vagus nerve via an implanted pulse generator.It may be useful for depression refractory to other treatments but usually takes 3 to 6 months to be effective.The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder has substantial support from controlled trials.Low-frequency rTMS may be applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC), and high-frequency rTMS can be applied to the left DLPC.The most common adverse effects are headaches and scalp discomfort; both occur more often when high-frequency rather than low-frequency rTMS is used.Deep brain stimulation using implanted electrodes that target the subgenual cingulate or the anterior ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum has had promising results in uncontrolled case series (2 Treatment references Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.Controlled trials are underway.Support groups (eg, the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance [DBSA] ) can help patients by providing a forum to share their common experiences and feelings.Key Points Depression is a common disorder that involves depressed mood and/or near-complete loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were previously enjoyed; somatic (eg, weight change, sleep disturbance) and cognitive manifestations (eg, difficulty concentrating) are common.Depression may markedly impair the ability to function at work and to interact socially; risk of suicide is significant.Sometimes depressive symptoms are caused by physical disorders (eg, thyroid or adrenal gland disorders, benign or malignant brain tumors, stroke, AIDS, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis) or use of certain drugs (eg, corticosteroids, some beta-blockers, interferon, some recreational drugs).Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria; physical disorders must be ruled out by clinical evaluation and selected testing (eg, CBC; electrolyte, TSH, B12 and folate levels).Treatment involves psychotherapy and usually drugs; SSRIs are usually tried first, and if they are ineffective, other drugs that affect serotonin, norepinephrine and/or dopamine may be tried.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9068, "dataset":

{"text": "【0】 Congenital goiter is enlargement of the thyroid gland that is present at birth.The enlarged thyroid gland may produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions.Hypothyroidism in the newborn may occur if there is a structural problem with the thyroid gland.The diagnosis is based on ultrasonography and blood tests.Treatment may include hormone therapy and sometimes surgery.(For adults, also see Goiter Simple Nontoxic Goiter Simple nontoxic goiter is noncancerous enlargement of the thyroid gland that does not involve over- or underproduction of thyroid hormones.The Thyroid VIDEO The thyroid gland is an endocrine gland Endocrine Glands The endocrine system consists of a group of glands and organs that regulate and control various body functions by producing and secreting hormones.Endocrine glands secrete hormones into the bloodstream.Hormones Endocrine Function The main function of endocrine glands is to secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream.Thyroid hormone regulates the rate at which the body functions (metabolic rate).Locating the Thyroid Gland Causes of Congenital Goiter Congenital goiters may be caused by the following: Defective production of thyroid hormone Antibodies from the mother that cross the placenta and affect the thyroid Drugs the mother takes in during the pregnancy (called goitrogens) that cross the placenta The thyroid gland Overview of the Thyroid Gland The thyroid is a small gland, measuring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across, that lies just under the skin below the Adam’s apple in the neck.Any thyroid gland disorder that decreases production of thyroid hormone causes the pituitary gland Overview of the Pituitary Gland The pituitary is a pea-sized gland that is housed within a bony structure (sella turcica) at the base of the brain.If a disorder prevents the thyroid gland from responding normally by increasing hormone output, the increased stimulation by TSH causes the thyroid gland to enlarge.There are many genetic abnormalities that decrease the thyroid gland's ability to produce thyroid hormone and cause congenital goiter.Women who have certain thyroid disorders such as Graves disease Graves disease Thyroid disorders may be present before women become pregnant, or they may develop during pregnancy.Being pregnant does not change the symptoms of thyroid disorders.These antibodies interact with the receptor for TSH and can cause the fetus to produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions.Hypothyroidism in the newborn may occur if there is a structural problem with the thyroid gland.But in both cases, a goiter may result.In affected infants, the goiter typically resolves spontaneously within 3 to 6 months.Drugs such as amiodarone, propylthiouracil, iodine, and methimazole taken by the mother can cross the placenta and may rarely cause congenital goiter.Symptoms of Congenital Goiter The most common symptom of congenital goiter is firm and symmetric enlargement of the thyroid.There is no tenderness.The entire gland may be enlarged or only portions of it.It may be noticeable at birth or detected later.If the enlargement continues, infants may have difficulty breathing and swallowing.Many infants with goiters have a normally functioning thyroid gland.However, some infants develop hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.Diagnosis of Congenital Goiter Ultrasonography Blood tests If doctors suspect the infant has a goiter, they do ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissues.Tests are done to determine levels of thyroid hormones in the blood  across, that lies just under the skin below the Adam’s apple in the neck.Treatment of Congenital Goiter Sometimes hormone therapy Surgery Infants who have hypothyroidism are given replacement thyroid hormone therapy by mouth.Goiters that cause breathing and swallowing difficulty can be treated surgically.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4951, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}
{"text": "【0】 Chest injuries most often affect the ribs, upper part of the abdomen, lungs, blood vessels, heart, muscles, soft tissues, and breastbone.Sometimes the esophagus, collarbone, or shoulder blade is also injured.In the United States, chest injuries cause about 25% of deaths due to severe injury.Many of the injuries that can cause death during the first minutes or hours after injury can be treated or stabilized in the emergency department without the need for major surgery.Causes of Chest Injuries The chest can be injured by blunt force (such as in motor vehicle crashes, falls, or sports injuries) or by an object that penetrates it (such as a bullet or knife).Chest injuries are often serious or immediately life threatening because they interfere with breathing or circulation.Some injuries damage the ribs and chest muscles (called the chest wall) severely enough to make it difficult for the lungs to inflate normally.Damage to the lungs themselves interferes with gas exchange Exchanging Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide The primary function of the respiratory system is to take in oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide.Inhaled oxygen enters the lungs and reaches the alveoli.Chest injuries can cause circulatory problems if they result in a lot of bleeding.Bleeding is often inside the chest wall, which also interferes with breathing.Also, injury to the heart can affect circulation by interfering with the heart's ability to pump blood to the body.Chest injuries that are common or can be severe include the following: Blunt injury to the heart Blunt Injury to the Heart Blunt injury to the heart is a blow to the chest that bruises the heart muscle, tears (ruptures) the heart's walls, or damages a heart valveCardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is pressure on the heart by blood or fluid that accumulates in the two-layered sac around the heart (pericardium)Hemothorax is an accumulation of blood between the lung and the chest

of breathRib fractures Rib Fractures A rib fracture is a crack or break in the bones enclosing the chest.Rib fractures cause severe pain, particularly when a person breathes deeply.A chest x-ray is usually takenInjury to the aorta Injury to the Aorta The aorta—the largest artery in the body—can be partially or completely torn by severe blunt force to the chestTraumatic pneumothorax Traumatic Pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates between the chest wall and the lung because of an injury.It causes the lung to collapse partially or completelySimple treatments, such as insertion of needles or tubes to treat certain chest injuries, can be lifesaving.Symptoms of Chest Injuries The injured area is usually tender or painful.Pain is worse when people inhale.The chest may be bruised.Sometimes people are short of breath.If the injury is severe, they may feel very short of breath, drowsy, or confused, and the skin may be cold, sweaty, or blue.Such symptoms may develop when the lungs malfunction severely (respiratory failure Respiratory Failure Respiratory failure is a condition in which the level of oxygen in the blood becomes dangerously low or the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes dangerously high.People in shock typically have dangerously low blood pressure and feel as if their heart is racing.Other symptoms depend on the specific chest injury.For example, sometimes air accumulates under the skin in people with pneumothorax.Affected skin feels crackly and makes a crackling sound when touched.The veins in the neck are sometimes enlarged if blood or fluid accumulates in the sac around the heart and interferes with the heart's ability to pump blood (called cardiac tamponade Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is pressure on the heart by blood or fluid that accumulates in the two-layered sac around the heart (pericardium)Tension Pneumothorax Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates between the chest wall and the lung and increases pressure in the chest, reducing the amount of blood returned to the heart.Diagnosis of Chest Injuries A doctor's evaluation Imaging Usually, a chest injury is obvious.However, the severity of chest injuries cannot be determined without a doctor's evaluation.First, doctors use a stethoscope to determine whether all parts of the lungs are receiving air, and they carefully examine the neck and chest for injuries.When someone is having difficulty breathing, a doctor places a sensor on the person's finger (pulse oximeter) to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood.Sometimes doctors measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood with a blood test (arterial blood gas measurement).A chest x-ray X-Rays of the Chest Anyone thought to have a heart disorder has chest x-rays taken from the front and the side.Chest x-ray shows most cases of pneumothorax Traumatic Pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates between the chest wall and the lung because of an injury.It causes the lung to collapse partially or completelyHemothorax is an accumulation of blood between the lung and the chest wallCollarbone Fractures Fracture of the collarbone (clavicle) is a break in the long bone that runs horizontally from the top of the breastbone (sternum) to the top of the shoulder blade (scapula)Rib Fractures A rib fracture is a crack or break in the bones enclosing the chest.Rib fractures cause severe pain, particularly when a person breathes deeply.A chest x-ray is usually taken.However, a rapid ultrasound procedure is usually needed to look at the heart and lungs.This procedure, called E-FAST (Extended Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma), is used in trauma centers and emergency departments.Computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a personCT), ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissuesComputed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.Sometimes blood tests and electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recordedECG) are also done.Treatment of Chest Injuries Support of breathing and circulation Treatment of the specific injury Injuries that are immediately life threatening are treated as quickly as possible.The specific treatment depends on the injury.For all injuries, doctors take measures to support breathing and circulation if necessary.People may be given oxygen (for example, by nasal prongs, by face mask, or through a breathing tube) and intravenous fluids or sometimes blood transfusions.People with severe chest injuries are admitted to the hospital.People may be given pain relievers (analgesics) to lessen pain.For some injuries, a tube must be inserted into the chest (thoracostomy, or chest tube insertion Chest Tube Insertion Chest tube insertion (also called tube thoracostomy) is a procedure in which a tube is inserted into the space between the lung and chest wall (called the pleural space)Hemothorax is an accumulation of blood between the lung and the chest wall.This procedure helps collapsed lungs reinflate.Insertion can usually be done using only local anesthesia.", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3918, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",
