The responsible genetic defect occurs in 1 of at least 12 genes involved in peroxisomal formation or protein import (the PEX gene family). Manifestations include facial dysmorphism, central nervous system malformations, demyelination, neonatal seizures, hypotonia, hepatomegaly, cystic kidneys, short limbs with stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata), cataracts, retinopathy, hearing deficit, psychomotor delay, and peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis is suspected when elevated blood levels of VLCFA, phytanic acid, bile acid intermediates, and pipecolic acid are detected and is confirmed by genetic testing. There is currently no specific treatment for these disorders. Management is mainly symptomatic. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata This defect of peroxisomal biogenesis is caused by PEX7 gene mutations and characterized by skeletal changes that include midface hypoplasia, strikingly short proximal limbs, frontal bossing, small nares, cataracts, ichthyosis, and profound psychomotor retardation. Vertebral clefts are also common. Diagnosis of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is suspected by x-ray findings, elevation of serum phytanic acid, and low red blood cell plasmalogen levels; VLCFA levels are normal. Confirmation is by genetic testing. There is no specific treatment for rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy This disorder is caused by deficiency of the peroxisomal membrane transporter ALDP, which is coded for by the gene ABCD1. This is an X-linked gene and thus the disorder manifests primarily in males. Currently, > 900 mutations have been identified (see ALD Info). The cerebral form affects 40% of patients. Onset occurs between age 4 years and 8 years, and symptoms of attention deficit Symptoms and Signs Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Milder adolescent and adult forms have also been described. About 45% of patients have a milder form called adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN); onset occurs in the 20s or 30s, with progressive paraparesis, and sphincter and sexual disturbance. About one third of these patients also develop cerebral symptoms. Patients with any form may also develop adrenal insufficiency Addison Disease Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex.

Adrenal steroid replacement is needed for patients with adrenal insufficiency. Dietary supplement with a 4:1 mixture of glyceryl trioleate and glyceryl trierucate (Lorenzo’s oil) can normalize plasma VLCFA levels but does not appear to stop neurologic degeneration in symptomatic patients. However, if given to boys before symptom onset, it may slow disease progression; the exact benefit has not been determined. Gene therapy trials are currently underway and have shown some preliminary success. Classic Refsum disease Genetic deficiency of a single peroxisomal enzyme, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, which catalyzes metabolism of phytanic acid (a common dietary plant component), causes phytanic acid accumulation.

Symptoms include night blindness and loss... read more , hearing deficit, anosmia, cardiomyopathy and conduction defects, and ichthyosis. Onset is usually in the 20s. Diagnosis of Refsum disease is confirmed by elevation of serum phytanic acid and decreased levels of pristanic acid (phytanic acid elevation is accompanied by pristanic acid elevation in several other peroxisomal disorders). Treatment of Refsum disease is dietary restriction of phytanic acid (< 10 mg/day), which can be effective in preventing or delaying symptoms when started before symptom onset.

Contraindications Absolute contraindications Subclavian vein thrombosis Fracture of the clavicle or proximal ribs Local infection at the insertion site Antibiotic-impregnated catheter in allergic patient Relative contraindications Unilateral lung disease: Cannulate ipsilaterally. Unilateral anatomic distortion, traumatic or congenital, without pneumothorax: Cannulate contralaterally. Cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator: Do not cannulate the vein being used for the pacemaker leads. Gross obesity: Because the axillary vein lies deep and the brachial plexus is nearby, cannulate the axillary vein only in thin patients. Young children and infants: Subclavian vein cannulation is the least preferred CVC for young children and infants because of unfavorable anatomy, including the vein’s close proximity to the pleura and subclavian artery. Coagulopathy, including therapeutic anticoagulation* Gross obesity Malignant superior vena cava syndrome Severe cardiorespiratory insufficiency or increased intracranial or intraocular pressure: These patients will be compromised by Trendelenburg (head down) positioning. History of prior catheterization of the intended central vein Uncooperative patient: Sedate if necessary.

Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient.

Complications include Pneumothorax (increased risk because apical pleura [especially on left side] is close to needle insertion path) Arterial puncture Hematoma (increased risk because clavicle impedes application of external pressure to stop subclavian arterial or venous bleeding) Damage to the vein Hemothorax Air embolism Catheter misplacement* (eg, internal jugular vein or thoracic duct) Arrhythmias or atrial perforation, typically caused by guidewire or catheter Nerve damage Infection Thrombosis (due to the catheter itself) * Rare complications due to catheter misplacement include arterial catheterization, hydrothorax, hydromediastinum, and damage to the tricuspid valve. Guidewire or catheter embolism also rarely occurs. To reduce the risk of venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis, CVCs should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed. Equipment Sterile procedure, barrier protection Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, alcohol) Large sterile drapes, towels Sterile head caps, masks, gowns, gloves Face shields Seldinger (catheter-over-guidewire) technique Cardiac monitor Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, about 5 mL) Small anesthetic needle (eg, 25 to 27 gauge, about 1 inch [3 cm] long) Large anesthetic/finder* needle (22 gauge, about 1.5 inches [4 cm] long) Introducer needle (eg, thin-walled, 18 or 16 gauge, with internally beveled hub, about 2.5 inches [6 cm] long) 3- and 5-mL syringes (use slip-tip syringes for the finder and introducer needles) Guidewire, J-tipped Scalpel (#11 blade) Dilator Central venous catheter (adult: 8 French or larger, minimum length for subclavian catheter is 20 cm for right side and 24 cm for left side) Sterile gauze (eg, 4 × 4 inch [10 × 10 cm] squares) Sterile saline for flushing catheter port or ports Nonabsorbable nylon or silk suture (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) Chlorhexidine patch, transparent occlusive dressing * A finder needle is a thinner needle used for locating the vein before inserting the introducer needle. It is optionally used for nonultrasound–guided subclavian vein cannulation. Having an assistant or two is helpful. Additional Considerations Cannulation attempts sometimes fail. Do not exceed 2 or 3 attempts (which increases the risk of complications), and use new equipment with each attempt (ie, do not re-use needles, catheters, or other equipment because they may have become blocked with tissue or blood). During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood. If the subclavian artery is errantly cannulated by either the tissue dilator or the CVC, leave the dilator or catheter in place and obtain surgical consultation for possible surgical removal. Relevant Anatomy Superiorly overlying the first rib, in sequence from anterior to posterior, are the clavicle, subclavian vein, anterior scalene muscle, and subclavian artery. Just medial to the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle, the subclavian vein is attached by fibrous tissue to both the first rib and the clavicle, stabilizing its position and diameter. At this site, the size of the subclavian vein is only slightly affected by respiration, the Trendelenburg position, or the Valsalva maneuver. This region of the vein is the intended target of subclavian venipuncture using the infraclavicular approach. The infraclavicular approach is most common, and one of two skin insertion sites is used: either 1 to 2 cm inferior to the clavicle at the junction of its medial and middle thirds, or just inferior to the clavicle at its midpoint. Needles are advanced medially along a coronal (frontal) plane—skirting beneath the clavicle—toward the sternal notch. At the first site, the underlying first rib offers protection against pneumothorax. At the second site (clavicular midpoint), less effort is needed to maintain the shallow angle of insertion that keeps the needle in the coronal plane. Right subclavian cannulation, versus left, is sometimes preferred because it avoids the thoracic duct and because the right pleural apex is lower than the left. Left cannulation is sometimes preferred (especially for pulmonary arterial catheterization) because it affords a direct, less angular path to the superior vena cava, with less chance of misdirected catheterization of the internal jugular vein. Positioning Raise the bed to a comfortable height for you (ie, so you may stand straight while doing the procedure). Place the patient supine or in Trendelenburg position (bed tilted with the head down 10 to 20°) to prevent air embolism. Keep the patient's arm adducted and the head neutral. Stand at the side of the bed. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Do a preliminary inspection (nonsterile) to identify the sternal notch, the posterior bend of the clavicle, the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle, and the midpoint of the clavicle. Attach the cardiac monitor to the patient and turn it on. Prepare the equipment Place sterile equipment on sterilely covered equipment trays. Dress in sterile garb and use barrier protection. Draw the local anesthetic into a syringe. Optional: Attach a finder needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it. Attach the introducer needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it. Align the bevel of the needle with the volume markings on the syringe. Pre-flush all lines of the CVC with 3 to 5 mL of sterile saline and then close the ports with caps or syringes. When flushing a central line, use a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and do not push too hard to avoid rupturing the line. Prepare the sterile field Swab a broad area of skin with antiseptic solution, encompassing the entire clavicular area, as well as the side of the neck and anterior chest to below the ipsilateral nipple. Creating this broad sterile area permits immediately switching to internal jugular cannulation How To Do Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation, Ultrasound-Guided Ultrasound-guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein uses real-time (dynamic) ultrasound to guide venipuncture and a guidewire (Seldinger technique) to thread a central venous catheter... read more , should this subclavian vein cannulation fail. Allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute. Place sterile towels around the site. Place large sterile drapes (eg, a full-body drape) to establish a large sterile field. Establish the needle insertion path (subclavian vein, infraclavicular approach) Place the tip of your index finger of the hand closest to the head of the bed on the sternal notch and your thumb at the midpoint of the clavicle. The needle insertion path: Insert procedural needles (local anesthetic, finder, and introducer needles) immediately inferior to the clavicular midpoint (or 1 to 2 cm inferior to the junction of the medial and middle thirds of the clavicle), at a shallow angle into the skin, and—skirting the underside of the clavicle—aim toward the sternal notch. You likely will need to push downward on the skin lateral to the needle insertion point to maintain the required, nearly horizontal, orientation of the syringe and needle. Anesthetize the cannulation site Place a wheal of anesthetic at the needle entry site and then inject anesthetic into the skin and soft tissues along the anticipated needle insertion path. Place extra anesthetic in the highly pain-sensitive periosteum on the underside of the clavicle. Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance to identify intravascular placement and prevent an intravascular injection. If blood returns into the syringe, stop advancing, hold the syringe in place, and now regard this needle as a finder needle. Proceed to Assess the blood return Assess the blood return Percutaneous cannulation of the subclavian vein uses anatomic landmarks to guide venipuncture and a Seldinger technique to thread a central venous catheter through the subclavian vein and into... read more below. Insert the introducer needle (or finder needle, optional) Insert the introducer needle (or, optionally, a finder needle), with the bevel facing along the needle insertion path. Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance the needle. Stop advancing when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe (you may feel the needle pop through the wall as it enters the lumen). Hold the syringe motionless in this spot. Even a slight movement may displace the needle tip from the vein. If cannulation is difficult, a small towel rolled under the patient's ipsilateral shoulder or caudal traction (5 cm) on the arm may be tried. If no flash of blood appears in the barrel after 3 to 4 cm of insertion, withdraw the needle slowly. If the needle had initially passed completely through the vein, a flash may now appear as you withdraw the needle tip back into the lumen. If a flash still does not appear, withdraw the needle almost to the skin surface, change direction, and try again to advance the needle into the vein. Do not change direction of the needle while it is fully inserted. Assess the blood return Continue to hold the syringe motionless. Securely grasp the needle hub and also hold it motionless. Remove the syringe from the needle hub and briefly let blood flow out to confirm that the blood is venous (ie, dark red and flowing but not pulsatile). Then immediately cover the hub with your thumb to stop the blood flow and prevent air embolism. However, if the blood is bright red and pulsatile (arterial), terminate the procedure. Remove the needle and use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area to decrease bleeding from the puncture site. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of hemothorax and hemorrhage (eg, serial vital signs, physical examination, possibly a chest x-ray). Percutaneous Cannulation of the Subclavian Vein VIDEO Optional: Use the finder needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle If up to this point you have been inserting a finder needle (or an anesthetic needle that found the vein), now you will use this needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle. Hold the introducer syringe with the needle bevel facing down. Use one of two insertion methods: Either remove the finder needle and immediately insert the introducer needle along the same path, or keep the finder needle in place and insert the introducer needle inferiorly alongside it but directed slightly superiorly to aim toward the same venipuncture point as the finder needle. Stop advancing the introducer needle and hold it motionless when a flash of blood appears in the in the barrel of the syringe. If the finder needle has not been removed, remove it now. Assess blood flow from the introducer needle as described in Assess the blood return Assess the blood return Percutaneous cannulation of the subclavian vein uses anatomic landmarks to guide venipuncture and a Seldinger technique to thread a central venous catheter through the subclavian vein and into... read more above. Subclavian venipuncture This figure shows hand position during subclavian venipuncture (infraclavicular approach). Insert the guidewire Carefully rotate the introducer syringe such that the bevel of the needle now faces inferiorly (ie, away from the internal jugular vein and toward the heart). Insert the J-curved end of the guidewire into the introducer needle, with the J curve facing inferiorly (ie, in the same direction as the needle bevel). Advance the guidewire through the needle and into the vein. Do not force the wire; it should slide smoothly. Advance the wire 20 cm or until ectopic heartbeats occur (withdraw from this point until ectopy stops). If you feel any resistance as you advance the guidewire, stop advancing it. Try to gently withdraw the wire slightly, rotate it slightly, and then readvance it, or try to gently withdraw the wire entirely, reestablish the needle tip within the vein (confirmed by venous blood return), and then reinsert the wire. However, if you feel any resistance as you withdraw the wire, terminate the procedure and withdraw the needle and guidewire together as a unit (to prevent the needle tip from shearing through the guidewire within the patient). Then use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma. Once the guidewire has been inserted, continue to hold it securely in place with one hand and maintain control of it throughout the remainder of the procedure. Remove the introducer needle (after successful guidewire insertion) First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle and pull the needle from the skin. Then, securely hold the guidewire at the skin surface and slide the needle down the remaining length of the guidewire to remove the needle. Widen the insertion tract Extend the skin insertion site: Using the scalpel, make a small stab incision (about 4 mm) into the skin insertion site, avoiding contact with the guidewire, to enlarge the site and allow it to accommodate the larger diameters of the tissue dilator and the catheter. Advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire: First, grasp the guidewire at the skin and slide the dilator down the length of the wire to the skin. Then grasp the wire just distal to the dilator, hold the dilator near the skin surface, and use a corkscrew motion as needed to stepwise insert the entire length of the dilator. Maintain your grasp on the wire at all times during the insertion. Remove the dilator: First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the dilator and pull the dilator from the skin. When the guidewire is visible at the skin surface, completely remove the dilator by sliding it down the remaining length of the guidewire. Maintain your grasp on the guidewire at the skin surface. Place the catheter Advance the catheter over the guidewire to the skin surface: Hold the guidewire fixed at the skin surface, thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire, and slide the catheter down to the skin surface. The distal end of the guidewire should now be protruding from the port hub. If the distal end of the guidewire is not protruding from the port hub, inch the guidewire outward from the skin surface while holding the catheter tip close to the surface until the guidewire protrudes. Continue to advance the catheter into the vein: Grasp and control the guidewire where it protrudes from the hub. Hold the catheter near its tip and insert the tip through the skin. Then, in increments of several centimeters and using a corkscrew motion as necessary, stepwise advance the entire length of the subclavian catheter. If ectopic heartbeats occur, slowly withdraw the catheter until ectopy stops. Maintain your grasp on both the guidewire and the catheter. Remove the guidewire: Withdraw the guidewire while holding the catheter securely in place at the skin surface. Flush each catheter port with saline: First, draw any air from the line and confirm venous blood flow into the hub. Then, using a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and nonexcessive force, push 20 mL of saline into the line to clear it. Dress the site If the patient is awake or minimally sedated, use 1% lidocaine to numb the skin at the planned suture locations. Place a chlorhexidine-impregnated disk on the skin at the catheter insertion point. Suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter. To prevent pulling on the insertion site, suture the catheter at a second site so that a curved or looped segment of catheter lies between the two sites. Apply a sterile occlusive dressing. Transparent membrane dressings are commonly used. Aftercare Do a chest x-ray to confirm that the tip of a subclavian (or jugular) CVC lies in the superior vena cava near its junction with the right atrium (the catheter can be advanced or retracted if not in the appropriate position) and to confirm that pneumothorax has not occurred. Warnings and Common Errors Placing a pillow under the patient's back to facilitate subclavian line placement was once recommended, but doing this may hinder correct placement by narrowing the space between the clavicle and first rib. The tip of a CVC must never lie in the right atrium because the atrium is thin-walled and easily perforated. Cardiac ectopy may be induced by a guidewire or catheter in the right atrium or ventricle. Never lose grasp of the guidewire. During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood. To help prevent air embolism, CVCs should be inserted (and removed) with the vascular cannulation site positioned dependant to the heart.

Previous ocular and nasal history, including infections, injuries, surgical procedures, and radiation exposure, is ascertained. Physical examination Examination focuses on the eye and surrounding structures. The face is inspected; asymmetry suggests congenital or acquired obstruction of nasolacrimal duct drainage. When available, a slit lamp should be used to examine the eyes. The conjunctivae and corneas are inspected for lesions, including punctate spots, and redness. The cornea is stained with fluorescein and examined. The lids are everted to detect hidden foreign bodies. The eyelids, including the lacrimal puncta, are closely inspected for foreign bodies, blepharitis, hordeola, ectropion, entropion, and trichiasis. The lacrimal sac (near the medial canthus) is palpated for warmth, tenderness, and swelling. Any swellings are palpated for consistency and to see whether pus is expressed. The nose is examined for congestion, purulence, and bleeding. Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Repeated, unexplained episodes of tearing Hard mass in or near the nasolacrimal drainage structures Interpretation of findings Findings that suggest obstruction of nasolacrimal drainage include: Tears running down the cheek (true epiphora) Absence of a different specific cause For a list of common causes that may be evident from the clinical evaluation, see table Some Causes of Tearing Some Causes of Tearing . Testing Testing is often unnecessary because the cause is usually evident from the examination. Schirmer test with a large amount of wetting (eg, > 25 mm) suggests an evaporative dry eye Etiology as the etiology of tearing. Schirmer test with very little wetting (< 5.5 mm) suggests an aqueous tear-deficient dry eye Etiology . Usually, Schirmer test is done by an ophthalmologist to ensure it is done and interpreted correctly. Probing and saline irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system can help detect anatomic obstruction of drainage, as well as stenosis due to complete obstruction of the nasolacrimal drainage system. Irrigation is done with and without fluorescein dye. Reflux through the opposite punctum (eg, the eye's upper punctum if the lower punctum was irrigated) or canaliculus signals fixed obstruction; reflux and nasal drainage signify stenosis. This test is considered adjunctive and is done by ophthalmologists. Imaging tests and procedures (dacryocystography, CT, nasal endoscopy) are sometimes useful to delineate abnormal anatomy when surgery is being considered or occasionally to detect an abscess.

Orbital cellulitis is infection of the orbital tissues posterior... read more . Treatment of Tearing Underlying disorders (eg, allergies, foreign bodies, conjunctivitis) are treated. The use of artificial tears paradoxically lessens reflex tearing when dry eyes or corneal epithelial defects are the cause. Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction often resolves spontaneously. In patients < 1 year, manual compression of the lacrimal sac 4 or 5 times a day may relieve the distal obstruction. After 1 year, the nasolacrimal duct may need probing with the patient under general anesthesia. If obstruction is recurrent, a temporary drainage tube may be inserted. In acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction, irrigation of the nasolacrimal duct may be therapeutic when underlying disorders do not respond to treatment. As a last resort, a passage between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity can be created surgically (dacryocystorhinostomy). In cases of punctal or canalicular stenosis, dilation is usually curative. If canalicular stenosis is severe and bothersome, a surgical procedure that places a glass tube leading from the caruncle into the nasal cavity can be considered. Geriatrics Essentials Idiopathic age-related nasolacrimal duct stenosis is the most common cause of unexplained epiphora in older patients; however, tumors should also be considered. Key Points If tears do not run down the cheek, dry eyes is often the cause. If tears run down the cheek, obstruction of nasolacrimal drainage is likely. Testing (dacryocystography, CT, nasal endoscopy) is often unnecessary but may be needed when surgery is being considered or occasionally to detect an abscess.

The blood gets its heat mainly from the energy given off by cells when they burn (metabolize) food—a process that requires a steady supply of food and oxygen. A normal body temperature is necessary for proper functioning of all the cells and tissues in the body. In a person with low body temperature, most organs, especially the heart and brain, become sluggish and eventually stop working. Body temperature falls when the skin is exposed to colder surroundings. In response to this fall in temperature, the body uses several protective mechanisms to generate additional heat. For example, the muscles produce additional heat through shivering. Also, the small blood vessels in the skin narrow (constrict), so that more blood is diverted to vital organs, such as the heart and brain. However, as less warm blood reaches the skin, body parts such as the fingers, toes, ears, and nose cool more rapidly. If body temperature falls much below about 88° F (about 31° C), these protective mechanisms stop working, and the body cannot warm itself. If body temperature falls below 83° F (about 28° C), death may occur. The risk of cold injuries increases in the following circumstances: When the flow of blood is too slow When food intake is inadequate When dehydration or exhaustion occurs When the environment is wet or when a body part contacts something wet When the person comes into contact with a metal surface When insufficient oxygen is available, as occurs at high altitude Cold injuries are less likely to occur, even in extremely cold weather, if the skin, fingers, toes, ears, and nose are well protected or are exposed only briefly. Prevention of Cold Injuries Keeping warm in a cold environment requires several layers of clothing, preferably wool or synthetics such as polypropylene, because these materials insulate even when wet. Because the body loses a large amount of heat from the head, a warm hat is essential. Eating enough food and drinking enough fluids (particularly warm fluids) also help. Food provides fuel to be burned, and warm fluids directly provide heat and prevent dehydration. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided because alcohol widens (dilates) blood vessels in the skin, which makes the body temporarily feel warm but actually causes greater heat loss. Did You Know... Drinking alcoholic beverages actually makes the body colder because the widening of blood vessels that makes a person feel warm allows more heat to escape from the body.

Blockage causes symptoms related to the lack of blood flow, including pain, in the area the artery serves. Imaging tests are used to make the diagnosis. Treatment is with removal of a blood clot, angioplasty, or sometimes surgical bypass grafting. The aorta is the largest artery of the body. It receives oxygen-rich blood from the heart and distributes it to the body through smaller arteries that branch off of it. The abdominal aorta is the part of the aorta that passes through the abdominal cavity. Important branches of the abdominal aorta include the arteries that supply blood to the Intestine (celiac artery and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries) Kidneys (renal arteries) Legs (iliac arteries) Blockage of the arteries that branch off of the aorta may develop suddenly or slowly. Sudden blockage (acute occlusion) of branches of the abdominal aorta may result from a blood clot that has developed in the artery or traveled into it from elsewhere (embolism), or because the layers of the artery suddenly separated (dissection Aortic Dissection An aortic dissection is an often fatal disorder in which the inner layer (lining) of the aortic wall tears and separates from the middle layer of the aortic wall.

Similar blockage can develop in arteries of the legs or, less commonly, the arms (see Occlusive Peripheral Arterial Disease Occlusive Peripheral Arterial Disease Occlusive peripheral arterial disease is blockage or narrowing of an artery in the legs (or rarely the arms), usually due to atherosclerosis and resulting in decreased blood flow. Symptoms depend... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Symptoms of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Sudden blockage shuts off blood flow, which causes immediate, severe pain. Pain may be in the abdomen, back, or legs, depending on which artery is blocked. Organ failure and tissue death (necrosis) occur within hours unless blood flow is restored. Symptoms of slowly developing blockage vary depending on which artery is involved and the severity of the blockage. Lower aorta and common iliac arteries Sudden blockage of the lower aorta where it divides into the common iliac arteries causes both legs to suddenly become painful, pale, and cold. No pulse can be felt in the legs, which may become numb. Sudden blockage of an iliac artery causes symptoms in only one leg. These symptoms indicate a medical emergency. Gradual narrowing of the lower aorta or of both common iliac arteries can cause cramping and pain when walking (intermittent claudication Symptoms ) that affects the buttocks and thighs of both legs. The legs may also feel cold or appear pale, although they usually appear normal.

This combination of claudication and erectile dysfunction is sometimes called Leriche syndrome.

Kidney failure or high blood... Common.TooltipReadMore , which supply the kidneys, may cause a sudden pain in the side, and the urine may become bloody. These symptoms indicate a medical emergency. Gradual, moderate narrowing of one or both renal arteries may not cause symptoms or affect kidney function. Rarely, more complete narrowing of one or both renal arteries contributes to the development of kidney failure or high blood pressure (a disorder called renovascular hypertension). Less than 5% of people with high blood pressure have renovascular hypertension. However, renovascular hypertension can be hard to control. Superior mesenteric artery Sudden, complete blockage of the superior mesenteric artery causes severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and is a medical emergency. Initially, most people with such a blockage vomit and feel an urgent need to have a bowel movement. They may become seriously ill and have severe abdominal pain because the superior mesenteric artery supplies a large part of the intestine. The abdomen may feel tender when a doctor presses on it, but the severe abdominal pain is usually more prominent than the tenderness, which is widespread and vague. The abdomen may be slightly swollen (distended). Through a stethoscope, a doctor initially hears fewer bowel sounds in the abdomen than normal. Later, no bowel sounds can be heard. The stool initially contains small amounts of blood but soon looks bloody. Blood pressure falls, and shock may result as areas of the intestine die (called necrosis or gangrene). Gradual narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery typically causes pain about 30 to 60 minutes after each meal, because the intestine requires more blood during digestion. The pain is steady, severe, and usually centered at the navel. This pain makes people afraid to eat, so they may lose considerable weight. Because the blood supply to the intestine is reduced, nutrients may be poorly absorbed into the bloodstream, contributing to the weight loss. People who have pain after they eat may also have nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. Hepatic and splenic arteries Blockage of the hepatic artery, which supplies the liver, or the splenic artery, which supplies the spleen, is usually not as dangerous as blockage of the major arteries that supply the intestine. However, parts of the liver or spleen may be damaged. People with hepatic artery occlusion may have no symptoms or may have abdominal pain, fevers and chills, nausea, vomiting, and yellowing of the skin (jaundice). People with splenic artery occlusion may have no symptoms or may have abdominal pain and fevers, and chills. Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Imaging tests Doctors can usually suspect the diagnosis on the basis of the person's symptoms and findings during the physical examination. Imaging tests such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or traditional angiography are used to confirm the diagnosis.

In such cases, its purpose is to provide doctors with clear images of the affected arteries before surgery or angioplasty is done. Rarely, angiography is needed to determine whether surgery or angioplasty is possible. In angiography, a contrast agent that can be seen on x-rays is injected into an artery via the flexible plastic catheter. The contrast agent shows an outline of the inside of the artery when x-rays are done. Thus angiography can show the precise diameter of the artery and is more accurate than ultrasonography in detecting some blockages.

Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion Restoration of blood flow by angioplasty or removal of blood clot Acute occlusion is a surgical emergency requiring removal of the blood clot (embolectomy), angioplasty, or some other procedure (such as injecting drugs to break up the clot or doing emergency surgical bypass) to restore blood flow to the affected area. Lower aorta and common iliac arteries For sudden, complete blockage of the lower aorta and common iliac arteries, surgery is done immediately. Clot removal is done using a catheter inserted into an artery, which is then used to dislodge or vacuum out the clot, or by making an incision in the artery during open surgery and manually removing the clot. Renal arteries Angioplasty with removal of a blood clot, insertion of a stent, or surgery is done for sudden, complete blockage of a renal artery. If done promptly, the procedure can restore blood flow and kidney function. In angioplasty, a catheter with a balloon at its tip is inserted into the narrowed part of the artery and then the balloon is inflated to clear the blockage and sometimes an expandable metal mesh tube (stent) is placed at the site of the blockage to keep the blood vessel open. Some stents contain drugs that are slowly released (drug-eluting stents) and prevent regrowth of the blockage. If chronic blockage causes symptoms, surgery or angioplasty may be needed.

Often, at least three antihypertensives are needed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are particularly useful. Kidney function must be monitored when ACE inhibitors are used. If high blood pressure persists and is severe or if kidney function is deteriorating, doctors may do angioplasty or bypass surgery to restore blood flow to the kidney. Superior mesenteric artery When the superior mesenteric artery is suddenly and completely blocked, only immediate angioplasty with stent placement, bypass surgery, or drug treatment can restore the blood supply fast enough to save the person’s life. Often, to save time, doctors send people straight to surgery rather than do diagnostic tests first. During surgery, doctors may remove or bypass the blockage, or they sometimes remove the affected piece of intestine. Drugs that dissolve clots or widen (dilate) the arteries may be given during the procedure when the diagnosis of blockage is made by angiography. These drugs are given directly into the artery and may open the blockage. This procedure may avoid the need for surgery. Whether a person survives and whether the intestine can be saved depend on how fast the blood supply is restored. Nitroglycerin may relieve the abdominal pain if the superior mesenteric artery has gradually narrowed, but angioplasty or surgery is still needed to widen the artery. Hepatic and splenic arteries Surgery is needed to clear a blockage of the hepatic or splenic artery.

Deep tissue infection may be more difficult to diagnose because focal swelling and erythema may not become apparent until pain has been present for some time; systemic manifestations such as fever or tachycardia may appear first and should not be ignored. Painful neuroma can occur in any severed nerve (from surgery or trauma) and may cause a focal or enlarged area of pain that can be temporarily blocked (as a diagnostic maneuver) by local anesthetic injection. The diagnosis of a neuroma is suggested by history and physical examination. Pain from a neuroma may have neurogenic characteristics such as feeling electrical, shooting, tingling, sharp and stabbing, or prickly. The pain typically does not involve the phantom limb but can. Other symptoms that suggest neuroma include unusual and unpleasant sensations that occur without stimulation or upon contraction of residual-limb muscles and a disagreeable sensation (dysesthesia) that occurs with light palpation of skin. Neurogenic pains that occur while using the prosthesis and disappear quickly or slowly upon removal of the prosthesis suggest a neuroma. The longer the neuroma is irritated, either mechanically by the prosthesis or from muscle contraction, the longer it takes to dissipate. Magnetic resonance imaging and/or ultrasound can be used to confirm the diagnosis of neuroma. In severe cases, surgical neurectomy may be advised.

If there is no medical disorder causing the pain, massaging and light tapping combined with elevating the residual limb may help relieve the pain. If this is ineffective, mild analgesics (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], acetaminophen) can be used. If pain persists, referral to a pain management specialist may be helpful. Amputees also can experience pain in other limbs, joints, back, and neck due to the compensatory body movements done to make up for the lost function of the amputated part. The prosthetist should regularly evaluate static and kinematic efficiency of the prosthesis and make adjustments as necessary. In addition, regular stretching and strengthening exercises help balance the body and relieve pain. A physical therapist can help design an appropriate exercise program. Phantom pain Most patients experience phantom pain at some time. The phantom aspect is not the pain, which is real, but the location of the pain—in a limb that has been amputated. The mechanism is believed to involve peripheral and central factors. Onset and duration typically is within days following amputation but could be delayed months to years. Terms used to describe phantom pain include tingling, shooting, stabbing, throbbing, burning, aching, pinching, clamping, and vise-like squeezing. Phantom pain is often more severe soon after the amputation, then decreases over time. Postsurgical desensitizing therapies are available and recommended to reduce pain during initial weight-bearing in the prosthesis. For many patients, phantom pain is more common when the prosthesis is not being worn, for example, at night. The risk of having this pain is reduced if both a spinal anesthetic and a general anesthetic are used during surgery. Other nonpharmacologic therapies may be tried to relieve the pain, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture, and spinal cord stimulation. Phantom sensation Most patients experience phantom sensation, which is the feeling that the amputated part is still present. Phantom sensation must not be misinterpreted as phantom pain Phantom pain Over 70% of amputees have postamputation pain in the residual limb, which can severely limit function, impair quality of life, and significantly impede rehabilitation. Residual-limb pain should... read more . Phantom sensation can be a particular problem with lower limb amputees during nighttime trips to the bathroom. They believe their limb is still there and take a step and fall or injure their residual limb. A protective device can be worn while sleeping to prevent injury. Evaluation of Pain in the Residual Limb History and physical examination are often adequate to evaluate residual-limb pain, but sometimes testing is needed. Pain accompanied by skin changes (eg, erythema, ulceration) suggests skin irritation or infection. Expanding painful and tender erythema suggests cellulitis. In patients with known vascular disease, ulceration may also be due to recurrent ischemia. Constant pain without skin changes suggests neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, deep tissue infection, and in patients with known vascular disease, recurrent ischemia. If the pain increases with compression and/or there are systemic manifestations (eg, malaise, fever, tachycardia), there may be deep infection. Intermittent pain without skin changes that occurs with use of the prosthesis and resolves with removal suggests fit problems, neuroma, or bone spurs. Dysesthesia and/or a neuropathic quality to the pain suggests neuroma. Intermittent pain unrelated to use of the prosthesis and with no skin changes suggests various underlying possibilities including neuroma, disuse atrophy of muscles with trophic changes in vessels, reduced blood supply, and deep bone ache due to open bone marrow.

Untreated preeclampsia is present for a variable time, then can suddenly progress to eclampsia, which occurs in 1/200 patients with preeclampsia. Untreated eclampsia is usually fatal. Overview of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia VIDEO Etiology of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Etiology of preeclampsia is unknown. However, high-risk and moderate-risk factors have been identified (1 Etiology references Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. Diagnosis... read more ). High-risk factors include Previous pregnancy with preeclampsia Multifetal gestation Kidney disorders Autoimmune disorders Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus Chronic hypertension Moderate-risk factors include First pregnancy Maternal age ≥ 35 Body mass index > 30 Family history of preeclampsia Sociodemographic characteristics (African American race, low socioeconomic status) Personal history factors (eg, previous infants with low birth weight or small for gestational age, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, > 10-year pregnancy interval [ 2 Etiology references Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation.

Pathophysiology of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Pathophysiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia is poorly understood. Factors may include poorly developed uterine placental spiral arterioles (which decrease uteroplacental blood flow during late pregnancy), a genetic abnormality, immunologic abnormalities, and placental ischemia or infarction. Lipid peroxidation of cell membranes induced by free radicals may contribute to preeclampsia.

Diffuse or multifocal vasospasm can result in maternal ischemia, eventually damaging multiple organs, particularly the brain, kidneys, and liver. Factors that may contribute to vasospasm include decreased prostacyclin (an endothelium-derived vasodilator), increased endothelin (an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor), and increased soluble Flt-1 (a circulating receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor). Women who have preeclampsia are at risk of placental abruption Placental Abruption (Abruptio Placentae) Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) is premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, usually after 20 weeks gestation.

The HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelet count) develops in 10 to 20% of women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia; this incidence is about 100 times that for all pregnancies (1 to 2/1000).

Symptoms and Signs of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia may be asymptomatic or may cause edema or sudden excessive weight gain (> 5 lb/week). Nondependent edema, such as facial or hand swelling (the patient’s ring may no longer fit her finger), is more specific than dependent edema. Petechiae may develop, as may other signs of coagulopathy. Eclampsia manifests as generalized (tonic-clonic) seizures. Pearls & Pitfalls If pregnant women have new or worsening hypertension, check for swelling in the hands (eg, a ring that no longer fits) or face, which may be among the more specific findings in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia with severe features may cause organ damage; these features may include Severe headache Visual disturbances Confusion Hyperreflexia Epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain (reflecting hepatic ischemia or capsular distention) Nausea and/or vomiting Dyspnea (reflecting pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], or cardiac dysfunction secondary to increased afterload) Oliguria (reflecting decreased plasma volume or ischemic acute tubular necrosis) Stroke (rarely) Diagnosis of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia: New onset after 20 weeks gestation of hypertension Hypertension Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.

Alternatively, proteinuria is diagnosed based on a protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3 or a dipstick reading of 2+; the dipstick test is used only if other quantitative methods are not available. Absence of proteinuria on less accurate tests (eg, urine dipstick testing, routine urinalysis) does not rule out preeclampsia. In the absence of proteinuria, preeclampsia is also diagnosed if pregnant women meet diagnostic criteria for new-onset hypertension and have new onset of any of the following signs of end-organ damage: Thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000/mcL) Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of serum creatinine in women without renal disease) Impaired liver function (aminotransferases > 2 times normal) Pulmonary edema New-onset headache (unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses) Visual symptoms The following points help differentiate among other hypertensive disorders in pregnant women: Chronic hypertension is identified if hypertension precedes pregnancy, is present at < 20 weeks gestation, or persists for > 6 weeks (usually > 12 weeks) postpartum (even if hypertension is first documented at > 20 weeks gestation). Chronic hypertension may be masked during early pregnancy by the physiologic decrease in BP. Gestational hypertension is new-onset hypertension at > 20 weeks gestation without proteinuria or other findings of preeclampsia; it resolves by 12 weeks (usually by 6 weeks) postpartum. Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension is diagnosed when new unexplained proteinuria develops or proteinuria worsens after 20 weeks in a woman known to have hypertension with BP elevations above baseline or when preeclampsia with severe features develops after 20 weeks in a woman known to have hypertension and proteinuria. Women with chronic hypertension are at high risk of preeclampsia and should be monitored closely. Further evaluation If preeclampsia is diagnosed, tests include complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, uric acid, liver tests, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and, if creatinine is abnormal, creatine clearance. The fetus is assessed using a nonstress test or biophysical profile (including assessment of amniotic fluid volume) and tests that estimate fetal weight. Preeclampsia with severe features Preeclampsia with severe features is differentiated from mild forms by new onset of one or more of the following: Systolic BP > 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 110 mm Hg on 2 occasions ≥ 4 hours apart Thrombocytopenia, platelet count < 100,000/mcL Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2 times normal Symptoms of liver capsule distention (eg, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) Progressive renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL or doubling of serum creatinine in women without renal disease) Pulmonary edema Central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (eg, blurred vision, scotomata, altered mental status, severe headache unrelieved by acetaminophen) HELLP syndrome is suggested by microangiopathic findings (eg, schistocytes, helmet cells) on peripheral blood smears, elevated liver enzymes, and a low platelet count.

Obstet Gynecol 135 (6):e237–e260, 2020. Treatment of Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Usually hospitalization and sometimes antihypertensive treatment Delivery, depending on factors such as gestational age, fetal status, and severity of preeclampsia Sometimes magnesium sulfate to prevent or treat new seizures or to prevent seizures from recurring General approach Definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery. However, risk of preterm delivery is balanced against gestational age, fetal growth restriction, fetal distress, severity of preeclampsia, and response to other treatments. Usually, immediate delivery after maternal stabilization (eg, controlling seizures, beginning to control blood pressure [BP]) is indicated for the following: Pregnancy of ≥ 37 weeks Preeclampsia with severe features if pregnancy is ≥ 34 weeks Deteriorating renal, pulmonary, cardiac, or hepatic function (eg, HELLP syndrome) Nonreassuring results of fetal monitoring or testing Eclampsia Other treatments aim to optimize maternal health, which usually optimizes fetal health. If delivery can be safely delayed in pregnancies of < 34 weeks, corticosteroids are given for 48 hours to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Some stable patients can be given corticosteroids after 34 weeks and before 36 weeks (late preterm period) if they have not been given corticosteroids earlier in the pregnancy. Most patients are hospitalized. Patients with eclampsia or preeclampsia with severe features are often admitted to a maternal special care unit or an intensive care unit (ICU). Preeclampsia without severe features Most patients who have preeclampsia without severe features before 37 weeks gestation are hospitalized for evaluation, at least initially. If maternal and fetal status are reassuring, outpatient treatment is possible; it includes modified activity (modified rest), BP measurements, laboratory monitoring, fetal nonstress testing, and physician visits at least once a week. As long as no criteria for preeclampsia with severe features develop, delivery can occur (eg, by induction) at 37 weeks. Monitoring All hospitalized patients with preeclampsia are evaluated frequently for evidence of seizures, preeclampsia with severe features, and vaginal bleeding; BP, reflexes, and fetal heart status (with nonstress testing or a biophysical profile) are also checked. Platelet count, serum creatinine, and serum liver enzymes are measured frequently until stable, then at least once a week. Outpatients are usually followed by an obstetrician or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and evaluated at least once a week with the same testing as inpatients. Evaluation is more frequent if preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed or if gestational age is < 34 weeks. Magnesium sulfate As soon as eclampsia is diagnosed, magnesium sulfate must be given to prevent seizures from recurring. If patients have preeclampsia with severe features, magnesium sulfate may be given to prevent seizures. Magnesium sulfate is given for 12 to 24 hours postpartum. Whether patients who have preeclampsia without severe features always require magnesium sulfate before delivery is controversial. Magnesium sulfate 4 g IV over 20 minutes is given, followed by a constant IV infusion of 2 g/hour. Dose is adjusted based on the patient’s symptoms or on whether renal insufficiency is present. Patients with abnormally high magnesium levels (eg, with magnesium levels > 10 mEq/L or a sudden decrease in reflex reactivity), cardiac dysfunction (eg, with dyspnea or chest pain), or hypoventilation after treatment with magnesium sulfate can be treated with calcium gluconate 1 g IV. IV magnesium sulfate may cause lethargy, hypotonia, and transient respiratory depression in neonates. However, serious neonatal complications are uncommon. Supportive treatments If oral intake is prohibited, hospitalized patients are given IV Ringer lactate or 0.9% normal saline solution, beginning at about 125 mL/hour (to maintain hemodynamic status). Persistent oliguria is treated with a carefully monitored fluid challenge. Diuretics are usually not used. Monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter is rarely necessary and, if needed, is done in consultation with a critical care specialist and in an intensive care unit (ICU). Anuric patients with normovolemia may require renal vasodilators or dialysis. If seizures occur despite magnesium therapy, diazepam or lorazepam can be given IV to stop seizures, and IV hydralazine or labetalol is given in a dose titrated to lower systolic BP to 140 to 155 mm Hg and diastolic BP to 90 to 105 mm Hg. Delivery method The most efficient method of delivery should be used. If the cervix is favorable and rapid vaginal delivery seems feasible, a dilute IV infusion of oxytocin is given to accelerate labor; if labor is active, the membranes are ruptured. If the cervix is unfavorable and prompt vaginal delivery is unlikely, cesarean delivery can be considered. Preeclampsia and eclampsia, if not resolved before delivery, usually resolve rapidly afterward, within 6 to 12 hours. Follow-up Patients should be evaluated at least every 1 to 2 weeks postpartum with periodic BP measurement. If BP remains high after 6 weeks postpartum, patients may have chronic hypertension and should be referred to their primary care physician for management. Treatment reference 1.

Prevention Meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown that low-dose aspirin therapy in women with certain risk factors reduces the rate of severe preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (1 Prevention references Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation.

Diagnosis... read more , 2 Prevention references Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. Diagnosis... read more ). Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) is recommended for patients with high-risk factors for preeclampsia (previous pregnancy with preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disorders, autoimmune disorders, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension). It is also recommended for those with > 1 moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age ≥ 35, body mass index > 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics such as African American race or low socioeconomic status, personal history factors such as low-birth-weight or small-for-gestational-age infants, previous adverse pregnancy outcome, or a> 10-year pregnancy interval [ 3 Prevention references Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. Diagnosis... read more ]). Aspirin prophylaxis should be started at 12 to 28 weeks of gestation (ideally before 16 weeks) and continued until delivery. Prevention references 1.

Key Points Preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation, and eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia; preeclampsia develops postpartum in 25% of cases. Preeclampsia is differentiated from chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension by the presence of new-onset proteinuria and/or end-organ damage. Preeclampsia is severe if it causes significant organ dysfunction (eg, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, visual symptoms), even in the absence of proteinuria. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) is a related disorder that occurs in 10 to 20% of women who have preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia. Evaluate and closely monitor the mother and fetus, usually in a hospital maternal special care unit, but sometimes outpatient monitoring is possible. Delivery is usually indicated when the pregnancy is ≥ 37 weeks, but if preeclampsia with severe features is diagnosed, deliver by 34 weeks; if HELLP syndrome or eclampsia is diagnosed, deliver immediately. Treat eclampsia immediately with magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures from recurring; consider magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women who have preeclampsia with severe features, but usually not in those with mild preeclampsia. If magnesium sulfate is given for seizure prophylaxis, continue for 12 to 24 hours after delivery. Give women with certain risk factors low-dose aspirin starting at 12 to 28 weeks to reduce risk of preeclampsia, ideally before 16 weeks.

Although quite rare, incidence is significant (perhaps 1/200 births) in Mennonite populations. Clinical manifestations include body fluid odor that smells like maple syrup (particularly strong in cerumen) and overwhelming illness in the first days of life, beginning with vomiting and lethargy, and progressing to seizures, coma, and death if untreated. Patients with milder forms of the disease may manifest symptoms only during stress (eg, infection, surgery). Biochemical findings are profound ketonemia and acidemia. Diagnosis of maple syrup urine disease is by finding elevated plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (particularly leucine) and confirmed by genetic testing. (Also see testing for suspected inherited disorders of metabolism Initial testing Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Timely diagnosis leads to early treatment and... read more .) Acutely, treatment of maple syrup urine disease with peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be required, along with IV hydration and nutrition (including protein restriction and high-dose dextrose). Patients should be closely monitored for cerebral edema and acute pancreatitis. Long-term management is restriction of dietary branched-chain amino acids; however, small amounts are required for normal metabolic function. Thiamin is a cofactor for the decarboxylation, and some patients respond favorably to high-dose thiamin (up to 200 mg orally once a day). An emergency plan for how to manage acute illness, which may provoke a metabolic crisis, should be in place. Liver transplantation is curative. Isovaleric acidemia The 3rd step of leucine metabolism is the conversion of isovaleryl CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl CoA, a dehydrogenation step. Deficiency of this dehydrogenase results in isovaleric acidemia, also known as “sweaty feet” syndrome, because accumulated isovaleric acid emits an odor that smells like sweat. Clinical manifestations of the acute form occur in the first few days of life with poor feeding, vomiting, and respiratory distress as infants develop profound anion gap metabolic acidosis High anion gap acidosis Metabolic acidosis is primary reduction in bicarbonate (HCO3−), typically with compensatory reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be markedly low or slightly... read more , hypoglycemia, and hyperammonemia. Bone marrow suppression often occurs. A chronic intermittent form may not manifest for several months or years. Diagnosis of isovaleric acidemia is made by detecting elevated levels of isovaleric acid and its metabolites in blood or urine. (Also see testing for suspected inherited disorders of metabolism Initial testing Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Timely diagnosis leads to early treatment and... read more .) Acute treatment of isovaleric acidemia is with IV hydration and nutrition (including high-dose dextrose) and measures to increase renal isovaleric acid excretion by conjugation with glycine. If these measures are insufficient, exchange transfusion and peritoneal dialysis may be needed. Long-term treatment is with dietary leucine restriction and continuation of glycine and carnitine supplements. Prognosis is excellent with treatment. Propionic acidemia Deficiency of propionyl CoA carboxylase, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing propionic acid to methylmalonate, causes propionic acid accumulation.

Propionic acidemia can also be seen as part of multiple carboxylase deficiency, biotin deficiency, or biotinidase deficiency. Diagnosis of propionic acidemia is suggested by elevated levels of propionic acid metabolites, including methylcitrate and tiglate and their glycine conjugates in blood and urine, and confirmed by measuring propionyl CoA carboxylase activity in white blood cells or cultured fibroblasts and/or genetic testing. (Also see testing for suspected inherited disorders of metabolism Initial testing Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Timely diagnosis leads to early treatment and... read more .) Acute treatment of propionic acidemia is with IV hydration (including high-dose dextrose), nutrition, and protein restriction; carnitine may be helpful. If these measures are insufficient, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be needed. Long-term propionic acidemia treatment is dietary restriction of precursor amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids and possibly continuation of carnitine supplementation. A few patients respond to high-dose biotin because it is a cofactor for propionyl CoA and other carboxylases. Intermittent courses of antibiotics should be considered for reducing a propionic acid load resulting from intestinal bacteria. An emergency plan for how to manage acute illness, which may provoke a metabolic crisis, should be in place. Methylmalonic acidemia This disorder is caused by deficiency of methylmalonyl CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl CoA (a product of the propionyl CoA carboxylation) into succinyl CoA. Adenosylcobalamin, a metabolite of vitamin B12, is a cofactor; its deficiency also may cause methylmalonic acidemia (and also homocystinuria Classic homocystinuria A number of defects in methionine metabolism lead to accumulation of homocysteine (and its dimer, homocystine) with adverse effects including thrombotic tendency, lens dislocation, and central... read more and megaloblastic anemia Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias Megaloblastic anemias result most often from deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate.

Your brain is like the central processing unit in a computer The brain receives information from your eyes, ears, nose, and other sense organs. It processes information, generates thoughts and ideas, and sends messages to your body. For example, it tells your muscles how to move so you can walk, talk, and do the things you want your body to do. Your brain also controls a lot of what your body does without you thinking about it. For example, your brain automatically adjusts your breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. You need your brain to be able to move, speak, taste, smell, hear, and see The brain needs a lot of blood and oxygen to work—at every moment, about 20% of the blood pumped by your heart goes to the brain You'll pass out if blood flow to your brain stops for more than 10 seconds. Viewing the Brain The brain consists of the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum. Each half (hemisphere) of the cerebrum is divided into lobes. What are the parts of the brain? The brain sits inside your skull surrounded by fluid that cushions and supports it. The fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. It is held around your brain inside 3 layers of membranes called the meninges. The brain has 3 main parts: Cerebrum: The main upper part of your brain that is divided into parts called lobes—these lobes control thought, movement, speech, memory, emotions, and all your senses Brain stem: The very bottom part of your brain that connects with the spinal cord—the brain stem controls critical body functions, such as consciousness, breathing, blood pressure, and heartbeat Cerebellum: A separate part of your brain just above your brain stem that controls balance and coordination Your cerebrum has two halves, one on the left and one on the right. The left half controls the right side of your body and vice versa. That's why when someone has a stroke in the left side of their brain, they can't move the right side of their body. Tissues Covering the Brain Within the skull, the brain is covered by three layers of tissue called the meninges. How does the brain work? Your brain is made of: Nerve cells and their fibers There are billions and billions of nerve cells in your brain. Each nerve cell has a microscopic cell body: The body of the nerve cell is responsible for processing nutrients and keeping the cell alive Each nerve cell body has fibers going to and from it: Input fibers receive signals from other nerve cells or from receptors in your sense organs Output fibers send signals to other nerves in your brain or spinal cord Signals travel only one way in a nerve cell Although nerve fibers and their signals act a lot like a wire carrying electrical signals, that's not exactly right. Nerve cells really send their signals using chemicals. Chemical changes take place progressively along the length of a nerve fiber When the chemical changes reach the end of the nerve fiber, they release other chemicals called neurotransmitters The neurotransmitters drift across a microscopic gap where they hit the chemical receptors of another cell The neurotransmitters trigger chemical changes in that other cell If that cell is a nerve cell, then the progressive chemical changes continue down the fibers of that cell to pass the signal along One nerve cell sends just one kind of signal that can't carry a lot of information. However, when billions of nerve cells are interconnected like they are in your brain, they form a very powerful information processor. What can go wrong with the brain? Many problems can affect your brain, including Injuries that destroy brain cells Infections such as meningitis Meningitis or encephalitis Encephalitis Encephalitis is inflammation of your brain, usually caused by an infection. Encephalitis can be caused by a virus directly infecting your brain or when a virus or a misguided immune reaction... read more Blockage or rupture of blood vessels that feed the nervous system, causing a stroke Stroke A stroke is a sudden brain problem that happens when a blood vessel in your brain either gets blocked or breaks open and bleeds.

They are mucus-filled and are located on either side of the vaginal opening. Symptoms of large cysts include vulvar pressure or pain, dyspareunia, and vulvar asymmetry. Bartholin gland cysts may form abscesses, which are painful. Diagnosis is by pelvic examination. Large cysts and abscesses require drainage and sometimes excision; abscesses require antibiotics. Bartholin glands are round, very small, nonpalpable, and located deep in the posterolateral vaginal orifice. Obstruction of the Bartholin duct causes the gland to enlarge with mucus, resulting in a cyst. Cause of obstruction is usually unknown.

Most cysts are nontender, unilateral, and palpable near the vaginal orifice. Cysts distend the affected labia majora, causing vulvar asymmetry. If an abscess develops, it causes severe vulvar pain and sometimes fever; abscesses are tender and typically erythematous.

Sexually transmitted diseases may coexist. Diagnosis of Bartholin Gland Cyst or Abscess Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of Bartholin gland cysts is usually by examination of the vulva. A sample of discharge from the cyst, if present, may be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Abscess fluid should be cultured. In women > 40 years old, some experts recommend biopsy to exclude Bartholin gland carcinoma or other vulvar cancer. Treatment of Bartholin Gland Cyst or Abscess Sitz baths for mild symptoms For abscesses, incision and drainage and usually placement of a catheter for drainage Surgery for more severe symptoms and for all cysts in women > 40 In women < 40, asymptomatic cysts do not require treatment. Mild symptoms may resolve with sitz baths. Otherwise, symptomatic cysts may require a procedure to drain or remove the cyst. For abscesses, a procedure is done to produce a permanent opening from the gland to the exterior because abscesses often recur after simple drainage. A small incision is made in the cyst and/or abscess, and then one of the following is done: Catheter insertion: A small balloon-tipped catheter may be inserted, inflated, and left in the cyst for 4 to 6 weeks; this procedure stimulates fibrosis and produces a permanent opening. Marsupialization: The everted edges of the cyst are sutured to the exterior. Abscesses are sometimes treated with a procedure and an oral antibiotic regimen that covers MRSA (eg, trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg once or twice a day OR trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg once or twice a day PLUS amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg twice a day OR trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg once or twice a day PLUS metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day).

Inpatient admission for IV antibiotics should be strongly considered if patients have poorly controlled diabetes mellitus or are immunocompromised. Recurrent cysts or abscesses may require complete excision of the Bartholin gland. In women > 40, newly developed cysts or abscesses should be surgically biopsied (to exclude vulvar cancer) or removed. Cysts that have been present for years and have not changed in appearance do not require biopsy or surgical removal unless symptoms are present. Key Points Bartholin gland cysts are vulvar cysts. They result from ductal obstruction; the cause is usually unknown. Cysts may become infected, sometimes with MRSA, and form an abscess. For abscesses and for cysts that cause bothersome symptoms, treat with an incision and drainage procedure (eg, with catheter insertion, marsupialization, and/or excision). In women > 40 years old, biopsy newly developed cysts to exclude vulvar cancer Surgically remove a Bartholin gland if a patient has recurrent cysts or abscesses or if cancer is suspected.

Evidence The medicinal claims of DHEA have not been fully supported by the evidence. In addition, DHEA is banned by numerous professional sports organizations as it is classified as a \"prohormone.\" DHEA levels are known to naturally decrease with age and therefore people in search of the unattainable fountain of youth have turned to DHEA supplementation as a possible solution to ailments associated with age. Studies have been reported showing both positive and negative results. More thorough studies are warranted not only with aging but with all clinical health conditions. An analysis of data from 4 randomized controlled trials in women and men aged ≥ 55 years found that daily supplementation of DHEA compared to placebo resulted in significant increases in lumbar spine and trochanter bone mineral density in women but not men, although men had a significant decrease in fat mass (1 References Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid produced by the adrenal gland and is a precursor of estrogens and androgens.

The disorder includes inability to recall everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic or stressful events, all of which would not typically be lost with ordinary forgetting.

The disorder may begin at any age, from early childhood to late life. Dissociative identity disorder has the following forms: Possession Nonpossession In the possession form, the identities usually manifest as though they were outside agents, typically a supernatural being or spirit (but sometimes another person), who has taken control of the person, causing the person to speak and act in a very different way. In such cases, the different identities are very overt (readily noticed by others). In many cultures, similar possession states are a normal part of cultural or spiritual practice and are not considered dissociative identity disorder.

J Psychiatr Res 40(2):131-140, 2006. Etiology of Dissociative Identity Disorder Dissociative identity disorder usually occurs in people who experienced overwhelming stress or trauma during childhood. Children are not born with a sense of a unified identity; it develops from many sources and experiences. In overwhelmed children, many parts of what should have blended together remain separate. Chronic and severe abuse (physical, sexual, or emotional) and neglect during childhood are frequently reported by and documented in patients with dissociative identity disorder (in the US, Canada, and Europe, about 90% of patients). Some patients have not been abused but have experienced an important early loss (such as death of a parent), serious medical illness, or other overwhelmingly stressful events. In contrast to most children who achieve cohesive, complex appreciation of themselves and others, severely mistreated children may go through phases in which different perceptions, memories, and emotions of their life experiences are kept segregated. This is intensified by parents or other caretakers who behave inconsistently (eg, alternating between affectionate and abusive behaviors) in a pattern termed betrayal trauma. Over time, such children may develop an increasing ability to escape the mistreatment by “going away\"—that is, by detaching themselves from their harsh physical environment—or by retreating into their own mind. Each developmental phase or traumatic experience may be used to generate a different identity. On standardized tests, people with this disorder have high scores for susceptibility to hypnosis and dissociation (ability to uncouple one’s memories, perceptions, or identity from conscious awareness). Symptoms and Signs of Dissociative Identity Disorder Several symptoms are characteristic of dissociative identity disorder. Multiple identities In the possession form, the multiple identities are readily apparent to family members and associates. Patients speak and act in an obviously different manner, as though another person or being has taken over. The new identity may be that of another person (often someone who has died, perhaps in a dramatic fashion) or that of a supernatural spirit (often a demon or god), who may demand punishment for past actions. In the nonpossession form, the different identities are often not as apparent to observers. Instead, patients experience feelings of depersonalization; ie, they feel unreal, removed from self, and detached from their physical and mental processes. Patients say that they feel like an observer of their life, as if they were watching themselves in a movie over which they have no control (loss of personal agency). They may think that their body feels different (eg, like that of a small child or someone of the opposite sex) and does not belong to them. They may have sudden thoughts, impulses, and emotions that do not seem to belong to them and that may manifest as multiple confusing thought streams or as voices. Some manifestations may be noticed by observers. For example, patients' attitudes, opinions, and preferences (eg, regarding food, clothing, or interests) may suddenly change, then change back. People with dissociative identity disorder also experience intrusions into their everyday activities when there is a shift in identities or interference by one identity state in the functioning of another. For example, at work, an angry identity may suddenly yell at a co-worker or boss.

Patients may discover objects in their shopping bag or samples of handwriting that they cannot account for or recognize.

Some try to hide it. The amnesia may be noticed by others when patients cannot remember things they have said and done or important personal information, such as their own name. Other symptoms In addition to hearing voices, patients with dissociative identity disorder may have visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. Thus, patients may be misdiagnosed with a psychotic disorder. However, these hallucinatory symptoms differ from the typical hallucinations of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis (loss of contact with reality), hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized speech and behavior, flattened affect... read more . Patients with dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as coming from an alternate identity (eg, as if someone else was wanting to cry using their eyes, hearing the voice of an alternate identity criticizing them). Depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, self-mutilation, nonepileptic seizures, and suicidal behavior are common, as is sexual dysfunction. The switching of identities and the amnestic barriers between them frequently result in chaotic lives. Generally, patients try to hide or minimize their symptoms and the effect they have on others. Diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder Clinical criteria Detailed interviews, sometimes with hypnosis or facilitated by drugs Diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder is clinical, based on presence of the following criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5): Patients have ≥ 2 personality states or identities (disruption of identity), with substantial discontinuity in their sense of self and sense of agency. Patients have gaps in their memory for everyday events, important personal information, and traumatic events—information that would not typically be lost with ordinary forgetting. Symptoms cause significant distress or significantly impair social or occupational functioning. Also, the symptoms cannot be better accounted for by another disorder (eg, complex partial seizures, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, another dissociative disorder), by the effects of alcohol intoxication, by broadly accepted cultural or religious practices, or, in children, by fantasy play (eg, an imaginary friend). The diagnosis requires knowledge of and specific questions about dissociative phenomena. Prolonged interviews, hypnosis, or drug-facilitated (barbiturate or benzodiazepine) interviews are sometimes used, and patients may be asked to keep a journal between visits. All of these measures involve an attempt to bring out a shift of identities during the evaluation. The clinician may over time attempt to map out the different identities and their interrelationships. Specially designed structured interviews and questionnaires can be very helpful, especially for clinicians who have less experience with this disorder. The clinician may also attempt to directly contact other identities by asking to speak to the part of the mind involved in behaviors that patients cannot remember or that seem to be done by someone else. Hypnosis can help clinicians access the patient's dissociated states and other identities and help the patient better control the shifts among the dissociated states. Malingering (intentional feigning of physical or psychologic symptoms motivated by an external incentive) should be considered if gain could be a motive (eg, to escape accountability for actions or responsibilities). However, malingerers tend to overreport well-known symptoms of the disorder (eg, dissociative amnesia Dissociative Amnesia Dissociative amnesia is a type of dissociative disorder that involves inability to recall important personal information that would not typically be lost with ordinary forgetting. It is usually... read more ) and underreport others. They also tend to create stereotypical alternate identities. In contrast to patients who have the disorder, malingerers usually seem to enjoy the idea of having the disorder; in contrast, patients with dissociative identity disorder often try to hide it. When clinicians suspect that the disorder is faked, cross-checking information from multiple sources may detect inconsistencies that preclude the diagnosis. Prognosis for Dissociative Identity Disorder Impairment in dissociative identity disorder varies widely. It may be minimal in highly functioning patients; in these patients, relationships (eg, with their children, spouse, or friends) may be impaired more than occupational functioning. With treatment, relational, social, and occupational functioning may improve, but some patients respond very slowly to treatment and may need long-term supportive treatment. Symptoms wax and wane spontaneously, but dissociative identity disorder does not resolve spontaneously. Patients can be divided into groups based on their symptoms: Symptoms are mainly dissociative and posttraumatic. These patients generally function well and recover completely with treatment. Dissociative symptoms are combined with prominent symptoms of other disorders, such as personality disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse disorders. These patients improve more slowly, and treatment may be less successful or longer and more crisis-ridden. Patients not only have severe symptoms due to coexisting mental disorders but may also remain deeply emotionally attached to their abusers. These patients can be challenging to treat, often requiring longer treatments that typically aim to help control symptoms more than to achieve integration. Treatment of Dissociative Identity Disorder Supportive care, including drug treatment as needed for associated symptoms Psychotherapy focused on long-term integration of identity states when possible Integration of the identity states is the most desirable outcome of treatment of dissociative identity disorder. Drugs are widely used to help manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, impulsivity, and substance abuse but do not relieve dissociation per se. Treatment to achieve integration centers on psychotherapy. For patients who cannot or will not strive for integration, treatment aims to facilitate cooperation and collaboration among the identities and to reduce symptoms. The first priority of psychotherapy is to stabilize patients and ensure safety, before evaluating traumatic experiences and exploring problematic identities and reasons for dissociations. Some patients benefit from hospitalization, during which continuous support and monitoring are provided as painful memories are addressed. Therapists should be vigilant in helping such patients avoid revictimization. Hypnosis may help with accessing the identities, facilitating communication among them, and stabilizing and interpreting them. Some therapists directly engage and interact with the dissociated identity states in an attempt to facilitate integration of the identity states (1 Treatment reference Dissociative identity disorder, formerly called multiple personality disorder, is a type of dissociative disorder characterized by ≥ 2 personality states (also called alters, self-states, or... read more ). Modified exposure techniques can be used to gradually desensitize patients to traumatic memories, which are sometimes tolerated only in small fragments. As the reasons for dissociations are addressed and worked through, therapy can move toward reconnecting, integrating, and rehabilitating the patient’s alternate selves, relationships, and social functioning. Some integration occurs spontaneously during treatment. Integration can be encouraged by negotiating with and arranging the unification of the identities or can be facilitated using hypnotic suggestion and guided imagery. Patients who have been traumatized, particularly during childhood, may expect further abuse during therapy and develop complex transference reactions to their therapist. Discussing these understandable feelings is an important component of effective psychotherapy. Treatment reference 1.

Primary hypogonadism In primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism, damage to the Leydig cells impairs testosterone production, damages the seminiferous tubules, or does both; oligospermia or azoospermia and elevated gonadotropins result.

The syndrome is usually identified at puberty, when inadequate sexual development is noted (typically very small, firm testes), or later, when infertility is investigated. Gynecomastia is often seen due to gonadotropin-induced increase in aromatase activity and subsequent conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Diagnosis is based on elevated gonadotropin levels and low to low-normal testosterone levels. Errors of sex determination and gonadal development, such as gonadal dysgenesis (46,XX or 46,XY) and testicular and ovotesticular disorders of sex development, represent rare forms of male hypogonadism. They may result in a male or undervirilized male phenotype, ambiguous genitals at birth, and some degree of testicular and spermatogenic failure. In cryptorchidism Cryptorchidism Cryptorchidism is failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum; in younger children, it is typically accompanied by inguinal hernia. Diagnosis is by testicular examination, sometimes... read more , one or both testes are undescended. Etiology is usually unknown. Sperm counts may be slightly low if one testis is undescended but are almost always very low if both are undescended. In bilateral anorchia (vanishing testes syndrome), the testes were presumably present but were resorbed before or after birth. External genitals and wolffian structures are normal, but müllerian duct structures are lacking. Thus, testicular tissue must have been present during the first 12 weeks of embryogenesis because testicular differentiation occurred and testosterone and müllerian-inhibiting factor were produced. Leydig cell aplasia occurs when congenital absence of Leydig cells causes partially developed or ambiguous external genitals. Although wolffian ducts develop to some extent, testosterone production is insufficient to induce normal male differentiation of the external genitals. Müllerian ducts are absent because of normal production of müllerian-inhibiting hormone by Sertoli cells. Gonadotropin levels are high with low testosterone levels. Noonan syndrome may occur sporadically or as an autosomal dominant disorder. Phenotypic abnormalities include hyperelasticity of the skin, hypertelorism, ptosis, low-set ears, short stature, shortened 4th metacarpals, high-arched palate, and primarily right-sided cardiovascular abnormalities (eg, pulmonic valve stenosis, atrial septal defect). Testes are often small or cryptorchid. Testosterone levels may be low with high gonadotropin levels. Defective androgen synthesis is caused by enzyme defects that impair androgen synthesis, which may occur in any of the pathways leading from cholesterol to dihydrotestosterone. These congenital problems may occur in congenital adrenal hyperplasia Overview of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders, each characterized by inadequate synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both. In the most common forms, accumulated hormone precursors... read more (eg, steroidogenic acute regulatory [StAR] protein deficiency, 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency) when the same enzyme defect occurs in the adrenal glands and the testes, resulting in defective androgen activity and ambiguous external genitals of varying degrees. Secondary hypogonadism Causes of secondary hypogonadism include panhypopituitarism, hypothalamic or pituitary tumors, isolated gonadotropin deficiency, Kallmann syndrome, Laurence-Moon syndrome, isolated luteinizing hormone deficiency, Prader-Willi syndrome, and functional and acquired disorders of the central nervous system (eg, trauma, infection, infiltrative disease such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis). Causes of secondary hypogonadism must be differentiated from constitutional delay of puberty, which is a functional form of secondary hypogonadism. Several acute disorders and chronic systemic disorders (eg, chronic renal insufficiency, anorexia nervosa) may lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which resolves after recovery from the underlying disorder. Hypogonadism is also more common among long-term survivors of childhood cancers treated with craniospinal irradiation. Panhypopituitarism may occur congenitally or anatomically (eg, in septo-optic dysplasia or Dandy-Walker malformation), causing deficiency of hypothalamic-releasing factors or pituitary hormones. Acquired hypopituitarism may result from tumors, neoplasia, or their treatment, vascular disorders, infiltrative disorders (eg, sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis), infections (eg, encephalitis, meningitis), or trauma. Hypopituitarism in childhood may cause delayed growth, hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, hypoadrenalism, and lack of sexual development when puberty is expected. Hormone deficiencies, whether originating in the anterior or posterior pituitary, may be varied and multiple. Kallmann syndrome causes about 60% of congenital forms of hypogonadism. It is characterized by anosmia due to aplasia or hypoplasia of the olfactory lobes and by hypogonadism due to deficiency of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It occurs when fetal GnRH neurosecretory neurons do not migrate from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. The genetic defect is known; inheritance is classically X-linked but can also be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Other manifestations include microphallus, cryptorchidism, midline defects, and unilateral kidney agenesis. Presentation is clinically heterogeneous, and some patients have a normal ability to detect odors. Isolated luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency (fertile eunuch syndrome) is a rare cause of hypogonadism due to monotropic loss of LH secretion in boys; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are normal. At puberty, growth of the testes is normal because most testicular volume consists of seminiferous tubules, which respond to FSH. Spermatogenesis may occur as tubular development proceeds. However, absence of LH results in Leydig cell atrophy and testosterone deficiency. Therefore, patients do not develop normal secondary sexual characteristics, but they continue to grow, reaching eunuchoidal proportions (arm span exceeds height by 5 cm; pubic to floor length exceeds crown to pubic length by > 5 cm) because the epiphyses do not close. Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, muscular hypotonia, and failure to thrive during early childhood followed later by obesity, intellectual disability, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The syndrome is caused by deletion or disruption of a gene or genes on the proximal long arm of paternal chromosome 15 or by uniparental disomy of maternal chromosome 15. Failure to thrive due to hypotonia and feeding difficulties during infancy usually resolves after age 6 to 12 months. From 12 to 18 months onward, uncontrollable hyperphagia causes excessive weight gain and psychologic problems; plethoric obesity becomes the most striking feature. Rapid weight gain continues into adulthood; stature remains short and may be caused by growth hormone deficiency. Features include emotional lability, poor gross motor skills, facial abnormalities (eg, a narrow bitemporal dimension, almond-shaped eyes, a mouth with thin upper lips and down-turned corners), and skeletal abnormalities (eg, scoliosis, kyphosis, osteopenia). Hands and feet are small. Other features include cryptorchidism and a hypoplastic penis and scrotum. Constitutional delay of puberty is absence of pubertal development before age 14 years; it is more common among boys. By definition, children with constitutional delay show evidence of sexual maturation by age 18 years, but pubertal delay and short stature may generate anxiety in adolescents and their families. Many children have a family history of delayed sexual development in a parent or sibling. Typically, stature is usually short during childhood, adolescence, or both but ultimately reaches the normal range. Growth velocity is nearly normal, and growth pattern parallels the lower percentile curves of the growth chart. The pubertal growth spurt is delayed, and at the expected time of puberty, height percentile begins to drop, which may contribute to psychosocial difficulties for some children. Skeletal age is delayed and is most consistent with the child's height age (age at which a child's height is at the 50th percentile) rather than chronologic age. Diagnosis is by exclusion of growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, systemic conditions that may interfere with puberty (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, eating disorders), and hypogonadism (whether primary or due to gonadotropin deficiency). Symptoms and Signs of Male Hypogonadism in Children Clinical presentation depends on whether, when, and how testosterone and sperm production are affected. (For presentation in adulthood, see Symptoms and Signs Symptoms and Signs Hypogonadism is defined as testosterone deficiency with associated symptoms or signs, deficiency of spermatozoa production, or both. It may result from a disorder of the testes (primary hypogonadism)... read more .) If androgen deficiency or defects in androgen activity occur during the first trimester (< 12 weeks gestation), differentiation of internal wolffian ducts and external genitals is inadequate. Presentation may range from ambiguous external genitals to normal-appearing female external genitals. Androgen deficiency during the second and third trimesters may cause a microphallus and partially or completely undescended testes. Androgen deficiency that develops early in childhood has few consequences, but if it occurs when puberty is expected, secondary sexual development is impaired. Such patients have poor muscle development, a high-pitched voice, inadequate phallic and testicular growth, a small scrotum, sparse pubic and axillary hair, and absent body hair. They may develop gynecomastia and grow to eunuchoidal body proportions (arm span exceeds height by 5 cm; pubic to floor length exceeds crown to pubic length by > 5 cm) because fusion of the epiphyses is delayed and long bone growth continues. Diagnosis of Male Hypogonadism in Children Measurement of testosterone, LH, and FSH Karyotyping (for primary hypogonadism) Diagnosis of male hypogonadism in children is often suspected based on developmental abnormalities or delayed puberty but requires confirmation by testing, including measurement of testosterone, LH, and FSH. LH, and especially FSH, levels are more sensitive than testosterone levels, especially for detecting primary hypogonadism. Testing should be done in the morning and requires pediatric-specific assays (often labeled as ultrasensitive or immunochemiluminometric [ICMA]). LH and FSH levels also help determine whether hypogonadism is primary or secondary: High levels, even with low-normal testosterone levels, indicate primary hypogonadism. Levels that are low or lower than expected for the testosterone level indicate secondary hypogonadism. In boys with short stature, delayed pubertal development, low testosterone, and low FSH and LH levels may indicate constitutional delay. Unlike constitutional delay, in which there is a transient decrease in these hormones that normalizes with time, the gonadotropins and testosterone do not normalize with time. Elevated serum FSH levels with normal serum testosterone and LH levels typically indicate impaired spermatogenesis but not impaired testosterone production. In primary hypogonadism, it is important to determine the karyotype to investigate for Klinefelter syndrome. Interpretation of testosterone, FSH, and LH levels for diagnosis of hypogonadism requires an understanding of how the levels vary. Before puberty, serum testosterone levels are < 20 ng/dL (< 0.7 nmol/L); in adulthood, levels are > 300 to 1200 ng/dL (12 to 42 nmol/L). Serum testosterone secretion is primarily circadian. In the 2nd half of puberty, levels are higher at night than during the latter part of the day. A single sample obtained in the morning can establish that circulating testosterone levels are normal. Because 98% of testosterone is bound to carrier proteins in serum (usually sex hormone–binding globulin), alterations in these protein levels alter total testosterone levels. Measurement of total serum testosterone (protein bound and free) is usually the most accurate indicator of testosterone secretion. Although serum LH and FSH levels are pulsatile, testing can be valuable. Puberty begins when GnRH secretion increases and serum LH rises disproportionately to FSH. Early in puberty, early morning levels are preferred. Serum LH levels are usually below 0.2 mIU/mL (0.2 units/L) before puberty and range from 2 to 12 mIU/mL (2 to 12 units/L) during later stages of puberty and into adulthood. Serum FSH levels are usually < 3 mIU/mL (< 3 units/L) before puberty and fluctuate between 5 and 10 mIU/mL (5 and 10 units/L) during the 2nd half of puberty and into adulthood. Measurement of inhibin B and anti-müllerian hormone levels can help assess gonadal function in boys with suspected hypogonadism. Both are functional markers of Sertoli cells, which play an important role in spermatogenesis and account for the majority of testicular growth before puberty. Unlike LH and FSH, these markers are easily measured before puberty. For older boys with delayed puberty and suspected secondary hypogonadism, low levels of inhibin B, which normally rise at puberty, are more suggestive of secondary hypogonadism than constitutional delay. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test is done to assess the presence and secretory ability of testicular tissue. Multiple protocols exist. In one protocol, a one-time dose of hCG 100 units/kg IM is given. hCG stimulates Leydig cells, as does LH, with which it shares a structural subunit, and stimulates testicular production of testosterone. Testosterone levels should double after 3 to 4 days.

Diagnosis is by testicular examination, sometimes... read more is corrected early to obviate concerns about cancer developing in later adulthood and to prevent testicular torsion. For secondary hypogonadism, any underlying pituitary or hypothalamic disorder is treated. Overall, the goal is to provide androgen replacement starting with a low dose and progressively increasing the dose over 18 to 24 months. Treatment is started at an appropriate age for normal onset of puberty, often around 12 years of age. Adolescent boys with androgen deficiency should be given long-acting injectable testosterone enanthate or cypionate 50 mg every 2 to 4 weeks; the dose is increased up to 200 mg over 18 to 24 months. A transdermal patch or gel may be used instead as boys get older. Treatment choice can be determined based on patient preference, but injections are preferred as doses are being increased. Treatment of Kallmann syndrome with hCG can correct cryptorchidism and establish fertility. Puberty is typically induced using testosterone injectable or gel. GnRH therapy has been previously shown to help endogenous sex hormone secretion, progressive virilization, and even fertility. In isolated LH deficiency, testosterone, via conversion to estrogen by aromatase, induces normal epiphyseal closure. Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome may be treated with human growth hormone. Several studies have shown this treatment is beneficial. Constitutional delay of puberty can be treated with a 4- to 6-month course of testosterone. After the course is complete, treatment is stopped and testosterone levels are measured several weeks or months later to differentiate temporary from permanent deficiency. If testosterone levels are not higher than the initial value and/or pubertal development does not proceed after completion of this treatment, a second course of low-dose treatment can be given. If endogenous puberty has not begun after two courses of treatment, the likelihood of permanent deficiency increases, and patients need to be reevaluated for other causes of hypogonadism. Key Points In primary male hypogonadism, a congenital (or rarely acquired) testicular disorder impairs testosterone production and/or damages the seminiferous tubules. In secondary male hypogonadism, congenital or acquired disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary cause gonadotropin deficiency and failure to stimulate normal testes; this must be differentiated from constitutional delay. Manifestations and their timing vary widely depending on when testosterone production is affected. Prenatal androgen deficiency may result in manifestations ranging from partially undescended testes, microphallus, and ambiguous external genitals to normal-appearing female external genitals. Androgen deficiency that occurs when puberty is expected impairs secondary sexual development. Diagnose by measurement of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Treat with hormone replacement and surgery as needed.

In some older people, the fat around the orbit shrinks, causing the eyeball to sink backward into the orbit. This condition is called enophthalmos. Because of lax tissues in the eyelids, the orbital fat can also bulge forward into the eyelids, making them appear constantly puffy. The muscles that work to regulate the size of the pupils weaken with age. The pupils become smaller, react more sluggishly to light, and dilate more slowly in the dark. Therefore, people older than 60 may find that objects appear dimmer, that they are dazzled initially when going outdoors (or when facing oncoming cars during night driving), and that they have difficulty going from a brightly lit environment to a darker one.

Incapacitating agents are designed not to cause serious injury or death but rather to disorient military personnel and keep them from carrying out their missions.

Their body temperature may also become dangerously high (hyperthermia). They may become lethargic and then develop hallucinations in which they see or hear things. The hallucinations are typically concrete and easily describable (for example, voices of people they know, imaginary television programs, sharing of imaginary cigarettes, or odd shapes).

Diagnosis is by examination. Treatment is symptomatic. The piriformis muscle extends from the pelvic surface of the sacrum to the upper border of the greater trochanter of the femur. During running or sitting, this muscle can compress the sciatic nerve at the site where it emerges from under the piriformis to pass over the hip rotator muscles. Piriformis syndrome is uncommon. Piriformis syndrome In piriformis syndrome, the sciatic nerve is compressed by the piriformis muscle in the posterior pelvis. Symptoms and Signs of Piriformis Syndrome A chronic nagging ache, pain, tingling, or numbness starts in the buttocks and can extend along the course of the sciatic nerve, down the entire back of the thigh and calf, and sometimes into the foot. Pain worsens when the piriformis is pressed against the sciatic nerve (eg, while sitting on a toilet, a car seat, or a narrow bicycle seat or while running). Diagnosis of Piriformis Syndrome Physical examination and provocative testing Diagnosis is by physical examination. Pain with forceful internal rotation of the flexed thigh (Freiberg maneuver), abduction of the affected leg while sitting (Pace maneuver), raising of the knee several centimeters off the table while lying on a table on the side of the unaffected leg (Beatty maneuver), or pressure into the buttocks where the sciatic nerve crosses the piriformis muscle while the patient slowly bends to the floor (Mirkin test) is diagnostic. Imaging is not useful except to rule out other causes of sciatic compression. Lumbar disk compression of the sciatic nerve (sciatica Sciatica Sciatica is pain along the sciatic nerve. It usually results from compression of lumbar nerve roots in the lower back.

However, differentiation from a lumbar disk disorder can be difficult, and referral to a specialist may be needed. Treatment of Piriformis Syndrome Modification of activity Stretches Patients should temporarily stop running, bicycling, or doing any activity that elicits pain. Patients whose pain is aggravated by sitting should stand or, if unable to do so, change positions to remove the source of pressure around the buttock. Specific stretching exercises for the posterior hip and piriformis can be beneficial. Surgery is rarely warranted. A carefully directed corticosteroid injection near the site where the piriformis muscle crosses the sciatic nerve often helps temporarily. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also provide temporary pain relief. Exercises to Stretch the Posterior Hip and Piriformis Side-Lying Hip External Rotation (Clamshell Exercise) 1.

About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss, and, less commonly, hemoptysis; however, many patients present with metastatic disease with or without any clinical symptoms. The diagnosis is typically made by chest x-ray or CT and confirmed by biopsy. Depending on the stage of the disease, treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination. For the past several decades, the prognosis for a lung cancer patient was poor, with only 15% of patients surviving > 5 years from the time of diagnosis. For patients with stage IV (metastatic) disease, the 5-year overall survival rate was < 1%. However, outcomes have improved because of the identification of certain mutations that can be targeted for therapy and current 5-year survival rates are 19% (23% for women and 16% for men). Epidemiology of Lung Carcinoma In 2020, an estimated 228,820 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the US (112,520 in women and 116,300 in men), and 135,720 people will die from the disease. The incidence of lung cancer has been declining in men over the past 2 decades and has started to decline in women. Etiology of Lung Carcinoma The most important cause of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of cases, is Cigarette smoking The risk of cancer differs by age, smoking intensity, and smoking duration. The risk of lung cancer increases with combined exposure to toxins and cigarette smoking. Other confirmed or possible risk factors include air pollution, marijuana smoking, exposure to cigar smoke and second-hand cigarette smoke, and exposure to carcinogens (eg, asbestos, radiation, radon, arsenic, chromates, nickel, chloromethyl ethers, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, mustard gas, coke-oven emissions, primitive cooking, heating huts). The lung cancer risk associated with electronic nicotine delivery systems (eg, e-cigarettes) remains to be determined, although it is thought that the products of combustion of tobacco are the primary carcinogens. The risk of cancer declines after smoking cessation, but it never returns to the baseline risk in never-smokers. About 15 to 20% of people who develop lung cancer have never smoked or have smoked minimally. Whether and how much exposure to household radon increases lung cancer risk is controversial. Chronic inflammation increases the risk of many cancers, including lung cancer. For example, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary fibrosis increase susceptibility to lung cancer. People whose lungs are scarred by other lung diseases (eg, tuberculosis) are potentially at increased risk of lung cancer. Also, active smokers who take beta-carotene supplements may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Genetic factors Respiratory epithelial cells require prolonged exposure to cancer-promoting agents and accumulation of multiple genetic mutations before becoming neoplastic (an effect called field carcinogenesis). In some patients with lung cancer, secondary or additional mutations in genes that stimulate cell growth (K-ras, MYC) cause abnormalities in growth factor receptor signaling (EGFR, HER2/neu) and inhibit apoptosis and can contribute to the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells. In addition, mutations that inhibit tumor-suppressor genes (eg, p53, APC) can lead to cancer. Other mutations that may be responsible include the EML-4-ALK translocation and mutations in ROS-1, BRAF, and PI3KCA. Genes such as these that are primarily responsible for lung cancer are called oncogenic driver mutations. Although oncogenic driver mutations can cause or contribute to lung cancer among smokers, these mutations are particularly likely to be a cause of lung cancer among never-smokers. In 2014, the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) found driver mutations in 64% of 733 lung cancers among smokers and nonsmokers (25% K-ras mutations, 17% EGFR mutations, 8% EML-4-ALK, and 2% BRAF mutations [ 1 Etiology reference Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss... read more ]). Additional mutations are being reported, and novel therapies aimed at oncogenic driver mutations are an area of active research; there are many current clinical trials of these so-called targeted therapies. Etiology reference 1. Kris MG, Johnson BE, Berry LD, et al: Using multiplexed assays of oncogenic drivers in lung cancers to select targeted drugs. JAMA 311 (19):1998–2006, 2014. doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.3741 Classification of Lung Carcinoma Lung cancer is classified into 2 major categories: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), about 15% of cases Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), about 85% of cases SCLC is highly aggressive and almost always occurs in smokers. It is rapidly growing, and roughly 80% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The clinical behavior of NSCLC is more variable and depends on histologic type, but about 40% of patients will have metastatic disease outside of the chest at the time of diagnosis. Oncogenic driver mutations have been identified primarily in adenocarcinoma, and attempts are being made to identify similar mutations in squamous cell carcinoma (eg, FGFR1, DDR2, and PI3K). Other features of the 2 categories (eg, location, risks, treatment, complications) also vary ( see Table: Features of Lung Cancer Features of Lung Cancer ). Table Symptoms and Signs of Lung Carcinoma About 25% of lung cancers are asymptomatic and are detected incidentally with chest imaging. Symptoms and signs can result from local tumor progression, regional spread, or distant metastases. Paraneoplastic syndromes and constitutional symptoms may occur at any stage of the disease. Although symptoms are not specific to the classification or histology of the cancer, certain complications may be more likely with different types (see table Features of Lung Cancer Features of Lung Cancer ). Local tumor The local tumor can cause cough and, less commonly, dyspnea due to airway obstruction, postobstructive atelectasis or pneumonia, and parenchymal loss due to lymphangitic spread. Fever may occur with postobstructive pneumonia. Up to half of patients report vague or localized chest pain. Hemoptysis is less common, and blood loss is minimal, except in rare instances when the tumor erodes into a major artery, causing massive hemorrhage and often death by asphyxiation or exsanguination. Hemoptysis is the presenting symptom in about 10% of patients; 20% of patients experience it during the course of their illness. Regional spread Regional spread of tumor may cause pleuritic chest pain or dyspnea due to development of a pleural effusion, hoarseness due to tumor encroachment on the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and dyspnea and hypoxia from diaphragmatic paralysis due to involvement of the phrenic nerve. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome results from compression or invasion of the SVC and can cause headache or a sensation of head fullness, facial or upper-extremity swelling, breathlessness when supine, dilated veins in the neck, face, and upper trunk, and facial and truncal flushing (plethora). Pancoast syndrome occurs when apical tumors, usually NSCLC (Pancoast tumor), invade the brachial plexus, pleura, or ribs, causing shoulder and upper-extremity pain and weakness or atrophy of the ipsilateral hand. Pancoast syndrome can also include Horner syndrome . Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis) results when the paravertebral sympathetic chain or cervical stellate ganglion is involved. Spread of the tumor to the pericardium may be asymptomatic or lead to constrictive pericarditis or cardiac tamponade. In rare cases, esophageal compression by the tumor leads to dysphagia. Metastases Metastases eventually cause symptoms that vary by location. Metastases can spread to the Liver, causing pain, nausea, early satiety, and ultimately hepatic insufficiency Brain, causing behavioral changes, confusion, aphasia, seizures, paresis or paralysis, nausea and vomiting, and ultimately coma and death Bones, causing severe pain and pathologic fractures Adrenal glands, rarely causing adrenal insufficiency Paraneoplastic syndromes Paraneoplastic syndromes Paraneoplastic Syndromes Paraneoplastic syndromes are symptoms that occur at sites distant from a tumor or its metastasis.

Diagnosis of Lung Carcinoma Chest x-ray CT or combined positron emission tomography (PET)–CT Cytopathology examination of pleural fluid or sputum Usually bronchoscopy-guided biopsy and core biopsy Sometimes open lung biopsy Imaging Chest x-ray is often the initial imaging test. It may show clearly defined abnormalities, such as a single mass or multifocal masses or a solitary pulmonary nodule Solitary Pulmonary Nodule A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a discrete lesion < 3 cm in diameter that is completely surrounded by lung parenchyma (ie, does not touch the hilum, mediastinum, or pleura) and... read more , an enlarged hilum, widened mediastinum, tracheobronchial narrowing, atelectasis, nonresolving parenchymal infiltrates, cavitary lesions, or unexplained pleural thickening or effusion. These findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of lung cancer and require follow-up with CT scans or combined PET–CT scans and cytopathologic confirmation. CT shows many characteristic anatomic patterns and appearances that may strongly suggest the diagnosis. If a lesion found on a plain x-ray is highly suggestive of lung cancer (ie, based on risk factors such as age, tobacco use, symptoms), PET–CT may be done to assist in diagnosis and staging Staging Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

This study combines anatomic imaging from CT with functional imaging from PET. The PET images can help differentiate inflammatory and malignant processes. Both CT and PET–CT can help direct core needle biopsy of lesions not amenable to bronchoscopic biopsy. These PET images may also detect metastatic disease. Cytology The method used to obtain cells or tissue for confirmation depends on the accessibility of tissue and the location of lesions. Sputum or pleural fluid cytology is the least invasive method. In patients with productive cough, sputum specimens obtained on awakening may contain high concentrations of malignant cells, but yield for this method is < 50% overall. Pleural fluid is another convenient source of cells; a malignant effusion is a poor prognostic sign and indicates advanced stage disease. In general, false-negative cytology readings can be minimized by obtaining as large a volume of sputum or pleural fluid as possible early in the day and sending the sample to the pathology laboratory immediately to minimize delays in processing because such delays lead to cell breakdown. Molecular (genetic) studies can be done on paraffin-embedded tumor cell pellets from pleural fluid if the fluid is spun down and the cell pellet preserved in a timely fashion. Procedures Percutaneous biopsy is the next least invasive procedure. It is more useful for metastatic sites (eg, supraclavicular or other peripheral lymph nodes, pleura, liver, adrenals) than for lung lesions. Risks include a 20 to 25% chance of pneumothorax (primarily in patients with significant emphysema) and the risk of obtaining a false-negative result. Bronchoscopy is the procedure most often used for diagnosing lung cancer. In theory, the procedure of choice for obtaining tissue is the one that is least invasive; however, in practice, bronchoscopy is often done in addition to or instead of less invasive procedures because diagnostic yields are greater and because bronchoscopy is important for staging. A combination of washings, brushings, and biopsies of visible endobronchial lesions and of paratracheal, subcarinal, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes often yields a tissue diagnosis. Advances in techniques to guide the bronchoscope have increased the diagnostic yield and the accuracy of sampling more peripheral lesions. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy (EBUS) can be done during bronchoscopy and has an excellent yield. EBUS is currently the preferred method for staging the mediastinum, except in cases where the lymph nodes cannot be sampled due to anatomic considerations. Mediastinoscopy had been the standard test for evaluating mediastinal lymph nodes but is a higher risk procedure that is typically used before more extensive thoracic surgical procedures to confirm or exclude the presence of tumor in those few patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes that cannot be sampled by EBUS. Open lung biopsy, done via open thoracotomy or using video assistance Thoracoscopy and Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery Thoracoscopy is a procedure in which an endoscope is introduced to visualize the pleural space. Thoracoscopy can be used for visualization (pleuroscopy) or for surgical procedures. Surgical... read more , is indicated when less invasive methods do not provide a diagnosis in patients whose clinical characteristics and radiographic features strongly suggest that the tumor is resectable. A core biopsy is preferable to a fine-needle biopsy because the latter retrieves too little tissue for accurate genetic studies. Screening Screening for lung cancer benefits patients with early disease, especially early NSCLC treatable with surgical resection, and is now recommended in high-risk populations. A large study (1 Diagnosis references Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss... read more ) has shown that annual screening using low-dose helical CT (LDCT) resulted in a 20% decrease in lung cancer deaths compared to screening using chest x-ray. The study defined the high-risk population as former or active smokers (mainly ages 55 to 74) with at least 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking, and, if former smokers, had quit within the previous 15 years). A recent study of screening in high-risk patients showed improved survival in patients receiving LDCT screening based on nodule volume and volume-doubling time (2 Diagnosis references Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss... read more ). However, screening LDCT may not be appropriate for patients not at high risk. Also, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends (3 Diagnosis references Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss... read more ) annual LDCT screening of asymptomatic smokers age 50 to 80 with a ≥ 20 pack-year history who currently smoke or have quit for less than 15 years. Shared decision making discussions between a provider and the patient should occur before screening. Shared decision making regarding screening should include discussions to exclude patients who would not benefit from early detection, such as those who would refuse treatment or be unable to complete treatment due to serious other medical conditions. Additionally, it is recommended that LDCT screening be done at facilities with demonstrated LDCT proficiency and adherence to established protocols for follow-up diagnosis and treatment. In the future, lung cancer screening may involve some combination of molecular analysis for genetic markers (eg, K-ras, p53, EGFR), sputum cytometry, and detection of cancer-related volatile organic compounds (eg, alkane, benzene) in exhaled breath. Studies have even shown that trained dogs can discriminate lung cancer patients from controls based on exhaled gas samples (4 Diagnosis references Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Eur J Cardiothorac Surg 52:1206–1210, 2017. doi: 10.1093/ejcts/ezx152 Staging of Lung Carcinoma SCLC has 2 stages: Limited Extensive Limited-stage SCLC disease is cancer confined to one hemithorax (including ipsilateral lymph nodes) that can be encompassed within one tolerable radiation therapy port, unless there is a pleural or pericardial effusion. Extensive-stage disease is cancer outside a single hemithorax or the presence of malignant cells detected in pleural or pericardial effusions. Less than one third of patients with SCLC will present with limited-stage disease; the remainder of patients often have extensive distant metastases. NSCLC has 4 stages, I through IV (using the TNM system). TNM staging is based on tumor size, tumor and lymph node location, and the presence or absence of distant metastases ( see Table: International Staging System for Lung Cancer International Staging System for Lung Cancer ). Tests for initial evaluation and staging Some components of staging are part of the typical diagnostic evaluation, for example, endobronchial ultrasound can sample enlarged lymph nodes at the same time a lung lesion is biopsied. All lung cancer patients need imaging to determine whether the disease has spread. Different combinations of tests can be done. Some tests are done routinely, and others are done depending on whether the results would impact treatment decisions: PET or integrated PET–CT CT from neck to pelvis and bone scan (done if PET–CT is not available) MRI of chest (for tumors near apex or diaphragm to evaluate vascular supply) Biopsy of questionable nodes (if PET is indeterminate) Head CT or brain MRI PET scanning is a reasonably accurate, noninvasive test used to identify malignant mediastinal lymph nodes and other distant metastases (metabolic staging). Integrated PET–CT scanning, in which PET and CT images are combined into a single image by scanners in a single gantry, is more accurate for NSCLC staging than CT or PET alone or than visual correlation of the 2 tests. The use of PET and integrated PET–CT is limited by cost, availability, and specificity (ie, the test is quite sensitive and has an excellent negative predictive value, but its positive predictive value is not as high). If PET–CT is not available, thin-section high-resolution CT (HRCT) from the neck to the upper abdomen (to detect cervical and supraclavicular and hepatic and adrenal metastases) is one of the first staging tests for both SCLC and NSCLC. However, CT often cannot distinguish postinflammatory changes from malignant intrathoracic lymph node enlargement or benign lesions from malignant hepatic or adrenal lesions (distinctions that determine stage). Thus, other tests are usually done when abnormalities are present in these areas. When PET scan results are indeterminate, bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography, mediastinoscopy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can be used to biopsy questionable mediastinal lymph nodes. Without PET scanning, hepatic or adrenal lesions must be evaluated by needle biopsy. MRI of the chest is slightly more accurate than high-chest HRCT for staging apical (Pancoast) tumors and cancers close to the diaphragm (eg, mesothelioma) and provides an evaluation of the vasculature surrounding the tumors. Blood tests are usually done. Calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels, if elevated, suggest possible bone metastases. Other blood tests, such as CBC, serum albumin levels, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, electrolytes, and creatinine levels, have no role in staging but provide important prognostic information about the patient’s ability to tolerate treatment and may demonstrate the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. After diagnosis, all patients with lung cancer should undergo brain imaging; MRI is preferred to CT. Brain imaging is especially necessary in patients with headache or neurologic abnormalities. Patients with bone pain or elevated serum calcium or alkaline phosphatase levels should undergo PET–CT or radionuclide bone scanning if PET–CT is not available. Table Prognosis for Lung Carcinoma For SCLC, the overall prognosis is poor. The median survival time for limited-stage SCLC is 20 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 20%. Patients with extensive-stage SCLC do especially poorly, with a 5-year survival rate of < 1%. For NSCLC, the 5-year survival rate varies by stage, from 60 to 70% for patients with stage I disease to < 1% for patients with stage IV disease. On average, untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC survive 6 months, whereas the median survival for treated patients is about 9 months. Recently, patient survival has improved in both early and later stage NSCLC. Evidence shows improved survival in early-stage disease (stages IB to IIIB) when platinum-based chemotherapy regimens are used after surgical resection. In addition, targeted therapies have improved survival in patients with stage IV disease, in particular patients with an EGFR mutation, EML-4-ALK and ROS-1 translocations. Overall 5-year survival rate is 18%. Targeted therapies and improved sequential treatments are incrementally prolonging survival, particularly in later stage disease. Treatment of Lung Carcinoma Surgery (depending on cell type and stage) Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy Treatment of lung cancer varies by cell type and by stage of disease. Many patient factors not related to the tumor affect treatment choice. Poor cardiopulmonary reserve, undernutrition, frailty or poor physical performance status (assessed by, eg, Karnofsky performance status [KPS] or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [ECOGPS]), comorbidities, including cytopenias, and psychiatric or cognitive illness all may lead to a decision for palliative over curative treatment or for no treatment at all, even though a cure with aggressive therapy might technically be possible. Radiation therapy carries the risk of radiation pneumonitis when large areas of the lung are exposed to high doses of radiation over time. Radiation pneumonitis can occur up to 3 months after treatment is completed. Cough, dyspnea, low-grade fever, or pleuritic chest pain may signal the condition, as may crackles or a pleural friction rub detected on chest auscultation. Chest x-ray may have nonspecific findings; CT may show a nonspecific infiltrate without an obvious mass. The diagnosis is often one of exclusion. Radiation pneumonitis can be treated with a corticosteroid taper over several weeks and bronchodilators for symptom relief. Radiofrequency ablation, in which high-frequency electrical current is used to destroy tumor cells, is a technique that can sometimes be used in patients who have small, early-stage tumors or small tumors that have recurred in a previously irradiated chest. This procedure may preserve more lung function than open surgery does and, because it is less invasive, may be appropriate for patients who are not candidates for open surgery. Immunotherapy harnesses the body's immune system to eliminate the cancer, and is used to treat advanced stage (IV) non-small cell lung cancer if there is high programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or PDL-1 expression (see table Some Targeted Therapy Drugs for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Some Targeted Therapy Drugs for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer ). SCLC SCLC of any stage is typically initially responsive to treatment, but responses are usually short-lived. Chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, is given depending on the stage of disease. In many patients, chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves quality of life enough to warrant its use. Surgery generally plays no role in treatment of SCLC, although it may be curative in the rare patient who has a small focal tumor without spread (such as a solitary pulmonary nodule Solitary Pulmonary Nodule A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a discrete lesion < 3 cm in diameter that is completely surrounded by lung parenchyma (ie, does not touch the hilum, mediastinum, or pleura) and... read more ) who underwent surgical resection before the tumor was identified as SCLC. Pearls & Pitfalls Surgery generally plays no role in treatment of SCLC, although it may be curative in the rare patient who has a small focal tumor without spread. Chemotherapy regimens of etoposide and a platinum compound (either cisplatin or carboplatin) are commonly used, as are other drugs, such as irinotecan, topotecan, vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide), doxorubicin, taxanes (docetaxel, paclitaxel), and gemcitabine. In limited-stage disease, when disease is confined to a hemithorax, radiation therapy further improves clinical outcomes; such response to radiation therapy was the basis for the definition of limited-stage disease. The use of prophylactic cranial irradiation to prevent brain metastases is also advocated in certain cases; micrometastases are common in SCLC, and chemotherapy has less ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In extensive-stage disease, treatment is based on chemotherapy rather than radiation therapy, although radiation therapy is often used as palliative treatment for metastases to bone or brain. In patients with an excellent response to chemotherapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation is sometimes used as in limited-stage SCLC to prevent growth of SCLC in the brain. In rare, selected patients who have a near-complete response to chemotherapy, thoracic radiation therapy is sometimes thought to improve disease control. It is unclear whether replacing etoposide with topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan or topotecan) improves survival. These drugs alone or in combination with other drugs are also commonly used in refractory disease and in cancer of either stage that has recurred. Immunotherapy may also be used in extensive SCLC. In general, recurrent SCLC carries a poor prognosis, although patients who maintain a good performance status should be offered further treatment in a clinical trial. NSCLC Treatment for NSCLC typically involves assessment of eligibility for surgery followed by choice of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of modalities as appropriate, depending on tumor type and stage. For stage I and II disease, the standard approach is surgical resection with either lobectomy or pneumonectomy combined with mediastinal lymph node sampling or complete lymph node dissection. Lesser resections, including segmentectomy and wedge resection, are considered for patients with poor pulmonary reserve. Surgery is curative in about 55 to 70% of patients with stage I and in 35 to 55% of patients with stage II disease. Outcomes appear better when surgical resection is done by a thoracic oncologic surgeon with expertise in lung cancer (1, 2 Treatment references Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. Symptoms can include cough, chest discomfort or pain, weight loss... read more ). Patients with early-stage disease who are high-risk surgical candidates may instead have local, non-surgical treatment, such as radiation therapy (stereotactic or conventional) or radiofrequency ablation. Preoperative pulmonary function is assessed. Surgery is done only if NSCLC patients will have adequate pulmonary reserve once a lobe or lung is resected. Patients with preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) > 2 L generally tolerate pneumonectomy. Patients with FEV1 < 2 L should have a quantitative xenon radionuclide perfusion scan to determine the proportion of function they can expect to lose as a result of resection. Postoperative FEV1 can be predicted by multiplying percent perfusion of the nonresected lung by the preoperative FEV1. A predicted FEV1 > 800 mL or > 40% of the predicted normal FEV1 suggests adequate postoperative lung function, although studies of lung volume reduction surgery in patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) suggest that patients with FEV1 < 800 mL can tolerate resection if the cancer is located in poorly functional, bullous (generally apical) lung regions. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery is now standard practice for patients with stage II or stage III disease and possibly also for patients with stage IB disease and tumors > 4 cm. Clinical trials have shown an increase in 5-year survival rates with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the decision to use adjuvant chemotherapy depends on the patient’s comorbidities and risk assessment. A commonly used chemotherapy regimen is a cisplatin-based doublet (combination of a cisplatin and another chemotherapy drug, such as vinorelbine, docetaxel, paclitaxel). Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC is also commonly used and consists of 4 cycles of a cisplatin-doublet. In patients who cannot receive cisplatin, carboplatin can be substituted. Multiple trials are examining neoadjuvant treatment with immunotherapy drugs. Stage III disease is treated with either chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, or a combination of therapies; the sequence and choice of treatment depend on the location of the patient's disease and comorbidities. In general, concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy are considered standard treatment for unresectable clinically staged IIIA disease, but the survival remains poor (median survival, 10 to 14 months). Patients with stage IIIB disease with contralateral mediastinal nodal disease or supraclavicular nodal disease are offered either radiation therapy or chemotherapy or both. Patients with locally advanced tumors invading the heart, great vessels, mediastinum, or spine usually receive radiation therapy. In some patients (ie, those with T4 N0 M0 tumors), surgical resection with either neoadjuvant or adjuvant combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be feasible. The 5-year survival rate for patients with treated stage IIIB disease is 5%. In stage IV disease, prolonging survival and palliation of symptoms are the goals. Chemotherapy, targeted drugs, and radiation therapy may be used to reduce tumor burden, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life. However, if no mutation treatable with a targeted drug is identified, median survival is only 9 months, and < 25% of patients survive 1 year. Surgical palliative procedures may be required and may include thoracentesis and pleurodesis of recurrent effusions, placement of indwelling pleural drainage catheters, bronchoscopic fulguration of tumors involving the trachea and mainstem bronchi, placement of stents to prevent airway occlusion, and, in some cases, spinal stabilization for impending spinal cord compression. Targeted therapy for NSCLC NSCLC treatment is based on precision medicine. Molecular analysis is done on adenocarcinomas to look for specific mutations that can direct therapy (see table Some Targeted Therapy Drugs for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Some Targeted Therapy Drugs for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer ). This field is rapidly advancing, and additional drugs are being evaluated. Several immune oncology drugs (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab) are available for NSCLC treatment. These drugs stimulate immune responsiveness, assist in the cancer being recognized as foreign, and inhibit the tumor's ability to block the natural immune system response. These drugs are used if the tumor advances despite chemotherapy (most often platinum-based doublets), and extensive work is being done to determine which tumors will respond to this treatment. For example, tumors that have high expression of the PD-L1 protein are responsive to pembrolizumab treatment. For tumors bearing an oncogenic driver mutation, targeted treatments are used first. In stage IV patients with sensitive EGFR mutations (ie, deletion exon 19, exon 21 L858 mutation), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be given as first-line therapy; response rates and progression-free survival are better than those obtained using standard chemotherapy. EGFR TKIs include gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and brigatinib. Osimertinib is the treatment of choice for EGFR mutant NSCLC that has an acquired T790M mutation. In patients with nonsquamous NSCLC without an oncogenic driver mutation, bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, can be used in combination with standard chemotherapy (eg, a platinum-based doublet, such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel) to improve outcomes. Necitumumab is now available for use in combination with cisplatin plus gemcitabine for first-line treatment of NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma. Patients who have EML -4-ALK translocations should receive an ALK and ROS-1 inhibitor (crizotinib, ceritinib, or alectinib). Patients with ALK mutations can be given alectinib or ceritinib. Patients with BRAF mutations benefit from the BRAF inhibitors (eg, dabrafenib, trametinib). Many other targeted biologic agents are under investigation, including some that specifically target cancer cell signal transduction pathways or the angiogenesis pathways that supply oxygen and nutrition to growing tumor cells. Table Recurrent lung cancer Treatment options for lung cancer that recurs after treatment vary by location and include repeat chemotherapy or targeted drugs for metastases, radiation therapy for local recurrence or pain caused by metastases, and brachytherapy for endobronchial disease when additional external radiation cannot be tolerated. Rarely, surgical resection of a solitary metastasis or for palliative purposes is considered. The treatment of a locally recurrent NSCLC follows the same guidelines as for primary tumor stages I to III. If surgery was used initially, radiation therapy is the main modality. If the recurrence manifests as distant metastases, patients are treated as if they have stage IV disease with a focus on palliation. Treatment for recurrent or metastatic stage IV NSCLC includes chemotherapy or targeted drugs. The choice depends on tumor histology, mutational profile, patient functional status, and patient preference. For example, an EGFR TKI, such as gefitinib or erlotinib, can be used as second- or third-line therapy even among patients who do not have sensitive EGFR mutations. When NSCLC progresses, repeat biopsies are commonly done to repeat the mutational analysis, which can guide future treatment.

Pain, anxiety, nausea, and anorexia are especially common and can be treated with parenteral morphine; oral, transdermal, or parenteral opioids; and antiemetics. The care provided by hospice programs is extremely well-accepted by patients and families, yet this intervention is markedly underused. Treatment references 1.

Remediation of high radon levels in private residences removes known cancer-promoting radiation, but a reduction in lung cancer incidence is unproven. Increasing dietary intake of fruits and vegetables high in retinoids and beta-carotene appears to have no effect on lung cancer incidence. Vitamin supplementation is either unproven (vitamin E) or harmful (beta-carotene) in smokers. Evidence suggesting that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and vitamin E supplementation may protect former smokers from lung cancer has not been confirmed. Chemopreventive interventions, aside from smoking cessation, should be done only as part of a clinical trial. Molecular approaches targeting cell signaling and cell cycle pathways and tumor-associated antigens (precision chemoprevention) are under investigation. Key Points The main factor contributing to lung cancer is smoking. About 15% of all lung cancer patients have never smoked cigarettes and have suspected driver mutations. Lung cancer can be small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) or non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Several genetic driver mutations that are amenable to targeted drugs have been identified in NSCLC; newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma should be tested for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 mutations. Manifestations can include cough fever, hoarseness, pleural effusion, pneumonia, Pancoast tumor, paraneoplastic syndromes, superior vena cava syndrome, Horner syndrome, and metastases to the brain, liver, and bone. Suspect the diagnosis based on clinical information and imaging studies (eg, CT, PET-CT), and confirm it histologically (eg, by cytology of sputum or pleural fluid or core biopsy). Consider yearly screening with low-dose helical CT for current or former smokers ≥ 55 years at high risk; shared decision making should occur before imaging is pursued. Do testing, beginning with whole-body imaging, to stage cancer. Treat early-stage NSCLC with resection when pulmonary reserve is adequate, often followed by chemotherapy. Treat advanced stage SCLC and NSCLC with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Genetic testing should be completed on adenocarcinoma to help define treatment regimens.

Young children can acquire the infection when they eat soil contaminated with animal stool (feces) that contain the roundworm eggs. The infection may cause fever, cough or wheezing, and an enlarged liver, and in some people, it may cause vision problems. Doctors confirm the diagnosis by identifying antibodies to the roundworm in a sample of blood. Regularly deworming dogs and cats can help prevent the infection. Treatment is usually unnecessary but may include antiparasitic drugs and corticosteroids.

Although this definition actually... Common.TooltipReadMore .) Toxocariasis occurs mainly in young children, who acquire Toxocara eggs by ingesting soil contaminated by the feces of dogs, cats, or other animals that carry the parasite. Sandboxes, where dogs and cats often defecate, pose a particular hazard for exposure to the eggs. Children frequently transfer the eggs from their hands to their mouth and may eat the contaminated sand. Occasionally, adults ingest eggs picked up from contaminated soil, other surfaces, or hands and become infected. Adults and children who have a craving for nonfoods, such as soil or clay (a condition called pica Pica Pica is an eating disorder characterized by regularly eating things that are not food. Usually, what people with pica eat does not harm them, but sometimes what they eat causes complications... Common.TooltipReadMore ), are at particular risk. After the eggs are swallowed, larvae hatch in the intestine. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and spread through the bloodstream. Almost any tissue of the body may be affected, but the liver and lungs are most commonly involved. The larvae can remain alive for many months, causing damage by moving through tissues and stimulating inflammation. The larvae do not mature to adulthood in people, but they can remain alive in the body for many months. The larvae require another host for maturation: dogs, cats, or other animals. Toxocara eggs may be ingested by other mammals, such as rabbits or sheep. In these animals, the eggs hatch into larvae, which penetrate the wall of the intestine and travel to various tissues where they form cysts. Rarely, people are infected by eating raw or undercooked meat from these animals. Symptoms of Toxocariasis Toxocariasis symptoms may start within several weeks after eggs are ingested. They vary depending on the organ affected. Fever, cough or wheezing, and liver enlargement are the most common. Some people have a rash, spleen enlargement, or recurring pneumonia. They may lose their appetite. When larvae infect the eye (usually only one eye), they typically cause no symptoms or very mild symptoms. However, the eyes may become inflamed, and vision may be impaired or lost. Diagnosis of Toxocariasis Blood tests to detect antibodies to the parasite A doctor may suspect toxocariasis in a person who has an enlarged liver, inflammation of the lungs, a fever, and high levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell). The diagnosis of toxocariasis is confirmed by identifying Toxocara antibodies in the blood.

Common.TooltipReadMore are proteins produced by the immune system to help defend the body against attack, including that by parasites.) Rarely, a sample of liver or other tissue is obtained and examined (biopsied) for evidence of larvae or inflammation resulting from their presence. Prevention of Toxocariasis Prevention involves deworming dogs and cats regularly. Covering sandboxes when not in use prevents animals from defecating in them. Children should be discouraged from eating nonfoods, such as soil and clay, as should adults who have such cravings. Treatment of Toxocariasis If needed, albendazole or mebendazole (drugs used to eliminate worms—anthelmintic drugs) plus corticosteroids Sometimes, laser photocoagulation or surgery when an eye is infected In most people with toxocariasis, the infection resolves on its own, and treatment is unnecessary. Albendazole or mebendazole plus corticosteroids is given when symptoms are severe or the eyes are infected. Eye specialists should be involved in the care of ocular larva migrans because of their expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of infections inside the eye. Even with appropriate care, most people have some loss of vision. Occasionally, laser photocoagulation (application of an intense beam of light) is used to kill larvae in the eyes. Sometimes, doctors use cold probes (cryosurgery) or surgery.

Bilirubin is formed when hemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) is broken down as part of the normal process of recycling old or damaged red blood cells. Bilirubin is carried in the bloodstream to the liver and is excreted in the bile (the digestive juice produced by the liver). Bilirubin is then moved through the bile ducts into the digestive tract, so that it can be eliminated from the body. Most bilirubin is eliminated in stool, but a small amount is eliminated in urine. If bilirubin cannot be moved through the liver and bile ducts quickly enough, it builds up in the blood and is deposited in the skin. The result is jaundice. Many people with jaundice also have dark urine and light-colored stool. These changes occur when a blockage or other problem prevents bilirubin from being eliminated in stool, causing more bilirubin to be eliminated in urine. If bilirubin levels are high, substances formed when bile is broken down may accumulate, causing itching all over the body. But jaundice itself causes few other symptoms in adults.

Hepatitis damages the liver, making it less able to move bilirubin into the bile ducts. Hepatitis may be acute (short-lived) or chronic (lasting at least 6 months). Acute viral hepatitis is a common cause of jaundice, particularly jaundice that occurs in young and otherwise healthy people. When hepatitis is caused by an autoimmune disorder or a drug, it cannot be spread from person to person. Alcohol-related liver disease Drinking large amounts of alcohol over a long period of time damages the liver. The amount of alcohol and time required to cause damage varies, but typically, people must drink heavily for at least 8 to 10 years. Bile duct obstruction If the bile ducts are blocked, bilirubin can build up in the blood. Most blockages are caused by a gallstone, but some are caused by cancer (such as cancer in the pancreas or bile ducts) or rare liver disorders (such as primary biliary cholangitis Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is inflammation with progressive scarring of the bile ducts in the liver.

Other causes of jaundice Some drugs, toxins, and herbal products can also damage the liver (see table Some Causes and Features of Jaundice Some Causes and Features of Jaundice ). Less common causes of jaundice include hereditary disorders that interfere with how the body processes bilirubin. They include Gilbert syndrome and other, less common disorders such as Dubin-Johnson syndrome. In Gilbert syndrome, bilirubin levels are slightly increased but usually not enough to cause jaundice. This disorder is most often detected during routine screening tests in young adults. It causes no other symptoms and no problems. Disorders that cause excessive breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis) often cause jaundice (see Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a group of disorders characterized by a malfunction of the immune system, resulting in the production of autoantibodies that attack red blood cells as if they...

Warning signs In people with jaundice, the following symptoms are cause for concern: Severe abdominal pain and tenderness Changes in mental function, such as drowsiness, agitation, or confusion Blood in stool or tarry black stool Blood in vomit Fever A tendency to bruise or to bleed easily, sometimes resulting in a reddish purple rash of tiny dots or larger splotches (which indicate bleeding in the skin) When to see a doctor If people have any warning signs, they should see a doctor as soon as possible. People with no warning signs should see a doctor within a few days. What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause and the tests that may need to be done (see table Some Causes and Features of Jaundice Some Causes and Features of Jaundice ). Doctors ask when the jaundice started and how long it has been present. They also ask when urine started to look dark (which usually occurs before jaundice develops). People are asked about other symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, changes in stool, and abdominal pain. Doctors are particularly interested in symptoms that suggest a serious cause. For example, sudden loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, and fever suggest hepatitis, particularly in young people and people with risk factors for hepatitis. Fever and severe, constant pain in the upper right part of the abdomen suggest acute cholangitis (infection of the bile ducts), usually in people with a blockage in a bile duct. Acute cholangitis is considered a medical emergency. Doctors ask people whether they have had liver disorders, whether they have had surgery that involved the bile ducts, and whether they take any drugs that can cause jaundice (for example, the prescription drugs amoxicillin/clavulanate, chlorpromazine, azathioprine, and oral contraceptives; alcohol; over-the-counter drugs; medicinal herbs; and other herbal products such as teas). Knowing whether family members have also had jaundice or other liver disorders can help doctors identify hereditary liver disorders.

They gently press on the abdomen to check for lumps, tenderness, swelling, and other abnormalities, such as an enlarged liver or spleen. Table Testing Tests include the following: Blood tests to evaluate how well the liver is functioning and whether it is damaged (liver tests) Usually imaging tests such as ultrasonography Ultrasonography Imaging tests of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tract include ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography...

These tests help doctors determine whether the cause is liver malfunction or a blocked bile duct. If a bile duct is blocked, imaging tests, such as ultrasonography, are usually required. Other blood tests are done based on the disorder doctors suspect and the results of the examination and the initial tests. They may include Tests to assess the blood's ability to clot (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) Tests to check for hepatitis viruses or abnormal antibodies (due to autoimmune disorders) A complete blood count Blood cultures to check for infection of the bloodstream Examination of a blood sample under a microscope to check for excessive destruction of red blood cells If imaging is needed, ultrasonography of the abdomen is often done first. It can usually detect blockages in the bile ducts. Alternatively, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done. If ultrasonography shows a blockage in a bile duct, other tests may be needed to determine the cause. Typically, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Imaging tests of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tract include ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography...

MRCP is MRI of the bile and pancreatic ducts, done with specialized techniques that make the fluid in the ducts appear bright and the surrounding tissues appear dark.

Then x-rays are taken. When available, MRCP is usually preferred because it is just as accurate and is safer. But ERCP may be used because it enables doctors to take a biopsy sample, remove a gallstone, or do other procedures.

Common.TooltipReadMore . That is, doctors may not realize that brain function is deteriorating because the liver is unable to remove toxic substances from the blood (as it usually does) and, thus, the toxic substances can reach the brain. In older people, jaundice usually results from a blockage in the bile ducts, and the blockage is more likely to be cancer. Doctors suspect that the blockage is cancer when older people have lost weight, have only mild itching, have no abdominal pain, and have a lump in the abdomen. Key Points If damage to the liver is severe, jaundice may be accompanied by serious problems, such as deterioration of brain function and a tendency to bleed or bruise. Acute viral hepatitis is a common cause of jaundice, particularly in young and otherwise healthy people. People should see a doctor promptly if they have jaundice so that the doctor can check for serious causes. Cholestyramine may help relieve itching. FAQs for Jaundice in Adults What is jaundice? Jaundice is a yellow color of the skin and eyes caused by having too much bilirubin in the blood. What causes jaundice in adults? Jaundice is caused by excess bilirubin, which is formed when hemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) is broken down as part of the normal process of recycling old or damaged red blood cells. Normally, the bilirubin is processed by the liver and excreted into the digestive tract. Bilirubin can build up in the blood and cause jaundice in the presence of certain kinds of liver damage (particularly from drinking too much alcohol Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol-related liver disease is liver damage caused by drinking too much alcohol for a long time.

Many drugs can cause jaundice in adults, including acetaminophen, amiodarone, isoniazid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anabolic steroids, and a number of antibiotics. What are the symptoms of jaundice in adults? Jaundice causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. The higher the bilirubin level, the yellower the skin. Severe jaundice usually also causes itching. What level of bilirubin causes jaundice in adults? In good light, jaundice may be faintly visible in people whose bilirubin levels are between 2 and 3 mg/dL (34 to 51 micromol/L). A bilirubin level of 20 mg/dL (342 micromol/L) can make the skin bright yellow, like a lemon.

Depending on when they are born, preterm newborns have underdeveloped organs, which may not be ready to function outside of the uterus. A previous preterm birth, multiple births, poor nutrition during pregnancy, late prenatal care, infections, assisted reproductive techniques (such as in vitro fertilization), and high blood pressure can increase the risk of a preterm birth. Because many organs are underdeveloped, preterm newborns may have difficulty breathing and feeding and are prone to bleeding in the brain, infections, and other problems. The earliest and smallest preterm newborns are at far greater risk of having problems, including developmental problems. Although some preterm newborns grow up with permanent problems, the majority of survivors have mild or no long-term problems. Early prenatal care may decrease the risk of a preterm birth. Preterm birth can sometimes be delayed for a brief period by giving the mother medications to slow or stop contractions. When an infant is expected to be delivered significantly early, doctors can give the mother injections of a corticosteroid to speed the development of the fetus’s lungs and help prevent bleeding in the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage).

The gestational age is the number of weeks between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery. This time frame is often adjusted according to other information doctors receive, including the results of early ultrasound scans, which give additional information regarding the gestational age. The baby is estimated to be due (the due date) at 40 weeks of gestation. Newborns are classified by gestational age as preterm if they are delivered before 37 weeks of gestation. Preterm infants are further categorized as Extremely preterm: Delivered before 28 weeks of gestation Very preterm: Delivered at 28 to before 32 weeks of gestation Moderately preterm: Delivered at 32 to before 34 weeks of gestation Late preterm: Delivered at 34 to before 37 weeks of gestation About 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States is born before full term.

Risk of complications also depends in part on the presence of certain causes of prematurity, such as infection, diabetes, high blood pressure, or preeclampsia. Underdeveloped brain Several problems arise when an infant is born before the brain is fully developed. These problems include Inconsistent breathing: The part of the brain that controls regular breathing may be so immature that preterm newborns breathe inconsistently, with short pauses in breathing or periods during which breathing stops completely for 20 seconds or longer (apnea of prematurity Apnea of Prematurity Apnea (not breathing) of prematurity is a pause in breathing that lasts for 20 seconds or more in an infant born before 37 weeks of gestation who is not known to have any underlying disorder...

Underdeveloped digestive tract and liver An underdeveloped digestive tract and liver can cause several problems, including the following: Frequent episodes of spitting-up: Initially, preterm newborns may have difficulty with feedings. Not only do they have immature sucking and swallowing reflexes, but their small stomach empties slowly, which can lead to frequent episodes of spitting up (reflux Gastroesophageal Reflux in Children Gastroesophageal reflux is the backward movement of food and acid from the stomach into the esophagus and sometimes into the mouth. Reflux may be caused by the infant’s position during feeding... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Frequent episodes of not tolerating feedings: The intestines of preterm newborns move very slowly, and preterm newborns frequently have difficulty passing stools. Because of the slow movement of the intestinal tract, preterm infants do not easily digest the breast milk or formula they are given. Intestinal damage: Very preterm newborns may develop a serious condition in which part of the intestine becomes severely damaged and may cause infection (called necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Necrotizing enterocolitis is injury to the inner surface of the intestine. This disorder occurs most often in newborns who are premature and/or seriously ill. The abdomen may be swollen, stools... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Hyperbilirubinemia: Preterm newborns are prone to developing hyperbilirubinemia Jaundice in the Newborn Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream. Bilirubin is a yellow substance formed when hemoglobin (the part of red blood cells... Common.TooltipReadMore . In hyperbilirubinemia, the newborn's liver is slow in clearing bilirubin (the yellow bile pigment that results from the normal breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood. Thus, the yellow pigment accumulates, giving the skin and the whites of the eyes a yellow color (jaundice). Preterm newborns tend to become jaundiced in the first few days after birth. Usually, jaundice is mild and resolves as newborns take in larger amounts during feedings and have more frequent bowel movements (bilirubin is removed in the stool, giving it its bright yellow color at first). Rarely, very high levels of bilirubin accumulate and put newborns at risk of developing kernicterus. Kernicterus Complications of jaundice Jaundice is a yellow color to the skin and/or eyes caused by an increase in bilirubin in the bloodstream.

The use of invasive devices for treatment, such as catheters in blood vessels and breathing tubes (endotracheal tubes), further increases the risk of developing serious bacterial infections. Underdeveloped kidneys Before delivery, waste products produced in the fetus are removed by the placenta and then excreted by the mother’s kidneys. After delivery, the newborn’s kidneys must take over these functions. Kidney function is diminished in very preterm newborns but improves as the kidneys mature. Newborns with underdeveloped kidneys may have difficulty regulating the amount of salt and other electrolytes as well as water in the body. Kidney problems may lead to growth failure and a buildup of acid in the blood (called metabolic acidosis Acidosis Acidosis is caused by an overproduction of acid that builds up in the blood or an excessive loss of bicarbonate from the blood (metabolic acidosis) or by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Underdeveloped lungs The lungs of preterm newborns may not have had enough time to fully develop before birth. The tiny air sacs called alveoli that absorb oxygen from the air and remove carbon dioxide from the blood are not formed until about the beginning of the last third of pregnancy (third trimester). In addition to this structural development, the tissues of the lungs must make a fatty material called surfactant. Surfactant coats the inside of the air sacs and allows them to remain open throughout the breathing cycle, making it easy to breathe. Without surfactant, the air sacs tend to collapse at the end of each breath, making breathing very difficult. Usually, the lungs do not make surfactant until about 32 weeks of pregnancy, and production is typically not adequate until about 34 to 36 weeks. These factors mean that babies born early are at risk of breathing problems, including respiratory distress syndrome Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Newborns Respiratory distress syndrome is a lung disorder in premature newborns in which the air sacs in their lungs do not remain open because a substance that coats the air sacs called surfactant is...

Some people with respiratory failure need a mechanical ventilator (a machine that helps air get... Common.TooltipReadMore (a machine that helps air get in and out of the lungs). The more preterm the newborn, the less surfactant is available, and the greater the likelihood that respiratory distress syndrome will develop. There is no treatment to make the lung structure mature more rapidly, but with adequate nutrition, the lungs continue to mature over time. There are two approaches to increase the amount of surfactant and reduce the likelihood and severity of respiratory distress: Before birth: Corticosteroid medications such as betamethasone increase surfactant production in the fetus and are given to the mother by injection when a preterm delivery is anticipated, typically 24 to 48 hours before delivery. After birth: Doctors may give surfactant directly into the newborn's windpipe (trachea). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disorder in newborns caused by extended use of a ventilator (a machine that helps air get in and out of the lungs) and/or extended need for supplemental... Common.TooltipReadMore (BPD) is a chronic lung disorder that can occur in preterm newborns, particularly the least mature infants. Most infants who have BPD have had respiratory distress syndrome and needed treatment with a ventilator. In BPD, the lungs develop scar tissue and the infant needs continued help with breathing, sometimes with a ventilator. In most cases, the infant very slowly recovers from the disease.

Common.TooltipReadMore is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina is nourished by blood vessels on its surface. The blood vessels grow from the center of the retina to the edges during the course of the pregnancy and do not finish growing until near term. In preterm infants, particularly the least mature infants, the blood vessels may stop growing and/or grow abnormally. Many preterm infants need extra oxygen, and this also can cause the blood vessels of the retina to grow abnormally. The abnormal vessels can bleed or cause scar tissue that can pull on the retina. This disorder is called retinopathy of prematurity Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Retinopathy of prematurity is a disorder of premature infants in which the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina) grow abnormally. Retinopathy of prematurity is strongly associated... Common.TooltipReadMore and it occurs after birth. In the most severe cases, the retina detaches from the back of the eye and causes blindness. Preterm infants, particularly those born before 31 weeks of gestational age, typically have periodic eye examinations so doctors can look for abnormal development of the blood vessels. If there is a high risk of retinal detachment, doctors may use laser treatments or give a medication called bevacizumab. Preterm newborns are also at increased risk of developing other eye problems, such as nearsightedness Causes (myopia), misalignment of the eyes (strabismus Strabismus Strabismus is an intermittent or constant misalignment of an eye so that its line of vision is not pointed at the same object as the other eye.

Difficulty regulating blood sugar levels Because preterm newborns have difficulty feeding and maintaining normal blood sugar (glucose) levels, they are often treated with glucose solutions given by vein (intravenously) or given small, frequent feedings. Without regular feedings, preterm newborns may develop low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes. Much less common causes of hypoglycemia include... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Most newborns with hypoglycemia do not develop symptoms. Other newborns become listless with poor muscle tone, feed poorly, or become jittery. Rarely, seizures develop. Preterm newborns are also prone to developing high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) if they have an infection or bleeding in the brain or receive too much glucose intravenously. However, hyperglycemia rarely causes symptoms and can be controlled by limiting the amount of glucose given to the newborn or by using insulin for a short period of time. Heart problems A common issue among less mature infants is a patent ductus arteriosus Patent Ductus Arteriosus In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta (ductus arteriosus) fails to close as it usually does shortly after birth.

Some are severe, but many are not. Defects may involve abnormal formation of the heart's walls or valves or of the blood vessels that enter... Common.TooltipReadMore ). In a full-term infant, the muscle wall of the ductus arteriosis closes the blood vessel in the first few hours or days of life. In preterm infants, however, the blood vessel may stay open, resulting in excessive blood flow through the lungs and requiring more work from the heart. In most preterm infants, the PDA eventually closes on its own, but medications are sometimes given to help the PDA close more quickly. In some cases, a surgical procedure to close the PDA is done. Difficulty regulating body temperature Body temperature is maintained by the brain. Because preterm newborns do not have a mature brain, they have trouble regulating their body temperature. Preterm newborns have a large skin surface area relative to their weight compared to full-term newborns, so they tend to lose heat rapidly and have difficulty maintaining normal body temperature, especially if they are in a cool room, there is a draft, or they are near a window when it is cold outside. If the baby is not kept warm, the body temperature falls (called hypothermia Hypothermia Hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature) is often regarded as a cold injury, because it can be caused or made worse by exposure to cold surroundings.

The most important factors in determining outcome are Birthweight Degree of prematurity Whether the mother was given corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours before a preterm delivery Complications that arise after birth The sex of the baby also affects the likelihood of a good outcome: girls have a better prognosis than boys who have the same degree of prematurity. Survival itself is rare if infants are born at less than 23 weeks of gestation. Infants born at 23 to 24 weeks may survive, but few survive without some degree of neurologic injury. Most infants born after 27 weeks of gestation survive without neurologic problems.

Treatment of Preterm Newborns Treatment of complications Treatment of prematurity involves managing the complications resulting from underdeveloped organs. All specific disorders are treated as needed. For instance, preterm newborns may be given treatments that help with breathing problems (such as mechanical ventilation for lung disease and surfactant treatment), antibiotics for infections, blood transfusions for anemia, and laser surgery for eye disease or they may need special imaging studies like echocardiography Echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.

Because breast milk is low in some nutrients like calcium, it may need to be mixed with a fortifying solution for newborns who have a very low birthweight. Infant formulas made specifically for preterm infants that are high in calories also can be used when necessary. Very preterm newborns may require a medication that prompts them to breathe, such as caffeine, until the part of the brain that controls regular breathing has matured. To keep warm, these newborns need to be kept in an incubator until they are able to maintain a normal body temperature. Extremely preterm newborns Extremely preterm newborns require all the same care as very preterm newborns. Like very preterm newborns, these newborns cannot be released from the hospital until they are able to breathe on their own, take oral feedings, maintain a normal body temperature, and gain weight. Discharge from the hospital Preterm infants typically remain hospitalized until their medical problems are under satisfactory control and they are Taking an adequate amount of milk without special assistance Gaining weight steadily Able to maintain a normal body temperature in a crib No longer having pauses in breathing (apnea of prematurity) Most preterm infants are ready to go home when they are at 35 to 37 weeks of gestational age and weigh 4 to 5 pounds (2 to 2.5 kilograms). However, there is wide variation. The length of time the infant stays in the hospital does not affect the long-term prognosis. Because preterm newborns are at risk of stopping breathing (apnea), and having low levels of oxygen in the blood and a slow heart rate while in a car seat, many hospitals in the United States do a car seat challenge test before preterm babies are discharged. The test is done to determine whether babies are stable in the semi-reclined position of a car seat. This test is usually done using the car seat provided by the parents. Preterm babies, including those who pass the test, should be observed by a non-driving adult during all car seat travel until the babies have reached the due date and have remained consistently able to tolerate being in the car seat. Because the baby's color should be observed, travel should be limited to daylight hours. Long trips should be broken up into 45- to 60-minute segments so that the baby can be taken out of the car seat and repositioned. Surveys show that most car seats are not installed optimally, so a check of the car seat by a certified car seat inspector is recommended. Inspection sites can be found here. Some hospitals offer an inspection service, but casual advice provided by an uncertified hospital staff member should not be considered equivalent to inspection by a certified car seat expert. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that car seats be used only for vehicular transportation and not as an infant seat or bed at home. Many doctors also recommend that parents do not put preterm infants in swings or bouncy seats for the first few months at home. After discharge, preterm infants are carefully monitored for developmental problems and receive physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy as needed.

Doctors insert a thin flexible tube (catheter) into a large blood vessel (for example, in your leg) and thread it up to your heart. The catheter has electrodes on its tip that record your heart's electrical activity from the inside. The catheter can also stimulate your heart electrically to see how it responds. If the test shows that one small bit of heart tissue is causing the SVT, getting rid of the tissue often fixes the rhythm problem. Doctors use a catheter that delivers a high-frequency electrical current to destroy the tissue that's causing the problem.

Children may be unable to explain inner feelings or moods. Depression should be considered when previously well-performing children do poorly in school, withdraw from society, or commit delinquent acts.

Major depressive disorder Major depressive disorder is a discrete depressive episode lasting ≥ 2 weeks. It occurs in as many as 2% of children and 5% of adolescents. Major depressive disorder can first occur at any age but is more common after puberty. Untreated, major depression may remit in 6 to 12 months. Risk of recurrence is higher in patients who have severe episodes, who are younger, or who have had multiple episodes. Persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a strong predictor of recurrence. For diagnosis, ≥ 1 of the following must be present for most of the day nearly every day during the same 2-week period: Feeling sad or being observed by others to be sad (eg, tearful) or irritable Loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities (often expressed as profound boredom) In addition, ≥ 4 of the following must be present: Decrease in weight (in children, failure to make the expected weight gain) or decrease or increase in appetite Insomnia or hypersomnia Psychomotor agitation or retardation observed by others (not self-reported) Fatigue or loss of energy Decreased ability to think, concentrate, and make choices Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying) and/or suicidal ideation or plans Feelings of worthlessness (ie, feeling rejected and unloved) or excessive or inappropriate guilt Major depression in adolescents is a risk factor for academic failure, substance abuse Overview of Substance Use Substance-related disorders involve substances that directly activate the brain's reward system.

In very severe depression, psychotic symptoms may emerge. Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Dysthymia is a persistent depressed or irritable mood that lasts for most of the day for more days than not for ≥ 1 year plus ≥ 2 of the following: Poor appetite or overeating Insomnia or hypersomnia Low energy or fatigue Low self-esteem Poor concentration Feelings of hopelessness Symptoms may be more or less intense than those of a major depressive disorder. A major depressive episode may occur before the onset or during the first year (ie, before the duration criterion is met for persistent depressive disorder). Diagnosis of Depressive Disorders Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of depressive disorders is based on symptoms and signs, including the criteria listed above. Sources of information include an interview with the child or adolescent and information from parents and teachers. Several brief questionnaires are available for screening. They help identify some depressive symptoms but cannot be used alone for diagnosis. Specific close-ended questions help determine whether patients have the symptoms required for diagnosis of major depression, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria. History should include causative factors such as domestic violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, and drug adverse effects.

After depression is diagnosed, the family and social setting must be evaluated to identify stresses that may have precipitated depression. Treatment of Depressive Disorders Concurrent measures directed at the family and school For adolescents, usually antidepressants plus psychotherapy For preadolescents, psychotherapy followed, if needed, by antidepressants Appropriate measures directed at the family and school must accompany direct treatment of the child to enhance continued functioning and provide appropriate educational accommodations. Brief hospitalization may be necessary in acute crises, especially when suicidal behavior is identified. For adolescents (as for adults), a combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants usually greatly outperforms either modality used alone (1 Treatment references: General Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ). For preadolescents, the situation is much less clear. Most clinicians opt for psychotherapy in younger children; however, drugs can be used in younger children (fluoxetine can be used in children ≥ 8 years), especially when depression is severe or has not previously responded to psychotherapy. Usually, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; see table Drugs for Long-Term Treatment of Depression, Anxiety, and Related Disorders Drugs for Long-Term Treatment of Depression, Anxiety, and Related Disorders ) is the first choice when an antidepressant is indicated (2 Treatment references: General Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ). Children should be closely monitored for the emergence of behavioral side effects (eg, disinhibition, behavioral activation), which are common but are usually mild to moderate. Usually, decreasing the drug dose or changing to a different drug eliminates or reduces these effects. Rarely, such effects are severe (eg, aggressiveness, increased suicidality). Behavioral adverse effects are idiosyncratic and may occur with any antidepressant and at any time during treatment. As a result, children and adolescents taking such drugs must be closely monitored. Adult-based research has suggested that antidepressants that act on both the serotonergic and adrenergic/dopaminergic systems may be modestly more effective; however, such drugs (eg, duloxetine, venlafaxine, mirtazapine; certain tricyclics, particularly clomipramine) also tend to have more adverse effects. Such drugs may be especially useful in treatment-resistant cases. Nonserotonergic antidepressants such as bupropion and desipramine may also be used with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to enhance efficacy. In very severe depression, psychotic and/or manic symptoms may require treatment with an antipsychotic drug Antipsychotic Drugs Antipsychotic drugs are divided into conventional antipsychotics and 2nd-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) based on their specific neurotransmitter receptor affinity and activity. SGAs may offer... read more (3, 4 Treatment references: General Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation—although not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in youths—has been used, particularly when patients do not respond to or tolerate drugs (5 Treatment references: General Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ).

Most experts recommend that children who have experienced ≥ 2 episodes of major depression be treated indefinitely. Table Treatment references: General 1.

Diagnosis is by history and... read more ). In 2004, the US FDA did a meta-analysis of 23 previously conducted trials of 9 different antidepressants (2 Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ). Although no patients completed suicide in these trials, a small but statistically significant increase in suicidal ideation was noted in children and adolescents taking an antidepressant (about 4% vs about 2%), leading to a black box warning on all classes of antidepressants (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine, and tetracyclic antidepressants such as mirtazapine). In 2006, a meta-analysis (from the United Kingdom) of children and adolescents being treated for depression (3 Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ) found that compared with patients taking a placebo, those taking an antidepressant had a small increase in self-harm or suicide-related events (4.8% vs 3.0% of those treated with placebo). However, whether the difference was statistically significant or not varied depending on the type of analysis (fixed-effects analysis or random-effects analysis). There was a nonsignificant trend toward an increase in suicidal ideation (1.2% vs 0.8%), self-harm (3.3% vs 2.6%), and suicide attempts (1.9% vs 1.2%). There appear to have been some differences in risk between different drugs; however, no direct head-to-head studies have been done, and it is difficult to control for severity of depression and other confounding risk factors. Observational and epidemiologic studies (4, 5 Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ) have found no increase in the rate of suicide attempts or completed suicide in patients taking antidepressants. Also, despite a decrease in prescriptions for antidepressants following the black-box warning, the adolescent suicide rate increased by 14% (6, 7 Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ). Using commercial claims data to estimate risks and benefits of medications in relation to suicidal events, SSRIs were associated with significantly decreased suicidal events (8 Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness or irritability that is severe or persistent enough to interfere with functioning or cause considerable distress. Diagnosis is by history and... read more ) . In general, although antidepressants have limited efficacy in children and adolescents, the benefits appear to outweigh risks. The best approach seems to be combining drug treatment with psychotherapy and minimizing risk by closely monitoring treatment. Whether or not drugs are used, suicide is always a concern in a child or adolescent with depression. The following should be done to reduce risk: Parents and mental health care practitioners should discuss the issues in depth. The child or adolescent should be supervised at an appropriate level. Psychotherapy with regularly scheduled appointments should be included in the treatment plan. Pearls & Pitfalls Suicide risk is always a concern in children or adolescents with depression whether they are taking antidepressants or not. Treatment references: Suicide risk and antidepressants 1.

Harvard Data Sci Rev 2019. doi: 10.1162/99608f92.6fdaa9de Key Points In children, depressive disorders may manifest as sadness or irritability. Major depressive disorder involves feeling sad or irritable or losing interest or pleasure in almost all activities for most of the day nearly every day during a 2-week period plus other specific symptoms. Diagnose a depressive disorder based on specific clinical criteria, and do appropriate laboratory tests to exclude other disorders (eg, infectious mononucleosis, thyroid disorders, drug abuse). Involve the family and school while treating the child to enhance the child's continued functioning and provide appropriate educational accommodations. For adolescents (as for adults), a combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants usually greatly outperforms either modality used alone; in younger children, most clinicians opt for psychotherapy although if needed, drugs can be used (depending on the child's age). In 2004, the FDA did a meta-analysis that led to a black box warning of an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults with all classes of antidepressants; subsequent analyses have cast doubt on this conclusion.

In selecting an antibiotic to treat a person with an infection, doctors evaluate which bacteria are likely to be the cause. For example, some infections are caused only by certain types of bacteria. Sometimes one antibiotic is predictably effective against all of the bacteria that are most likely to be causing an infection and so further testing may not be needed. If infections may be caused by many different types of bacteria or by bacteria that are not predictably susceptible to antibiotics, a laboratory is asked to identify the infecting bacteria Diagnosis of Infectious Disease Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

The infecting bacteria are then tested for susceptibility to a variety of antibiotics. Results of these tests usually take a day or two and thus cannot guide the initial choice of antibiotic if the infection needs to be treated immediately. In such cases, doctors typically start treatment with an antibiotic that is effective against the bacteria most likely to be causing the infection. When test results are back, doctors change the antibiotic if needed. Antibiotics that are effective in the laboratory do not necessarily work in an infected person. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on How well the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream (for drugs taken by mouth Oral route Drugs are introduced into the body by several routes. They may be Taken by mouth (orally) Given by injection into a vein (intravenously, IV), into a muscle (intramuscularly, IM), into the space...

(See also Introduction to Administration and Kinetics of Drugs.) All drugs are eventually eliminated from the body. They may be eliminated... Common.TooltipReadMore ) These factors may vary from person to person, depending on other drugs being taken, other disorders present, and the person’s age. In selecting an antibiotic, doctors also consider the following: The nature and seriousness of the infection The status of the person's immune system (how well it can help the drug fight the infection) The drug’s possible side effects The possibility of allergies or other serious reactions to the drug The cost of the drug Doctors also consider how hard it may be for people to take antibiotics for the entire time prescribed and complete the full course of treatment. People may find it more difficult to complete treatment if the drug must be taken very often or only at specific times (such as before meals, during meals, or after meals). Combinations of antibiotics may be needed to treat the following: Severe infections, particularly during the first days when the bacteria's susceptibility to antibiotics is not known Certain infections caused by bacteria that rapidly develop resistance to a single antibiotic Infections caused by more than one type of bacteria if each type is susceptible to a different antibiotic Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria, like all living organisms, change over time in response to environmental challenges. Because of the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics (when antibiotics are not taken as prescribed), bacteria are constantly exposed to these drugs. Although many bacteria die when exposed to antibiotics, if antibiotics are not taken appropriately, some bacteria survive and develop resistance Antibiotic resistance Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms. They are among the earliest known life forms on earth. There are thousands of different kinds of bacteria, and they live in every conceivable... Common.TooltipReadMore to the drugs’ effects. For example, 50 years ago, Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of skin infections) was very sensitive to penicillin. But over time, strains of this bacteria developed an enzyme able to break down penicillin, making the drug ineffective. Researchers responded by developing a form of penicillin that the enzyme could not break down, but after a few years, the bacteria adapted and became resistant to this modified penicillin. Other bacteria have also developed resistance to antibiotics. Medical research continues to develop drugs to combat bacteria. But people can help prevent the development of resistance in bacteria by Understanding that antibiotics are used to treat bacteria, not viral infections (such as the common cold or the flu), and that doctors do not prescribe antibiotics for these viral infections Taking antibiotics exactly as directed, including the correct dose, numbers of times per day, and number of days (it is important to take antibiotics for the full number of days prescribed, even if a person is feeling better) Did You Know... If a virus is causing the infection, taking antibiotics is useless and can contribute to the development of resistance in bacteria.

For less severe infections, antibiotics can often be taken by mouth from the start. Spotlight on Aging: Antibiotics When doctors prescribe antibiotics for older people, they may prescribe a lower dose than usual because the kidneys tend to function less well as people age. In such cases, the kidneys may not be able to eliminate antibiotics from the body as effectively, increasing the risk of side effects. (See also Aging and Drugs Aging and Medications Medications, the most common medical intervention, are an important part of medical care for older people. Without medications, many older people would function less well or die at an earlier... Common.TooltipReadMore .) Doctors also consider the following: What other drugs the person is taking because older people tend to take many drugs and drug interactions are a risk Whether the antibiotic regimen is complex and hard to follow Whether the person has family members or caregivers who can help the person take the antibiotic as prescribed Whether the person lives in a nursing home because different bacteria may cause infections in such situations Antibiotics need to be taken until the infecting bacteria are eliminated from the body, which may be days after the symptoms disappear. Stopping treatment too soon can result in a return of the infection. A doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can explain how the prescribed antibiotic should be taken and what side effects it may have. Some antibiotics must be taken on an empty stomach. Others should be taken with food.

Home Antibiotic Therapy Usually, antibiotics taken outside the hospital are given by mouth.

Common.TooltipReadMore )—may require antibiotics to be given by vein (intravenously) for a long time, often 4 to 6 weeks. If people have no other conditions that need treatment in the hospital and are feeling relatively well, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be given at home. When antibiotics have to be given a long time, the short IV catheters that are inserted into a small vein in the arm or hand (such as those used in most routine hospital procedures) may not be desirable. These catheters last only up to 3 days. Instead, a special type of IV catheter is used. It may be inserted either Directly into a large central vein, usually in the neck or chest (called a central catheter) Into a small vein in the arm and threaded into a large central vein (called a peripherally inserted central catheter, or a PICC) Some devices for giving antibiotics IV are simple enough that people and their family members can learn to operate them on their own. In other cases, a visiting nurse must come to the home to give each dose. In either situation, people are carefully supervised to make sure the antibiotic is being given correctly and to watch for possible complications and side effects. If antibiotics are given at home through an IV catheter, the risk of developing an infection at the site where the catheter is inserted and in the bloodstream is increased. The following may indicate a catheter-related infection: Pain, redness, and pus at the catheter insertion site Chills and fever (even without problems at the insertion site) Side Effects of Antibiotics Common side effects of antibiotics include Upset stomach Diarrhea Gastroenteritis as a Side Effect of Drugs In women, vaginal yeast infections Vaginal Yeast Infection (Candidiasis) The vagina is infected by a yeast called Candida, usually Candida albicans, resulting in a yeast infection called candidiasis. Being pregnant or having diabetes or a weakened immune... Common.TooltipReadMore Some side effects are more severe and, depending on the antibiotic, may impair the function of the kidneys, liver, bone marrow, or other organs. Blood tests are sometimes done to determine whether these organs have been affected. Colitis, an inflammation of the large intestine (colon), develops in some people who take antibiotics, especially cephalosporins, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, or penicillins. This type of colitis, called Clostridioides difficile–induced colitis Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile-Induced Colitis Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)–induced colitis is an inflammation of the large intestine (colon) that results in diarrhea. The inflammation is caused by toxin produced... Common.TooltipReadMore , results from toxins produced by the bacteria Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). These bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics and grow in the intestines unchecked when other normal bacteria in the intestine are killed by the antibiotics. Clostridioides difficile–induced colitis can be difficult to treat and can be life threatening, especially in older people. Allergic Reactions to Antibiotics Antibiotics can also cause allergic reactions Allergies to Drugs People sometimes mistake many adverse drug reactions for allergies. For example, people who experience stomach discomfort after taking aspirin (a common adverse reaction) often say they are... Common.TooltipReadMore . Mild allergic reactions may consist of an itchy rash or slight wheezing. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions are sudden, widespread, potentially severe and life-threatening allergic reactions. Anaphylactic reactions often begin with a feeling of uneasiness, followed by tingling... Common.TooltipReadMore ) can be life threatening and usually include swelling of the throat, inability to breathe, and low blood pressure. It is important for people to tell health care practitioners if they are allergic to a particular antibiotic and to describe their past reaction when treated with that antibiotic. Many people have side effects when taking an antibiotic, but these effects may not be allergy-related (see Allergies to Drugs Allergies to Drugs People sometimes mistake many adverse drug reactions for allergies. For example, people who experience stomach discomfort after taking aspirin (a common adverse reaction) often say they are... Common.TooltipReadMore ). The distinction is important because people who are allergic to an antibiotic should not be given that drug or an antibiotic closely related to it. That is because allergic reactions may be life threatening. However, people who have experienced only minor side effects can usually take related drugs or even continue taking the same drug. Health care practitioners can determine the significance of any unpleasant reaction people have to an antibiotic.

Treatment of Pityriasis Rosea Antipruritic therapy No specific treatment is necessary because the eruption usually remits within 5 weeks and recurrence is rare. Artificial or natural sunlight may hasten resolution. Antipruritic therapy such as topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or topical measures may be used as needed. Some data suggest that acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times a day for 7 days may be helpful in patients who present early and have widespread disease, or present with flu-like symptoms. Of note, pityriasis rosea during pregnancy (especially during the first 15 weeks of gestation) is associated with premature birth or fetal demise. Pregnant women should be offered acyclovir; however, antiviral therapy has not proved to reduce obstetric complications. Key Points Pityriasis rosea is a self-limited, inflammatory disorder of the skin possibly caused by human herpesvirus types 6, 7, or 8 or drugs. An initial 2- to 10-cm herald patch is followed by centripetal eruption of oval papules and plaques with a slightly raised and scaly border, typically appearing along skin lines.

Although in-person visits have several advantages, telemedicine is a valuable alternative when in-person visits are unsafe or not feasible. Advances in technology have made it possible for doctors to interact with their patients when they cannot or should not meet in person. Telemedicine involves the use of: Telephone calls Text messages Emails (usually sent via a patient portal—a secure site where the patient's electronic records, including prescriptions, health history, and laboratory test results, are kept) Video chats using the internet Not all doctors are set up to provide telemedicine, and not all medical conditions can or should be treated remotely. (Telehealth is the term used to describe a wider range of nonclinical services used to support telemedicine.) People need to have the equipment, services, and software necessary to use telemedicine. When arranging a telemedicine appointment, someone from the doctor's office will check that the patient has some or all of the following: a telephone, reliable internet service, and a smartphone or computer capable of supporting any applications the office uses to set up remote doctor visits. The doctor's office will likely ask the patient to test the connection before the virtual appointment takes place. The office may also establish a backup plan in case the primary connection fails. For example, a video chat may go awry if the audio or video fails, in which case it may be necessary to continue the session by phone. The person or a member of the health care team may need to visit the patient portal before the virtual appointment, either in advance or as part of the check-in procedure; sometimes it is done during the visit too. Telemedicine can be useful for people who have Limited access to health care, including those who live in rural areas or far from the doctor's office Difficulty with movement, such as those with Parkinson disease or other mobility issues Limited or no transportation A disorder or situation (for example, a viral epidemic) that makes an in-person visit unsafe Some medical conditions are more suitable for telemedicine management than others. Chronic conditions that require frequent monitoring, including at-home readings, such as blood pressure and blood sugar, can often be managed using telemedicine. People can share and discuss the data they collect at home during a virtual appointment. They may also be able to log that data into their patient portal for the doctor to review before the appointment. The patient portal is useful in other ways. For example, people can request or obtain electronically stored health information from the patient portal instead of waiting for the doctor's office to call with the information. Some conditions such as specific rashes (for example, shingles) can be diagnosed using telemedicine video or transmitted photographs. For doctors, telemedicine is useful for determining when an office visit is absolutely necessary. During a public health crisis that involves an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, health care facilities seek to limit the risk of exposure to health care practitioners and patients alike. Telemedicine gives the health care team enough advance warning to prepare to safely meet the needs of individual patients while adhering to protocols that protect the health care practitioners themselves as well as others. Doctors can help determine at a safe distance If a condition needs no intervention (for example, the common cold or an asymptomatic or mild case of COVID-19) If a condition needs to be confirmed by a test or treated in person (for example, a sore throat that needs to be cultured or a suspected case of COVID-19 that requires testing or treatment) If a condition requires immediate or urgent care in a hospital setting How to make the most of telemedicine Making the most of telemedicine is a lot like making the most of any health care visit Making the Most of a Health Care Visit Preparing for a health care visit helps people get the most out of time spent with a doctor or another health care practitioner.

It is important to test the technology before the scheduled virtual visit. That way, there is time to resolve any problems. It may be necessary for people to upgrade their technology to meet the demands of telemedicine (for example, by increasing their internet bandwidth). It may help to make certain preparations for the specific visit (for example, taking and uploading photos of a skin rash) No matter how well the technology works, a backup plan is important (for example, being prepared to complete an interrupted video session by phone). At the end of a telemedicine session, the doctor may recommend that additional medical attention be provided in a more traditional office setting.

Cancer Cells VIDEO Initiation The first step in cancer development is initiation, in which a change in a cell’s genetic material (a mutation) primes the cell to become cancerous. The change in the cell’s genetic material may occur spontaneously as a random event or due to a gene mutation or be brought on by an external exposure to a substance that causes cancer (a carcinogen). Carcinogens Some Carcinogens include many chemicals, tobacco, viruses, radiation, and sunlight. However, not all cells are equally susceptible to carcinogens. And not all people exposed to a carcinogen will develop cancer. The risk depends on many factors, for example, the amount of exposure the person had to that carcinogen or whether the person has a genetic predisposition to a certain type of cancer. Promotion The second and final step in the development of cancer is promotion. Agents that cause promotion, or promoters, may be substances in the environment or even some medications, such as sex hormones (for example, testosterone taken to improve sex drive and energy in older men). Unlike carcinogens, promoters do not cause cancer by themselves. Instead, promoters allow a cell that has undergone initiation to become cancerous. Promotion has no effect on cells that have not undergone initiation. Some carcinogens are sufficiently powerful to be able to cause cancer without the need for promotion.

The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic; the first symptom of cervical cancer is usually irregular, often postcoital vaginal bleeding. Diagnosis is by a cervical Papanicolaou test and biopsy. Staging is clinical, combined with imaging and pathology results when available. Treatment usually involves surgical resection for early-stage disease or radiation therapy plus chemotherapy for locally advanced disease. If the cancer has widely metastasized, chemotherapy is often used alone. Cervical cancer is the 3rd most common gynecologic cancer and the 8th most common cancer among women in the US. Mean age at diagnosis is 50; it is frequently diagnosed in women aged 35 to 44 years. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2021, there were 14,480 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and 4290 deaths (1 Arteries of the heart ). Worldwide, cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher in low- or middle-income countries; rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Among females, it is the most common cancer in 23 countries and the leading cause of cancer death in 36 countries (2 Arteries of the heart ).

The ectocervix protrudes into the vagina and is lined with squamous epithelium. The endocervix (a canal that passes from the internal os to the external os) is lined with columnar epithelium. Nearly all cervical carcinomas originate in the transformation zone, which surrounds the external os; the transformation zone is an area of squamous metaplasia between the original and current squamocolumnar junction (1 Pathology reference Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is graded as 1: Mild cervical dysplasia 2: Moderate dysplasia 3: Severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ CIN 3 is unlikely to regress spontaneously; if untreated, it may, over months or years, penetrate the basement membrane, becoming invasive carcinoma. About 80 to 85% of all cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinoma; most of the rest are adenocarcinomas. Sarcomas and small cell neuroendocrine tumors are rare. Invasive cervical cancer usually spreads by direct extension into surrounding tissues or via the lymphatics to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. Hematogenous spread is possible but rare. If cervical cancer spreads to the pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes, the prognosis is worse, and the location and size of the radiation therapy field is affected. Pathology reference 1. Bhatla N, Aoki D, Sharma DN, et al: Cancer of the cervix uteri: 2021 update. Int J Gynaecol Obstet 155 Suppl 1:28-44, 2021. doi: 10.1002/ijgo.13865 Symptoms and Signs of Cervical Cancer Early cervical cancer can be asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they usually include irregular vaginal bleeding, which is most often postcoital, but may occur spontaneously between menses. Larger cancers are more likely to bleed spontaneously and may cause a foul-smelling vaginal discharge or pelvic pain. More widespread cancer may cause obstructive uropathy, back pain, and leg swelling due to venous or lymphatic obstruction. Pelvic examination may detect an exophytic necrotic cervical tumor; however, most cervical cancers cannot be seen without magnification. Diagnosis of Cervical Cancer Papanicolaou (Pap) test (cervical cytology) Biopsy Cervical cancer may be suspected during a routine gynecologic examination. It is considered in women with Visible cervical lesion Abnormal vaginal bleeding Cervical cancer is usually diagnosed when cervical cytology and/or HPV testing detects abnormalities. Reporting of cervical cytology results is standardized (see table Bethesda Classification of Cervical Cytology Bethesda Classification of Cervical Cytology* [ 1 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ]). Further evaluation with screening tests or colposcopy is indicated if atypical or cancerous cells are found and/or HPV testing is positive. Colposcopy (examination of the vagina and cervix with a magnifying lens) is used to identify areas that require biopsy; endocervical curettage is also often performed. Cone biopsy (conization) is required if the diagnosis is uncertain and high-grade CIN or invasive cancer is suspected; a cone of tissue is removed using a loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), laser, or scalpel (cold knife). Table Staging Cervical cancer staging underwent a major revision in 2018. The previous FIGO 2009 staging system allowed only clinical examination, cervical biopsy, and a few additional tests to assign the stage. The FIGO 2018 staging system allows, when available, cross-sectional imaging (eg, ultrasonography, CT, MRI, positron emission tomography [PET], PET-CT, MRI-PET) and surgical pathology results to supplement clinical findings in all stages. Imaging and pathology results are optional because they may be not available in low- and middle-income countries, where cervical cancer is more common (2 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more , 3 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma.

Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more , 4 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Other changes in the 2018 staging system include the following: Horizontal spread of the tumor is no longer considered part of stage IA1 and IA2. Stage I is subdivided into 3 subgroups according to tumor size (IB1 < 2 cm, IB2 2 to < 4 cm, and IB3 ≥ 4 cm) instead of 2 subgroups (stages IB1 and IB2, which used only 4 cm as a cutoff value). Lymph node status is now part of the staging system. Positive pelvic nodes are now stage IIIC1 and positive paraortic nodes are stage IIIC2. Micrometastases in the lymph nodes are considered positive; however, these isolated tumor cells do not change the stage to III, but they should be recorded. If lymph nodes are classified as positive by imaging studies, an \"r\" is added to the stage (eg, IIIC1r, IIIC2r); if they are classified as positive by pathology results, a \"p\" is added(IIIC1p, IIIC2p [ 2 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection.

Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more , 4 Diagnosis references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ]). If the stage is > IA2, CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis is typically done to better determine tumor size, parametrial involvement, vaginal compromise, and nodal metastases. PET with CT (PET/CT) is often used to check for spread beyond the cervix. If PET/CT, MRI, or CT is not available, cystoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, chest x-ray, and IV urography, when clinically indicated, may be used for staging. Table When imaging tests suggest that pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes are grossly enlarged (> 2 cm), surgical exploration, typically with a retroperitoneal approach, may be indicated. Its sole purpose is to remove enlarged lymph nodes so that radiation therapy can be more precisely targeted and more effective. Diagnosis references 1.

Int J Gynaecol Obstet 143 Suppl 2:22–36, 2018. doi: 10.1002/ijgo.12611 Prognosis for Cervical Cancer The most common histologic types of cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) usually metastasize to distant sites only when the cancer is locally advanced or recurrent. The 5-year survival rates are as follows: Stage I: 80 to 90% Stage II: 60 to 75% Stage III: 30 to 40% Stage IV: 0 to 15% Nearly 80% of recurrences manifest within 2 years. Adverse prognostic factors include Lymph node involvement Large tumor size and volume Deep cervical stromal invasion Parametrial invasion Lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) Nonsquamous histology Treatment of Cervical Cancer Surgery alone for microinvasive disease Surgery or curative radiation therapy if there is no spread to parametria or beyond Radiation therapy and chemotherapy (chemoradiation) if there is spread to parametria or beyond Chemotherapy for metastatic and recurrent cancer Treatment of cervical cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. If radical hysterectomy is indicated but patients are not ideal candidates for it, chemoradiation is used and has similar oncologic outcomes. Stage IA1 (no lymphovascular space invasion) Treatment of stage IA1 involves Conization or simple hysterectomy Microinvasive cervical cancer, defined as FIGO stage IA1 with no lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), has a < 1% risk of lymph node metastases and may be managed conservatively with conization using LEEP, laser, or cold knife. Conization is indicated for patients who are interested in preserving fertility (to obtain, if possible, a nonfragmented specimen with a 3-mm margin). A cold knife preserves the margins for pathology evaluation but cannot always be used. Simple hysterectomy should be done if patients are not interested in preserving fertility or if margins are positive after conization. If margins are positive, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping should be considered, and if patients are interested in preserving fertility, repeat conization is an alternative. Sentinel lymph node mapping for cervical cancer Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an alternative to full pelvic lymphadenectomy for patients with early-stage (IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion, IB1, IB2, or IIA1) cervical cancer (1 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ) because only 15 to 20% of these patients have positive nodes. SLN mapping therefore decreases the number of full pelvic lymphadenectomies, which can have adverse effects (eg, lymphedema, nerve damage). For SLN mapping, blue dye, technetium-99 (99Tc), or indocyanine green (ICG) is directly injected into the cervix, usually at 3 and 9 o’clock. During surgery, SLNs are identified by direct visualization of blue dye, by a camera to detect the fluorescence of ICG, or by a gamma probe to detect 99Tc. SLNs are commonly located medial to the external iliac vessels, ventral to the hypogastric vessels, or in the superior part of the obturator space. Ultrastaging of all SLNs is done to detect micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells (low-volume disease). Any grossly suspicious node must be removed regardless of mapping. If there is no mapping on a hemipelvis, a side-specific lymphadenectomy is done. In the 2018 FIGO staging system, only macrometastases and micrometastases are considered when classifying cases as IIIC; isolated tumor cells do not change the stage, they are considered pN0. Detection rates for SLN mapping are best for tumors < 2 cm. Stage IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion) and stage IA2 For stage IA1 with LVSI or stage IA2, recommended treatments include Modified radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without SLN mapping) External pelvic radiation therapy with brachytherapy Criteria for radiation therapy after radical hysterectomy Criteria used to determine whether pelvic radiation with concurrent chemotherapy should be done after radical hysterectomy include the following (see table Sedlis Criteria for External Pelvic Radiation After Radical Hysterectomy Sedlis Criteria for External Pelvic Radiation After Radical Hysterectomy* ): Presence of lymphovascular space invasion Depth of invasion Tumor size Patients with a combination of risk factors, such as large tumor size (> 4 cm), deep (> 1/3) stromal invasion, and/or lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), have a risk of recurrence and death of up to 30% after surgery alone (2 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more , 3 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Risk factors such as positive margins and/or pathologically confirmed positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium are considered higher risk. In a randomized trial, the estimated 4-year survival rates for patients with stage IB cervical cancer and high-risk factors were 81% for those treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy and 71% for those treated with radiation therapy alone (4 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more , 5 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Table Stages IB1, IB2, and IIA1 For stages IB1, IB2, and IIA1, the standard recommendation is Open radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without SLN mapping) Radical hysterectomy includes resection of the uterus (including the cervix), parts of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, the upper 1 to 2 cm of the vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes and parametrium. The Querleu & Morrow classification system describes four types of radical hysterectomy based on the lateral extent of resection; a few subtypes take nerve preservation and paracervical lymphadenectomy into account (6 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Results from a randomized trial (7 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ) showed that minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy or robot-assisted laparoscopy) resulted in a lower overall survival rate and a higher recurrence rate than total abdominal radical hysterectomy. Therefore, open radical hysterectomy is recommended as the appropriate approach. When patients are not considered ideal candidates for surgery because of comorbidities, another valid option is external pelvic radiation therapy and brachytherapy with or without concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. Another treatment option is radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy), sometimes with adjuvant radiation therapy (see table Sedlis Criteria for External Pelvic Radiation After Radical Hysterectomy Sedlis Criteria for External Pelvic Radiation After Radical Hysterectomy* ). If extracervical spread is noted during radical hysterectomy, the procedure should be aborted, and postoperative radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy is recommended to prevent local recurrence (8 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Stages IB3, IIA2, IIB, III, and IVA The standard therapy for stages IB3, IIA2, IIB, III, and IVA cancer is External pelvic radiation therapy with brachytherapy and concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy To determine the extent of the radiation field, clinicians may evaluate spread to para-aortic lymph nodes clinically (abdominal CT and/or MRI) or surgically (pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy). In a randomized trial, oncologic outcomes did not differ significantly in patients with stage IIB through IVA staged clinically compared with those staged surgically before chemoradiation. In this study, laparoscopic staging appeared to be safe, did not delay primary treatment, and resulted in upstaging in 33% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (9 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). When cancer is limited to the cervix and/or pelvic lymph nodes, the standard recommendation is External beam radiation therapy, followed by brachytherapy (local radioactive implants, usually using cesium) to the cervix Radiation therapy may cause acute complications (eg, radiation proctitis and cystitis) and, occasionally, late complications (eg, vaginal stenosis, intestinal obstruction, rectovaginal and vesicovaginal fistula formation). Chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) is usually given with radiation therapy, often to sensitize the tumor to radiation. Although stage IVA cancers are usually treated with radiation therapy initially, pelvic exenteration (excision of all pelvic organs) may be considered. If after radiation therapy, cancer remains but is confined to the central pelvis, exenteration is indicated and cures up to 40% of patients. The procedure may include continent or incontinent urostomy, low anterior rectal anastomosis without colostomy or with an end-descending colostomy, omental carpet to close the pelvic floor (J-flap), and vaginal reconstruction with gracilis or rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps. Stage IVB and recurrent cancer Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for stage IVB cervical cancer. Response rates are about 48%. Adding bevacizumab to combination chemotherapy (cisplatin plus paclitaxel or topotecan plus paclitaxel) resulted in an improvement of 3.7 months in median overall survival in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer (10 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Metastases outside the radiation field appear to respond better to chemotherapy than does previously irradiated cancer or metastases in the pelvis. Clinicians should consider testing for mismatch repair (MMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI), PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1) expression, and/or NTRK gene fusion if patients have recurrent, progressive, or metastatic cervical cancer. Results can help predict responses to immunotherapies such as PD-L1 inhibitors. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy, improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (11 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Fertility-sparing surgery In some patients who have early-stage cervical cancer (IA1 with LVSI, IA2, IB1, some cases of IB2) and who wish to preserve fertility, fertility-sparing surgery is an option. Surgical treatment of cervical cancer does not include oophorectomy unless ovaries appear abnormal. In young patients having surgery, ovarian preservation is particular important to avoid premature menopause. Before pelvic radiation, ovaries may be moved outside the radiation field (oophoropexy) to avoid toxic exposure. Patients should be counseled about the benefit of preserving ovary function versus the risk of potential ovarian metastases. In a study of 3471 patients who had stage Ib through IIb cervical cancer treated with a radical hysterectomy, the cancer metastasized to the ovaries in 1.5% of patients (12 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Ovarian metastasis was more common among patients with adenocarcinoma (5.31%) than among those with squamous cell carcinoma (0.79%). Surgical options for uterine conservation include Radical trachelectomy with nodal evaluation Cervical conization Radical trachelectomy is removal of the cervix, parametria immediately adjacent to the cervix, upper 2 cm of the vagina, and pelvic lymph nodes. The uterus is conserved and is reattached to the upper vagina, preserving the potential for fertility. Candidates for this procedure are patients with the following: Histologic subtypes such as squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma (not neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma or sarcoma) Stage IA1/grade 2 or 3 with lymphovascular space invasion Stage IA2 Stage IB1 Invasion of the upper cervix and lower uterine segment should be excluded by MRI before surgery. Rates of recurrence and death are similar to those after radical hysterectomy. If patients who have this procedure plan to have children, delivery must be cesarean. After a radical trachelectomy, fertility rates range from 50 to 70%, and the recurrence rate is about 5 to 10%. Radical trachelectomy can be performed via vaginal surgery, laparotomy, laparoscopy, or robotic-assisted surgery. There has been concern about the safety of radical trachelectomy using minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopy or robotic-assisted surgery) compared with laparotomy. In one retrospective study of patients with early-stage cervical cancer (≤ 2 cm), laparotomy compared with minimally invasive approaches had comparable 4.5-year disease-free survival rates (13 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). For patients with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer, conization with pelvic nodal evaluation may be an alternative to radical trachelectomy. In a single-arm, prospective study, conservative surgery (cervical conization or simple hysterectomy with nodal evaluation) appeared to be safe and feasible in women with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer; the 2-year recurrence rate was 3.5% (14 Treatment references Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ). Studies to determine the optimal treatment for patients with early-stage cervical cancer are ongoing. An ongoing prospective study (CONTESSA) is evaluating the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by fertility-sparing surgery in patients who have tumors 2 to 4 cm and who wish to preserve fertility.

Prevention of Cervical Cancer Screening tests Routine cervical cancer screening effectively detects preinvasive and early-stage disease and decreases cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates. Two types of screening tests for cervical abnormalities are used: Tests for high-risk HPV genotypes Pap test (cervical cytology) If Pap and HPV tests are not available (eg, in resource-limited settings), visual inspection of the cervix after application of acetic acid or Lugol iodine is an alternative screening method. In 2020, the American Cancer Society guidelines (ACS) issued new guidelines for cervical cancer screening as follows (1 Prevention reference Cervical cancer is usually a squamous cell carcinoma; less often, it is an adenocarcinoma. The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. Cervical neoplasia is often asymptomatic... read more ): Screening should begin at age 25, rather than age 21. If primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is available, it should be started at age 25 years, rather than at age 30 and done every 5 years; cytology (eg, Pap tests) is not needed. If primary HPV testing is not available, co-testing with Pap and HPV tests should be done every 5 years or a Pap test should be done every 3 years. For those over age 65, guidance remains the same: Testing is stopped if an adequate series of previous tests have been normal during the preceding 10 years; testing should be continued if women have not had adequate normal test results or started if they have not been screened previously. If women have had a hysterectomy for a disorder other than cancer and have not had abnormal Pap test results, screening is not indicated. Table HPV testing is the preferred method of follow-up evaluation for all women with ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), an inconclusive finding detected by Pap tests. If HPV testing shows that the woman does not have HPV, screening should continue at the routinely scheduled intervals. If HPV is present, colposcopy should be done.

The vaccines aim to prevent cervical cancer but do not treat it. All three vaccines are most effective if given before first sexual activity and potential exposure to HPV. The HPV vaccine is recommended for all people, ideally before they become sexually active. The standard recommendation is to vaccinate beginning at age 11 to 12 years, but vaccination may begin at age 9. Prevention reference 1.

Key Points Consider cervical cancer if women have abnormal cervical cancer screening (HPV or Pap test) results, visible cervical lesions, or abnormal, particularly postcoital, vaginal bleeding. Do a colposcopy and/or biopsy to further evaluate and confirm the diagnosis. Stage cervical cancer clinically, using biopsy, pelvic examination, and available imaging, including chest x-ray; also use ultrasonography, PET/CT, MRI, or CT and surgical pathology, if available. Treatment is surgical resection for early-stage cancer, radiation therapy plus chemotherapy for locally advanced cancer, and chemotherapy for metastatic and recurrent cancer. Recommend HPV vaccination for children before first sexual activity. More Information The following is an English-language resource that may be useful.

The cause is usually hypertension. Typical symptoms include focal neurologic deficits, often with abrupt onset of headache, nausea, and impairment of consciousness. Diagnosis is by CT or MRI.

Most intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the basal ganglia, cerebral lobes, cerebellum, or pons. Intracerebral hemorrhage may also occur in other parts of the brain stem or in the midbrain.

Lobar intracerebral hemorrhages (hematomas in the cerebral lobes, outside the basal ganglia) usually result from angiopathy due to amyloid deposition in cerebral arteries (cerebral amyloid angiopathy), which affects primarily older people. Lobar hemorrhages may be multiple and recurrent. Pathophysiology of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Blood from an intracerebral hemorrhage accumulates as a mass that can dissect through and compress adjacent brain tissues, causing neuronal dysfunction. Large hematomas increase intracranial pressure.

Because the... read more , compressing the brain stem and often causing secondary hemorrhages in the midbrain and pons. If the hemorrhage ruptures into the ventricular system (intraventricular hemorrhage), blood may cause acute hydrocephalus. Cerebellar hematomas can expand to block the 4th ventricle, also causing acute hydrocephalus, or they can dissect into the brain stem. Cerebellar hematomas that are > 3 cm in diameter may cause midline shift or herniation. Herniation, midbrain or pontine hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, or dissection into the brain stem can impair consciousness and cause coma and death. Symptoms and Signs of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Symptoms of intracerebral hemorrhage typically begin with sudden headache, often during activity. However, headache may be mild or absent in older people. Loss of consciousness is common, often within seconds or a few minutes. Nausea, vomiting, delirium, and focal or generalized seizures are also common. Neurologic deficits are usually sudden and progressive. Large hemorrhages, when located in the hemispheres, cause hemiparesis; when located in the posterior fossa, they cause cerebellar or brain stem deficits (eg, conjugate eye deviation or ophthalmoplegia, stertorous breathing, pinpoint pupils, coma). Large hemorrhages are fatal within a few days in about half of patients. In survivors, consciousness returns and neurologic deficits gradually diminish to various degrees as the extravasated blood is resorbed. Some patients have surprisingly few neurologic deficits because hemorrhage is less destructive to brain tissue than infarction. Small hemorrhages may cause focal deficits without impairment of consciousness and with minimal or no headache and nausea. Small hemorrhages may mimic ischemic stroke Ischemic Stroke Ischemic stroke is sudden neurologic deficits that result from focal cerebral ischemia associated with permanent brain infarction (eg, positive results on diffusion-weighted MRI).

CT angiography, done within hours of bleeding onset, may show areas where contrast extravasates into the clot (spot sign); this finding indicates that bleeding is continuing and suggests that the hematoma will expand and the outcome will be poor. Treatment of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Supportive measures Control of modifiable risk factors Sometimes surgical evacuation (eg, for many cerebellar hematomas > 3 cm) Treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage includes supportive measures and control of modifiable risk factors. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are contraindicated. If patients have used anticoagulants, the effects are reversed when possible by giving fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrate, vitamin K, or platelet transfusions as indicated. Hemodialysis can remove about 60% of dabigatran. As recommended by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association 2015 guidelines, hypertension can be safely lowered to systolic blood pressure (BP) 140 mm Hg if systolic BP is between 150 mm Hg and 220 mm Hg and if acute antihypertensive treatment is not contraindicated (1 Treatment reference Intracerebral hemorrhage is focal bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain parenchyma. The cause is usually hypertension. Typical symptoms include focal neurologic deficits, often with abrupt... read more ). If systolic BP is > 220 mm Hg, hypertension can be treated aggressively with a continuous IV infusion; in such cases, systolic BP must be monitored frequently. Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV is given initially; dose is increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed to decrease systolic BP by 10 to 15%. Cerebellar hemisphere hematomas that are > 3 cm in diameter may cause midline shift or herniation, so surgical evacuation is often lifesaving. Early evacuation of large lobar cerebral hematomas may also be lifesaving, but rebleeding occurs frequently, sometimes increasing neurologic deficits. Early evacuation of deep cerebral hematomas is seldom indicated because surgical mortality is high and neurologic deficits are usually severe. Antiseizure drugs are not typically used prophylactically; they are used only if patients have had a seizure. Treatment reference 1.

Key Points With intracerebral hemorrhage, sudden, severe symptoms (eg, sudden headache, loss of consciousness, vomiting) are common, but headache may be absent (particularly in older people), and small hemorrhages may mimic ischemic stroke. Do CT or MRI and a bedside glucose test immediately. Essential supportive care may include reversing anticoagulation and decreasing BP if systolic BP is > 150 mm Hg; if systolic BP is > 220 mm Hg, consider aggressively reducing BP by continuously infusing nicardipine IV. Consider surgical evacuation for large lobar cerebral hematomas and hematomas > 3 cm in a cerebellar hemisphere.

Typically, a broken (fractured) nose bleeds, hurts, and swells. To diagnose a broken nose, a doctor looks at and feels the bridge of the nose. Doctors sometimes need to push the broken pieces of bone back into place. When nasal bones break, the mucous membrane lining the nose can tear, resulting in a nosebleed. Commonly, the bridge of the nose is pushed to one side. Sometimes the cartilage of the nasal septum (the rubbery tissue that divides the nasal cavity into two) can be pushed to one side. If blood collects under the membrane that lines the cartilage of the nasal septum (called septal hematoma), the cartilage may die. The dead cartilage may disintegrate, causing the bridge of the nose to sag in the middle (called saddle nose deformity). Saddle Nose Deformity Saddle nose deformity occurs when cartilage in the nose dies and disintegrates. As a result, the bridge of the nose sags in the middle. Sometimes when a nose is broken, the bones that join the nose to the skull are damaged. This damage allows the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) to leak out. This damage can also allow bacteria from the nose to enter the space around the brain and spinal cord and cause a serious infection (meningitis Introduction to Meningitis Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space).

Sometimes the area around the eyes also looks bruised. The nose remains swollen for 3 to 5 days after the fracture. Diagnosis of Nose Fractures A doctor's examination Medical attention is needed so that doctors can find septal hematomas, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and other facial injuries that may need to be treated right away. Ordinarily, a doctor diagnoses a broken nose by gently feeling the bridge of the nose for irregularities in shape and alignment, unusual movement of bones, the rough sensation of broken bones moving against one another, and tenderness. X-rays of the nose are not normally done because they are not accurate for diagnosing fractures or helpful in indicating what treatment is necessary. If doctors suspect an injury to other bones in the face or to the skull, they do computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.

Treatment of Nose Fractures Relief of pain and swelling Prompt drainage of septal hematomas Sometimes realignment of fractured bones Treatment of pain and swelling Applying ice packs (every 2 hours for 15 minutes at a time if possible) for about 2 days, taking pain relievers (such as acetaminophen), and sleeping with the head elevated help limit pain and swelling. Treatment of hematomas Septal hematomas are drained as soon as possible. Blood must be removed to prevent the destruction of the cartilage. Treatment of fractures The fracture itself can wait. Doctors usually wait 3 to 5 days after an injury for the swelling to go down before they push the broken pieces of bone back into place (called reduction). Waiting makes it easier for doctors to see and feel when the pieces are perfectly aligned. Many nasal fractures do not disrupt alignment and do not have to be reduced. First, doctors give adults a local anesthetic, which numbs the area. Children are given a general anesthetic, which causes temporary unconsciousness. By pressing with their fingers and lifting with an instrument inserted into the nose, doctors manipulate the bones into their normal position. The nose is then stabilized with an external splint. Doctors also may need to insert gauze into the nose (internal packing). Antibiotics are given while the packing is in place to decrease the risk of infection.

Normal voluntary muscle contraction requires the brain to generate a signal that then travels through the spinal cord and nerves to reach a normally functioning muscle. Therefore, true weakness can result from injury or disease affecting the nervous system, muscles, or connections between them (neuromuscular junction). Diagnosis of Difficulty Moving A doctor's evaluation Doctors can often diagnose weakness based on the person's symptoms and the results of a physical examination. Doctors first try to determine whether the person can contract the muscles with normal strength. If muscle strength is normal, and the person has difficulty moving a joint, the doctor tries to move the joint for the person while the person relaxes (called passive motion). If motion is painful, joint inflammation may be the problem. If passive motion causes little pain but is blocked, joint contracture (for example, due to scar tissue) or stiffness due to spasticity or rigidity caused by a nervous system disorder may be the problem. If passive motion causes little pain and is not blocked, doctors encourage the person to try as hard as possible to move. If movement is still difficult and still does not cause pain, true weakness is possible. Treatment of Difficulty Moving Stretching exercises and physical therapy Sometimes surgery For joints with a limited range of motion, joint flexibility can be maximized by stretching exercises and physical therapy Physical Therapy (PT) Physical therapy, a component of rehabilitation, involves exercising and manipulating the body with an emphasis on the back, upper arms, and legs.

With prolapse, blood sometimes leaks (regurgitates) back into the atrium (see also Mitral Regurgitation Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation is leakage of blood backward through the mitral valve each time the left ventricle contracts.

Although the cause is not known, low folate levels during pregnancy increase risk. Some children are asymptomatic, and others have severe neurologic dysfunction below the lesion. Open spina bifida can be diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonography or suggested by elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. After birth, a lesion is typically visible on the back. Treatment is usually surgical. Spina bifida is one of the most serious neural tube defects compatible with prolonged life. This defect is one of the more common congenital anomalies overall, with an incidence in the US of about 1/1500. It is most common in the lower thoracic, lumbar, or sacral region and usually extends for 3 to 6 vertebral segments. Severity ranges from occult, in which there are no apparent anomalies, to protruding sacs (spina bifida cystica), to a completely open spine (rachischisis) with severe neurologic disability and death. In occult spinal dysraphism (OSD), anomalies of the skin overlying the lower back (typically in the lumbosacral area) occur; these include sinus tracts that have no visible bottom, are above the lower sacral area, or are not in the midline; hyperpigmented areas; asymmetry of the gluteal cleft with the upper margin deviated to one side; and tufts of hair. These children often have anomalies in the underlying portion of the spinal cord, such as lipomas and tethering (in which the cord has an abnormal attachment—see figure Forms of spina bifida Forms of spina bifida ). In spina bifida cystica, the protruding sac can contain meninges (meningocele), spinal cord (myelocele), or both (myelomeningocele). In a myelomeningocele, the sac usually consists of meninges with a central neural plaque. If not well covered with skin, the sac can easily rupture, increasing the risk of meningitis. Forms of spina bifida In occult spinal dysraphism, ≥ 1 vertebrae do not form normally, and the spinal cord and meninges may also be affected. In spina bifida cystica, the protruding sac can contain meninges (meningocele), spinal cord (myelocele), or both (meningomyelocele).

Symptoms and Signs of Spina Bifida Many children with minor defects are asymptomatic. Neurologic When the spinal cord or lumbosacral nerve roots are involved, as is usual, varying degrees of paralysis and sensory deficits are present below the lesion. Rectal tone is usually decreased. Hydrocephalus may cause minimal symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Brain stem involvement may cause manifestations such as stridor, swallowing difficulties, and intermittent apnea. Orthopedic Lack of muscle innervation leads to atrophy of the legs. Because paralysis occurs in the fetus, orthopedic problems may be present at birth (eg, clubfoot Talipes Equinovarus (Clubfoot) and Other Foot Abnormalities Talipes equinovarus, sometimes called clubfoot, is characterized by plantar flexion, inward tilting of the heel (from the midline of the leg), and adduction of the forefoot (medial deviation... read more , arthrogryposis of the legs Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita refers to a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by multiple joint contractures present at birth.

Urologic Paralysis also impairs bladder function, occasionally leading to a neurogenic bladder and, consequently, urinary reflux, which can cause hydronephrosis, frequent UTIs, and, ultimately, kidney damage. Diagnosis of Spina Bifida Ultrasonography or MRI Spinal cord imaging, with ultrasonography or MRI, is essential in children with occult spinal dysraphism; even children with minimal cutaneous findings may have underlying spinal abnormalities (those with overt defects do not require spinal cord imaging because the anatomy is known). Plain x-rays of the spine, hips, and, if they are malformed, lower extremities are done. Cranial imaging using ultrasonography, CT, or MRI is done to look for hydrocephalus and syringomyelia. Once the diagnosis of spina bifida is made, urinary tract evaluation is essential and includes urinalysis, urine culture, BUN and creatinine determination, and ultrasonography. Measurement of bladder capacity and pressure at which urine exits into the urethra can determine prognosis and intervention. Need for further testing, such as urodynamics and voiding cystourethrogram, depends on previous findings and associated anomalies. Screening Prenatal screening can be done by doing fetal ultrasonography and by measuring maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (see Maternal serum screening for neural tube defects Maternal serum screening for neural tube defects Noninvasive maternal screening, unlike invasive testing, has no risk of test-related complications. By more precisely assessing the risk of fetal abnormalities, noninvasive maternal screening... read more ), ideally between 16 wk and 18 wk gestation; levels can also be done on amniotic fluid samples if previous testing suggests an increased risk. Elevated levels suggest increased risk of spina bifida cystica (occult spinal dysraphism rarely causes elevated levels). Prognosis for Spina Bifida Prognosis varies by the level of cord involvement and the number and severity of associated anomalies. Prognosis is worse for children with higher cord level (eg, thoracic) lesions or who have kyphosis, hydrocephalus, early hydronephrosis, and associated congenital anomalies. With proper care, however, most children do well. Loss of renal function and ventricular shunt complications are the usual causes of death in older children. Treatment of Spina Bifida Surgical repair of the spinal lesion Sometimes a ventricular shunt Various measures for orthopedic and urologic complications Without early surgical treatment, neurologic damage can progress in occult spinal dysraphism. Treatment for all spina bifida requires a united effort by specialists from several disciplines; neurosurgical, urologic, orthopedic, pediatric, psychiatric/psychologic, and social service evaluations are important. It is important to assess the type, vertebral segment, and extent of the lesion; the infant’s health status; and associated anomalies. Discussion with the family should ascertain the family’s strengths, desires, and resources, and community resources, including availability of ongoing care. A myelomeningoocele identified at birth is covered immediately with a sterile dressing. If the myelomeningocele is leaking CSF, antibiotics are started to prevent meningitis. Neurosurgical repair of a myelomeningocele or an open spine typically is done within the first 72 h after birth to reduce the risk of meningeal or ventricular infection. If the lesion is large or is in a difficult location, plastic surgeons may be consulted to ensure adequate closure. Hydrocephalus may require a shunt procedure in the neonatal period (see treatment of hydrocephalus Treatment Hydrocephalus is accumulation of excessive amounts of CSF, causing cerebral ventricular enlargement and/or increased intracranial pressure. Manifestations can include enlarged head, bulging... read more ); sometimes a ventricular shunt is inserted when the back is repaired. Kidney function must be monitored closely, and UTI should be treated promptly. Obstructive uropathy at either the bladder outlet or ureteral level must be treated vigorously to prevent infection. When children are between 2 and 3 yr of age, or at any time if they have elevated pressure in the bladder with vesicoureteral reflux, clean intermittent catheterization is done to empty the bladder on a regular basis. Catheterization increases continence and maintains bladder and kidney health. At around the same time, children are placed on the commode or toilet after meals to encourage fecal continence. Well-balanced diets are encouraged; stool softeners, laxatives, or a combination may be helpful to ensure regular bowel movements and to increase continence (see treatment of stool incontinence Treatment Stool incontinence is the voluntary or involuntary passage of stool in inappropriate places in children > 4 years of age (or developmental equivalent) who do not have an organic defect or... read more ). In older children, an antegrade colonic enema procedure, in which a hole is placed through the abdominal wall into the colon to allow infusion of liquids, can improve continence. The hole is kept open by a tube (eg, a gastrostomy feeding tube). Orthopedic care should begin early. If a clubfoot Talipes Equinovarus (Clubfoot) and Other Foot Abnormalities Talipes equinovarus, sometimes called clubfoot, is characterized by plantar flexion, inward tilting of the heel (from the midline of the leg), and adduction of the forefoot (medial deviation... read more is present, a cast is applied; surgery is often necessary after casting. Hip joints are checked for dislocation. Affected children should be monitored for development of scoliosis, pathologic fractures, pressure sores, and muscle weakness and spasm. Prevention of Spina Bifida Folate supplementation (400 to 800 mcg po once/day) in women beginning 3 mo before conception and continuing through the 1st trimester reduces the risk of neural tube defects (see prevention of congenital neurologic anomalies Prevention Congenital brain anomalies usually cause severe neurologic deficits; some may be fatal. Some of the most serious neurologic anomalies (eg, anencephaly, encephalocele, spina bifida) develop in... read more ). Women who are considered at high risk of neural tube defects, ie, women who have had a fetus or infant with a neural tube defect, should take folate 4 mg (4000 mcg) po once/day. Key Points Spina bifida involves defective closure of the vertebral column, sometimes with a protruding sac containing meninges (meningocele), spinal cord (myelocele), or both (myelomeningocele). Chiari II, often causing hydrocephalus, is common. Folate deficiency is a significant risk factor, but other factors include maternal use of certain drugs (eg, valproate), maternal diabetes, and possibly a genetic component. Children with minor defects are asymptomatic, but others typically have varying degrees of paralysis and sensory deficits below the lesion. Lack of muscle innervation leads to atrophy of the legs and orthopedic deformities. Screen prenatally using fetal ultrasonography and maternal serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Repair the spinal lesion, place a shunt for symptomatic hydrocephalus, and treat orthopedic and urologic abnormalities as needed. Reduce risk by giving folate supplementation.

There are many causes of hypercalcemia (see table Principal Causes of Hypercalcemia Principal Causes of Hypercalcemia ), but the most common are Hyperparathyroidism Cancer Table Pathophysiology of Hypercalcemia Primary hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder resulting from excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by one or more parathyroid glands. It probably is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, particularly among patients who are not hospitalized. Incidence increases with age and is higher in postmenopausal women. It also occurs in high frequency ≥ 3 decades after neck irradiation. Familial and sporadic forms exist. PTH increases serum calcium by increasing intestinal absorption of calcium; rapidly mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone (bone resorption); enhancing renal distal nephron calcium reabsorption; and stimulating conversion of vitamin D Vitamin D Deficiency and Dependency Inadequate exposure to sunlight predisposes to vitamin D deficiency.

Histologic examination shows a parathyroid adenoma in about 85% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an adenoma from a normal gland. About 15% of cases are due to hyperplasia of ≥ 2 glands. Parathyroid cancer occurs in < 1% of cases. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia The syndrome of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. FHH involves an inactivating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor gene CASR (most commonly), GNA11, or AP2S1 (peptides related to control or expression of CASR), resulting in higher concentrations of serum calcium being needed to inhibit PTH secretion. Subsequent PTH secretion induces renal phosphate excretion. Persistent hypercalcemia (usually asymptomatic) and often from an early age, normal to slightly elevated concentrations of PTH, hypocalciuria, and hypermagnesemia Hypermagnesemia Hypermagnesemia is a serum magnesium concentration > 2.6 mg/dL (> 1.05 mmol/L).

Once the hyperparathyroidism is established, hypercalcemia or normocalcemia may occur. The sensitivity of the parathyroid to calcium may be diminished because of pronounced glandular hyperplasia and elevation of the calcium set point (ie, the amount of calcium necessary to reduce secretion of PTH). Tertiary hyperparathyroidism Tertiary hyperparathyroidism results in autonomous hypersecretion of PTH regardless of serum calcium concentration. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism generally occurs in patients with long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, as in patients with end-stage renal disease of several years’ duration. Cancer Cancer is a common cause of hypercalcemia, usually in hospitalized patients. Although there are several mechanisms, elevated serum calcium ultimately occurs as a result of bone resorption. Humoral hypercalcemia of cancer (ie, hypercalcemia with no or minimal bone metastases) occurs most commonly with squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma Renal Cell Carcinoma Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer.

Symptoms and Signs of Hypercalcemia In mild hypercalcemia, many patients are asymptomatic. Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia include constipation, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and ileus. Impairment of the renal concentrating mechanism leads to polyuria, nocturia, and polydipsia. Elevation of serum calcium > 12 mg/dL (> 3.00 mmol/L) can cause emotional lability, confusion, delirium, psychosis, stupor, and coma. Hypercalcemia may cause neuromuscular symptoms, including skeletal muscle weakness. Hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis is common. Less often, prolonged or severe hypercalcemia causes reversible acute kidney injury or irreversible kidney damage due to nephrocalcinosis (precipitation of calcium salts within the kidney parenchyma). In severe hypercalcemia a shortened QTc interval is shown on ECG, and arrhythmias may occur, particularly in patients taking digoxin. Hypercalcemia > 18 mg/dL (> 4.50 mmol/L) may cause shock, renal failure, and death. Diagnosis of Hypercalcemia Total serum (and sometimes ionized) calcium concentration Chest x-ray; measurement of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, phosphate, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum protein immunoelectrophoresis to determine the cause Sometimes urinary excretion of calcium with or without phosphate Hypercalcemia is diagnosed by a serum calcium concentration > 10.4 mg/dL (> 2.60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5.2 mg/dL (> 1.30 mmol/L). The condition is frequently discovered during routine laboratory screening. Serum calcium can be artifactually elevated by high serum protein levels (see table Laboratory and Clinical Findings in Some Disorders Causing Hypercalcemia Laboratory and Clinical Findings in Some Disorders Causing Hypercalcemia ). True ionized hypercalcemia can also be masked by low serum protein. When protein and albumin are abnormal and when ionized hypercalcemia is suspected because of clinical findings (eg, because of symptoms of hypercalcemia), ionized serum calcium should be measured. Initial evaluation Initial evaluation should include Review of the history, particularly of past serum calcium concentrations Physical examination Chest x-ray Laboratory studies, including electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, ionized calcium, phosphate, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum protein immunoelectrophoresis The cause is apparent from clinical data and results of these tests in ≥ 95% of patients. Patients without an obvious cause of hypercalcemia after this evaluation should undergo measurement of intact parathyroid hormone and 24-hour urinary calcium. When no cause is obvious, serum calcium < 11 mg/dL (< 2.75 mmol/L) suggests hyperparathyroidism or other nonmalignant causes, whereas serum calcium > 13 mg/dL (> 3.25 mmol/L) suggests cancer. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia that has been present for years or is present in several family members raises the possibility of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism generally manifests late in life but can be present for several years before symptoms occur. Measurement of intact PTH levels help differentiate PTH-mediated hypercalcemia (eg, caused by hyperparathyroidism or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia), in which PTH levels are high or high-normal, from most other (PTH-independent) causes. In PTH-independent causes, levels are usually < 20 pg/mL.(< 2.1 pmol/L) The chest x-ray is particularly helpful, revealing most granulomatous disorders, such as tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.

Chest and bone (eg, skull, extremity) x-rays can also show the effects on bone of secondary hyperparathyroidism, most commonly in patients receiving long-term dialysis. In osteitis fibrosa cystica (often due to primary hyperparathyroidism), increased osteoclastic activity from overstimulation by PTH causes rarefaction of bone with fibrous degeneration and cyst and fibrous nodule formation. Because characteristic bone lesions occur only with relatively advanced disease, bone x-rays are recommended only for symptomatic patients. X-rays typically show bone cysts, a heterogeneous appearance of the skull, and subperiosteal resorption of bone in the phalanges and distal clavicles. Hyperparathyroidism In hyperparathyroidism, the serum calcium is rarely > 12 mg/dL (> 3 mmol/L), but the ionized serum calcium is almost always elevated. Low serum phosphate concentration suggests hyperparathyroidism, especially when coupled with elevated renal excretion of phosphate. When hyperparathyroidism results in increased bone turnover, serum alkaline phosphatase is frequently increased. Increased intact PTH, particularly inappropriate elevation (ie, a high concentration in the absence of hypocalcemia) or an inappropriate high-normal concentration (ie, despite hypercalcemia), is diagnostic. Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high in hyperparathyroidism. Chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.

MEN 1 involves... read more (MEN) should be considered in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in women, occurs most commonly in people ages 30 to 50 years and typically presents with a single abnormal gland while MEN occurs equally in both sexes, typically occurs in younger adults and frequently manifests with multiple abnormal glands as well as recurrent parathyroid adenomas. The need for localization of parathyroid tissue before surgery on the parathyroid(s) is controversial. High-resolution CT with or without CT-guided biopsy and immunoassay of thyroid venous drainage, MRI, high-resolution ultrasonography, digital subtraction angiography, and thallium-201–technetium-99 scanning all have been used and are highly accurate, but they have not improved the usually high cure rate of parathyroidectomy done by experienced surgeons. Technetium-99 sestamibi, a radionuclide agent for parathyroid imaging, is more sensitive and specific than older agents and may be useful for identifying solitary adenomas. For residual or recurrent hyperparathyroidism after initial parathyroid surgery, imaging is necessary and may reveal abnormally functioning parathyroid glands in unusual locations throughout the neck and mediastinum. Technetium-99 sestamibi is probably the most sensitive imaging test. Use of several imaging studies (MRI, CT, or high-resolution ultrasonography in addition to technetium-99 sestamibi) before repeat parathyroidectomy is sometimes necessary. Cancer A serum calcium measurement > 13 mg/dL (> 3 mmol/L) suggests some cause of hypercalcemia other than hyperparathyroidism. Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high in cancer. In humoral hypercalcemia of cancer, PTH is often decreased or undetectable; phosphate is often decreased; and metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypoalbuminemia are often present. Suppressed PTH differentiates humoral hypercalcemia of cancer from primary hyperparathyroidism. Humoral hypercalcemia of cancer can also be diagnosed by detection of PTH-related peptide in serum. Multiple myeloma Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin and invade and destroy adjacent bone tissue. Common manifestations include lytic lesions in bones causing... read more is suggested by simultaneous anemia, azotemia, and hypercalcemia or by the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Myeloma is confirmed by bone marrow examination. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) FHH is very rare but should be considered in patients with hypercalcemia and elevated or high-normal intact PTH levels. FHH is distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by the Early age of onset Absence of symptoms Frequent occurrence of hypermagnesemia Presence of hypercalcemia without hypercalciuria in other family members Low fractional excretion of calcium, which is the ratio of calcium clearance to creatinine clearance (< 1% in FHH; 1 to 4% in primary hyperparathyroidism) Elevated or normal intact PTH Altered feedback regulation of the parathyroid glands may be responsible for the elevated or normal intact PTH level. Testing for mutations of the CASR, GNA11, or AP2S1 genes may identify the genetic cause of the autosomal dominant forms of the disease that affect a specific family. Milk-alkali syndrome In addition to a history of increased intake of calcium antacids, milk-alkali syndrome is recognized by the combination of hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and, occasionally, azotemia with hypocalciuria. The diagnosis can be confirmed when the serum calcium concentration rapidly returns to normal when calcium and alkali ingestion stops, although renal insufficiency can persist when nephrocalcinosis is present. Circulating PTH usually is suppressed. Other causes Vitamin D toxicity is characterized by elevated 25(OH)D concentration. In hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis, other granulomatous disorders, and some lymphomas, serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D may be elevated.

Table Treatment of Hypercalcemia Oral phosphate for serum calcium < 11.5 mg/dL (< 2.9 mmol/L) with mild symptoms and no kidney disease IV saline and furosemide for more rapid correction of elevated serum calcium < 18 mg/dL (< 4.5 mmol/L) Bisphosphonates or other calcium-lowering drugs for serum calcium 11.5 to 18 mg/dL (3.7 to 5.8 mmol/L) and/or moderate symptoms Hemodialysis for serum calcium >18 mg/dL (> 5.8 mmol/L) Surgical removal of parathyroid glands for moderate, progressive primary hyperparathyroidism and sometimes for mild hyperparathyroid disease Phosphate restriction and binders and sometimes calcitriol for secondary hyperparathyroidism There are 4 main strategies for lowering serum calcium: Decrease intestinal calcium absorption Increase urinary calcium excretion Decrease bone resorption Remove excess calcium through dialysis The treatment used depends on both the degree and the cause of hypercalcemia. Volume repletion with saline is an essential element of care. Mild hypercalcemia In mild hypercalcemia (serum calcium < 11.5 mg/dL [< 2.9 mmol/L]), in which symptoms are mild or absent, treatment is deferred pending definitive diagnosis. After diagnosis, the underlying disorder is treated. When symptoms are significant, treatment aimed at lowering serum calcium is necessary. Oral phosphate can be used. When taken with meals, phosphate binds some calcium, preventing its absorption. A starting dose is 250 mg of elemental phosphate (as sodium or potassium salt) 4 times a day. The dose can be increased to 500 mg 4 times a day as needed unless diarrhea develops. Another treatment is increasing urinary calcium excretion by giving isotonic saline plus a loop diuretic. Initially, 1 to 2 L of saline is given over 2 to 4 hours unless significant heart failure is present because nearly all patients with significant hypercalcemia are hypovolemic. Furosemide 20 to 40 mg IV every 2 to 4 hours is given as needed to maintain a urine output of roughly 250 mL/hour (monitored hourly). Care must be taken to avoid volume depletion. Potassium and magnesium are monitored as often as every 4 hours during treatment and replaced IV as needed to avoid hypokalemia Hypokalemia Hypokalemia is serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mEq/L (< 3.5 mmol/L) caused by a deficit in total body potassium stores or abnormal movement of potassium into cells.

Serum calcium begins to decrease in 2 to 4 hours and falls to near-normal within 24 hours. Moderate hypercalcemia Moderate hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL [> 2.88 mmol/L] and < 18 mg/dL [< 4.51 mmol/L]) can be treated with isotonic saline and a loop diuretic as is done for mild hypercalcemia or, depending on its cause, with drugs that decrease bone resorption (usually bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or infrequently plicamycin or gallium nitrate), corticosteroids, or chloroquine. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts. They are usually the drugs of choice for cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Zoledronate can be given as a one-time dose of 4 to 8 mg IV and lowers serum calcium very effectively for an average of > 40 days. Pamidronate can be given for cancer-associated hypercalcemia as a one-time dose of 30 to 90 mg IV, repeated only after 7 days. It lowers serum calcium for ≤ 2 weeks. Ibandronate as a one-time dose of 4 to 6 mg IV can be given for cancer-associated hypercalcemia; it is effective for about 14 days. Etidronate 7.5 mg/kg IV once a day for 3 to 5 days is used to treat Paget disease and cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Maintenance dosage is 20 mg/kg orally once a day, but the dose must be reduced when glomerular filtration rate is low. Repetitive use of IV bisphosphonates to treat hypercalcemia associated with metastatic bone disease or myeloma has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw is an oral lesion involving bare mandibular or maxillary bone. It may cause pain or may be asymptomatic. Diagnosis is by the presence of exposed bone for at least 8... read more . Some reports suggest this finding may be more common with zoledronate. Renal toxicity has been reported in patients receiving zoledronate. Oral bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate or risedronate) can be given to maintain calcium in the normal range but are not generally used for treating hypercalcemia acutely. Denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional doses on days 8 and 15 of the first month of treatment, is a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of osteoclastic activity that can be used for cancer-associated hypercalcemia that does not respond to bisphosphonates. Calcium and vitamin D are given as needed to avert hypocalcemia. Calcitonin (thyrocalcitonin) is a rapidly acting peptide hormone normally secreted in response to hypercalcemia by the C cells of the thyroid. Calcitonin appears to lower serum calcium by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. A dosage of 4 to 8 IU/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours of salmon calcitonin is safe. Calcitonin can lower serum calcium levels by 1 to 2 mg/dL within a few hours. Its usefulness in the treatment of cancer-associated hypercalcemia is limited by its short duration of action with the development of tachyphylaxis (often after about 48 hours) and by the lack of response in ≥ 40% of patients. However, the combination of salmon calcitonin and prednisone may control serum calcium for several months in some patients with cancer. If calcitonin stops working, it can be stopped for 2 days (while prednisone is continued) and then resumed. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 20 to 40 mg orally once a day) can help control hypercalcemia as adjunctive therapy by decreasing calcitriol production and thus intestinal calcium absorption in most patients with vitamin D toxicity, idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy, and sarcoidosis. Some patients with myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, or metastatic cancer require 40 to 60 mg of prednisone once a day. However, > 50% of such patients fail to respond to corticosteroids, and response, when it occurs, takes several days; thus, other treatment usually is necessary. Chloroquine phosphate 500 mg orally once a day inhibits 1,25(OH)2D synthesis and reduces serum calcium concentration in patients with sarcoidosis. Routine ophthalmologic surveillance (eg, retinal examinations every 6 to 12 months) is mandatory to detect dose-related retinal damage. Plicamycin 25 mcg/kg IV once a day in 50 mL of 5% dextrose in water (D/W) over 4 to 6 hours is effective in patients with hypercalcemia due to cancer but is rarely used because other treatments are safer. Gallium nitrate is also effective in hypercalcemia due to cancer but is used infrequently because of renal toxicity and limited clinical experience. Severe hypercalcemia In severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 18 mg/dL [> 4.5 mmol/L] or with severe symptoms), hemodialysis with low-calcium dialysate may be needed in addition to other treatments. Although there is no completely satisfactory way to correct severe hypercalcemia in patients with renal failure, hemodialysis Hemodialysis In hemodialysis, a patient’s blood is pumped into a dialyzer containing 2 fluid compartments configured as bundles of hollow fiber capillary tubes or as parallel, sandwiched sheets of semipermeable... read more is probably the safest and most reliable short-term treatment. IV phosphate (disodium phosphate or monopotassium phosphate) should be used only when hypercalcemia is life threatening and unresponsive to other methods and when short-term hemodialysis is not possible. No more than 1 g should be given IV in 24 hours; usually 1 or 2 doses over 2 days lower serum calcium for 10 to 15 days. Soft-tissue calcification and acute renal failure may result. (NOTE: IV infusion of sodium sulfate is even more hazardous and less effective than phosphate infusion and should not be used.) Hyperparathyroidism Treatment for hyperparathyroidism depends on severity. Patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism with no indications for surgery may be treated conservatively with methods to ensure that serum calcium concentrations remain low. Patients should remain active (ie, avoid immobilization that could exacerbate hypercalcemia), follow a low-calcium diet, drink plenty of fluids to minimize the chance of nephrolithiasis, and avoid drugs that can raise serum calcium, such as thiazide diuretics. Serum calcium and renal function are monitored every 6 months. Bone density is monitored every 12 months. However, subclinical bone disease, hypertension, and longevity are concerns. Osteoporosis is treated with bisphosphonates. In patients with symptomatic or progressive hyperparathyroidism, surgery is indicated. The indications for surgery in patients with asymptomatic, primary hyperparathyroidism are controversial. Surgical parathyroidectomy increases bone density and may have modest effects on some quality of life symptoms, but most patients do not have progressive deterioration in biochemical abnormalities or bone density. Still, concerns about hypertension and longevity remain. Many experts recommend surgery in the following circumstances: Serum calcium 1 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) greater than the upper limits of normal Calciuria > 400 mg/day (> 10 mmol/day) Creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min Peak bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or radius 2.5 standard deviations below controls (T score = −2.5) Age < 50 years The possibility of poor adherence with follow-up Surgery consists of removal of adenomatous glands. Parathyroid hormone concentration can be measured before and after removal of the presumed abnormal gland using rapid assays. A fall of ≥ 50% 10 minutes after removal of the adenoma indicates successful treatment. In patients with disease of > 1 gland, several glands are removed, and often a small portion of a normal-appearing parathyroid gland is reimplanted in the belly of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or subcutaneously in the forearm to prevent hypoparathyroidism. Parathyroid tissue is also occasionally preserved using cryopreservation to allow for later autologous transplantation in case persistent hypoparathyroidism develops. When hyperparathyroidism is mild, the serum calcium concentration drops to just below normal within 24 to 48 hours after surgery; serum calcium must be monitored. In patients with severe osteitis fibrosa cystica, prolonged, symptomatic hypocalcemia may occur postoperatively unless 10 to 20 g elemental calcium is given in the days before surgery. Even with preoperative calcium administration, large doses of calcium and vitamin D may be required Treatment Hypocalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration < 8.8 mg/dL (< 2.20 mmol/L) in the presence of normal plasma protein concentrations or a serum ionized calcium concentration < 4... read more ) while bone calcium is repleted. In patients with severe hypercalcemia with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, medical treatment is indicated. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to extracellular calcium, may lower parathyroid hormone and calcium levels. Hyperparathyroidism in patients with renal failure is usually secondary. Measures used for treatment can also be used for prevention. One aim is to prevent hyperphosphatemia. Treatment combines dietary phosphate restriction and phosphate binding agents, such as calcium carbonate or sevelamer. Despite the use of phosphate binders, dietary restriction of phosphate is needed. Aluminum-containing compounds have been used to limit phosphate concentration, but they should be avoided, especially in patients receiving long-term dialysis, to prevent aluminum accumulation in bone resulting in severe osteomalacia. Vitamin D administration is potentially hazardous in renal failure because it can increase phosphate absorption and contribute to hypercalcemia; administration requires frequent monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels. Treatment should be limited to patients with any of the following: Symptomatic osteomalacia (unrelated to aluminum) Secondary hyperparathyroidism Postparathyroidectomy hypocalcemia Although oral calcitriol is often given along with oral calcium to suppress secondary hyperparathyroidism, the results are variable in patients with end-stage renal disease. The parenteral form of calcitriol, or vitamin D analogs such as paricalcitol, may better prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism in such patients, because the higher attained serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D directly suppresses PTH release. Simple osteomalacia may respond to calcitriol 0.25 to 0.5 mcg orally once a day, whereas correction of postparathyroidectomy hypocalcemia may require prolonged administration of as much as 2 mcg of calcitriol po once/day and ≥ 2 g of elemental calcium/day. The calcimimetic, cinacalcet, modulates the set point of the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells and decreases PTH concentration in dialysis patients without increasing serum calcium. In patients with osteomalacia caused by having taken large amounts of aluminum-containing phosphate binders, removal of aluminum with deferoxamine is necessary before calcitriol administration reduces bone lesions. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Although FHH results from histologically abnormal parathyroid tissue, the response to subtotal parathyroidectomy is unsatisfactory. Because overt clinical manifestations are rare, drug therapy is not routinely indicated. Key Points The most common causes of hypercalcemia are hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Clinical features include polyuria, constipation, anorexia, and hypercalciuria with renal stones; patients with high calcium concentrations may have muscle weakness, confusion, and coma. Do chest x-ray; measure electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ionized calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase, and do serum protein immunoelectrophoresis. In addition to treating the cause, treat mild hypercalcemia (serum calcium < 11.5 mg/dL [< 2.9 mmol/L]) with oral phosphate or isotonic saline plus a loop diuretic. For moderate hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL [< 2.9 mmol/L] and < 18 mg/dL [< 4.5 mmol/L]), add a bisphosphonate, corticosteroids, and sometimes calcitonin. For severe hypercalcemia, hemodialysis may be needed.

After people eat food contaminated with the tapeworm's eggs, secretions in the stomach cause the eggs to hatch into larvae. The larvae enter the bloodstream and are distributed to all parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. The larvae form cysts (clusters of larvae enclosed in a protective wall). (The infection caused by cysts is called cysticercosis or, when the cysts form in the brain, neurocysticercosis.) These cysts cause few symptoms until the cysts degenerate and the larvae die, triggering inflammation, swelling, and symptoms such as headaches, seizures, personality changes, and mental impairment. Sometimes the cysts block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid within the spaces of the brain (ventricles) putting pressure on the brain. This disorder is called hydrocephalus. The increased pressure can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, and sleepiness.

The spinal fluid may have a large number of white blood cells called eosinophils. These three infections are usually treated with antihelminthic drugs, such as albendazole, mebendazole, praziquantel, and pyrantel pamoate. But in echinococcosis and coenurosis, cysts must often be removed surgically.

(See also Overview of Eye Trauma.) Eyelid contusions (which result in black eyes) are more cosmetically than clinically... read more ) may cause retrobulbar hematoma or severe edema surrounding the eyeball, either of which can increase intraorbital pressure. Because the eye is constrained by the lids and the orbit, increased intraorbital pressure can cause intraocular pressure to rise rapidly and compress the optic nerve and its vascular supply. Untreated, this increased pressure causes permanent vision loss (OCS). Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are done immediately to relieve intraorbital pressure and preserve vision if signs indicate OCS. Contraindications to Lateral Canthotomy Absolute contraindications Suspected globe rupture (eg, irregular pupil, hyphema, herniated iris tissue, shallow cornea, leak of aqueous humor) Complications of Lateral Canthotomy Complications may include Mechanical damage of the eye (eg, to the lateral rectus muscle, lacrimal gland, or lacrimal artery) or lids Hemorrhage Infection The urgency of the procedure, combined with traumatic distortion of the anatomy and possible unfamiliarity with the procedure by nonophthalmologists, may increase the risk of iatrogenic injury to the eyeball. Equipment for Lateral Canthotomy Sterile gauze, gloves, and drapes Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine) Topical ocular anesthetic (eg, 0.5% proparacaine or tetracaine eyedrops) Local anesthetic (eg, 1% or 2% lidocaine with epinephrine), small injection needles, and small (about 3 mL) syringe Ophthalmic antibiotic ointment (eg, erythromycin 0.5%, bacitracin) Sometimes, normal saline or water for irrigation Needle holder or hemostat, toothed forceps, iris scissors Additional Considerations for Lateral Canthotomy Speed of diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) and of execution of the canthotomy or cantholysis procedure are important to minimize the duration of retinal ischemia. Ophthalmologic consultation should be requested but should not delay the procedure. Because the diagnosis of OCS is purely clinical, the procedure also should not be delayed for imaging studies. Sterile technique is necessary. This procedure is painful. A conscious, confused, or uncooperative patient may require regional nerve block, sedation, or restraint to prevent motion that could result in damage to the eyeball during the procedure. Children may require general anesthesia in the operating room. Relevant Anatomy for Lateral Canthotomy The medial and lateral canthal ligaments contain the eye within the orbit and eyelids. The lateral canthal tendon has two branches: a superior and an inferior. Cutting one, or both, loosens the eyelids and allows the globe to expand out of the orbit and thus relieve pressure on the eye. Positioning for Lateral Canthotomy Position the patient supine on the stretcher and stabilize the patient’s head and eyelids. Step-by-Step Description of Lateral Canthotomy All preliminary steps should be done as quickly as possible, including rough estimation of visual acuity Assessing Visual Acuity , inspection of the globe, and sometimes a simple cleaning and irrigation of the lateral canthus area. Place all your instruments on a tray near the head of the bed, so everything is within easy reach and you do not have to ask for assistance. Prepare the skin with an antiseptic agent such as povidone iodine or chlorhexidine; do not allow the antiseptic to enter the eye. Drape the area. Inject 1 or 2 mL of local anesthetic containing epinephrine into the lateral canthal incision site. Use a needle driver or hemostat to crush the tissue from the lateral canthus to the rim of the orbit, for about 20 seconds to 2 minutes. Crushing this tissue helps minimize bleeding and makes it easier to see where to cut when there is extensive traumatic edema. Use iris scissors to cut from the lateral canthus to the rim of the orbit, about 1 to 2 cm (canthotomy). Cut the inferior and sometimes both crus of the lateral canthal ligament (cantholysis). Most experts recommend starting with the inferior crus. Lift the lateral portion of lower eyelid. With the scissors pointing away from the globe, identify and cut the inferior crus. “Strumming” with the scissors may help identify the inferior crus. If the tendon is still intact, you will feel a twanging like a plucked string. Next, some experts recommend routinely cutting the superior crus. Others recommend reassessing for relief of orbital compartment syndrome (OCS—eg, by measuring intraocular pressure) and cutting the superior crus only if OCS persists. To cut the superior crus, lift and expose the underside of the lateral upper eyelid. Check whether the superior crus tendon has been cut by strumming across it with the scissors. If the tendon is still intact, cut it. Cutting the tendon loosens the eyelid and relieves pressure on the eye even more.

Filmed on location at School of Medicine, Anatomical Services Division, Univ. of Maryland. Aftercare for Lateral Canthotomy Because the patient cannot blink to lubricate the cornea, apply an antibiotic ointment to the eye and cover it with a sterile dressing. Lateral canthotomy incisions are not sutured at the time of the canthotomy and often heal without significant scarring. Patients with severe injuries should be hospitalized. Methylprednisolone (ie, 250 mg IM/IV every 6 hours) for 3 days should be considered for inpatients with progressive vision loss. If intraocular pressure remains elevated, topical therapy (eg, timolol 0.5%, brimonidine 0.2%, or dorzolamide 2% eye drops) or systemic therapy (eg, acetazolamide immediate-release 500 mg by mouth, or mannitol 1 to 2 mg/kg IV over 45 minutes) should be considered. Patients should avoid straining and apply ice packs for several days following canthotomy. Warnings and Common Errors of Lateral Canthotomy If a ruptured globe is suspected, avoid checking intraocular pressure or palpating the globe. Tips and Tricks for Lateral Canthotomy When cutting the inferior crus, aim inferoposteriorly toward the lateral rim to avoid injuring the levator muscle, lacrimal gland, and lacrimal artery, which are located superiorly.

Inflammation that can affect small- and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) may affect any organ. The peripheral nervous system, sinuses, skin, joints, lungs, digestive tract, heart, and kidneys are most commonly affected. Collections of immune cells that cause inflammation (called granulomas) may form raised bumps (nodules) in affected tissue. Granulomas can destroy normal tissue and interfere with functioning. They may also cause lumps to form under the skin. People also have an increased number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in their blood and body tissues. An increased number of eosinophils is called eosinophilia, and the increase suggests that an allergic reaction may be part of the disorder. Symptoms In people with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, asthma, nasal allergies, nasal polyposis, or a combination may develop or worsen over many years. People may sneeze and have a persistently runny nose and itchy eyes. Inflammation of the sinuses may cause facial pain. Later, people may feel generally ill and tired. They may have fevers or night sweats or lose their appetite and lose weight. Other symptoms depend on which organs are affected and may include the following: Muscle and joint pain Shortness of breath, asthma, and sinusitis Chest pain Rashes Abdominal pain and diarrhea Blood in the stool Abnormal sensations, numbness, or weakness in a limb, often sudden Confusion, seizures, and coma Any combination of these symptoms may occur.

Testing Most patients require laboratory evaluation (see table Laboratory Tests of Hemostasis by Phase Laboratory Tests of Hemostasis by Phase ). The initial tests are Complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count Peripheral blood smear Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) Screening tests evaluate the components of hemostasis, including the number of circulating platelets and the plasma coagulation pathways (see figure Pathways in blood coagulation Pathways in blood coagulation ).

Prothrombin time (PT) screens for abnormalities in the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation (plasma factors VII, X, V, prothrombin [II], and fibrinogen). The PT is reported as the international normalized ratio (INR), which reflects the ratio of the patient’s PT to the laboratory’s control value; the INR controls for differences in reagents among different laboratories. Because commercial reagents and instrumentation vary widely, each laboratory determines its own normal range for PT and PTT; a typical normal range for the PT is between 10 and 13 seconds. An INR > 1.5 or a PT ≥ 3 seconds longer than a laboratory’s normal control value is usually abnormal and requires further evaluation.

It is also used to monitor therapy with the oral vitamin K antagonist, warfarin. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) screens plasma for abnormalities in factors of the intrinsic and common pathways (prekallikrein; high molecular weight kininogen; factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, and V; prothrombin [II]; fibrinogen). The PTT tests for deficiencies of all clotting factors except factor VII (measured by the PT) and factor XIII (measured by a factor XIII assay). A typical normal range is 28 to 34 seconds.

For determining whether prolongation reflects a deficiency of one or more clotting factor or the presence of an inhibitor, the test is repeated after mixing the patient’s plasma with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio. Because this mixture contains at least 50% of normal levels of all coagulation factors, failure of the mixture to correct almost completely the prolongation suggests the presence of an inhibitor in patient plasma.

Imaging tests are often required to detect occult bleeding in patients with bleeding disorders. For example, head CT should be done in patients with severe headaches, head injuries, or impairment of consciousness. Abdominal CT is needed in patients with abdominal pain or other findings compatible with intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Treatment of Excessive Bleeding Treat underlying disorder Treatment is directed at the underlying disorder. In addition, hypovolemia should be corrected. For immediate treatment of bleeding due to a coagulopathy that has not yet been diagnosed, fresh frozen plasma, which contains all coagulation factors, should be infused pending definitive evaluation. Key Points Disseminated intravascular coagulation should be suspected in patients with sepsis, shock, or complications of pregnancy or delivery. Mild platelet dysfunction caused by aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is common. Easy bruising with no other clinical manifestations and normal laboratory test results is often benign.

Ab = antibody; Ag =antigen; C1-INH = C1 inhibitor; MAC = membrane attack complex; MASP = MBL-associated serine protease; MBL = mannose-binding lectin. Overbar indicates activation. Classical pathway components are labeled with a C and a number (eg, C1, C3), based on the order in which they were identified. Alternative pathway components are often lettered (eg, factor B, factor D) or named (eg, properdin). Classical pathway activation is either Antibody-dependent, occurring when C1 interacts with antigen-IgM or aggregated antigen-IgG complexes Antibody-independent, occurring when polyanions (eg, heparin, protamine, DNA and RNA from apoptotic cells), gram-negative bacteria, or bound C-reactive protein reacts directly with C1 This pathway is regulated by C1 inhibitor (C1-INH).

Lectin pathway activation is antibody-independent; it occurs when mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a serum protein, binds to mannose, fucose, or N-acetylglucosamine groups on bacterial cell walls, yeast walls, or viruses. This pathway otherwise resembles the classical pathway structurally and functionally. Alternate pathway activation occurs when components of microbial cell surfaces (eg, yeast walls, bacterial cell wall lipopolysaccharide [endotoxin]) or immunoglobulin (eg, nephritic factor, aggregated IgA) cleave small amounts of C3. This pathway is regulated by properdin, factor H, and decay-accelerating factor (CD55). The 3 activation pathways converge into a final common pathway when C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b (see figure Complement activation pathways Complement activation pathways ). C3 cleavage may result in formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), the cytotoxic component of the complement system. MAC causes lysis of foreign cells. Factor I, with cofactors including membrane cofactor protein (CD46), inactivates C3b and C4b.

Several CRs use molecules that have been assigned a CD number. CR1 (CD35) promotes phagocytosis and helps clear immune complexes. CR2 (CD21) regulates antibody production by B cells and is the Epstein-Barr virus receptor. CR3 (CD11b/CD18), CR4 (CD11c/CD18), and C1q receptors play a role in phagocytosis. C3a, C5a, and C4a (weakly) have anaphylatoxin activity: They cause mast cell degranulation, leading to increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. C3b acts as an opsonin by coating microorganisms and thereby enhancing their phagocytosis. C3d enhances antibody production by B cells. C5a is a neutrophil chemoattractant; it regulates neutrophil and monocyte activities and may cause augmented adherence of cells, degranulation and release of intracellular enzymes from granulocytes, production of toxic oxygen metabolites, and initiation of other cellular metabolic events.

The soft, jelly-like interior of the disk may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering. Aging, injuries, and being overweight can cause a herniated disk. When herniated disks cause pain, it can be slight to debilitating. Imaging tests are done to make the diagnosis. People can reduce their risk of a herniated disk by exercising, strengthening their muscles, and maintaining a healthy weight. Treatment includes measures to relieve pain and sometimes surgery. The spine (spinal column) consists of back bones (vertebrae). There are shock-absorbing disks between each of the vertebrae. The disks have a tough, outer layer of fibrocartilage and a soft, jelly-like interior called the nucleus pulposus. If a disk is suddenly squeezed by the vertebrae above and below it (as when lifting a heavy object), the outer layer may tear (rupture), causing pain. The interior of the disk can squeeze through the tear in the covering, so that part of the interior bulges out (herniates). This bulge can compress, irritate, and even damage the spinal nerve root or sometimes the spinal cord (see also Compression of the Spinal Cord Compression of the Spinal Cord Injuries and disorders can put pressure on the spinal cord, causing back or neck pain, tingling, muscle weakness, and other symptoms.

Common.TooltipReadMore if the rupture or herniation affects a disk that is in the neck (called a herniated cervical disk). More than 80% of herniated disks occur in the lower back. They are most common among people aged 30 to 50 years. Between these ages, the covering weakens. The jelly-like interior, which is under high pressure, may squeeze through a tear or a weakened spot in the covering and bulge out. After age 50, the interior of the disk begins to harden, making herniation less likely. A disk may herniate because of a sudden, traumatic injury or repeated minor injuries. Being overweight or lifting heavy objects, particularly lifting incorrectly, increases the risk. A Herniated Disk The tough covering of a disk in the spine can tear (rupture), causing pain. The soft, jelly-like interior may then bulge out (herniate) through the covering, causing more pain. Pain occurs because the bulge puts pressure on the spinal nerve root next to it. Sometimes the nerve root becomes inflamed or is damaged. Symptoms of Herniated Disk Often, herniated disks, even ones that appear obviously bulging or herniated on imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), cause no symptoms. Herniated disks that do not cause symptoms are more common as people age. However, herniated disks may cause slight to debilitating pain. Movement often intensifies the pain, and the pain is worsened by coughing, sneezing, straining, or leaning forward. Where the pain occurs depends on which disk is herniated and which spinal nerve root is affected. The pain may be felt along the pathway of the nerve compressed by the herniated disk. For example, a herniated disk in the low back commonly causes sciatica Sciatica Sciatica is pain along the sciatic nerves.

Prevention of Herniated Disk It is not always possible to prevent a herniated disc, but there are ways to reduce the risk of developing one: Exercising Strengthening and stretching muscles Maintaining a healthy weight Maintaining good posture Using proper lifting techniques Regular exercise is an effective way to reduce the risk of developing a herniated disc. Aerobic exercise and specific muscle-strengthening and stretching exercises can help. Aerobic exercise, such as swimming and walking, improves general fitness and generally strengthens muscles. Specific exercises to strengthen and stretch the muscles in the abdomen, buttocks, and back (the core muscles) can help stabilize the spine and decrease strain on the disks that cushion the spine and the ligaments that hold it in place. Muscle-strengthening exercises include pelvic tilts and abdominal curls. Stretching exercises include the knee-to-chest stretch. Stretching exercises can increase back pain in some people and therefore should be done carefully. As a general rule, any exercise that causes or increases back pain should be stopped. Exercises should be repeated until the muscles feel mildly but not completely fatigued. Breathing during each exercise is important. People who have back pain should consult a doctor before beginning to exercise. Exercises to Prevent Low Back Pain Pelvic Tilts Lie on the back with the knees bent, the heels on the floor, and the weight on the heels. Press the small of the back against the floor, contract the buttocks (raising them about half an inch [1 cm] from the floor), and contract the abdominal muscles. Hold this position for a count of 10. Repeat 20 times. Abdominal Curls Lie on the back with the knees bent and feet on the floor. Place the hands across the chest. Contract the abdominal muscles, slowly raising the shoulders about 10 inches (25 cm) from the floor while keeping the head back (the chin should not touch the chest). Then release the abdominal muscles, slowly lowering the shoulders. Do 3 sets of 10. Knee-to-Chest Stretch Lie flat on the back. Place both hands behind one knee and bring it to the chest. Hold for a count of 10. Slowly lower that leg and repeat with the other leg. Do this exercise 10 times. Exercise can also help people maintain a desirable weight because being overweight increases the stress on a disk. Maintaining good posture when standing, sitting, and sleeping reduces stress on the back. Slouching should be avoided. Chair seats can be adjusted to a height that allows the feet to be flat on the floor, with the knees bent up slightly and the lower back flat against the back of the chair. If a chair does not support the lower back, a pillow can be used behind the lower back. Sitting with the feet on the floor rather than with the legs crossed is advised. People should avoid standing or sitting for long periods. If prolonged standing or sitting is unavoidable, changing positions frequently may reduce stress on the back. Learning to lift correctly helps prevent back injury. The hips should be aligned with the shoulders (that is, not rotated to one side or the other). People with low back pain should avoid bending over with their legs nearly straight and reach out with their arms to pick up an object. Instead, they should bend at the hips and knees. Bending this way keeps the back straighter and brings the arms down to the object with the elbows at the side. Then, keeping the object close to the body, they lift the object by straightening their legs. This way, the legs, not the back, lift the object. Lifting an object over the head or twisting while lifting increases the risk of back injury. Treatment of Herniated Disk Measures to relieve pain Sometimes surgery Because a herniated disk shrinks over time, symptoms tend to lessen regardless of treatment. Most people recover without any treatment, usually within 3 months, but often much faster.

If symptoms are not relieved with analgesics, doctors may give corticosteroids taken by mouth or injected into the epidural space (between the spine and the outer layer of tissue covering the spinal cord). However, whether such corticosteroid injections are beneficial is controversial. Sleeping in a comfortable position on a medium mattress is recommended. People who sleep on their back can place a pillow under their knees. People who sleep on their side should use a pillow to support their head in a neutral position (not tilted down toward the bed or up toward the ceiling). They should place another pillow between their knees with their hips and knees bent slightly if that relieves their back pain.

Common.TooltipReadMore ), surgical removal of the bulging part of the disk (diskectomy) and sometimes part of the vertebra (lumbar laminectomy) may be necessary. A general anesthetic is usually required. The hospital stay is usually 1 or 2 days. Often, microsurgical techniques, with a small incision and regional spinal anesthesia (which numbs only a specific part of the body), can be used to remove the herniated portion of the disk. Hospitalization for this procedure is usually not required. After either procedure, most people can resume all of their activities in 6 weeks to 3 months. Surgery tends to result in faster recovery than treatment without surgery. However, after about a year or two, people treated with or without surgery have about the same degree of recovery.

Preparations of Influenza Vaccine There are 2 basic types of influenza vaccine: Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) Trivalent vaccines are gradually being superseded by quadrivalent vaccines that cover an additional B virus strain. A quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) and a cell culture–based vaccine (ccIIV4) that do not contain egg protein are available. High-dose quadrivalent vaccines are available for patients ≥ 65 years of age. (See also CDC: Different Types of Flu Vaccines.) Indications for Influenza Vaccine Annual vaccination against influenza with an age-appropriate formulation is recommended For all people ≥ 6 months of age who do not have a contraindication Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) can be given to all people ≥ 6 months, including pregnant women. Adults ≥ 65 years should be given high-dose IIV. The high dose is recommended only for those ≥ 65 years. Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) can be used in people aged 18 to 49 years. Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) can be given to healthy people aged 2 to 49 years who are not pregnant and who do not have immunocompromising conditions. Safety of LAIV has not been established in people with disorders that predispose them to complications from influenza, including advanced lung disease or asthma. Health care workers who care for immunocompromised people (ie, those who require care in a protected environment) should be given IIV or RIV4 rather than LAIV (or they should avoid contact with the immunocompromised people for 7 days after getting the vaccine). Contraindications and Precautions of Influenza Vaccine The main contraindication for IIV is A severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are reexposed to the sensitizing antigen.

Any influenza vaccine that is otherwise recommended based on the recipient’s age and health status can be used. Patients who report reactions to egg involving symptoms other than hives (such as angioedema, respiratory distress, light-headedness, or recurrent emesis) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention may similarly be given any influenza vaccine that is otherwise recommended based on the recipient’s age and health status. The vaccine should be given in a medical setting and supervised by a health care practitioner capable of recognizing and managing severe allergic conditions. Dose and Administration of Influenza Vaccine The influenza vaccine is given yearly. For IIV, the dose is 0.25 mL or 0.50 mL IM (depending on vaccine) for children aged 6 to 35 months 0.5 mL IM for people ≥ 3 years 0.1 mL for people aged 18 to 64 years, given intradermally Children age 6 months to 8 years who have received fewer than 2 influenza vaccine doses or whose influenza vaccination history is unknown should receive 2 doses, separated by at least 4 weeks. The smaller, intradermal dose can be used to conserve vaccine in times of shortage. For LAIV, the dose is 0.1 mL, sprayed into each nostril (total dose is 0.2 mL). For RIV4, the dose is 0.5 mL IM. Adverse Effects of Influenza Vaccine For IIV, adverse effects are usually limited to mild pain at the injection site. Fever, myalgia, and other systemic effects are relatively uncommon; however, people who have been vaccinated may mistakenly think that the vaccine is causing influenza. Such reactions do not contraindicate future vaccination, which should be encouraged. Multidose vials contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative.

Survey data from 2010–2011 indicate that almost 90% of older adults regularly take at least 1 prescription drug, almost... read more .) Drugs may be ineffective in older adults because clinicians under-dose (eg, because of increased concern about adverse effects) or because adherence is poor (eg, because of financial or cognitive limitations). Adverse drug effects are effects that are unwanted, uncomfortable, or dangerous. Common examples are oversedation, confusion, hallucinations, falls, and bleeding. Among ambulatory people ≥ 65, adverse drug effects occur at a rate of about 50 events per 1000 person-years. Hospitalization rates due to adverse drug effects are 4 times higher in older patients (about 17%) than in younger patients (4%). And 66% of these hospitalizations in older patients are due to 4 drugs or drug classes—warfarin, insulin, oral antiplatelet drugs, and oral hypoglycemic drugs. Reasons for Drug-Related Problems Adverse drug effects can occur in any patient, but certain characteristics of older adults make them more susceptible. For example, older adults often take multiple drugs and have age-related changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics; both increase the risk of adverse effects. At any age, adverse drug effects may occur when drugs are prescribed and taken appropriately; eg, new-onset allergic reactions are not predictable or preventable. However, adverse effects are thought to be preventable in at least 25% of cases in older adults. Certain drug classes are commonly involved: antipsychotics, warfarin, antiplatelet agents, hypoglycemic drugs, insulin, antidepressants, and sedative-hypnotics. In older adults, a number of common causes for adverse drug effects, ineffectiveness, or both are preventable (see table Preventable Causes of Drug-Related Problems Preventable Causes of Drug-Related Problems ). One major cause involves inadequate communication with patients or between health care practitioners (particularly during health care transitions). Many drug-related problems could be prevented if greater attention were given to medication reconciliation when patients are admitted or discharged from the hospital or at other care transitions (transfer from nursing home to hospital, or skilled nursing facility to home) (1-3 References Drug-related problems are common in older adults and include drug ineffectiveness, adverse drug effects, overdosage, underdosage, inappropriate treatment, inadequate monitoring, nonadherence... read more ). Table Drug-disease interactions A drug given to treat one disease can exacerbate another disease regardless of patient age, but such interactions are of special concern in older adults. Distinguishing often subtle adverse drug effects from the effects of disease is difficult (see table Drug-Disease Interactions of Concern in Older Adults Drug-Disease Interactions of Concern in Older Adults (Based on the American Geriatrics Society 2019 Beers Criteria® Update) ) and may lead to a prescribing cascade. A prescribing cascade occurs when the adverse effect of a drug is misinterpreted as a symptom or sign of a new disorder and a new drug is prescribed to treat it. The new, unnecessary drug may cause additional adverse effects, which may then be misinterpreted as yet another disorder and treated unnecessarily, and so on. Many drugs have adverse effects that resemble symptoms of disorders common in older adults or changes due to aging. The following are examples: Antipsychotics may cause symptoms that resemble Parkinson disease. In older adults, these symptoms may be diagnosed as Parkinson disease and treated with dopaminergic drugs, possibly leading to adverse effects from the antiparkinson drugs (eg, orthostatic hypotension, delirium, hallucinations, nausea). Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) may be prescribed for patients with dementia. These drugs may cause diarrhea or urinary frequency or urge incontinence. Patients may then be prescribed an anticholinergic drug (eg, oxybutynin) to treat the new symptoms. Thus, an unnecessary drug is added, increasing the risk of adverse drug effects and drug-drug interactions. A better strategy is to reduce the dose of the cholinesterase inhibitor or consider a different treatment for dementia (eg, memantine) with a different mechanism of action. Calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine) may be prescribed for patients with hypertension. These drugs may treat the hypertension appropriately, but they may also cause peripheral edema. Patients may then be prescribed diuretic therapy (eg, furosemide), which may then cause hypokalemia necessitating potassium supplementation. A better strategy is to reduce the dose or discontinue the calcium channel blocker in favor of other antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In older patients, prescribers should always consider the possibility that a new symptom or sign is due to existing drug therapy. Table Drug-drug interactions Because older adults often take many drugs, they are particularly vulnerable to drug-drug interactions. Older adults also frequently use medicinal herbs and other dietary supplements Overview of Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements are the most commonly used of all integrative, complementary, and alternative therapies, primarily because they are widely available, relatively inexpensive, and can be bought... read more and may not tell their health care providers. Medicinal herbs can interact with prescribed drugs and lead to adverse effects. For example, ginkgo biloba extract taken with warfarin can increase risk of bleeding, and St. John's wort taken with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) can increase risk of serotonin syndrome. Therefore, physicians should ask patients specifically about dietary supplements, including medicinal herbs and vitamin supplements. Drug-drug interactions in older adults differ little from those in the general population. However, induction of cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) drug metabolism Drug Metabolism The liver is the principal site of drug metabolism (for review, see [ 1]). Although metabolism typically inactivates drugs, some drug metabolites are pharmacologically active—sometimes even... read more by certain drugs (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may be decreased in older adults; therefore, the change (increase) in drug metabolism may be less pronounced in older adults. Many other drugs inhibit CYP450 metabolism and thus increase the risk of toxicity of drugs that depend on that pathway for elimination. Because older adults typically use a larger number of drugs, they are at greater risk of multiple, difficult-to-predict CYP450 interactions. Also, concurrent use of ≥ 1 drug with similar adverse effects can increase risk or severity of adverse effects. Inadequate monitoring Monitoring drug use involves Documenting the indication for a new drug Keeping a current list of drugs used by the patient in medical records Monitoring for achievement of therapeutic goals and other responses to new drugs Monitoring necessary laboratory tests for efficacy or adverse effects Periodically reviewing drugs for continued need Such measures are especially important for older patients. Lack of close monitoring, especially after new drugs are prescribed, increases risk of polypharmacy, adverse effects and ineffectiveness. Criteria to facilitate monitoring have been developed by the Health Care Financing Administration expert consensus panel as part of drug utilization review criteria. The criteria focus on inappropriate dosage or duration of therapy, duplication of therapy, and possible drug-drug interactions. Inappropriate drug selection A drug is inappropriate if its potential for harm is greater than its potential for benefit. Inappropriate use of a drug may involve Choice of an unsuitable drug, dose, frequency of dosing, or duration of therapy Duplication of therapy Failure to consider drug interactions and appropriate indications for a drug Appropriate drugs that are mistakenly continued once an acute condition resolves (as may happen when patients move from one health care setting to another and the indication is not reevaluated) Some classes of drugs are of special concern in older adults Drug Categories of Concern in Older Adults Some drug categories (eg, analgesics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian drugs, diuretics, hypoglycemic drugs, psychoactive drugs) pose special risks for older adults. Some... read more . Some drugs are so problematic that they should be avoided altogether in older adults, some should be avoided only in certain situations, and others can be used but with increased caution. The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® (see table Potentially Inappropriate Drugs in Older Adults Drug-Disease Interactions of Concern in Older Adults (Based on the American Geriatrics Society 2019 Beers Criteria® Update) ) lists potentially inappropriate drugs for older adults by drug class; other similar lists are available (4 References Drug-related problems are common in older adults and include drug ineffectiveness, adverse drug effects, overdosage, underdosage, inappropriate treatment, inadequate monitoring, nonadherence... read more ). A list of some drug-therapy alternatives with supporting references is also available (5 References Drug-related problems are common in older adults and include drug ineffectiveness, adverse drug effects, overdosage, underdosage, inappropriate treatment, inadequate monitoring, nonadherence... read more ). Clinicians must weigh potential benefits and risks of therapy in each patient. The criteria do not apply to patients at the end-of-life, when drug therapy decisions are much different. Despite dissemination and knowledge of the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® and other criteria, inappropriate drugs are still being prescribed for older adults; typically, about 20% of community-dwelling older adults receive at least one inappropriate drug. In such patients, risk of adverse effects is increased. In nursing home patients, inappropriate use also increases risk of hospitalization and death. In one study of hospitalized patients, 27.5% received an inappropriate drug. Some inappropriate drugs (eg, diphenhydramine and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are available over-the-counter (OTC); thus, clinicians should specifically question patients about use of OTC drugs and discuss with patients the potential problems such drugs can cause. Older adults are often prescribed drugs (typically, analgesics, proton pump inhibitors, or hypnotics) for minor symptoms (including adverse effects of other drugs) that may be better treated with nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, exercise, physical therapy, massage, dietary changes, cognitive-behavioral therapy) or by lowering the dose of the drug causing adverse effects. Initiating additional drugs is often inappropriate; benefit may be low, costs are increased, and the new drug may lead to additional toxicity. Solving the problem of inappropriate drug use in older adults requires more than avoiding a short list of drugs and noting drug categories of concern. A patient’s entire drug regimen should also be assessed regularly to determine continued need for a drug, as well as potential benefit versus harm. Lack of patient adherence Drug effectiveness is often compromised by lack of patient adherence among the ambulatory older adults. Adherence Adherence to a Drug Regimen Adherence (compliance) is the degree to which a patient follows a treatment regimen. For drugs, adherence requires that the prescription be obtained promptly and the drug be taken as prescribed... read more is affected by many factors, including language barriers, but not by age per se. Up to half of older adults do not take drugs as directed, usually taking less than prescribed (underadherence). Causes are similar to those for younger adults. In addition, the following contribute: Financial and physical constraints, which may make purchasing drugs difficult Cognitive problems, which may make taking drugs as instructed difficult Use of multiple drugs (polypharmacy) Use of drugs that must be taken several times a day or in a specific manner Lack of understanding about what a drug is intended to do (benefits) or how to recognize and manage adverse effects (harms) A regimen using too frequent or too infrequent dosing, multiple drugs, or both may be too complicated for patients to follow. Clinicians should assess patients’ health literacy and abilities to adhere to a drug regimen (eg, dexterity, hand strength, cognition, vision) and try to accommodate their limitations—eg, by arranging for or recommending easy-access containers, drug labels and instructions in large type, containers equipped with reminder alarms, containers filled based on daily drug needs, reminder telephone calls, or medication assistance. Pharmacists and nurses can help by providing education and reviewing prescription instructions with older adults at each encounter. Pharmacists may be able to identify a problem by noting whether patients obtain refills on schedule or whether a prescription seems illogical or incorrect. Many pharmacies can monitor refill patterns and contact patients and/or prescribers if prescriptions are not being refilled at appropriate intervals. Overdosage An excessive dose of an appropriate drug may be prescribed for older adults if the prescriber does not consider age-related changes that affect pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Older Adults Pharmacokinetics is best defined as what the body does to the drug; it includes Absorption Distribution across body compartments Metabolism Excretion read more and pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics in Older Adults In contrast to pharmacokinetic effects, pharmacodynamics is defined as what the drug does to the body or the response of the body to the drug; it is affected by receptor binding, postreceptor... read more . For example, doses of renally cleared drugs (eg, gabapentin, some antimicrobials, digoxin) should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment. Generally, although dose requirements vary considerably from person to person, drugs should be started at the lowest dose in older adults. Typically, starting doses of about one third to one half the usual adult dose are indicated when a drug has a narrow therapeutic index, when another condition may be exacerbated by a drug, and particularly when patients are frail. The dose is then titrated upward as tolerated to the desired effect. When the dose is increased, patients should be evaluated for adverse effects, and drug levels should be monitored when possible. Overdosage can also occur when drug interactions Drug-drug interactions Drug-related problems are common in older adults and include drug ineffectiveness, adverse drug effects, overdosage, underdosage, inappropriate treatment, inadequate monitoring, nonadherence... read more increase the amount of drug available or when different practitioners prescribe a drug and are unaware that another practitioner prescribed the same or a similar drug (therapeutic duplication). Poor communication Poor communication of medical information at transition points (from one health care setting to another) causes up to 50% of all drug errors and up to 20% of adverse drug effects in the hospital. When patients are discharged from the hospital, drug regimens that were started and needed only in the hospital (eg, sedative hypnotics, laxatives, proton pump inhibitors) may be unnecessarily continued by the discharging prescriber. This can be due to carelessness or lack of time or ability to communicate with the primary care prescriber. Conversely, at admission to a health care facility, lack of communication may result in unintentional omission of a necessary maintenance drug. Drug reconciliation refers to a formal process of reviewing all prescribed drugs at each transition of care and can help eliminate errors and omissions. Underprescribing Appropriate drugs may be underprescribed—ie, not used for maximum effectiveness. Underprescribing may increase morbidity and mortality and reduce quality of life. Clinicians should use adequate drug doses and, when indicated, multidrug regimens. Drugs that are often underprescribed in older adults include those used to treat depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction (beta-blockers), atrial fibrillation (anticoagulants), and hypertension. Also, immunizations are not always given as recommended. Beta-blockers: In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and/or heart failure, even in older patients at high risk of complications (eg, those with pulmonary disorders or diabetes), these drugs reduce mortality rates and hospitalizations. Antihypertensives: Guidelines for treating hypertension in older adults are available, and treatment appears to be beneficial (reducing risk of stroke and major cardiovascular events) even in frail older adults. Nonetheless, studies indicate that hypertension is often not optimally controlled in older patients. Drugs for Alzheimer disease: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) antagonists have been shown to benefit patients with Alzheimer disease. The amount of benefit is modest and variable, but patients and family members should be given the opportunity to make an informed decision about their use. Anticoagulants: Anticoagulants (both warfarin and the newer direct oral anticoagulant drugs) reduce risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Although there is an increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulation in general, some older adults who might benefit from anticoagulation are not receiving it. Immunizations: Older adults are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from influenza, pneumococcal infection, and herpes zoster. Vaccination rates among older adults can still be improved. In older patients with a chronic disorder, acute or unrelated disorders may be undertreated (eg, hypercholesterolemia may be untreated in patients with COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]). Clinicians may withhold these treatments because they are concerned about increasing the risk of adverse effects or the time required to benefit from treatment in a patient with reduced life expectancy. Clinicians may think that treatment of the primary problem is all patients can or want to handle or that patients cannot afford the additional drugs. Patients and caregivers should be active participants in decision making about drug treatment so that clinicians can understand patients' priorities and concerns. References 1.

Monitor patients for signs of adverse drug effects, including measuring drug levels and doing other laboratory tests as necessary. Document the response to therapy and increase doses as necessary to achieve the desired effect. Regularly reevaluate the need to continue drug therapy and stop drugs that are no longer necessary or drugs with greater potential risk than benefit. Ongoing The following should be ongoing: Medication reconciliation is a process that helps ensure transfer of information about drug regimens at any transition point in the health care system. The process includes identifying and listing all drugs patients are taking (name, dose, frequency, route) and comparing the resulting list with the physician’s orders at a transition point. Medication reconciliation should occur at each move (admission, transfer, and discharge). Computerized physician ordering programs can alert clinicians to potential problems (eg, allergy, need for reduced dosage in patients with impaired renal function, drug-drug interactions). These programs can also cue clinicians to monitor certain patients closely for adverse drug effects.

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary significantly. Two types of tests can be used to diagnose a COVID-19 infection. Measures should be taken to prevent infection, particularly vaccination, social distancing, and masking. Treatment of COVID-19 depends on how severe the illness is and the likelihood that the person will develop severe disease. COVID-19 was first reported in late 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since spread extensively worldwide. For current information on the number of cases and deaths, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the World Health Organization Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. It is related to but slightly different from the coronavirus that causes SARS Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. There are many different coronaviruses. Most of them cause... Common.TooltipReadMore . Social determinants of health (conditions in the places where people are born, live, learn, work, and play) impact a wide range of health risks and outcomes, such as exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19, and death, as well as access to testing, vaccination, and treatment (see CDC: Risk for COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Death By Race/Ethnicity). In the United States, COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates are higher in some racial and ethnic minority groups, including among people who are Black, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, and Alaska Native. Most viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, evolve and new variants of the virus emerge. Variants with the potential to be more transmissible, more likely to cause severe disease, or that are harder to treat are tracked as Variants of Concern and are commonly referred to by their Greek alphabet label. The dominant variants in the United States and much of the world are Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. The Omicron variant has been the most common variant worldwide since March 2022, with newer and more transmissible Omicron subvariants (such as BA.4 and BA.5) replacing the original Omicron (B.1.1.529). See also CDC: Omicron Variant: What You Need to Know. Transmission of COVID-19 COVID-19 is mainly spread from person to person through respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, exercises, or talks. The virus spreads through both large respiratory droplets that can travel short distances and through small respiratory particle aerosols that can linger in the air for several hours and travel longer distances (> 6 feet) before being inhaled. In general, the closer and longer the interaction with an infected person, the higher the risk of the virus spreading. Factors such as distance from an infected person, duration of time in the presence of an infected person, the size of the air space, and the direction and speed of airflow can contribute to this risk. People may also get a COVID-19 infection by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. The virus is usually transmitted by a person with symptoms of the infection. However, the virus can be transmitted by people before they exhibit symptoms (presymptomatic) and even by people who are infected but never develop symptoms (asymptomatic). Situations with high risk of transmission include congregate living facilities (for example, elder care or other long-term care facilities, residential schools, prisons, ships) and crowded, poorly ventilated environments (such as indoor religious services, gyms, bars, night clubs, indoor restaurants, and meat-packing facilities). The residents of elder care facilities are also at high risk of severe disease because of age and underlying medical disorders. Large indoor events, such as meetings or weddings, have also been associated with high transmission rates. These have been called super-spreader events and may lead high rates of infection due to large numbers of people being physically close to each other without adequate airflow or ventilation. Viral tests Diagnosis in people with COVID-19 may remain positive for at least 3 months regardless of symptoms. However, even people with lingering symptoms are generally not considered infectious after 10 days of illness. Symptoms of COVID-19 Symptoms vary in people with COVID-19 and may include the following: Fever Cough Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Chills or repeated shaking with chills New loss of smell or taste Fatigue Muscle pain Headache Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea If people develop symptoms, they usually appear about 2 to 14 days (incubation period) after being infected. For the Omicron variant, symptoms usually appear in only 2 to 4 days. Many infected people have no symptoms or have only mild disease. The risk of serious disease and death in people with COVID-19 increases With age In people who smoke or previously smoked In people with other serious medical disorders, such as cancer or chronic heart, lung, kidney, or liver disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, obesity, or immunocompromising disorders For all age groups, risk of serious disease and death decreases in people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 COVID-19 Vaccine Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines provide protection against COVID-19.

Vaccination helps protect against developing MIS-C. A similar complication has been reported in young and middle-aged adults (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults [MIS-A]). In most people, symptoms resolve over about a week. However, in some people, symptoms last longer, sometimes with shortness of breath, cough, and extreme fatigue, and persisting for weeks. Prolonged illness appears to be more common in those who originally had severe disease, but even people with mild illness may have persistent symptoms. In 25 to 50% of people with COVID-19, symptoms last for months. This has been referred to by many names, including long COVID, long-haul COVID, and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome or condition. Diagnosis of COVID-19 Tests to identify the virus Doctors suspect COVID-19 in people who have symptoms of the infection. Recent close contact with someone who has COVID-19 increases the likelihood of infection. People who suspect they may have COVID-19 should call their doctor before being tested and before arriving at a clinic so appropriate precautions can be taken. The following people should be tested for COVID-19 (also see COVID-19 Testing): People with symptoms of COVID-19 Symptoms COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness that can be severe and is caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.

There are two types of tests to diagnose COVID-19 infection: NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) Antigen tests There are multiple types of NAATs. RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction) tests, often simply called PCR tests, are the type of NAAT that have the highest sensitivity and specificity, meaning they are more accurate and thus the preferred initial test for COVID-19. RT-PCR tests can be done on upper and lower respiratory secretions (samples from nasal or oral swabs or saliva) to identify the virus. Antigen tests can be done at home or in a health care setting, but they are generally less accurate than NAATs, including RT-PCR tests. Therefore, it may be necessary to confirm some antigen test results (for example, a negative test in a person with symptoms) with a RT-PCR or other NAAT. Many antigen test kits also recommend repeating the test over several days to increase the likelihood of detecting infection. Also, some tests may not detect the Omicron variant or other emerging variants (see FDA: SARS-CoV-2 Viral Mutations: Impact on COVID-19 Tests). Another type of test is called an antibody test. Antibody tests (also called serologic tests) are not used for diagnosing current infections. Antibody tests help determine whether the person being tested was previously infected, which is important for tracking cases and studying the virus. Prevention of COVID-19 Vaccination The best way to prevent infection, severe illness, and death from COVID-19 is to be up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations, including booster shots. In the United States in the fall of 2021, unvaccinated people were 78 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than vaccinated people who had received a booster dose. For a detailed discussion of the vaccines approved in the United States, see COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 Vaccine Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines provide protection against COVID-19. COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are multiple COVID-19 vaccines... Common.TooltipReadMore . Following the recommendations for vaccination is very important for people's own health and for the health of their family and the people in their community. Multiple COVID-19 vaccines are currently in use worldwide (see COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker). Two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), one adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S), and one protein subunit adjuvanted vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) are used in the United States. Vaccines available in the United States are administered as a primary series of 1, 2, or 3 injections (see CDC: Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States). Protection against infection from a primary vaccination series has been shown to decrease over time. To maximize protection against infection, severe disease, and death, additional doses are recommended. People who have received all recommended primary series vaccinations and booster doses are considered \"up-to-date\" on their vaccine series. (See also CDC: COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots.) In the US, the “updated” booster dose is an mRNA vaccine that is bivalent, which means it stimulates an immune response against 2 viruses or viral strains. The bivalent vaccines are designed to protect against the original COVID-19 strain and also common Omicron variants. The bivalent vaccines may be given as a booster dose or as part of the primary series. In most situations, the mRNA vaccines and the protein subunit adjuvanted vaccine are preferred over the vector vaccine due to the slight risk of serious side effects with the vector vaccine (see CDC: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety.) Masking and other routine measures In addition to being vaccinated, people should avoid being exposed to the virus by taking steps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC varies its recommendations regarding prevention measures based on COVID-19 Community Levels. Levels can be low, medium, or high and are determined by looking at hospital beds being used, hospital admissions, and the total number of new COVID-19 cases in an area. For people age 2 years or older, the CDC provides the following guidance regarding wearing a well-fitting face mask, covering both mouth and nose: Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, should wear a mask when in indoor public places in areas where the COVID-19 Community Level is high. People who are at increased risk for severe illness, or who live with or spend time with someone at higher risk, should wear a mask in areas where the COVID-19 Community Level is medium, if advised by a health care practitioner to wear one. Everyone should wear a mask when sick and around other people. Everyone should wear a mask when caring for someone who has COVID-19. Everyone should wear a mask when on public transportation (for example, planes, buses, trains) and while indoors at transportation hubs (for example, airports, train stations) regardless of COVID-19 Community Level. In addition to following the CDC recommendations, people may be required to wear a mask by local laws, regulations, or rules or business or workplace guidance, and this may vary by vaccination status. People who are at increased risk for severe disease or who have someone in their household at increased risk might choose to wear a mask regardless of any requirements or the COVID-19 Community Level. People who are at increased risk for severe disease include those who are unvaccinated, have a weakened immune system, have an underlying medical condition, are pregnant or recently pregnant, and people older than 65 (Different Groups of People at Increased Risk for Severe Illness). Different types of masks provide different levels of protection, including (in increasing order of protection): multi-layer cloth masks; multi-layer surgical masks and K95 masks; and N95 masks (see CDC: Types of Masks and Respirators). In addition to being up to date with vaccinations and wearing a mask, the CDC recommends the following steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, regardless of COVID-19 Community Level: Get tested Diagnosis if having symptoms of COVID-19 Symptoms COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness that can be severe and is caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.

Quarantine is meant to separate people who had close contact with a contagious person so they do not infect other people. Currently, the CDC does not advise quarantine for people who have been exposed to Covid-19 but are not infected. See CDC: What to Do If You Were Exposed to COVID-19 for information regarding masking and testing after exposure. Isolation separates people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from those without COVID-19. Regardless of vaccination status, people with COVID-19 symptoms and/or who have a positive COVID-19 test should isolate for at least 5 full days. People who are in isolation should stay home and separated from others, or wear a well-fitting mask when they need to be around others in the home. For an additional 5 days, they should wear a mask when around others both in public and at home. (See also CDC: Isolation and Precautions for People with COVID-19.) Treatment of COVID-19 Drugs to relieve fever and muscle aches Sometimes, remdesivir and/or dexamethasone Sometimes, antiviral drugs for mild to moderate infection Sometimes, monoclonal antibodies Treatment of COVID-19 depends on how severe the illness is and the likelihood that the person will develop severe disease. For mild illness, resting at home is often sufficient. Acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen, may be taken to relieve fever and muscle aches. Despite initial anecdotal concerns, there is no scientific evidence that the use of NSAIDs worsens COVID-19. Similarly, there is no scientific evidence that people with COVID-19 who take the blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should stop taking them.

Some people with respiratory failure need a mechanical ventilator (a machine that helps air get... Common.TooltipReadMore . For people with severe illness from COVID-19 or people at high risk for progression to severe disease, some drug and other therapies are recommended. This is a rapidly evolving topic (see National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19). Remdesivir (an antiviral drug) is for the treatment for select people with COVID-19. Remdesivir is given intravenously. The recommended treatment duration is 5 to 10 days. The combination of remdesivir and the corticosteroid dexamethasone is commonly used in hospitalized people who need supplemental oxygen. The combination drug nirmatrelvir and ritonavir is an antiviral drug taken by mouth. It may be used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 infection in some adults and adolescents who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. It is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days. Molnupiravir is an antiviral drug taken by mouth. It may be used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 infection in nonhospitalized adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not available or appropriate. Molnupiravir is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days. It is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, casirivimab plus imdevimab, and sotrovimab are monoclonal antibody therapies. They are not effective against the Omicron variant. Therefore, the FDA recommended (April 22, 2022) against their use in treatment of COVID-19, because Omicron has become the dominant variant in the United States. Bebtelovimab is also a neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody. It was effective against early Omicron variants but is not expected to neutralize the later and now predominant Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1. Therefore, effective November 30, 2022, bebtelovimab is not authorized for use in the US (see FDA Announces Bebtelovimab is Not Currently Authorized in Any US Region). The following therapies are also NOT recommended for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19: Blood plasma from recovered patients Nonspecific immunoglobulin (IVIG) and mesenchymal stem cell therapy Additional immunomodulatory therapies, including interferons, kinase inhibitors, and interleukin inhibitors Azithromycin and antiretrovirals Lopinavir/ritonavir (an HIV retroviral) Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (antimalaria drugs) Ivermectin (an antiparasite drug): the FDA and other organizations have issued warnings about toxicity from the inappropriate use of ivermectin preparations intended for large animal use (see FDA: Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19).

Primary Tumor Resection If a primary tumor has not metastasized, surgery may be curative. Establishing a margin of normal tissue around the primary cancer is important for success. Intraoperative examination of tissue sections by a pathologist may be needed. Immediate resection of additional tissue is done if margins show cancer. Surgical resection may include removal of local and regional lymph nodes and/or resection of an involved adjacent tissue or organ. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given before surgery to reduce the cancer size, limit the extent of surgery, and improve success rates. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given after surgery to decrease the risk of recurrence. Resection of Metastases Local and regional lymph nodes are sometimes removed during surgery to evaluate the extent of cancer spread and reduce likelihood of cancer recurrence. Limited numbers of metastases, especially in the lungs, liver, or brain, can sometimes be resected or treated with radiation therapy. Tumor Debulking (Cytoreduction) Tumor debulking (surgical resection to reduce cancer size) is sometimes done when removing all the cancer is impossible. Tumor debulking may increase the sensitivity of the remaining cancer to other treatment modalities through unclear mechanisms. Palliative Surgery Surgery to relieve symptoms and preserve quality-of -life is reasonable even when cure is unlikely or when an attempt at extensive surgery is precluded. Resection may be indicated to control pain, reduce the risk of hemorrhage, or relieve obstruction of a vital organ.

Anemia can occur when red blood cells are broken down too rapidly, too much blood is lost, or the bone marrow does not produce enough red blood cells. If red blood cells are broken down too rapidly, anemia may develop and levels of bilirubin (a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells) increase, and the newborn’s skin and the whites of the eyes can appear yellow (a condition called jaundice). If a large amount of blood is lost very rapidly, the newborn may become seriously ill and develop shock, appear pale, have a rapid heart rate, and have low blood pressure along with rapid, shallow breathing. If there is less severe blood loss, or the blood is lost gradually, the newborn may appear normal but pale. Treatment may involve fluids given by vein (intravenously) followed by a blood transfusion or an exchange transfusion. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that gives blood its red color and enables it to carry oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to all body tissues. Oxygen is used by cells to help produce from food the energy that the body needs, leaving carbon dioxide as a waste product. Red blood cells carry carbon dioxide away from the tissues and back to the lungs. When the number of red blood cells is too low, blood carries less oxygen, and fatigue and weakness develop (see also Overview of Anemia Overview of Anemia Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.

Sometimes the cause of infantile spasms cannot be identified. Symptoms and Signs of Infantile Spasms Spasms begin with a sudden, rapid, tonic contraction of the trunk and limbs, sometimes for several seconds. Spasms range from subtle head nodding to contraction of the whole body. They involve flexion, extension, or, more often, both (mixed). The spasms usually occur in clusters, often several dozen, in close succession and occur typically after children wake up and occasionally during sleep. Sometimes, at first, they are mistaken for startles. Developmental delays (see Childhood Development Childhood Development Development is often divided into specific domains, such as gross motor, fine motor, language, cognition, and social/emotional growth.

Diagnosis of Infantile Spasms Electroencephalography (EEG) with awake and asleep stages Neuroimaging, preferably MRI Testing to identify the cause unless an underlying significant neurologic disorder has already been identified Previous history (eg, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) and/or symptoms and signs suggest the diagnosis of infantile spasms in some children.

Typically, the interictal pattern is hypsarrhythmia (chaotic, high-voltage polymorphic delta and theta waves with superimposed multifocal spike discharges). Multiple variations (eg, focal or asymmetric hypsarrhythmia) are possible. The ictal pattern is usually a sudden, marked and diffuse attenuation of electrical activity. Neuroimaging, preferably MRI, is done if it has not already recently been done. Tests to determine the cause If it is not clear from neuroimaging or the previous history, tests to determine the cause may include Laboratory tests (eg, complete blood count with differential; measurement of serum glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, serum amino acids, and urine organic acids; liver tests) if a metabolic disorder is suspected Genetic testing Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to check for metabolic disorders (See also Approach to the Patient With a Suspected Inherited Disorder of Metabolism Approach to the Patient With a Suspected Inherited Disorder of Metabolism Most inherited disorders of metabolism (inborn errors of metabolism) are rare, and therefore their diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.

Treatment of Infantile Spasms Intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Oral corticosteroids Vigabatrin (especially for tuberous sclerosis complex) Infantile spasms are not responsive to typical antiseizure drugs. ACTH is the most effective treatment. Both high-dose (150 units/m2) ACTH and low-dose (20 units/m2) ACTH, given daily IM, have been used. The Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC) recommends the higher dose, given for 2 weeks and then tapered down every 3 days until 29 days of treatment are completed. If low-dose therapy is tried and has not stopped spasms within 2 weeks, the higher dose is used. Corticosteroids (eg, oral prednisone) are sometimes given for 4 to 7 weeks as an alternative to ACTH. A regimen recommended by PERC uses oral prednisolone as follows: Days 1 to 14: 10 mg 4 times a day Days 15 to 19: 10 mg 3 times a day Days 20 to 24: 10 mg 2 times a day Days 25 to 29: 10 mg once a day Vigabatrin is the drug of choice when the spasms are caused by tuberous sclerosis complex Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) Tuberous sclerosis complex is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder in which tumors (usually hamartomas) develop in multiple organs.

It is also often used in children with an established preexisting serious brain injury or malformation and in those who do not tolerate or respond to ACTH. Dosage of oral vigabatrin is 25 mg/kg 2 times a day, increased gradually up to 75 mg/kg 2 times a day if needed. There is insufficient evidence that any other antiseizure drug or the ketogenic diet is effective. In some patients with resistant spasms or with focal cortical malformation, epilepsy surgery can eliminate seizures. There is evidence that the more quickly effective therapy is initiated, the better the neurodevelopmental outcome, particularly when no cause is identified. Treatment reference Knupp KG, Coryell J, Nickels KC, et al: Response to treatment in a prospective national infantile spasms cohort. Ann Neurol 79(3):475–484, 2016. doi: 10.1002/ana.24594 Key Points Infantile spasms last a few seconds and can recur many times a day; they may resolve spontaneously by about 5 years of age but are often replaced by other types of seizures. Usually, infantile spasms occur in infants with serious brain disorders and developmental abnormalities that often have already been recognized; tuberous sclerosis complex is a common cause. Do electroencephalography to confirm the diagnosis, and other tests (eg, brain MRI and metabolic and genetic testing) to evaluate the cause of infantile spasm. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is the most effective treatment, but vigabatrin is the drug of choice for spasms caused by tuberous sclerosis complex and is often used in children who have an established preexisting serious brain injury or malformation or who do not tolerate or respond to ACTH; oral corticosteroids may also be used.

Diagnosis is clinical and includes spinal x-rays. Treatment depends on the severity of the curvature. Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common form of scoliosis and is present in 2 to 4% of children aged 10 to 16 years. Boys and girls are equally affected; however, it is 10 times more likely to progress and require treatment in girls. Genetic factors contribute about one third of the risk of disease development. Mutations in the CHD7 and MATN1 genes have been implicated in some cases. Symptoms and Signs of Idiopathic Scoliosis Scoliosis may first be suspected when one shoulder seems higher than the other or when clothes do not hang straight, but it is often detected during routine physical examination. Other findings include apparent leg-length discrepancy and asymmetry of the chest wall. Patients may initially report fatigue in the lumbar region after prolonged sitting or standing. Muscular backaches in areas of strain (eg, in the lumbosacral angle) may follow. Diagnosis of Idiopathic Scoliosis X-ray of the spine The curve is most pronounced when patients bend forward. Most curves are convex to the right in the thoracic area and to the left in the lumbar area, so that the right shoulder is higher than the left. X-ray examination should include standing anteroposterior and lateral views of the spine. Cobb angle In the Cobb method, two lines are drawn on a posterior-anterior x-ray of the spine, one extending from the top of the most tilted upper vertebra and the other from the bottom of the most tilted lower vertebra. The angle formed by these lines is the Cobb angle. The amount of curvature is quantified in degrees based on x-ray findings (the Cobb method). In this method, two lines are drawn on a posterior-anterior x-ray of the spine, one extending from the top of the most tilted upper vertebra and the other from the bottom of the most tilted lower vertebra. The angle formed by these lines is the Cobb angle. Prognosis for Idiopathic Scoliosis The greater the curve, the greater the likelihood that it will progress after the skeleton matures. Curves > 10° are considered significant. Prognosis depends on site and severity of the curve and age at symptom onset. Significant intervention is required in < 10% of patients. Treatment of Idiopathic Scoliosis Physical therapy and bracing Sometimes surgery Prompt referral to an orthopedist is indicated when progression is of concern or the curve is significant. Likelihood of progression is greatest around puberty. Moderate curves (20 to 40°) are treated conservatively (eg, physical therapy and bracing) to prevent further deformity. Severe curves (> 40°) may be ameliorated surgically (eg, spinal fusion with rod placement). Scoliosis and its treatment often interfere with an adolescent’s self-image and self-esteem. Counseling or psychotherapy may be needed.

In some people, this reaction occurs only if they eat a specific food (especially wheat or shrimp) before exercising. Breathing becomes difficult or blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness and collapse. An anaphylactic reaction can be life threatening. Typically, symptoms triggered by exercise—asthma or an anaphylactic reaction—occur after 5 to 10 minutes of vigorous exercise. Sometimes symptoms begin after exercise has stopped. Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation Sometimes an exercise challenge test The diagnosis of exercise-induced allergic reactions is based on the symptoms and their relationship to exercise. An exercise challenge test Diagnosis can also help doctors make the diagnosis. For this test, lung function is measured before and after exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. Treatment Drugs used to treat asthma or anaphylaxis Avoidance of possible triggers For people with exercise-induced asthma, the goal of treatment is to be able to exercise without symptoms. Becoming more physically fit may make symptoms less likely to develop during exercise. Inhaling a beta-adrenergic drug (such as those used to treat asthma Drugs Commonly Used to Treat Asthma ) about 15 minutes before starting to exercise often helps prevent reactions. Cromolyn, usually taken through an inhaler, may be helpful. For people with asthma, taking the drugs usually used to control asthma often prevents symptoms from developing during exercise. Taking drugs to treat asthma and gradually increasing the intensity and duration of exercise enables some people with asthma to tolerate exercise. People who have had an exercise-induced anaphylactic reaction should avoid the form of exercise that triggered the attack. If eating a specific food before exercise triggers symptoms, they should not eat the food before exercise. A self-injecting syringe of epinephrine should always be carried for prompt emergency treatment. Exercising with other people is recommended.

Surgery Doctors may do surgery to insert a tube (graft) into your aorta to repair the aneurysm. Two types of surgery are possible. Doctors may cut open your chest to insert the graft. Or they may be able to put the graft in your aorta by going through an artery in your upper leg. Which surgery you have depends on your age, health, and where your aneurysm is in your aorta. If your aneurysm bursts or is about to burst, emergency surgery to fix it may save your life. Without surgery, you'll die.

The American Thoracic Society estimates the population-attributable fraction of COPD related to occupational and environmental exposures to be about 20% (ie, COPD incidence and mortality would decline by about 20% if environmental exposures were reduced to zero). Clinicians should take an occupational and environmental history in all patients, asking specifically about past and current exposure to vapors, gases, dust, fumes, and/or biomass smoke (ie, from burning wood, animal waste, crops). Any positive response is followed by more detailed questions. Prevention of Environmental Pulmonary Disease Prevention of occupational and environmental pulmonary diseases centers on reducing exposure (primary prevention). Exposure can be limited by the use of Administrative controls (eg, limiting the number of people exposed to hazardous conditions) Engineering controls (eg, enclosures, ventilation systems, safe clean-up procedures) Product substitution (eg, using safer, less toxic materials) Respiratory protection devices (eg, respirator, dust mask, gas mask) Many clinicians erroneously assume that a patient who has used a respirator or another respiratory protection device has been well protected. Although respirators do afford a degree of protection, especially when fresh air is provided by tank or air hose, the benefit is limited and varies from person to person. When recommending use of a respirator, clinicians should consider several factors. Workers with cardiovascular disease may be unable to carry out jobs that require strenuous work if they must wear a self-contained breathing apparatus (tank). Respirators that are tight-fitting and that require the wearer to draw air through filter cartridges can increase the work of breathing, which can be especially difficult for patients with asthma, COPD, or interstitial lung diseases. When a respirator is recommended, patients should undergo yearly adjustments of the respiratory mask to ensure proper fit. Medical surveillance is a form of secondary prevention. Workers can be offered medical tests that identify disorders early when treatment might help reduce long-term consequences.

These x-rays usually can show a blockage or paralysis of the digestive tract, or abnormal air patterns in the abdominal cavity. Standard x-rays can also show enlargement of the liver, kidneys, and spleen. Barium x-ray studies of the digestive tract X-ray studies using barium often provide more information than standard x-rays. X-rays are taken after a person swallows barium in a flavored liquid mixture or as barium-coated food. The barium looks white on x-rays and outlines the digestive tract, showing the contours and lining of the esophagus (the hollow tube that leads from the throat to the stomach), stomach, and small intestine. Barium may collect in abnormal areas, showing ulcers, tumors, blockages, and erosions and enlarged, dilated esophageal veins. X-rays may be taken at intervals to determine where the barium is. In a continuous x-ray technique called fluoroscopy, the barium is observed as it moves through the digestive tract. With this technique, doctors can see how the esophagus and stomach function, determine whether their contractions are normal, and tell whether food is getting blocked. Barium Swallow: Fluoroscopy Show Details Hide Details Fluoroscopy (a continuous x-ray technique) is used to view the esophagus after a person swallows liquid barium. The esophagus can be seen contracting as barium passes through it and into the stomach and small intestine. Courtesy of Howard Lee, MD. Barium also can be given in an enema to outline the lower part of the large intestine. Barium also can be given through a thin tube that is passed through the nose, down into the stomach, and then into the small intestine (enteroclysis). With a barium enema or enteroclysis, x-rays can show polyps, tumors, or other structural abnormalities. This procedure may cause crampy pain or slight to moderate discomfort. Barium taken by mouth or as an enema is eventually passed in the stool, making the stool chalky white.

Indications Severe upper airway obstruction in an infant (under age 1 year), caused by choking on a foreign object. Signs of severe airway obstruction in an infant include Cyanosis Retractions Inability to cry or make much sound Weak, ineffective coughing Stridor Do not interfere if the infant can cry and make significant sounds, cough effectively, or breathe adequately; such infants do not have severe airway obstruction. Furthermore, strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway. Contraindications Absolute contraindications Do not do back blows or chest thrusts if the infant stops breathing for reasons other than an obstructed airway (eg, asthma, infection, swelling, or a blow to the head). Relative contraindications None Complications Rib injury or fracture Internal organ injury Equipment None Additional Considerations This rapid first aid procedure is done immediately wherever the infant is choking. Relevant Anatomy The epiglottis usually protects the airway from aspiration of foreign objects. Objects that are aspirated beyond the epiglottis may be stopped by the vocal cords in the larynx and, at this level or below, cause life-threatening airway obstruction. In infants and children, the cricoid cartilage, which lies inferior to the vocal cords, is the narrowest part of the upper airway. Sometimes, objects become trapped between the vocal cords and the cricoid ring, resulting in an obstruction that is particularly difficult to clear. Positioning For back blows, place the infant prone along your forearm, using your thigh or lap for support. Hold the infant’s chest in your hand and the jaw with your fingers. Tilt the infant head-downward, such that the head is lower than the body (see figure Back blows—infant Back blows—infant ). For chest thrusts, place the infant supine along your forearm, using your thigh or lap for support. Hold the back of the infant's head in your hand.

Back blows—infant Chest thrusts—infant Chest thrusts are delivered on the lower half of the sternum, just below the nipple level. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Determine if there is severe airway obstruction, which may endanger the infant’s life. Look for signs of severe airway obstruction, such as the inability to cry audibly, cough effectively, or breathe adequately (eg, stridor, retractions, cyanosis). If the infant has a strong cry or is coughing hard, do not do these procedures. If you have determined that the infant has severe airway obstruction, proceed with the following procedures. Tell someone to call 911 while you begin first aid. If you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid. Hold the infant face-down along your forearm using your thigh or lap for support. Hold the infant’s chest in your hand and open the jaw by pulling the mandible with your fingers. Point the infant’s head downward and lower than the body. Give up to 5 quick, forceful back blows between the infant’s shoulder blades using the palm of your free hand. Check the mouth to see whether the aspirated foreign body is visible; if it can be easily removed, remove it. If the object does not come out of the airway after 5 back blows, turn the infant face-up. Hold the infant face-up along your forearm using your thigh or lap for support. Hold the head in your hand with the head lower than the torso. Place 2 fingers on the middle of the infant’s sternum just below the nipples. Avoid the lower ribs or the tip of the sternum. Give up to 5 quick thrusts, compressing the chest about 1/3 to ½ the depth of the chest—usually about 1.5 to 4 cm (0.5 to 1.5 inches) for each thrust. Continue to deliver 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or the infant becomes unconscious. Do not try to grasp and pull out the object if the infant is conscious.

If you are alone, after 1 minute of CPR call 911. If the infant is unconscious and you can see the object blocking the airway, try to remove it with a finger. Try to remove the object only if you can see it. How To Treat the Choking Conscious Infant VIDEO Aftercare Carefully examine the infant as soon as possible, even after successful removal of the airway obstruction and resumption of normal breathing. Warnings and Common Errors Do not do back blows or chest thrusts if the choking infant can cry audibly, cough forcefully, or breathe adequately. Do not do back blows or chest thrusts if the infant stops breathing for reasons other than an obstructed airway (eg, asthma, infection, angioedema, head injury). Do give CPR in these cases. Do not do blind finger sweeps on infants. Do not do abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) on infants. Tips and Tricks It is important to use gravity as an ally. Keep the infant's head lower than its torso during the procedure. More Information The following is an English-language resource that may be useful.

Early symptoms are related to hyperglycemia and include polydipsia... read more Increased blood viscosity Occlusion may also be idiopathic. The condition is uncommon among young people. Occlusion may affect a branch of the retinal vein or the central retinal vein. Neovascularization (abnormal new vessel formation) of the retina or iris (rubeosis iridis) occurs in about 16% of patients with central retinal vein occlusion and can result in secondary (neovascular) glaucoma, which can occur weeks to months after occlusion. Vitreous hemorrhage may result from retinal neovascularization. Symptoms and Signs Painless vision loss is usually sudden but it can also occur gradually over a period of days to weeks. Funduscopy reveals hemorrhages throughout the retina, engorged (dilated) and tortuous retinal veins, and, usually, significant retinal edema. These changes are typically diffuse if obstruction involves the central retinal vein and are limited to one quadrant if obstruction involves only a branch of the central retinal vein. Diagnosis Funduscopy Color fundus photography Fluorescein angiography Optical coherence tomography The diagnosis is suspected in patients with painless vision loss, particularly those with risk factors. Funduscopy, color photography, and fluorescein angiography confirm the diagnosis. Optical coherence tomography is used to determine the degree of macular edema and its response to treatment.

Young patients are tested for increased blood viscosity (with a complete blood count and clotting factors as deemed necessary). Prognosis Most patients have some visual deficit. In mild cases, there can be spontaneous improvement to near-normal vision over a variable period of time. Visual acuity at presentation is a good indicator of final vision. If visual acuity is at least 20/40, visual acuity will likely remain good, occasionally near normal. If visual acuity is worse than 20/200, it will remain at that level or worsen in 80% of patients. Central retinal vein occlusions rarely recur. Treatment For macular edema, intraocular injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs, dexamethasone implant, and/or triamcinolone acetonide For some cases of macular edema with branch retinal vein occlusion, focal laser photocoagulation Panretinal laser photocoagulation if neovascularization develops Treatment for branch retinal vein occlusion in patients with macular edema that involves the fovea is usually intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF drug (eg, ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab) or intraocular injection of triamcinolone or a slow-release dexamethasone implant. These treatments can also be used to treat central retinal vein occlusion in patients with macular edema. With these treatments, vision improves significantly in 30 to 40% of patients. Focal laser photocoagulation can be used for branch retinal vein occlusion with macular edema but is less effective than intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF drug or a dexamethasone implant. Focal laser photocoagulation is typically not effective for the treatment of macular edema due to a central retinal vein occlusion. If retinal or anterior segment neovascularization develops secondary to central or branch retinal vein occlusion, panretinal laser photocoagulation should be done promptly to decrease vitreous hemorrhage and prevent neovascular glaucoma. Key Points Retinal vein occlusion involves blockage by a thrombus. Patients have painless loss of vision that is typically sudden and may have risk factors (eg, older age, hypertension). Funduscopy characteristically demonstrates macular edema with dilated veins and hemorrhages; additional tests include color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. Treat patients who have macular edema with an intraocular injection of an anti-VEGF drug (ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab) or intraocular injection of a dexamethasone implant or triamcinolone. Focal laser photocoagulation is useful in some cases of macular edema secondary to a branch retinal vein occlusion, and panretinal laser photocoagulation should be done for retinal or anterior segment neovascularization.

The placenta is an organ that grows on the inside, upper part of your uterus (womb) when you're pregnant It has many large blood vessels to carry oxygen and nutrients from you to your baby The placenta's blood vessels form the umbilical cord to connect the placenta to your baby About 15 minutes after you deliver your baby, the placenta comes off your uterus and goes out your vagina That's why it's also called the \"afterbirth\" What is placental abruption? A placenta that starts to pull away from the uterus before delivery is called placental abruption. The placenta may pull away a little bit or a lot. The more that it pulls off, the more dangerous it is for you and your baby. Placental abruption is more likely to happen after 20 weeks of pregnancy If the placenta pulls away only a little bit, your baby might not grow as much or there might be too little amniotic fluid If the placenta pulls away fully, your baby could die To treat placental abruption, doctors will have you stay in the hospital and may deliver your baby early Doctors usually don't know why placental abruption happens.

The placenta carries oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus. In placental abruption (abruptio placentae), the placenta detaches from the uterine wall prematurely, causing the uterus to bleed and reducing the fetus’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. Women who have this complication are hospitalized, and the baby may be delivered early. In placenta previa, the placenta is located over the cervix, in the lower part of the uterus. Placenta previa may cause painless bleeding that suddenly begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bleeding may become profuse. The baby is usually delivered by cesarean. What are the symptoms of placental abruption? Symptoms depend on how much the placenta has pulled away from your uterus but can include: Vaginal bleeding Cramps in your belly or sudden, intense belly pain A dangerously low drop in blood pressure (shock Shock Shock is a medical emergency caused by your organs not getting enough blood and oxygen.

Wounds that are not caused by bites and are clean and relatively small usually heal rapidly without any problems. However, some wounds can cause extensive blood loss. In some wounds, deeper structures, such as nerves, tendons, or blood vessels, are also injured. Other wounds can become infected. A piece of foreign material (such as a splinter, glass, or a clothing fragment) can also remain hidden inside a wound, causing later problems such as infection. Shallow cuts to most areas of the skin rarely bleed much and often stop bleeding on their own. Cuts to the hand and scalp as well as cuts to arteries and larger veins often bleed vigorously.

Wounds can be painful at first, but usually the pain lessens after the first day. If a cut affects a nerve or tendon, the person may be unable to move the body part fully. Some nerve injuries cause weakness or paralysis, loss of sensation, or numbness. If foreign material remains inside a puncture wound, the part of the wound near the material is usually painful when touched.

First-Aid Treatment The first step in treating a cut is to stop the bleeding. Visible bleeding can almost always be stopped by firmly compressing the bleeding area with a finger or hand for at least 5 minutes. Whenever possible, the bleeding part is elevated above the level of the heart. If the bleeding is on an arm or leg and continues after pressure has been applied, a tourniquet can be applied by anyone who has been trained to use one. This is usually required only in severe injuries (for example, gunshot wounds, deep penetrating stab injuries, large deep cuts, or amputations. Tourniquets should be used only until the person can be evaluated and treated by a doctor. (See Stop the Bleed.org for additional information on tourniquet use.) To prevent infection, dirt and particles are removed and the wound is washed. Large, visible particles are picked off. Smaller dirt and particles that cannot be seen are removed by washing with mild soap and tap water. Colder temperature water may allow the blood vessels to constrict, helping to slow the bleeding. Dirt and particles that remain after washing often can be removed with a more highly pressured stream of warm tap water. Harsher agents, such as alcohol, iodine, and peroxide, are not recommended. These solutions can damage tissue, impairing the capacity to heal. Scrubbing is required to clean deep scrapes. If a wound is very small, it can be kept closed with certain commercially available tapes. Stitches may be needed for deep or large cuts. After cleaning and, if necessary, closing the wound, antibiotic ointment and a bandage are applied. Medical assistance is needed under the following circumstances: If a cut is longer than about ⅓ inch (¾ centimeter), is on the face, appears deep, or has edges that separate If bleeding does not stop on its own or within several minutes after pressure is applied If there are symptoms of a nerve or tendon injury, such as loss of sensation, loss of movement, or numbness If a scrape is deep or has dirt and particles that are difficult to remove If there is a puncture wound, particularly if foreign material in the wound is likely If the person has not had a tetanus vaccination Vaccination Tetanus results from a toxin produced by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium tetani.

The shoulders are ball-and-socket joints that allow the arms to have inward and outward rotation as well as forward, backward, and sideways movement (see Shoulder Anatomy Anatomy of a Shoulder Joint ). The shoulder tends to be unstable. It has been likened to a golf ball sitting on a tee because the socket (glenoid bone) is very shallow and small compared to the size of the ball (humeral head). To enhance stability, the socket is deepened by the labrum, a rubbery material attached around the lip of the glenoid bone. The labrum can tear during athletic activities, especially during throwing sports, or as a result of falling and landing on an outstretched arm. When the labrum tears, the athlete feels pain deep in the shoulder during movement, for example, when pitching a baseball. This discomfort may be accompanied by a painful clicking or clunking sensation and a feeling of catching in the shoulder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Physical therapy is the usual initial treatment. If symptoms do not resolve, surgical repair is usually needed. Exercises to Stabilize the Shoulder Joint Prone Shoulder Extension 1.

Symptoms of Meningitis in Children Symptoms of meningitis vary by age. Once children develop symptoms involving their brain (such as abnormal drowsiness or confusion), meningitis can progress very quickly.

Newborns and children under 12 months of age Newborns and children under 12 months of age rarely develop a stiff neck (a common symptom in older children) and are unable to communicate specific discomfort. In these younger children, important signs of illness that should alert parents to a possibly serious problem include Unusual fussiness and irritability (particularly when they are held) Abnormal drowsiness (lethargy) Poor feeding Temperature too high or too low Vomiting Rash Seizures About one third of newborns who have bacterial meningitis have seizures Seizures in Children Seizures are a periodic disturbance of the brain’s electrical activity, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.

Occasionally, the nerves controlling some eye and facial movements may be damaged by the bacteria, causing an eye to turn inward or outward or the facial expression to become lopsided. In about 33 to 50% of newborns with meningitis, increased pressure of the fluid around the brain may make the fontanelles (the soft spots between the skull bones) bulge or feel firm. These symptoms usually develop over at least 1 to 2 days, but some infants, particularly those between birth and 3 or 4 months of age, become ill very rapidly, progressing from health to near death in less than 24 hours. Rarely, certain bacteria cause pockets of pus (abscesses) to form within the brain of infants with meningitis. As the abscesses grow, pressure on the brain increases (called intracranial pressure), resulting in vomiting, head enlargement, and bulging fontanelles.

In older infants and children, death rates vary from 3 to 5% when the cause is Haemophilus influenzae type b, 5 to 10% when the cause is Neisseria meningitidis, and 10 to 20% when the cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Some infants and young children who are at high risk of Neisseria meningitidis infection also may be given the meningococcal vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis Doctors usually give antibiotics to people who have been in close contact with someone who has meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae. Close contacts are defined somewhat differently depending on which of these two bacteria has caused the meningitis but they typically include Members of the household (especially those under 2 years of age) Workers at child care centers (especially workers in the infected child's classroom) Anyone who has been directly exposed to the infected child's saliva (such as through kissing or sharing toothbrushes or utensils, or health care personnel doing certain procedures) Exposed children who are not immunized or who are only partially immunized Exposed children who have a weakened immune system Chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts as soon as the infected child has been identified. Ideally, it is given within 24 hours. Drugs for chemoprophylaxis include rifampin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin and are selected depending on the age of the close contact. Treatment of Meningitis in Children Antibiotics Doctors give high doses of antibiotics by vein (intravenously) as soon as they suspect meningitis. Very sick children may receive antibiotics even before a spinal tap is done. When culture results from the spinal tap become available, doctors change the antibiotics, if needed, based on the type of bacteria causing the meningitis. The child's age also helps doctors determine which antibiotics to give. Some children older than 6 weeks may be given corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone) by vein to help reduce the risk of hearing loss. Sometimes a second blood culture and spinal tap are done to determine whether the antibiotics are working fast enough.

The breakdown and formation of bone increase, resulting in bones that are thicker, but weaker, than normal. Symptoms may be absent or may include bone pain, bone deformity, arthritis, and painful nerve compression. X-rays show the bone abnormalities. Pain and complications are treated, and bisphosphonates may be given. Paget disease can affect any bone, but the most commonly affected bones are the pelvis, thighbone (femur), and skull. The shin (tibia), spine (vertebrae), collarbone (clavicle), and upper arm bone (humerus) are affected less commonly. Paget disease rarely occurs in people younger than 40. In the United States, about 1% of people older than 40 have the disorder, and the prevalence increases with age. However, the prevalence of the disease seems to be decreasing. Men are 50% more likely than women to develop it. Paget disease is more common in Europe (excluding Scandinavia), Australia, and New Zealand. Causes of Paget Disease of Bone Normally, cells that break down old bone (osteoclasts) and cells that form new bone (osteoblasts) work in balance to maintain bone structure and integrity. In Paget disease, both osteoclasts and osteoblasts become overactive in some areas of bone, and the rate at which bone is broken down and rebuilt (called bone remodeling Bones ) in these areas increases tremendously. The overactive areas enlarge but, despite being large, are structurally abnormal and weak. The cause of Paget disease is unknown in most people. The disorder tends to run in families. Specific, identified gene abnormalities contribute in about 10% of people who have Paget disease, and other genetic abnormalities probably contribute in others. Also, some evidence suggests that a virus is involved. However, there is no evidence that the disorder is contagious.

Fractures tend to occur more easily than normal at involved bones because these bones are weakened by Paget disease. Such fractures are called pathologic fractures.

Common.TooltipReadMore ) may very rarely occur in bedridden people with Paget disease. Symptoms of Paget Disease of Bone Paget disease usually causes no symptoms. However, bone pain, bone enlargement, or bone deformity may occur. Bone pain may be deep, aching, and occasionally severe and may worsen at night. The enlarging bones may compress nerves, causing more pain. If osteoarthritis occurs, joints become painful and stiff. Other symptoms vary depending on which bones are affected. The skull may enlarge, and the brow and forehead may look more prominent (called frontal bossing). A person may notice this enlargement when a larger hat is needed. Enlarged skull bones may damage the inner ear (cochlea), which can cause hearing loss, and dizziness. The enlarged skull bones can compress nerves, which causes headaches. The veins on the scalp may bulge, possibly because of the increased blood flow through the skull bones. Bones the upper arm, thigh, or calf may appear bowed and are more likely to break because the bone is weakened by Paget disease. The vertebrae may enlarge, collapse, or both because bones affected by Paget disease are weak. Weakened vertebrae could result in a loss of height, a hunched posture, or pinching of the nerves of the spinal cord, causing pain, numbness, or weakness. Diagnosis of Paget Disease of Bone X-rays Blood tests Bone scan Paget disease is often discovered accidentally when x-rays or laboratory tests are done for other reasons. Otherwise, the diagnosis of Paget disease may be suspected based on the symptoms and a physical examination. The diagnosis of Paget disease of bone can be confirmed by x-rays showing abnormalities characteristic of Paget disease and by a laboratory test to determine blood levels of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme involved in bone formation), calcium, and phosphate.

A radionuclide is a radioactive form of an element, which means it is an unstable atom that becomes more stable by releasing... Common.TooltipReadMore using technetium) shows which bones are affected. Prognosis for Paget Disease of Bone The prognosis for people with Paget disease is most often very good. However, the few people who develop bone cancer have a poor prognosis. People who develop other rare complications, such as heart failure or compression of the spinal cord, may also have a poor prognosis, unless treatment of these complications is timely and successful. Treatment of Paget Disease of Bone Treatment of pain and complications Bisphosphonates A person who has Paget disease needs treatment if the symptoms cause discomfort or if there is a significant risk or suggestion of complications, such as hearing loss, osteoarthritis, and deformity. People who do not have symptoms may not need any treatment. Commonly used pain relievers (analgesics) such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) help reduce bone pain. If one leg becomes bowed and shortened, heel lifts can help make walking easier. Sometimes surgery is needed to relieve pinched nerves or to replace a joint that has become arthritic from Paget disease. Bisphosphonates are drugs that inhibit bone turnover. One of several bisphosphonates—alendronate, etidronate, pamidronate, risedronate, tiludronate, or zoledronic acid—can be used to slow the progression of Paget disease. Zoledronic acid is often the bisphosphonate of choice. Except for pamidronate and zoledronic acid, which are usually given by vein (intravenously), these drugs are given by mouth. These drugs are given for the following: Before orthopedic surgery to prevent or reduce bleeding during surgery To treat bone pain caused by Paget disease To prevent or slow the progression of complications (such as hearing loss, bone deformity, arthritis, weakness, or paralysis), especially in people who cannot have surgery To people with a blood level of alkaline phosphatase twice the normal level or higher Calcitonin is occasionally injected under the skin or into muscle. It is not as effective as the bisphosphonates and is used only when the other drugs cannot be given. Denosumab may be another alternative for people who cannot take bisphosphonates. Doctors encourage weight bearing (such as standing and walking). Excessive bed rest (except for sleeping at night) should be avoided, if possible, to prevent hypercalcemia. Because bone is being remodeled rapidly, people should consume adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D in their diet. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and add it to bone (a process called bone mineralization). Vitamin D and calcium supplements are often needed. Otherwise, poor bone mineralization and bone weakening (osteomalacia) may occur.

Syphilis... Common.TooltipReadMore is another treponematosis caused by the closely related bacteria called Treponema pallidum. However, syphilis and bejel, yaws, and pinta are spread in different ways. Syphilis is spread by sexual contact, whereas bejel, yaws, and pinta are spread by any close contact (sexual or not) with the skin of an infected person—chiefly between children living in conditions of poor hygiene. Bejel also may be spread by mouth-to-mouth contact or when eating utensils are shared. Also unlike syphilis, bejel, yaws, and pinta are not spread through contact with contaminated blood or from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Bejel occurs mainly in the hot, dry regions of the eastern Mediterranean and Saharan West Africa. Yaws occurs in hot, humid countries that are very near the equator in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Pinta is common among the natives of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Pinta is not very contagious. Bejel, yaws, and pinta rarely occur in the United States, except among immigrants from areas of the world where these diseases are common. Symptoms of Bejel, Yaws, and Pinta Yaws and pinta, like syphilis, begin with skin symptoms. Bejel begins with mouth sores. These symptoms subside, and after a period with few or no symptoms, new symptoms develop. Bejel Bejel typically begins in childhood. It affects the mucous membranes of the mouth, then the skin and bones. The initial mouth sore may not be noticed. Moist patches then develop in the mouth. They resolve over a period of months to years. During this time, people have few or no symptoms. Then, sores may develop on the trunk and limbs. Lumps develop in long bones, mainly leg bones, and in the tissues around the mouth, nose, and roof of the mouth (palate). These lumps destroy tissue, causing bones to be deformed and disfiguring the face. Yaws Yaws also affects the skin and bones. Several weeks after exposure to Treponema, yaws begins as a slightly raised sore at the site of infection, usually on a leg. The sore heals, but later, soft nodules (granulomas) form, then break open on the face, arms, legs, and buttocks. The granulomas heal slowly and may return. The skin on the palms of the hands and on the soles of the feet may thicken and break open to form painful sores. The sores on the feet make walking difficult and force people to walk on the sides of their feet, giving rise to the nickname crab yaws. Later, areas of the shinbones may be destroyed, and many other destructive, disfiguring growths, especially around the nose, mouth, and palate, may develop.

Yaws: Disfiguring Growths If yaws is not treated, destructive, disfiguring growths may develop, especially around the nose, mouth, and palate. Image courtesy of Dr. Peter Perine via the Public Health Image Library of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pinta Pinta affects only the skin. It begins as flat, itchy, reddened areas on the hands, feet, legs, arms, face, or neck. These areas enlarge and thicken. After several months, thick, flat patches develop all over the body. They tend to develop where bones are close to skin, for example, on the elbow. Later, the patches lose their color or turn gray-blue. Without treatment, these patches usually do not go away. Diagnosis of Bejel, Yaws, and Pinta A doctor's evaluation Doctors make the diagnosis of bejel, yaws, or pinta when typical symptoms appear in people who live in or have visited an area where such infections are common. Sometimes doctors examine a sample from the skin sores under a microscope. Because the bacteria that cause these infections and the bacteria that cause syphilis are so similar, doctors sometimes do blood tests for syphilis Diagnosis Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum. It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health. Syphilis... Common.TooltipReadMore . People who have one of these infections test positive for syphilis. Treatment of Bejel, Yaws, and Pinta A single dose of azithromycin by mouth People are given antibiotics. One dose of azithromycin given by mouth kills the bacteria. Then, the skin can heal. However, some scarring may remain, particularly if a lot of tissue has been destroyed. People who cannot have azithromycin may be given one injection of penicillin. Doxycycline given by mouth for 14 days is another alternative. Public health officials try to identify and treat infected people and their close contacts.

Treatment includes local burn care and topical and/or parenteral calcium. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is commonly used in numerous industrial processes, including oil refining, silicon and glass etching, refrigerant production, fluoropolymer production, and aluminum metal production. HF is also used as a brick and stone cleaner, rust remover, and wheel cleaner. Although most HF exposure is occupational, some products containing HF are available for retail purchase, and nonoccupational exposure does occur. HF is a weak acid (pKa = 3.17) in dilute aqueous solution and exists primarily in the non-ionized form. Compared with strong acids that exist primarily in the ionized form, HF in dilute solutions is better able to penetrate the skin barrier and diffuse into local soft tissues, where it causes injury. Strong acids cause only direct caustic injury (coagulative necrosis, which typically spares the underlying soft tissues), but HF causes caustic skin injury due to its acidity and also injures underlying soft-tissue due to penetration of the fluoride ion. In aqueous intracellular and extracellular spaces, fluoride complexes with divalent cations (calcium, magnesium), forming insoluble calcium fluoride and magnesium fluoride. Formation of these insoluble salts promotes the release of more fluoride ion from HF (per Le Chatelier’s principle).

In addition, the fluoride ion itself may be arrhythmogenic. Time to symptom-onset from time of exposure varies and is inversely related to the concentration of HF. Exposure to concentrated preparations (> 50% HF) results in immediate pain and tissue damage due to the direct caustic effect on the skin or mucous membranes. This effect is partly due to a marked increase in the acidity of HF at high concentrations and HF homoassociation resulting in an increase in disassociated protons. Conversely, exposure to dilute preparations (< 20% HF) may not result in pain or clinical findings for several hours after the exposure because cellular dysfunction and death caused by local hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia take time to develop. HF exposure may be dermal, ocular, oral, or inhalational. The most common route of occupational exposure to HF is dermal. Symptoms and Signs of Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure Symptoms and signs of hydrofluoric acid exposure vary depending on the route of exposure. Dermal Pain is typically the first symptom to manifest after dermal exposure and precedes signs of chemical burns, such as erythema (1st degree), edema and bullae formation (2nd degree), or gray-white discoloration (3rd degree). Pain is often more severe than expected based on apparent dermal involvement. If the fingers and nail beds are burned, the nails may remain intact, and pain may be severe despite apparent absent or minimal involvement of the nails and skin. Oral Oral occupational exposure to HF is less common but may occur when aqueous solution containing HF is stored in unmarked containers (eg, water bottles). Nonoccupational oral HF exposure may result from attempts at self-harm or exploratory ingestion by young children. Ingestion of dilute HF solution may result in oropharyngeal erythema and edema and gastrointestinal irritation; ingestion of a small volume may be asymptomatic. Ingestion of concentrated HF solution results in hemorrhagic gastritis and pulmonary toxicity similar to inhalational exposure. Inhalational Inhalational exposure to HF most commonly results in upper airway and chest pain (described as burning), cough, and shortness of breath. Patients may also report nausea, vomiting, and headache and a burning sensation in skin exposed to HF vapor. Time to symptom-onset is inversely proportional to the airborne concentration of HF. Pharyngeal erythema and edema may be present, as may wheezing, rales, and respiratory distress. With more severe inhalational exposure, patients may develop hemorrhagic alveolitis with hemoptysis Hemoptysis Hemoptysis is coughing up of blood from the respiratory tract.

Systemic Dermal, oral, or inhalational HF exposure may result in systemic fluoride toxicity (ocular exposure has not been implicated in systemic toxicity). Onset of systemic toxicity is more rapid after oral HF exposure because systemic absorption is more rapid after oral exposure than dermal exposure. Dermal exposure to concentrated HF solution may result in systemic fluoride toxicity even when the body surface area involved is small.

Coagulopathy may result from hypocalcemia. Ocular Ocular exposure to HF may result from a splash injury involving an aqueous solution or from gaseous HF. Mild (more dilute) exposure may cause eye pain, conjunctival injection, and chemosis and may not manifest for hours after the exposure. If the exposure is more concentrated, onset of symptoms is more rapid; corneal coagulative necrosis may occur, and the globe may rupture. Diagnosis of Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure Clinical evaluation Electrolyte levels Diagnosis of problems due to hydrofluoric acid exposure begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Physicians should obtain information about potential exposure in the last 24 hours, including route and duration of exposure, concentration of HF, other chemicals in the formulation, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). There is no specific test for HF poisoning; however, hypocalcemia (ideally measured as ionized calcium), hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and elevated serum fluoride (if available) may suggest that systemic exposure has occurred. Except for the most minor burns, patients are usually admitted to the hospital for monitoring for systemic toxicity and for any indicated treatments.

The most common... read more (peaked T waves, widening of the QRS interval, flattening of the P wave, sine wave pattern). Endoscopy should generally be done for oral ingestion, and consultation with gastroenterology and/or otorhinolaryngology should be obtained. Prognosis for Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure Prognosis depends on the route of hydrofluoric acid exposure. Dermal Prognosis after mild dermal HF exposure is good if the patient is promptly evaluated and treated. As with other chemical burns, symptoms typically resolve over a period of days to weeks, depending on the severity of the burn. Oral Patients who have ingested a dilute HF solution may develop reversible oropharyngeal or gastrointestinal (GI) irritation or may remain asymptomatic and have a benign prognosis. Ingestion of concentrated HF solution may result in fatal GI hemorrhage or systemic fluoride toxicity, which may be fatal. If patients with severe GI burns survive, long-term sequelae including strictures may develop. Systemic Patients with systemic fluoride toxicity are at high risk of cardiac arrhythmia and hypotension. Inhalational Prognosis after inhalational exposure depends on the intensity and chronicity of exposure. If inhalational exposure is mild to moderate, symptoms may resolve spontaneously over a period of hours to days. More intense exposures may result in persistent upper airway irritation (reactive upper airways dysfunction syndrome [RUDS]) or pulmonary irritation (reactive airways dysfunction syndrome [RADS]) that persists for months to years. Chronic occupational HF exposure may result in a bronchial hyperreactivity syndrome called \"potroom worker’s asthma\". Serial pulmonary function tests may be used to monitor RADS and bronchial hyperreactivity in workers exposed to HF. Ocular If ocular exposure is mild, conjunctival irritation and chemosis (which typically occurs) resolves over a period of several days, and no long-term sequelae are anticipated. If exposure is more severe, corneal injury or sloughing may result in chronic conjunctivitis, corneal opacification or vascularization, glaucoma, or keratitis sicca. Treatment of Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure Various treatments depending on type of exposure Prompt decontamination if applicable Calcium and magnesium salts Dermal Immediate decontamination should be done, including removing contaminated clothing or work gear and flushing the affected areas with water for 15 minutes. After decontamination, 2.5% calcium gluconate or calcium carbonate gel should be applied to the affected area and covered with an occlusive nonadherent dressing (for finger injuries, gel can be placed in a surgical glove put on the patient's hand). Application of the soluble calcium salt to areas exposed to HF results in complexation of calcium with fluoride, which forms soluble calcium fluoride. This reaction results in a fluoride concentration gradient that favors the diffusion of HF out of the body and into the gel. Topical calcium is applied until pain is relieved. If pain persists despite application of topical calcium or if the patient was exposed to concentrated HF solutions, calcium gluconate may be given by subcutaneous or intra-arterial injection. Calcium chloride should not be given by these routes because tissue necrosis is a risk. For subcutaneous injection, 0.5 mL of 5% calcium gluconate per square centimeter can be infiltrated. Iatrogenic compartment syndrome is a risk in small tissue compartments (eg, the hand). If those areas are affected, risks and benefits of calcium infiltration should be weighed. No more than 0.5 mL of solution should be injected per digit. For intra-arterial administration, 50 mL of 2% calcium gluconate can be infused into the artery perfusing the affected area over a 4-hour period. Risks of arterial cannulation should be considered when deciding whether to do this procedure. All but the most minor or superficial exposures require transfer to a burn center for possible surgical intervention, including skin grafting, debridement of necrotic tissue, fasciotomy, and amputation. Oral Gastric emptying with an orogastric (OG) or nasogastric (NG) tube should be done as soon as possible after an oral HF exposure. Gastric emptying is unlikely to be beneficial if >1 hour has elapsed since the ingestion. The same OG or NG tube may be used to deliver calcium or magnesium salt to the GI tract, although evidence of its benefit is limited. As with other caustic ingestions, activated charcoal is contraindicated. A GI specialist should be consulted about possible endoscopy. Systemic Patients with systemic fluoride toxicity should be admitted to an intensive care unit for cardiac monitoring, serial electrocardiography and, if depressed cardiac contractility is suspected, echocardiography. Serial measurement of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate levels is done and treated as required. Treatment of systemic fluoride toxicity includes calcium and magnesium salts, given IV, to replenish calcium and magnesium lost from complexation with fluoride. IV fluids, and vasopressor and/or inotropic support are given for depressed cardiac contractility. Magnesium sulfate may be given as a loading dose of 4 to 6 g IV over 60 minutes, followed by 2 to 4 g/hour infusion. Patients should be monitored for hypotension and respiratory depression. Calcium gluconate may be given as a loading dose of 6 g IV over 60 minutes, followed by infusion of 0.5 mEq/kg/hour. If a central venous catheter is available, calcium chloride may be used instead of calcium gluconate at a loading dose of 2 g, followed by infusion of 0.5 mEq/kg/hour. If hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia persist or recur, loading doses of both magnesium and calcium may be repeated. Amount of supplementary electrolytes to administer should be guided by real time blood testing. Sodium bicarbonate may be given IV for acidemia, although few studies address its efficacy. Fluoride ions are eliminated by hemodialysis. Hemodialysis should be considered for patients with systemic toxicity, although such patients may be too clinically unstable to have the procedure. Inhalational Inhalational exposure may be treated with nebulized calcium gluconate; 2.5% and 5% calcium gluconate can be given as intermittent or continuous treatments. Patients with wheezing and bronchospasm can also be treated with a nebulized beta agonist (eg, albuterol), nebulized ipratropium, and oral or IV corticosteroids.

Irrigation with at least 2 to 3 liters of fluid is recommended. Ocular irrigation with calcium-containing solutions, which are irritating and may create corneal injury, should not be used. Consultation with an ophthalmologist should be obtained in the acute care setting, and ophthalmology follow-up should be arranged. Prevention of Hydrofluoric Acid Exposure Various organizations (eg, Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA], National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH]) provide recommendations for minimizing the risk of exposure to hydrofluoric acid. These recommendations include Providing workers with information about the hazards specific to HF before they handle it Limiting the time workers are exposed to HF Requiring workers to wear a properly functioning fume hood and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as goggles, disposable gloves, and acid-resistant apron Requiring workers to wear long pants, long sleeves, and closed-toe shoes Equipping the work area with a safety shower and eye wash station Having calcium gluconate available for skin treatment Storing HF properly Providing all areas where HF is used with spill-response equipment (eg, dry magnesium sulfate, spill control pads, sodium bicarbonate solution) Key Points Dermal, oral, inhalational, and ocular exposures to hydrofluoric acid may occur in the workplace. Symptoms begin immediately after exposure to concentrated HF formulations but may be delayed by several hours after exposure to dilute HF formulations. Surface burns and the complexation of calcium or magnesium with the fluoride ion in HF results in local hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, which cause cellular dysfunction and death. Treat dermal burns and severe pain due to dermal exposure with dermal, subcutaneous, or intra-arterial calcium; transfer almost all patients with burns to a burn center. For oral exposures, use an orogastric or nasogastric tube to empty the stomach as soon as possible; ingestion of concentrated HF solution is toxic as well as caustic and can be fatal. Treat patients with inhalational exposure with nebulized calcium gluconate; treat patients who have had a more concentrated exposure and who have ARDS-like symptoms with the usual treatments for ARDS. Admit patients with systemic fluoride toxicity (which may be due to dermal, oral, or inhalational exposure) to an intensive care unit for serial monitoring and support, and treat them with IV magnesium and calcium and, if needed, vasopressors. After ocular exposure, irrigate the eyes immediately, continuously, and thoroughly and arrange consultation and follow-up with an ophthalmologist.

Adults most often choke on a piece of food, such as a large piece of meat. Infants do not have well-developed swallowing reflexes and may choke if given small, rounded foods such as peanuts or hard candies. Children, especially toddlers, also may choke on balloons, toys, coins, other inedible objects that they place in their mouth, and foods (particularly rounded, smooth foods, such as hot dogs, round candies, nuts, beans, and grapes). Coughing may be the first symptom and is often so severe that the person cannot ask for help. The person may grasp both hands near the throat. Breathing and speaking can become weak or stop. There can be high-pitched or gasping sounds, and the person can turn blue, have a seizure, or faint. First-Aid Treatment If more than one rescuer is available, one rescuer should call for emergency medical care while another starts to treat the person who is choking. If only one rescuer is available, wait to call for help until after trying to clear the choking person's airway. Performing Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver) The rescuer stands behind the person and encircles the person's abdomen with the arms. With one hand, the rescuer forms a fist and clasps the other hand around the fist. The rescuer places the hands halfway between the breastbone and navel and thrusts the hands inward and upward. A strong cough often expels the object from the airway. A person with a strong cough should be allowed to continue coughing. A person who can speak normally usually still has a strong cough. If a person who is choking cannot cough, the rescuer should deliver abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver), which increase pressure in the abdomen and chest and help expel the object. If the person is conscious, the rescuer approaches from behind, using the arms to encircle the person's abdomen. The rescuer forms a fist. The thumb should be inside the fist, and the thumb side of the fist should point inward, toward the person. The rescuer places the fist between the breastbone and the navel. The other hand is placed firmly over the fisted hand. The hands are then thrust inward and upward forcefully, 5 times in succession. The rescuer should kneel and less force should be used if the person is a child younger than 5 or weighs less than 45 pounds (20 kg). Series of thrusts should be repeated until the object is expelled. If the person loses consciousness, the rescuer should immediately stop the thrusts and try to remove the airway obstruction by other means. If the person loses consciousness, the rescuer looks in the mouth and throat for any visible objects that may be blocking the airway and, if any are present, removes them. If the person does not start breathing, the tongue may be blocking the airway. The rescuer then tilts the person's head back slightly and lifts the chin, moving the tongue and thus opening the airway. If the person is not breathing, mouth-to-mouth respiration can be given. Failure of the chest to rise indicates that the airway is still blocked (see First-Aid Treatment First-Aid Treatment Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops pumping blood and oxygen to the brain and other organs and tissues.

How To Treat the Choking Conscious Infant VIDEO For an infant, abdominal thrusts are not done. Instead, the infant is turned face down, the chest resting on the rescuer's forearm, with the head lower than the body. The rescuer then strikes the infant between the shoulder blades 5 times using the heel of the hand (back blows). The strikes should be firm but not hard enough to cause injury. The rescuer then checks the mouth, removing any visible objects. If the airway remains blocked, the rescuer turns the infant face up with the head down, and using the second and third fingers, thrusts inward and upward about ½ to 1½ inches (about 1¼ to 4 centimeters) on the infant's breastbone 5 times (chest thrusts). The rescuer then checks the mouth again for any visible objects. The process is repeated until the object is dislodged or the infant becomes unconscious (which requires immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation First-Aid Treatment Cardiac arrest is when the heart stops pumping blood and oxygen to the brain and other organs and tissues.

The dermatosis often precedes the cancer diagnosis. Classical acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis affects mostly women ages 30 to 50, with a female:male ratio of 3:1. In contrast, men who develop the condition tend to be older (60 to 90). In children under age 3, the ratio is male:female 2:1. The cause of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is unknown; however, type 1 helper T-cell cytokines, including interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, are predominant and may play a role in lesion formation. Symptoms and Signs Patients are febrile, with an elevated neutrophil count, and have painful, tender, and edematous red to violet plaques or papules, most often on the face, neck, and upper extremities, especially the dorsum of hands. Oral lesions can also occur. The lesions often develop in crops and may appear annular. Each crop is usually preceded by fever and persists for days to weeks.

Treatment Systemic corticosteroids Treatment of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis involves systemic corticosteroids, chiefly prednisone 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg orally once a day tapered over 3 weeks. Colchicine 0.5 mg orally 3 times a day or potassium iodide 300 mg orally 3 times a day are alternative treatments. Antipyretics are also recommended. In difficult cases, dapsone 100 to 200 mg orally once a day, indomethacin 150 mg orally once a day for 1 week and 100 mg orally once a day for 2 additional weeks, clofazimine (eg, 200 mg orally once a day for 4 weeks then 100 mg/day for 4 weeks), or cyclosporine (eg, 2 to 4 mg/kg orally 2 times a day) can be given. Other treatments used for refractory disease include infliximab, etanercept, thalidomide, minocycline, and mycophenolate mofetil.

These disorders often result from conditions that cause the atria to enlarge. Symptoms depend on how fast the ventricles contract and may include palpitations, weakness, dizziness or light-headedness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Electrocardiography (ECG) confirms the diagnosis. Treatment includes drugs to slow the ventricles’ contractions and sometimes drugs or electrical shocks (cardioversion) to restore normal heart rhythm.

Heart disorders are... Common.TooltipReadMore .) Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are more common among older people and people who have a heart disorder. Atrial fibrillation is much more common than atrial flutter. Many people with atrial flutter also have episodes of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may come and go or be sustained. The Conduction System VIDEO Atrial fibrillation During atrial fibrillation, electrical impulses are triggered from many areas in and around the atria rather than just one area (the sinoatrial node—see figure ). The resulting electrical activity is chaotic rather than organized and thus, the atrial walls quiver rather than contract. Because the atria do not contract normally, they do not help pump blood into the ventricles. When the atria do not help pump blood to the ventricles, the maximum amount of blood that the heart pumps is reduced by about 10%. This slightly lower maximum output is usually not a problem except in people who have heart disease, particularly when they exert themselves. Only some of the chaotic electrical impulses are conducted through the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Thus, the ventricles beat irregularly. For most people who are not being treated for atrial fibrillation, the impulses are conducted to the ventricles at a faster-than-normal rate (often 140 to 160 times per minute, compared to the normal heart rate of about 60 to 100 beats per minute). Even faster rates occur during exercise. Atrial Fibrillation VIDEO Atrial flutter During atrial flutter, unlike in atrial fibrillation, electrical activity in the atria is coordinated. Thus, the atria do contract, but at a very rapid rate (250 to 350 times per minute). This rate is too fast to allow every impulse to be conducted through the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. For most people who are not being treated, every second atrial impulse gets to the ventricules, resulting in a ventricular rate of about 150 beats per minute. ECG: Reading the Waves An electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the electrical current moving through the heart during a heartbeat. The current's movement is divided into parts, and each part is given an alphabetic designation in the ECG. Each heartbeat begins with an impulse from the heart's pacemaker (sinus or sinoatrial node). This impulse activates the upper chambers of the heart (atria). The P wave represents activation of the atria. Next, the electrical current flows down to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). The QRS complex represents activation of the ventricles. The ventricles must then undergo an electrical change to get ready for the next heart beat. This electrical activity is called the recovery wave, which is represented by the T wave. Many kinds of abnormalities can often be seen on an ECG. They include a previous heart attack (myocardial infarction), an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the heart (ischemia), and excessive thickening (hypertrophy) of the heart's muscular walls. Certain abnormalities seen on an ECG can also suggest bulges (aneurysms) that develop in weaker areas of the heart's walls. Aneurysms may result from a heart attack. If the rhythm is abnormal (too fast, too slow, or irregular), the ECG may also indicate where in the heart the abnormal rhythm starts. Such information helps doctors begin to determine the cause. Atrial Flutter Atrial flutter is a regular rhythm with characteristic \"flutter\" waves in a sawtooth pattern. Causes of Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter may occur even when there is no other heart disorder.

Complications The main complications include the following: Blood clots in the atria Rapid heart rate, causing decreased heart output In atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the atria do not empty completely into the ventricles with each beat. Over time, some blood inside the atria may stagnate, and blood clots may form. Pieces of the clot may break off, often shortly after atrial fibrillation converts back to normal rhythm—whether spontaneously or because of treatment. These pieces of clot may pass into the left ventricle, travel through the bloodstream (becoming emboli), and block a smaller artery.

When the ventricular rate is normal or only slightly increased (less than about 120 beats per minute), people usually have no symptoms.

It enables doctors to evaluate the heart valves and look for blood clots in the atria. Doctors usually also do blood tests to look for an overactive thyroid gland. Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter Slowing the heart rate Anticoagulants Restoring normal heart rhythm Ablation Treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is designed to control the rate at which the ventricles contract, to restore the normal rhythm of the heart, and to treat the disorder causing the arrhythmia. Drugs to prevent the formation of blood clots and emboli (anticoagulants or aspirin) are usually given. Treatment of the underlying disorder is important but does not always alleviate atrial arrhythmias. However, treatment of an overactive thyroid gland or surgery to correct a heart valve disorder or a birth defect of the heart may help. Slowing the heart rate Usually, the first step in treating atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is to slow the beating of the ventricles so that the heart pumps blood more efficiently. Usually, drugs can slow the ventricle. Often, the first drug tried is a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem or verapamil, which may slow the conduction of impulses to the ventricles (see table ). A beta-blocker, such as propranolol or atenolol, may be used. For people who have heart failure, digoxin may be used. Restoring normal heart rhythm Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter may spontaneously convert to a normal rhythm. In some people, these arrhythmias must be actively converted to a normal rhythm (cardioversion Cardioversion-Defibrillation There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment. Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle,... Common.TooltipReadMore ). Such people include those in whom the atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter causes heart failure or other symptoms of low heart output. Before restoring normal rhythm, because there is a risk that a blood clot will break off and cause a stroke during conversion, measures must be taken to prevent blood clots. If the atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter has been present for more than 48 hours, doctors give an anticoagulant, such as warfarin, for 3 to 4 weeks before attempting conversion. Alternatively, doctors can give a short-acting anticoagulant, such as heparin, and do echocardiography. If echocardiography does not show a clot in the heart, the person can undergo conversion immediately. If the rhythm has clearly been present less than 48 hours, people do not need an anticoagulant before conversion. However, most people need an anticoagulant for at least 4 weeks after conversion. Methods of conversion include Electrical shock (synchronized cardioversion) Drugs An electrical shock to the heart is the most effective approach. The electrical shock is synchronized to be given only at a certain point in the heart's electrical activity (synchronized cardioversion Cardioversion-Defibrillation There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment. Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle,... Common.TooltipReadMore ) so that it does not cause ventricular fibrillation. Cardioversion is effective in 75 to 90% of people. Certain antiarrhythmic drugs (most commonly, amiodarone, flecainide, procainamide, propafenone, or sotalol—see table ) also may restore a normal rhythm. However, these drugs are effective in only about 50 to 60% of people and often cause side effects. Conversion to a normal rhythm by any means becomes less likely the longer the arrhythmia has been present (especially after 6 months or more), the larger the atria become, and the more severe the underlying heart disorder becomes. When conversion is successful, the risk of recurrence is high, even if people are taking a drug to prevent recurrence (typically one of the same drugs used to convert the arrhythmia to a normal rhythm). Ablation procedures Rarely, when all other treatments of atrial fibrillation are ineffective, the atrioventricular node can be destroyed by an ablation procedure Destroying Abnormal Heart Tissue (Ablation) There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment. Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle,... Common.TooltipReadMore . Ablation is a process to kill a specific area of abnormal tissue using energy from radiofrequency waves, lasers, or electrical current, or by applying very cold temperatures. These are applied using a catheter inserted into the heart. By destroying the AV node, this ablation procedure completely stops conduction from the atria to the ventricles. Thus, although the atria continue to fibrillate, the ventricular rate slows down. However, a permanent artificial pacemaker Artificial Pacemakers There are many causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Some arrhythmias are harmless and do not need treatment. Sometimes arrhythmias stop on their own or with changes in lifestyle,... Common.TooltipReadMore is required to activate the ventricles afterward. Another type of ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation destroys atrial tissue near the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein isolation). Pulmonary vein isolation spares the atrioventricular node and can stop the atrial fibrillation but is less often successful (60 to 80%), and the risk of serious complications is significant (1 to 5%). Accordingly, this procedure is often reserved for the best candidates (such as, younger people who have no significant heart disease like a heart valve disorder, people without other options such as those with atrial fibrillation that does not respond to drug therapy, or people with heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure is a disorder in which the heart is unable to keep up with the demands of the body, leading to reduced blood flow, back-up (congestion) of blood in the veins and lungs, and/or...

Common.TooltipReadMore such as warfarin, dabigatran, or a clotting factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban). People who cannot be given an anticoagulant may be given aspirin, which also can help prevent stroke, but aspirin is not as effective as warfarin. Otherwise healthy people who had only one episode of atrial fibrillation that converted to normal rhythm (spontaneously or with treatment) need anticoagulant treatment for only 4 weeks. People who had several episodes of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or who remain in such rhythms despite treatment should take a drug to prevent blood clots indefinitely. Doctors use warfarin or other anticoagulants for people who have one or more risk factors for developing stroke. Such risk factors include Age 65 years or older High blood pressure Diabetes Heart failure A previous stroke or transient ischemic attack Disease affecting the blood vessels Being female Some people without those risk factors are given aspirin, and some are not given any treatment to prevent strokes. Even after atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter converts to normal rhythm, doctors usually continue anticoagulant treatment, often for the remainder of the person’s life. This anticoagulant treatment is needed because the arrhythmia may come back without the person being aware of it. Dangerous blood clots can form during these episodes.

Sometimes the infection spreads, causing the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes to enlarge and damaging other organs. The diagnosis is based on culture and examination of tissue and fluid samples.

Histoplasmosis is particularly common in the eastern and midwestern United States, particularly along the Ohio and Mississippi river valley. It may occur in the Southern states. Histoplasmosis also occurs in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Outbreaks associated with bat caves have occurred worldwide and in the United States have been reported in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Histoplasma grows best in soil and dust that are contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Chicken farmers, construction workers, cavers (people who like to explore caves), and others who work with soil are most likely to inhale the spores produced by Histoplasma. The risk of infection is greatest when activity generates airborne spores (for example, tree or building removal at construction sites in areas where birds or bats live) or when exploring caves. Severe illness can result when large numbers of spores are inhaled. Forms of Histoplasmosis There are three main forms of histoplasmosis: Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis: This form is the initial form of the infection. It occurs in the lungs and usually remains there. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis: If the immune system is weakened or is immature, the infection may spread (disseminate) from the lungs through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, such as the brain, spinal cord, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, digestive system, or bone marrow. This form rarely occurs in healthy adults. It usually occurs in malnourished infants or very young children or in people with a weakened immune system, such as those who have HIV/AIDS, an organ transplant, or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system, including corticosteroids. Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis: In this form, one or more spaces (cavities) form in the lungs gradually, over several weeks. The infection does not spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. Symptoms of Histoplasmosis Most people infected with Histoplasma do not develop any symptoms, or they develop only very mild symptoms. Symptoms vary, depending on the form of histoplasmosis. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis Symptoms usually appear 3 to 21 days after people inhale the spores. People may feel sick, have a fever and a cough, and feel as though they have the flu. Symptoms usually disappear without treatment in 2 weeks and rarely last longer than 6 weeks. People who inhale many spores may develop pneumonia. They may become very short of breath and be ill for months. Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis is very rarely fatal but can become serious in people with a weakened immune system (such as those with AIDS). Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis Symptoms are vague at first. People may feel tired, weak, and generally ill. Symptoms may worsen very slowly or extremely rapidly. Pneumonia may develop but is rarely severe, except in people with AIDS.

Without treatment, this form is fatal in more than 90% of people. Even with treatment, death may occur rapidly in people with AIDS. Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis This lung infection develops gradually over several weeks, causing a cough and difficulty breathing that become increasingly worse. Symptoms include weight loss, night sweats, a mild fever, and a general feeling of illness (malaise). Most people recover without treatment within 2 to 6 months. However, breathing difficulties may continue to worsen, and some people cough up blood, sometimes in large amounts. Lung tissue is destroyed, and scar tissue forms. Lung damage or bacterial invasion of the lungs may eventually cause death. Diagnosis of Histoplasmosis Culture and examination of samples of tissues or fluids Sometimes blood and urine tests Chest x-ray To diagnose histoplasmosis, doctors obtain samples of the sputum, urine, blood, or mouth ulcers (if present).

Doctors also take a chest x-ray to look for evidence of lung infection. For some rare forms of the infection, the help of infectious disease specialists is required for diagnosis (and treatment). Prognosis of Histoplasmosis Acute primary histoplasmosis almost always goes away without treatment. Chronic cavitary histoplasmosis can cause death. Untreated progressive disseminated histoplasmosis has a death rate of greater than 90%. Treatment of Histoplasmosis Antifungal drugs Acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in otherwise healthy people rarely requires drug treatment. However, if people do not improve after a month, itraconazole, given by mouth, is often prescribed. If severe pneumonia develops, people are given amphotericin B intravenously, followed by itraconazole. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis requires treatment. If the infection is severe, amphotericin B is given intravenously, followed by itraconazole, given by mouth. If the infection is mild, itraconazole is used alone. If people with AIDS develop histoplasmosis, they may need to take an antifungal drug, usually itraconazole, for the rest of their life.

Hyperbilirubinemia in this setting is known as hepatocellular jaundice and, according to Hy’s law, is associated with mortality rates as high as 50%. If hepatocellular liver injury is accompanied by jaundice, impaired hepatic synthesis, and encephalopathy, chance of spontaneous recovery is low, and liver transplantation Liver Transplantation Liver transplantation is the 2nd most common type of solid organ transplantation.

This type of injury can result from drugs such as acetaminophen and isoniazid. Cholestatic: Cholestatic hepatotoxicity is characterized by development of pruritus and jaundice accompanied by marked elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Usually, this type of injury is less serious than severe hepatocellular syndromes, but recovery may be protracted. Substances known to lead to this type of injury include amoxicillin/clavulanate and chlorpromazine. Rarely, cholestatic hepatotoxicity leads to chronic liver disease and vanishing bile duct syndrome (progressive destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts). Mixed: In these clinical syndromes, neither aminotransferase nor alkaline phosphatase elevations are clearly predominant. Symptoms may also be mixed. Drugs such as phenytoin can cause this type of injury. Diagnosis of Drug-Related Liver Injury Identification of characteristic patterns of laboratory abnormalities Exclusion of other causes Presentation varies widely, ranging from absent or nonspecific symptoms (eg, malaise, nausea, anorexia) to jaundice, impaired hepatic synthesis, and encephalopathy. Early recognition of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) improves prognosis.

Because there is no confirmatory diagnostic test, other causes of liver disease, especially viral, biliary, alcoholic, autoimmune, and metabolic causes, need to be excluded. Drug rechallenge, although it can strengthen evidence for the diagnosis, should be avoided. Suspected cases of DILI should be reported to MedWatch (the Food and Drug Administration's [FDA’s] adverse drug reaction monitoring program; 1 Treatment Many drugs (eg, statins) commonly cause asymptomatic elevation of hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase).

Antidotes for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are available for only a few hepatotoxins; such antidotes include N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity and silymarin or penicillin for Amanita phalloides toxicity. Occassionally, corticosteroids can help in DILI with DRESS syndrome or in autoimmune-like injury, as with minocycline or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor toxicity. Prevention of Drug-Related Liver Injury Efforts to avoid drug-induced liver injury (DILI) begin during the drug-development process, although apparent safety in small preclinical trials does not ensure eventual safety of the drug after it is in widespread use. Postmarketing surveillance, now increasingly mandated by the FDA, can call attention to potentially hepatotoxic drugs. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has established a database (LiverTox) to collect and analyze cases of severe liver injury caused by prescription drugs, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and alternative medicines such as herbal products and dietary supplements Overview of Dietary Supplements Dietary supplements are the most commonly used of all integrative, complementary, and alternative therapies, primarily because they are widely available, relatively inexpensive, and can be bought... read more . This is a searchable database that provides easily accessible and accurate information regarding known hepatotoxicity related to drugs and supplements. Routine monitoring of liver enzymes has not been shown to decrease the incidence of hepatotoxicity. Use of pharmacogenomics may allow tailoring of drug use and avoidance of potential toxicities in susceptible patients. Key Points Drugs are much more likely to cause an asymptomatic abnormality in liver function than clinically evident liver damage or dysfunction. Risk factors for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include age ≥ 18 years, obesity, pregnancy, concomitant alcohol consumption, and certain genetic polymorphisms. DILI can be predictable and dose-related or unpredictable and unrelated to dose. DILI can be hepatocellular, cholestatic (usually less serious than hepatocellular), or mixed. To confirm the diagnosis, exclude other causes of liver disease, especially viral, biliary, alcoholic, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders. Do not rechallenge patients with drugs suspected of causing DILI.

However, urine output may not be reduced if ATN is less severe (eg, typical in aminoglycoside-induced ATN). Diagnosis of Acute Tubular Necrosis Differentiation from prerenal azotemia, based mainly on laboratory findings and, in the case of blood or fluid loss, response to volume expansion Acute tubular necrosis is suspected when serum creatinine rises ≥ 0.3 mg/dL/day (26.5 micromol/liter [μmol/L]) above baseline or a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in serum creatinine from baseline after an apparent trigger (eg, hypotensive event, exposure to a nephrotoxin); the rise in creatinine may occur 1 to 2 days after certain exposures (eg, IV radiocontrast) but be more delayed after exposure to other nephrotoxins (eg, aminoglycosides). ATN must be differentiated from prerenal azotemia because treatment differs. In prerenal azotemia, renal perfusion is decreased enough to elevate serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) out of proportion to creatinine, but not enough to cause ischemic damage to tubular cells. Prerenal azotemia can be caused by direct intravascular fluid loss (eg, due to hemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract losses, urinary losses) or by a relative decrease in effective circulating volume without loss of total body fluid (eg, in heart failure, portal hypertension with ascites). If fluid loss is the cause, volume expansion using IV normal saline solution increases urine output and normalizes serum creatinine level. If ATN is the cause, IV saline typically causes no increase in urine output and no rapid change in serum creatinine. Untreated prerenal azotemia may progress to ischemic ATN. Laboratory findings also help distinguish acute tubular necrosis from prerenal azotemia (see table Laboratory Findings Distinguishing Acute Tubular Necrosis From Prerenal Azotemia Laboratory Findings Distinguishing Acute Tubular Necrosis From Prerenal Azotemia ). Table Prognosis for Acute Tubular Necrosis In otherwise healthy patients, short-term prognosis is good when the underlying insult is corrected; serum creatinine typically returns to normal or near-normal within 1 to 3 weeks.

Key Points Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) can develop after various disorders or triggers decrease renal perfusion or expose the kidneys to toxins. Other than oliguria in severe cases, symptoms do not develop unless and until renal failure develops. Differentiate ATN from prerenal azotemia by the response to volume expansion and by urine and blood chemistry tests and calculations derived from them. Correct the cause of ATN as soon as possible to achieve a good short-term prognosis. Stop nephrotoxins, maintain euvolemia, and treat infection and undernutrition.

Atopic dermatitis is very common, particularly in high-income countries and among people who have a tendency to develop allergies. Infants tend to develop red, oozing, crusted rashes on the face, scalp, hands, arms, feet, or legs.

Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders, particularly in children living in urban areas or high-income countries. Each year, up to about 10% of adults and 20% of children are diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. Most people develop the disorder before age 5, and many people develop it before age 1. Atopic dermatitis that develops during childhood frequently goes away or lessens greatly by adulthood. Atopic dermatitis may begin during late adulthood or even later in life. Atopic dermatitis is caused by a genetic defect of the skin barrier that predisposes the skin to inflammation.

Atopic dermatitis is not an allergy to a particular substance, but having atopic dermatitis increases the likelihood of also developing asthma and hay fever (what doctors call an atopic triad). Atopic dermatitis is not contagious. Symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy, as early as 3 months of age. In the early (acute) phase, red, oozing, and crusted areas develop, and sometimes blisters. Itching is often intense. In the chronic (later) phase, scratching and rubbing create areas that appear dry and thickened (lichenified). Examples of Atopic Dermatitis Atopic Dermatitis (Acute) Atopic dermatitis usually develops in infancy. In the early (acute) phase, the rash appears on the face and then spreads to the neck, scalp, arms, and legs. Image provided by Thomas Habif, MD. Atopic Dermatitis (Chronic) In the chronic (later) phase of atopic dermatitis, the rash often occurs in only one or a few spots, such as on the inner fold of the elbow area seen here.

Atopic Dermatitis (Back of Knees) This photo shows red crusted spots on the back of the knees and legs. © Springer Science+Business Media In infants, rashes on the face spread to the neck, eyelids, scalp, hands, arms, feet, and legs. Large areas of the body may be affected. In older children and adults, a rash often occurs (and recurs) in only one or a few spots, especially on the front of the neck, the inner folds of the elbows, and behind the knees. Although the color, intensity, and location of the rash vary, the rash always itches. In older children and adults, intense itching is the main symptom. The itching often leads to uncontrollable scratching, triggering a cycle of itching-scratching-itching that makes the problem worse. Continuous scratching causes the skin to thicken (lichenification). Itching worsens with dry air, irritation, and emotional stress. Common environmental triggers of symptoms include Excessive bathing or washing Harsh soaps Presence of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus on the skin Sweating Rough fabrics and wool Complications of atopic dermatitis Scratching and rubbing can also tear the skin, leaving an opening for bacteria to enter and cause infections of the skin, tissues below the skin, and nearby lymph nodes. Widespread inflammation and scaling of the skin also can develop.

These contact reactions are triggered when the skin comes in to contact with an allergen, which is a substance that sensitizes the skin. For example, contact allergies to nickel, the most common contact allergen, are twice as common among people who have atopic dermatitis than among people who do not have atopic dermatitis. Diagnosis of Atopic Dermatitis The appearance of the rash and the person's family history A doctor makes the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis based on the typical appearance of the rash and often on whether people or other members of their family have allergies, hay fever, or asthma. Prevention of Atopic Dermatitis Avoiding excessive washing or bathing, reducing the use of soap, using lukewarm water when washing or bathing, and applying moisturizers very often can prevent or at least reduce flare-ups. Identifying and avoiding triggers that worsen the condition can help. Triggers include sweat, stress, soaps, and detergents. Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis Measures to relieve itching Skin care Corticosteroids Immune system‒modulating medications Crisaborole Janus kinase inhibitors Phototherapy Biologic agents Sometimes antibiotics or antivirals No cure exists, but itching can be relieved with medications applied to the skin (topical medications) or medications taken by mouth (oral medications).

Doctors educate people about good skin care practices and the importance of breaking the itch–scratch cycle. General care and itch relief Certain skin care measures are helpful: Using soap substitutes instead of regular soap Applying moisturizers (ointments or creams) immediately after bathing, while the skin is damp Reducing the frequency of bathing (showers/baths should be limited to once a day, and sponge baths can be substituted to decrease the number of days with full baths) Limiting the temperature of bathing water to lukewarm Blotting or patting the skin dry after bathing rather than rubbing Taking baths with diluted bleach (for people who have certain skin infections) Antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, can help relieve itching. These medications are preferably taken at bedtime to avoid sleepiness during the day. People should also try to reduce their emotional stress. Corticosteroids Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. Specific treatments include applying a corticosteroid ointment or cream. To limit the use of corticosteroids in people being treated for long periods (because long-term use can lead to thinning of the skin, stretch marks, or acne-like bumps), doctors sometimes replace the corticosteroids with noncorticosteroid treatments for eczema, for a week or more at a time. Other treatments The immune system‒modulating medications tacrolimus and pimecrolimus also are helpful and can limit the need for long-term corticosteroid use. These medications are usually given as ointments or creams. Crisaborole ointment can be used to reduce itching, swelling, and redness. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interfere with the communication between cells that coordinate inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme JAK. Ruxolitinib cream is a JAK inhibitor that can be used to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people 12 years of age or older who do not have a weakened or impaired immune system. New JAK inhibitors include upadacitinib and abrocitinib. These two JAK inhibitors are taken by mouth.

Natural sun exposure is an alternative when phototherapy is not available. Immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, and azathioprine, are taken by mouth. They are given to people who have widespread, hard-to-treat, or disabling atopic dermatitis that does not get better with topical therapy and phototherapy.

Antibiotics may be given to people who have skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus or other bacteria. Antibiotic ointments may be applied directly to the skin or pills may be taken by mouth. People who have the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus in their nose may be given the antibiotic mupirocin to apply inside their nostrils, thus preventing skin infection. Parents should cut their children's fingernails short to minimize scratching and thus reduce the risk of infection. If a skin infection does occur, antibiotics may be given by mouth, applied to the skin, or both. Eczema herpeticum is treated with antivirals, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications are taken by mouth but can also be given by infusion. Prognosis for Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis often lessens by the time children are 5 years of age. However, flare-ups are common throughout adolescence and into adulthood. Girls and people who developed atopic dermatitis at an early age, have a severe case, have a family history, and have rhinitis or asthma are more likely to have atopic dermatitis for a long time. Even in these people, however, atopic dermatitis frequently resolves or lessens significantly by adulthood. Because the symptoms of atopic dermatitis are visible and sometimes disabling, children may develop long-term emotional problems as they face the challenge of living with the disorder during their developmental years.

There are usually several simultaneous contributing factors, including increased potassium intake, drugs that impair renal potassium excretion, and acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Hyperkalemia can also occur in metabolic acidosis (eg, as in diabetic ketoacidosis). Clinical manifestations are generally neuromuscular, resulting in muscle weakness and cardiac toxicity that, when severe, can degenerate to ventricular fibrillation or asystole.

Etiology of Hyperkalemia A common cause of increased serum potassium concentration is Pseudohyperkalemia Pseudohyperkalemia is most often caused by hemolysis of red blood cells in a blood sample. Pseudohyperkalemia can also occur as a result of prolonged application of a tourniquet or excessive fist clenching when venous blood is drawn. Thrombocytosis can cause pseudohyperkalemia in serum (platelet potassium is released during clotting), as can extreme leukocytosis. Normal kidneys eventually excrete potassium loads, so sustained, nonartifactual hyperkalemia usually implies diminished renal potassium excretion. However, other factors usually contribute. They can include increased potassium intake, increased potassium release from cells, or both (see table Factors Contributing to Hyperkalemia Factors Contributing to Hyperkalemia ). When sufficient potassium chloride is rapidly ingested or given parenterally, severe hyperkalemia may result even when renal function is normal, but hyperkalemia is usually temporary.

Diagnosis of Hyperkalemia Serum potassium measurement ECG Review of drug use Assessment of renal function Hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L [> 5.5 mmol/L]) may be found on routine serum electrolyte measurement. It should be suspected in patients with typical changes on an ECG or in patients at high risk, such as those with chronic kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function.

Pseudohyperkalemia should be considered in patients without risk factors or ECG abnormalities. Hemolysis may be reported by the laboratory. When pseudohyperkalemia is suspected, potassium concentration should be repeated, taking measures to avoid hemolysis of the sample (such as avoiding small-gauge needles or tourniquet use and limiting fist clenching) and blood should be promptly processed by the laboratory. ECG ECG should be done on patients with hyperkalemia. ECG changes (see figure ECG patterns in hyperkalemia ECG patterns in hypokalemia ) are frequently visible when serum potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Slowing of conduction is characterized by an increased PR interval and shortening of the QT interval. Tall, symmetric, peaked T waves are visible initially. Potassium > 6.5 mEq/L (> 6.5 mmol/L) causes further slowing of conduction with widening of the QRS interval, disappearance of the P wave, and nodal and escape ventricular arrhythmias. Finally, the QRS complex degenerates into a sine wave pattern, and ventricular fibrillation or asystole ensues. ECG patterns in hyperkalemia Serum potassium is in mEq/L and mmol/L. Diagnosis of cause Diagnosis of the cause of hyperkalemia requires a detailed history, including a review of drugs, a physical examination with emphasis on volume status, and measurement of electrolytes, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and creatinine. In cases in which renal failure is present, additional tests, including renal ultrasonography to exclude obstruction, are needed. Treatment of Hyperkalemia Treatment of the cause For mild hyperkalemia, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate For moderate or severe hyperkalemia, IV insulin and glucose, an IV calcium solution, possibly an inhaled beta 2-agonist, and usually hemodialysis Mild hyperkalemia Patients with serum potassium < 6 mEq/L (< 6 mmol/L) and no ECG abnormalities may respond to diminished potassium intake or stopping potassium-elevating drugs. The addition of a loop diuretic enhances renal potassium excretion as long as volume depletion is not present. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate in sorbitol can be given (15 to 30 g in 30 to 70 mL of 70% sorbitol orally every 4 to 6 hours). It acts as a cation exchange resin and removes potassium through the gastrointestinal mucosa. Sorbitol is administered with the resin to ensure passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Patients unable to take drugs orally because of nausea or other reasons may be given similar doses by enema. Enemas are not as effective at lowering potassium in patients with ileus. Enemas should not be used if acute abdomen is suspected. About 1 mEq (1 mmol) of potassium is removed per gram of resin given. Resin therapy is slow and often fails to lower serum potassium significantly in hypercatabolic states. Because sodium is exchanged for potassium when sodium polystyrene sulfonate is used, sodium overload (see Hypernatremia Hypernatremia Hypernatremia is a serum sodium concentration > 145 mEq/L (> 145 mmol/L). It implies a deficit of total body water relative to total body sodium caused by water intake being less than water... read more ) may occur, particularly in patients with oliguria and preexisting volume overload. In patients with recurrent hyperkalemia, avoidance of drugs that can induce hyperkalemia (see table Factors Contributing to Hyperkalemia Factors Contributing to Hyperkalemia ) is generally all that is needed. In patients who need ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocking drugs (eg, patients with chronic heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.

It manifests as slowly progressive albuminuria with worsening... read more ), the polymer resin patiromer can be taken daily to help decrease gut absorption of potassium and prevent hyperkalemia. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is being used increasingly. It is a polymer matrix that binds to potassium in the gut. It decreases serum potassium over several hours and has few gastrointestinal adverse effects. Moderate to severe hyperkalemia Serum potassium between 6 and 6.5 mEq/L (6 and 6.5 mmol/L) needs prompt attention, but the actual treatment depends on the clinical situation. If no ECG changes are present and renal function is intact, maneuvers as for mild hyperkalemia are usually effective. Follow-up serum potassium measurements are needed to ensure that the hyperkalemia has been successfully treated. If serum potassium is > 6.5 mEq/L (> 6.5 mmol/L), more aggressive therapy is required. Administration of regular insulin 5 to 10 units IV is followed immediately by or administered simultaneously with rapid infusion of 50 mL 50% glucose. Infusion of 10% dextrose in water (D/W) should follow at 50 mL/hour to prevent hypoglycemia. The effect on serum potassium peaks in 1 hour and lasts for several hours. If ECG changes include the loss of P-wave or widening of the QRS complex, treatment with IV calcium as well as insulin and glucose is indicated; 10 to 20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate (or 5 to 10 mL of 22% calcium gluceptate) is given IV over 5 to 10 minutes. If the ECG shows a sine wave pattern or asystole, calcium gluconate may be given more rapidly (5 to 10 mL IV over 2 minutes). Calcium antagonizes the effect of hyperkalemia on cardiac muscle. Calcium should be given with caution to patients taking digoxin because of the risk of precipitating hypokalemia-related arrhythmias. Calcium chloride can also be used but can be irritating to peripheral veins and cause tissue necrosis if extravasated. Calcium chloride should be given only through a correctly positioned central venous catheter. The benefits of calcium occur within minutes but last only 20 to 30 minutes. Calcium infusion is a temporizing measure while awaiting the effects of other treatments or initiation of hemodialysis and may need to be repeated. A high-dose beta 2-agonist, such as albuterol 10 to 20 mg inhaled over 10 minutes (5 mg/mL concentration), can lower serum potassium by 0.5 to 1.5 mEq/L (0.5 to 1.5 mmol/L) and may be a helpful adjunct. The peak effect occurs in 90 minutes. However, beta 2-agonists are contraindicated in patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. Administration of IV sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is controversial. It may lower serum potassium over several hours. Reduction may result from alkalinization or from the hypertonicity due to the concentrated sodium in the preparation. The amount of sodium contained in the infusion may be harmful for dialysis patients who also may have volume overload. Another possible complication of IV sodium bicarbonate is that it acts to acutely lower the ionized calcium concentration, which further exacerbates the cardiotoxicity of hyperkalemia. When sodium bicarbonate is given, the typical dose is 3 ampules of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate in one liter 5% D/W infused over 2 to 4 hours. Bicarbonate therapy has little effect when used by itself in patients with severe renal insufficiency unless acidemia is also present. In addition to strategies for lowering potassium by shifting it into cells, maneuvers to remove potassium from the body should also be done early in the treatment of severe or symptomatic hyperkalemia. Potassium can be removed via the gastrointestinal tract by administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate Mild hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/L (> 5.5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells. There... read more , but because the rate of potassium removal is somewhat unpredictable, close monitoring is needed. Patiromer and sodium zirconium silicate are not recommended for use as an emergency treatment to acutely lower potassium because of these drugs' delayed onset of action. Hemodialysis Hemodialysis In hemodialysis, a patient’s blood is pumped into a dialyzer containing 2 fluid compartments configured as bundles of hollow fiber capillary tubes or as parallel, sandwiched sheets of semipermeable... read more should be instituted promptly when emergency medical treatment is ineffective especially in patients with severe chronic kidney disease and/or acute kidney injury. Dialysis should be considered early in patients with end-stage renal disease and hyperkalemia because they are at increased risk of progression to more severe hyperkalemia and serious cardiac arrhythmias. Peritoneal dialysis is relatively inefficient at removing potassium acutely. Key Points Common causes of hyperkalemia include potassium-retaining drugs, renal insufficiency, adrenal insufficiency, and disorders involving cellular breakdown (eg, rhabdomyolysis, burns, bleeding into soft tissue or the gastrointestinal tract). Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic until cardiac toxicity develops, although some patients have weakness. ECG changes begin with an increased PR interval, shortening of the QT interval, and tall, symmetric, peaked T waves; with potassium > 6.5 mEq/L (> 6.5 mmol/L), QRS interval widens, and P wave disappears; ultimately, the QRS complex degenerates into a sine wave pattern, and ventricular fibrillation or asystole ensues. Give sodium polystyrene sulfonate, patiromer, or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate for mild hyperkalemia. Give IV insulin, glucose, and calcium, and possibly an inhaled beta 2-agonist for moderate to severe hyperkalemia. Use hemodialysis for patients with chronic kidney disease and those with significant ECG changes.

Symptoms begin with acute gastroenteritis, followed by a quiescent period, then shock and liver failure. Diagnosis is by measuring serum iron, detecting radiopaque iron tablets in the gastrointestinal tract, or detecting unexplained metabolic acidosis in patients with other findings suggesting iron poisoning. Treatment of a substantial ingestion is usually whole-bowel irrigation and chelation therapy with IV deferoxamine. (See also General Principles of Poisoning General Principles of Poisoning Poisoning is contact with a substance that results in toxicity. Symptoms vary, but certain common syndromes may suggest particular classes of poisons. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but for... read more .) Many commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) preparations contain iron. Of the many iron compounds used in OTC and prescription preparations, the most common are Ferrous sulfate (20% elemental iron) Ferrous gluconate (12% elemental iron) Ferrous fumarate (33% elemental iron) To children, iron tablets may look like candy. Prenatal multivitamins are the source of iron in most lethal iron ingestions among children. Children’s chewable multivitamins with iron usually have such small amounts that toxicity rarely occurs. Pathophysiology of Iron Poisoning Iron is toxic to the gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system. Specific mechanisms are unclear, but excess free iron is inserted into enzymatic processes and interferes with oxidative phosphorylation, causing metabolic acidosis Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic acidosis is primary reduction in bicarbonate (HCO3−), typically with compensatory reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be markedly low or slightly... read more . Iron also catalyzes free radical formation, acts as an oxidizer, and, when plasma protein binding is saturated, combines with water to form iron hydroxide and free H+ ions, compounding the metabolic acidosis. Coagulopathy may appear early because of interference with the coagulation cascade and later because of liver injury. Toxicity depends on the amount of elemental iron that has been ingested. Up to 20 mg/kg of elemental iron is not toxic, 20 to 60 mg/kg is mildly to moderately toxic, and > 60 mg/kg can cause severe symptoms and morbidity. Symptoms and Signs of Iron Poisoning Symptoms of iron poisoning occur in 5 stages (see table Stages of Iron Poisoning Stages of Iron Poisoning ); however, symptoms and their progression vary significantly. The severity of stage 1 symptoms usually reflects the overall severity of poisoning; late-stage symptoms develop only if stage 1 symptoms are moderate or severe. If no symptoms develop within the first 6 hours after ingestion, risk of serious toxicity is minimal. If shock and coma develop within the first 6 hours, the mortality rate is about 10%. Table Diagnosis of Iron Poisoning Abdominal x-ray Determination of serum iron, electrolytes, and pH 3 to 4 hours after ingestion Iron poisoning should be considered in mixed ingestions (because iron is ubiquitous) and in small children with access to iron and unexplained metabolic acidosis or severe or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Because children often share, siblings and playmates of small children who have ingested iron should be evaluated. Abdominal x-ray is usually recommended to confirm ingestion; it detects intact iron tablets or iron concretions but misses chewed and dissolved tablets, liquid iron preparations, and iron in multivitamin preparations. Serum iron, electrolytes, and pH are determined 3 to 4 hours after ingestion. Toxicity is assumed if suspected ingestion is accompanied by any of the following: Vomiting and abdominal pain Serum iron levels > 350 mcg/dL (63 micromol/L) Iron visible on x-ray Unexplained metabolic acidosis These iron levels may indicate toxicity; however, iron levels alone do not predict toxicity accurately. Total iron binding capacity is often inaccurate and not helpful in diagnosing serious poisoning and is not recommended. The most accurate approach is to serially measure levels of serum iron, bicarbonate, and pH (with calculation of the anion gap); these findings are then evaluated together, and results are correlated with the patient’s clinical status. For example, toxicity is suggested by increasing iron levels, elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, worsening symptoms, or, more typically, some combination of these findings. The deferoxamine challenge test is no longer recommended for evaluation of possible iron overdose because of poor sensitivity. In this test, deferoxamine, an iron chelating agent, was given intramuscularly, and serial urine samples were evaluated for the characteristic orange or reddish brown color (vin rosé urine) caused by excreted ferrioxamine). Treatment of Iron Poisoning Whole-bowel irrigation For severe toxicity, IV deferoxamine If radiopaque tablets are visible on abdominal x-ray, whole-bowel irrigation Whole-bowel irrigation Poisoning is contact with a substance that results in toxicity.

Administration via nasogastric tube may be necessary to deliver these large volumes and care must be taken to protect the airway; intubation may be necessary (see Tracheal Intubation Tracheal Intubation Most patients requiring an artificial airway can be managed with tracheal intubation, which can be Orotracheal (tube inserted through the mouth) Nasotracheal (tube inserted through the nose)... read more ). Gastric lavage is usually not helpful because vomiting tends to empty the stomach more efficiently. Activated charcoal does not adsorb iron and should be used only if other toxins also were ingested. All patients with more than mild gastroenteritis are hospitalized. Patients with severe toxicity (metabolic acidosis, Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic acidosis is primary reduction in bicarbonate (HCO3−), typically with compensatory reduction in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be markedly low or slightly... read more shock, severe gastroenteritis, or serum iron level > 500 mcg/dL [89.5 micromol/L]) are treated with IV deferoxamine to chelate free serum iron. Deferoxamine is infused at rates up to 15 mg/kg/h IV, titrated until hypotension occurs. Because both deferoxamine and iron poisoning can decrease blood pressure, patients receiving deferoxamine require IV hydration. Key Points Iron toxicity, like some other hepatotoxins, can cause gastroenteritis followed by a quiescent phase, then shock and liver failure. Suspect iron poisoning in mixed ingestions (because iron is ubiquitous) and in small children with access to iron and unexplained metabolic acidosis or severe or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Suspect that toxicity is severe with increasing iron levels, metabolic acidosis, worsening symptoms, or a combination. Do whole-bowel irrigation until an abdominal x-ray shows absence of radiopaque iron products. Give IV deferoxamine to treat severe poisoning (eg, metabolic acidosis, shock, severe gastroenteritis, serum iron level > 500 mcg/dL [89.5 micromol/L]).

Cytopenias Decreased blood concentrations of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBC), especially granulocytes, and platelets result from diverse systemic cancer therapies, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs, and radiation therapy. Anemia Decreased levels of RBCs are common in patients with cancer. Decreases in RBCs result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially in blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional cancer (chemotherapy) drugs. Often anemia requires no therapy. Some patients, especially those with comorbidities such as arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, may benefit from RBC transfusions. Others may benefit from receiving recombinant erythropoietin, which can substitute for RBC transfusions. Some data suggest erythropoietin use can have adverse effects on cancer prognosis and is prothrombotic. Guidelines on RBC transfusion and erythropoietin use are available, but recommendations are controversial (1 Cytopenia references Adverse effects are common in patients receiving any cancer therapy, particularly cytopenias, gastrointestinal effects, and tumor lysis and cytokine release syndromes. Patients may also have... read more ). Thrombocytopenia Decreased platelet concentration is common in patients with cancer. Decreases in platelets result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs. The risk of bleeding is inversely proportional to the platelet count (see table ). Platelet concentrations < 10,000/microL (10 × 109/L) are dangerous and require platelet transfusions. Molecularly cloned hormones, such as eltrombopag and avatrombopag, which stimulate megakaryocytes to produce platelets, have been used. Leukocyte depletion of transfused blood products may prevent alloimmunization to platelets and should be used in patients expected to need platelet transfusions during multiple courses of chemotherapy or for candidates for hematopoietic cell transplants. Leukocyte depletion also lowers the probability of acquiring a cytomegalovirus infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV, human herpesvirus type 5) can cause infections that have a wide range of severity. A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. Severe... read more . Neutropenia A decreased granulocyte concentration is common in patients with cancer. Neutropenia is considered a reduction in blood neutrophil count to < 1500/mcL (< 1.5 × 109/L) in White patients and < 1200/mcL (< 1.2 × 109/L) in people with African ancestry (see also Neutropenia Neutropenia Neutropenia is a reduction in the blood neutrophil count. If it is severe, the risk and severity of bacterial and fungal infections increase. Focal symptoms of infection may be muted, but fever... read more ). Decreases in granulocytes result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs. The risk of infection is inversely proportional to the granulocyte count. A granulocyte concentration < 500/microL (0.5 × 109/L) markedly increases the risk of infection. Measures to protect against infection, including wearing a mask, hand washing, and protective isolation, are important. Laminar air flow (LAF) rooms are sometimes used but have not proved effective. Oral nonabsorbable antibiotics are sometimes given prophylactically. When a prolonged interval of low granulocytes is anticipated, prophylactic antifungal and antiviral drugs are sometimes given, including drugs to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii. In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in whom there is an expected incidence of febrile neutropenia > 20 %, prophylactic myeloid growth factors such as filgrastrim, sargramostim, or pegfilgastrim are given with the chemotherapy (2, 3 Cytopenia references Adverse effects are common in patients receiving any cancer therapy, particularly cytopenias, gastrointestinal effects, and tumor lysis and cytokine release syndromes. Patients may also have... read more ). Afebrile patients with neutropenia require close outpatient follow-up for detection of fever and should be instructed to avoid contact with sick people or areas frequented by large numbers of people (eg, shopping malls, airports). Although most patients do not require antibiotics, patients with severe immunosuppression are sometimes given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet/day) as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii. In transplant patients or others receiving high-dose chemotherapy, antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir 800 mg orally twice a day or 400 mg IV every 12 hours) should be considered if serologic tests are positive for herpes simplex virus. Fever > 38.5° C on two or more occasions in a patient with neutropenia is a medical emergency. An extensive evaluation for potential infection sources should be made and blood cultures done. Typically, systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics are given before culture results are known and therapy modified as needed. Patients with persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics are often started on systemic antifungal and sometimes antiviral drugs. Evaluation should include immediate chest x-ray and cultures of blood, sputum, urine, stool, and any suspect skin lesions. Examination includes possible abscess sites (eg, skin, ears, sinuses, perirectal area), skin and mucosa for presence of herpetic lesions, retina for vascular lesions suggestive of infectious emboli, and catheter sites. Rectal examination and use of a rectal thermometer should be avoided. Other evaluation should be guided by clinical findings. Febrile neutropenic patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics chosen on the basis of the most likely organism. Typical regimens include cefepime or ceftazidime 2 g IV every 8 hours immediately after samples for culture are obtained. If diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are present, sputum should be tested for P. jirovecii, and if positive, appropriate therapy should be started. If fever resolves within 72 hours after starting empiric antibiotics, they are continued until the neutrophil count is > 500/microL (0.5 × 109/L). If fever continues, antifungal drugs should be added. Reassessment for infection, often including CT of the chest and abdomen, is also done. Granulocyte concentrations can be increased by giving molecularly cloned myeloid growth factors such as granulocyte (G) or granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as filgrastim, sargramostim, and peg-filgrastim. Guidelines for appropriate use of these drugs are available (2 Cytopenia references Adverse effects are common in patients receiving any cancer therapy, particularly cytopenias, gastrointestinal effects, and tumor lysis and cytokine release syndromes. Patients may also have... read more ). In selected patients with neutropenia related to chemotherapy, especially after high-dose chemotherapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may be started to shorten the duration of neutropenia. G-CSF 5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once/day up to 14 days and longer-acting forms (eg, pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously single dose once per chemotherapy cycle) may be used to accelerate WBC recovery. These drugs should not be given in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, and for pegfilgrastim, at least 14 days should elapse until the next planned chemotherapy dose. These drugs are begun at the onset of fever or sepsis or, in afebrile high-risk patients, when neutrophil count falls to < 500/microL. Many centers use outpatient treatment with G-CSF in selected low-risk patients with fever and neutropenia. Candidates must not have hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory distress, uncontrolled pain, or serious comorbid illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or hypercalcemia. The regimen in such cases requires daily follow-up and often involves visiting nurse services and home antibiotic infusion. Some regimens involve oral antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice a day plus amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg twice a day or 500 mg 3 times a day. If no defined institutional program for follow-up and treatment of neutropenic fever is available in an outpatient setting, then hospitalization is required. Cytopenia references 1.

These effects may be caused by the cancer itself, cancer therapy, or both. Anorexia Anorexia is common in patients with cancer and may be caused by the cancer directly or as a consequence of cancer therapy(ies). Loss of more than 10% of ideal body weight predicts an adverse prognosis. Efforts should be made to maintain reasonable nutrition. Sometimes partial or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is needed. Patients with surgical interruption of the gastrointestinal tract may need a feeding gastrostomy. Drugs that may increase appetite include corticosteroids, megestrol acetate, androgenic steroids, and dronabinol. Whether these drugs convincingly reduce anorexia, reverse weight loss, improve quality of life, or prolong survival is unclear. Some steroids, such as testosterone, are contraindicated in patients with prostate or liver cancer. Constipation Constipation is common in patients with cancer and is often exacerbated by opioids used to treat pain. A stimulant laxative such as senna 2 tablets orally at bedtime (maximum 8 tablets/day) or bisacodyl 5 to 15 mg orally at bedtime should be initiated when repeated opioid use is anticipated. Established constipation can be treated with various drugs (eg, bisacodyl 5 to 15 mg orally every 24 hours, milk of magnesia 15 to 30 mL orally at bedtime, lactulose 15 to 30 mL (10 to 20 g) every 12 to 24 hours, magnesium citrate 195 to 300 mL once every 24 hours. Enemas and suppositories should be avoided in patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Diarrhea Diarrhea is common after chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapy drugs, and radiation therapy, especially if the abdomen and/or pelvis is included in the radiation field. It is usually treated with loperamide 2 to 4 mg orally after each loose stool; or diphenoxylate/atropine 2.5 mg to 5 mg orally every 6 hours. However, doses can vary depending on various factors. Patients with cancer who are taking broad-spectrum antibiotics may become infected with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile–Induced Diarrhea Toxins produced by Clostridioides difficile strains in the gastrointestinal tract cause pseudomembranous colitis, typically after antibiotic use. Symptoms are diarrhea, sometimes bloody... read more , which should be tested for and treated with vancomycin. Patients with lower colorectal cancers may have a diverting colostomy, which complicates diarrhea management. Mouth lesions Mouth lesions such as inflammation and ulcers are common in patients receiving chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy. Sometimes these lesions are complicated by infection, often with Candida albicans. Candidiasis is usually treated with nystatin. Oral candidiasis can be treated with nystatin oral suspension 4 to 6 mL (400,000 to 600,000 units) 4 times a day, clotrimazole troches 10 mg 4 times a day, or fluconazole 100 mg orally once a day. Mucositis due to radiation therapy can cause pain and preclude sufficient oral intake, leading to undernutrition and weight loss. Rinses with analgesics and topical anesthetics (2% viscous lidocaine 5 to 10 mL every 2 hours or other commercially available mixtures) before meals, a bland diet without citrus food or juices, and avoidance of temperature extremes may allow patients to eat and maintain weight. If not, a feeding tube may be helpful if the small intestine is functional. For severe mucositis and diarrhea or an abnormally functioning intestine, parenteral alimentation may be needed. Nausea and vomiting Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with cancer whether or not they are receiving cancer therapy and decrease quality of life. Variables that predict the likelihood of causing nausea and vomiting secondary to cancer drugs are Type of drug(s) Dose How the drug is given How frequently the drug is given Interactions between cancer drugs Interactions between cancer drugs and drugs given to treat cancer-related pain Some chemotherapy drugs are especially likely to cause nausea and vomiting, including platinum-containing drugs such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin. Patients treated with other cancer modalities, including radiation therapy, hormones, targeted therapy drugs, and immune therapy can also have nausea and vomiting. Several drugs are effective in controlling and/or preventing nausea and vomiting: Serotonin-receptor antagonists are the most effective drugs but are also the most expensive. Virtually no toxicity occurs with granisetron and ondansetron aside from headache and orthostatic hypotension. A 0.15-mg/kg dose of ondansetron or a 10-mcg/kg dose of granisetron is given IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy. Doses of ondansetron can be repeated 4 and 8 hours after the first dose. The efficacy against highly emetogenic drugs, such as the platinum-containing drugs, can be improved with coadministration of dexamethasone 8 mg IV given 30 minutes before chemotherapy with repeat doses of 4 mg IV every 8 hours. A substance P/neurokinin-1 antagonist, aprepitant, can limit nausea and vomiting resulting from highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Dosage is 125 mg orally 1 hour before chemotherapy on day 1, then 80 mg orally 1 hour before chemotherapy on days 2 and 3. Other traditional antiemetics, including phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine 10 mg IV every 8 hours, promethazine 12.5 to 25 mg orally or IV every 8 hours) and metoclopramide 10 mg orally or IV given 30 minutes before chemotherapy with repeated doses every 6 to 8 hours, are alternatives restricted to patients with mild to moderate nausea and vomiting. Dronabinol (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) is an alternative treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. THC is the principal psychoactive component of marijuana. Its mechanism of antiemetic action is unknown, but cannabinoids bind to opioid receptors in the forebrain and may indirectly inhibit the vomiting center. Dronabinol is administered in doses of 5 mg/m2 orally 1 to 3 hours before chemotherapy, with repeated doses every 2 to 4 hours after the start of chemotherapy (maximum of 4 to 6 doses/day). However, it has variable oral bioavailability, is not effective for inhibiting the nausea and vomiting of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, and has significant adverse effects (eg, drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, mood changes, visual and time sense alterations). Smoking marijuana may be more effective. Marijuana for this purpose can be obtained legally in some states, although federal law still prohibits its use. It is used less commonly because of barriers to availability and because many patients cannot tolerate smoking. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam 1 to 2 mg orally or IV given 10 to 20 minutes before chemotherapy with repeated doses every 4 to 6 hours as needed, are sometimes helpful for refractory or anticipatory nausea and vomiting.

However, these drugs are often ineffective in controlling cancer pain, and opioids, including morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and oxymorphone, may be needed. An appropriate dose and schedule of these drugs are essential for adequate pain control (see table Opioid Analgesics Opioid Analgesics ). Often the patient with cancer is the best judge of when analgesics are needed. Patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) using an indwelling pump allows the patient to manage dose and timing of analgesics. Use of multiple drug classes may provide better pain control with fewer or less severe adverse effects than use of a single drug class. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in patients with thrombocytopenia. Neuropathic pain can be treated with gabapentin; the dose required is high (up to 1200 mg orally 3 times a day) but must be started low (eg, 300 mg 3 times a day) and then increased over a few weeks. Alternatively, a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, nortriptyline, 25 to 75 mg orally at bedtime) can be tried. Doses can vary to a large degree between patients. Opioids are the mainstay of pain control in patients with cancer and are often underused. Pain medication should be given at doses and schedules which achieve the target level of pain control. Too often people with cancer receive inadequate pain control. Other approaches may be needed to control pain under special circumstances. For example, radiation therapy often is needed for bone pain.

Symptomatic patients with hypocalcemia (eg, with arrhythmias, tetany) should receive IV calcium regardless of the serum phosphate level. Prevention of tumor lysis syndrome is desirable. Often it is possible to anticipate development of tumor lysis syndrome (eg, when treating cancers with rapid cell turnover) and to give large volumes of fluids and allopurinol or rasburicase before starting chemotherapy and sometimes prior to immune therapy (such as bispecific monoclonal antibodies or CAR-T-cells) to protect the kidneys from damage from uric acid. Patients should receive vigorous IV hydration to establish a urine output of at least 100 mL/hour before treatment. Patients also should receive allopurinol for at least 2 days before and during chemotherapy; for patients with high cell burden, this regimen can be continued for 10 to 14 days after therapy. Rasburicase is an enzyme that oxidizes uric acid to allantoin (a more soluble molecule) and is given at 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes once a day for 5 to 7 days, typically started 4 to 24 hours before the first chemotherapy treatment.

Grade 3: Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention with oxygen supplementation ≥ 40% FiO2, or hypotension requires high-dose or multiple vasopressors, or grade 3 organ toxicity, or grade 4 transaminitis. Grade 4: Symptoms are life threatening, including need for ventilator support, or indicate grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis). Grade 5: Death Therapy of low-grade CRS is supportive. Moderate-grade CRS requires oxygen therapy and fluids and one or more antihypotensive drugs to raise blood pressure. Moderate and severe-grade (ie, grades 3 and 4) CRS are treated with immune suppressive drugs such as corticosteroids. Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) monoclonal antibody, is also used in severe CRS. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur in some cancer patients treated with immune therapy. It is also related to cytokine-mediated toxicity and has been called cytokine release encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). Symptoms include confusion, depressed level of consciousness, disturbance in attention, lethargy, mental status changes, delirium, dizziness, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness (1 Tumor lysis syndrome and cytokine release syndrome references Adverse effects are common in patients receiving any cancer therapy, particularly cytopenias, gastrointestinal effects, and tumor lysis and cytokine release syndromes.

It causes itching, a rash, sometimes with scarring, as well as eye symptoms that may lead to blindness. The infection is spread through the bite of female blackflies, which breed in streams. The infection may cause only intense itching but sometimes causes a rash, swollen lymph nodes, impaired vision, or complete blindness. Usually, doctors diagnose the infection by identifying an immature form of the worm in a skin sample. Administration of ivermectin once or twice a year to people living in areas where the infection is common can control infection. If onchocerciasis causes symptoms, treatment is a single dose of ivermectin, which is repeated every 6 to 12 months until symptoms are gone.

Onchocerciasis is most common in tropical and southern (sub-Saharan) areas of Africa.

Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala have been declared free of onchocerciasis by the World Health Organization (WHO). People who live or work near rapidly flowing streams or rivers are the most likely to be infected. In addition to residents, longterm travelers in these regions, such as missionaries, volunteers, or field researchers, are at risk. Did You Know... Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Transmission of onchocerciasis Onchocerciasis is spread though the bite of female blackflies that breed in swiftly flowing streams (hence, the term river blindness). The cycle of infection begins when a blackfly bites an infected person and the fly is infected with immature forms of the worm called microfilariae. The microfilariae develop into larvae in the fly. When the fly bites another person, larvae are passed into that person’s skin. The larvae move under the skin and form lumps (nodules), where they develop into adult worms in 12 to 18 months. Adult female worms may live up to 15 years in these nodules. After mating, mature female worms produce eggs, which develop into microfilariae that leave the worm. A worm may produce 1,000 microfilariae each day. Thousands of microfilariae move through the tissues of the skin and eyes and are responsible for the disease. Usually, many bites are necessary before the infection causes symptoms. Thus, the infection is much less likely to develop in visitors to affected areas. Because the infection is transmitted near rivers, many people avoid those areas. Not being able to live or to work near a river affects their ability to raise crops. Thus, onchocerciasis can contribute to food shortages in some areas. Symptoms of Onchocerciasis Onchocerciasis symptoms occur when the microfilariae die. Their death can cause intense itching, which may be the only symptom. A rash with redness may develop. Over time, the skin may thicken, roughen, and wrinkle. It may lose its elasticity and pigment in patchy spots. In severe cases, people may develop long folds of skin that hang down over their lower abdomen and upper thighs (\"hanging groin\"). Lymph nodes, including those in the genital area, may become inflamed and swollen. Lumps (nodules) containing adult worms form and may be seen or felt under the skin. Usually, these lumps do not cause symptoms. Effects on vision range from mild impairment (blurring) to complete blindness. The eye may become inflamed and appear red. Exposure to bright light may cause pain. Without treatment, the cornea may become completely opaque and may scar—the cause of blindness. Other structures in the eye, including the iris, pupil, and retina, may be affected. The optic nerve may become inflamed and degenerate. If people become blind, they may become unable to work and provide for their family, and their life span may be decreased. Diagnosis of Onchocerciasis Examination of a sample of skin Usually to diagnose onchocerciasis, a sample of skin is removed and examined for microfilariae.

Blood tests to check for evidence of the infection may be done, but these tests are not always reliable or available. Nodules can be removed and checked for adult worms, but this procedure is rarely necessary. Prevention of Onchocerciasis The following may help reduce the chances of being bitten by a blackfly and thus reduce the risk of onchocerciasis: Avoiding fly-infested areas Wearing protective clothing Liberally using insect repellents Ivermectin given once or twice a year dramatically reduces the number of microfilariae, prevents the development of further disease, and helps control the infection in people who are repeatedly exposed to it. This community-based preventive approach has been used in areas where onchocerciasis is common. Treatment of Onchocerciasis Ivermectin Sometimes doxycycline For treatment of onchocerciasis, ivermectin is given as a single dose by mouth and is repeated every 6 to 12 months until symptoms are gone. Ivermectin kills microfilariae, reducing the number of microfilariae in the skin and eyes. It reduces production of microfilariae by adult worms for several months. It does not kill adult worms, but repeated doses decrease their fertility. If people with onchocerciasis live in areas of Africa where Loa loa is transmitted, doctors check them for loiasis Loiasis Loiasis is infection of tissues under the skin or under the clear outer membrane that covers the eye (conjunctiva) with the roundworm Loa loa.

Sometimes doctors also treat onchocerciasis with doxycycline (an antibiotic), given for 6 weeks. Doxycycline kills bacteria that live inside the worms and that are essential to the worms' survival. As a result, many of the adult female worms die, and others produce fewer or no microfilariae. Side effects are usually mild. In the past, nodules were surgically removed, but this treatment has been replaced by ivermectin.

Symptoms and signs include itching and burning of the eyelid margins with redness and edema. Diagnosis is by history and examination. Acute ulcerative blepharitis is usually treated with topical antibiotics or systemic antivirals. Acute nonulcerative blepharitis is occasionally treated with topical corticosteroids. Chronic disease is treated with tear supplements, warm compresses, and occasionally oral antibiotics (eg, a tetracycline or azithromycin) for meibomian gland dysfunction or with eyelid hygiene and tear supplements for seborrheic blepharitis. Etiology of Blepharitis Blepharitis may be acute (ulcerative or nonulcerative) or chronic (meibomian gland dysfunction, seborrheic blepharitis). Acute blepharitis Acute ulcerative blepharitis is usually caused by bacterial infection (usually staphylococcal) of the eyelid margin at the origins of the eyelashes; the lash follicles and the meibomian glands are also involved. It may also be due to a virus (eg, herpes simplex, varicella zoster). Bacterial infections typically have more crusting than the viral type, which usually has more of a clear serous discharge. Acute nonulcerative blepharitis is usually caused by an allergic reaction involving the same area, eg, atopic blepharodermatitis and seasonal allergic blepharoconjunctivitis, which cause Intense itching and inflammation (usually along the edges of both eyelids); Rubbing (a response to itching that can increase conjunctival itching and exacerbate atopic dermatitis [eczema] of the eyelid); or Contact sensitivity (dermatoblepharoconjunctivitis) Chronic blepharitis Chronic blepharitis is noninfectious inflammation of unknown cause. Meibomian glands in the eyelid produce lipids (meibum) that reduce tear evaporation by forming a lipid layer on top of the aqueous tear layer. In meibomian gland dysfunction, the lipid composition is abnormal, and gland ducts and orifices become inspissated with hard, waxy plugs.

Symptoms and Signs of Blepharitis Symptoms common to all forms of blepharitis include itching and burning of the eyelid margins and conjunctival irritation with lacrimation, photosensitivity, and foreign body sensation. Symptoms tend to be worse in the early morning than those of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which tend to be worse toward the end of the day. Acute blepharitis In acute ulcerative blepharitis, small pustules may develop in eyelash follicles and eventually break down to form shallow marginal ulcers. Tenacious adherent crusts leave a bleeding surface when removed. During sleep, eyelids can become glued together by dried secretions. Recurrent ulcerative blepharitis can cause eyelid scars and loss or misdirection (trichiasis Trichiasis Trichiasis is an anatomic misalignment of eyelashes, which rub against the eyeball, in a patient with no entropion. Trichiasis is most often idiopathic, but known causes include blepharitis... read more ) of eyelashes. In acute nonulcerative blepharitis, eyelid margins become edematous and erythematous; eyelashes may become crusted with dried serous fluid. Chronic blepharitis In meibomian gland dysfunction, examination reveals dilated, inspissated gland orifices that, when pressed, exude a waxy, thick, yellowish secretion.

Chronic blepharitis that does not respond to treatment may require biopsy to exclude eyelid tumors or immune-mediated conditions that can simulate the condition. Prognosis for Blepharitis Acute blepharitis most often responds to treatment but may recur, develop into chronic blepharitis, or both. Chronic blepharitis is indolent, recurrent, and resistant to treatment. Exacerbations are inconvenient, uncomfortable, and cosmetically unappealing but do not usually result in corneal scarring or vision loss. Treatment of Blepharitis Antimicrobials for acute ulcerative blepharitis; warm compresses and sometimes topical corticosteroids for acute nonulcerative blepharitis For chronic blepharitis, treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, warm compresses, cleansing of eyelids, and sometimes topical or systemic antibiotics as clinically indicated Acute blepharitis Acute ulcerative blepharitis is treated with an antibiotic ointment (eg, bacitracin/polymyxin B, erythromycin, or gentamicin 0.3% 4 times a day for 7 to 10 days). Acute viral ulcerative blepharitis is treated with systemic antivirals (eg, for herpes simplex, acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times a day for 7 days; for varicella zoster, famciclovir 500 mg orally 3 times a day or valacyclovir 1 g orally 3 times a day for 7 days). Treatment of acute nonulcerative blepharitis begins with avoiding the offending action (eg, rubbing) or substance (eg, new eye drops). Warm compresses over the closed eyelid may relieve symptoms and speed resolution. If swelling persists > 24 hours, topical corticosteroids (eg, fluorometholone ophthalmic ointment 0.1% 3 times a day for 7 days) can be used.

Tear supplements during the day, bland ointments at night, and, if necessary, punctal plugs (inserts that obstruct the puncta and thus decrease tear drainage) are effective in most patients. If needed, additional treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction includes warm compresses to melt the waxy plugs and occasionally eyelid massage to extrude trapped secretions and coat the ocular surface. If needed, additional treatment for seborrheic blepharitis includes gentle cleansing of the eyelid margin (lid scrubs) twice a day with a cotton swab dipped in a dilute solution of baby shampoo (2 to 3 drops in ½ cup of warm water) or with commercially available wipes and washes that contain ingredients such as a gentle eyelid cleanser, tea tree and coconut oils, or hypochlorous acid 0.01%. A topical antibiotic ointment (erythromycin, bacitracin/polymyxin B or drops such as azithromycin 1.0% or 1.5% or sulfacetamide 10% twice a day for up to 3 months) may be added to reduce bacterial counts on the eyelid margin when cases are unresponsive to weeks of eyelid hygiene. In some cases, oral azithromycin 500 mg per day for 3 days in three cycles with 7-day intervals or a tetracycline (eg, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day tapered over 3 to 4 months) may also be effective because it changes the composition of meibomian gland secretions or alters the composition of skin bacteria. Key Points Common forms of blepharitis include acute ulcerative (often secondary to staphylococcal or herpes virus infection), acute nonulcerative (usually allergic), and chronic (often with meibomian gland dysfunction or seborrheic dermatitis). Secondary keratoconjunctivitis sicca usually accompanies chronic blepharitis. Common symptoms include itching and burning of the eyelid margins and conjunctival irritation with lacrimation, photosensitivity, and foreign body sensation. Diagnosis is usually by slit-lamp examination. Consider alternate diagnoses, including eyelid carcinoma, if chronic blepharitis is unilateral. Supportive treatments are indicated (eg, warm compresses, eyelid cleansing, and treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca as needed). Specific drug treatments can include topical antimicrobials for acute ulcerative blepharitis, systemic antivirals if viral infection is suspected, and topical corticosteroids for persistent acute nonulcerative blepharitis. Treatment of chronic blepharitis includes treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca with tear supplements and, as-needed use of warm compresses and topical or systemic antibiotics.

Acute otitis media often occurs in people with a cold or allergies. The infected ear is painful. Doctors examine the eardrum to make the diagnosis. Certain routine childhood vaccinations can reduce the risk of acute otitis media. The infection is sometimes treated with antibiotics. Acute otitis media (AOM) results from infection by viruses or bacteria, often as a complication of the common cold or of allergies. Although acute otitis media can occur at any age, it is most common between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. Acute otitis media often occurs during this age range because structures in the middle ear, such as the eustachian tube The Eustachian Tube: Keeping Air Pressure Equal , are immature and not functioning properly. Symptoms and treatment are similar in adults and older children (for acute otitis media in younger children, see Acute Middle Ear Infection in Children Acute Middle Ear Infection in Children Acute middle ear infection is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, usually accompanying a cold.

Symptoms of Acute Otitis Media In people with acute otitis media, the infected ear is painful (see Earache Earache Earache usually occurs in only one ear. Some people also have ear discharge or, rarely, hearing loss. Ear pain may be due to a disorder within the ear itself or a disorder in a nearby body part... Common.TooltipReadMore ), with a red, bulging eardrum. Many people have hearing loss. Infants may simply be cranky or have difficulty sleeping. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea often occur in young children. The bulging eardrum sometimes ruptures, causing pus to drain from the ear, sometimes with relief of ear pain. If the infection spreads, people may have a severe headache, confusion, or impaired brain function. Diagnosis of Acute Otitis Media A doctor's evaluation Doctors use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and eardrum. This examination shows pus is present in the middle ear behind the eardrum. Prevention of Acute Otitis Media The risk of acute otitis media can be reduced by routine childhood vaccinations Childhood Vaccination Schedule Most doctors follow the vaccination schedule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC—see the schedule for infants and children and the schedule for older children... Common.TooltipReadMore against pneumococci (with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB), and influenza (flu). Infants should not sleep with a bottle because this makes it easy for liquid to run through the eustachian tube into the middle ear. Secondhand smoke may increase the risk, so people should not smoke, especially in the house or around children. Recurrent acute otitis media may be prevented by the insertion of drainage tubes (tympanostomy tubes). Ear Tubes VIDEO Treatment of Acute Otitis Media Pain relievers Antibiotics if needed Most people with acute otitis media get better without treatment. However, because it is hard to predict whose symptoms will not lessen, some doctors treat all people with antibiotics, such as amoxicillin. Other doctors may give antibiotics only if the illness is severe or if symptoms do not lessen after 72 hours. Some experts say that older children or children aged 6 to 23 months who have acute otitis media in only one ear and that is not severe can start treatment with or without antibiotics. If antibiotics are withheld, they are given if the child is worse or does not feel better by the time 48 to 72 hours have passed since symptoms began. Pain relief is important. Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can relieve pain. Adults may be given decongestant nasal sprays containing phenylephrine or decongestants taken by mouth such as pseudoephedrine. Antihistamines are useful for people who have allergies but not for those with colds. Decongestants and antihistamines are not helpful for children and may cause bothersome and possibly dangerous side effects, particularly in children younger than 2 years. If a person has severe or persistent pain and fever, and the eardrum is bulging, a doctor may perform a myringotomy, in which an opening is made through the eardrum to allow fluid to drain from the middle ear. The opening, which does not affect hearing, usually heals without treatment. People who have repeated bouts of otitis media may need to have drainage tubes (tympanostomy tubes) placed in their eardrums (see figure Myringotomy Myringotomy: Treating Recurring Ear Infections ). Myringotomy: Treating Recurring Ear Infections During a myringotomy, doctors make a small opening in the eardrum to allow fluid to drain from the middle ear. Then they place a tiny, hollow plastic or metal tube (tympanostomy tube, or ventilating tube) in the eardrum through the opening. These tubes balance the pressure in the environment with that in the middle ear. Doctors recommend ventilating tubes for some children who have had recurring ear infections (acute otitis media) or recurring or persistent collections of fluid in their middle ears (chronic secretory otitis media). Placement of ventilating tubes is a common surgical procedure that is done in a hospital or doctor’s office. General anesthesia or sedation is usually required. After the procedure, children usually go home within a few hours. Antibiotic ear drops are sometimes given after the procedure for about a week. The tubes usually come out on their own after about 6 to 12 months, but some types stay in longer. Tubes that do not come out on their own are removed by the doctor, sometimes under general anesthesia or sedation. If the opening does not close on its own, it may need to be closed surgically. Children with ventilating tubes may wash their hair and go swimming, but some doctors recommend children do not submerge their head in deep water without using earplugs. Drainage of fluid from the ears indicates an infection, and the doctor should be notified.

IADLs enable people to live independently and include preparing meals, doing housework, taking drugs, going on errands, managing finances, and using a telephone. Physical health: History and physical examination should include problems common among older people (eg, problems with vision, hearing, continence, gait, and balance). Cognition and mental health: Several validated screening tests for cognitive dysfunction (eg, mental status examination Examination of Mental Status ) and for depression (eg, Geriatric Depression Scale Geriatric Depression Scale (Short Form) , Hamilton Depression Scale) can be used. Socioenvironmental situation: The patient’s social interaction network, available social support resources, special needs, and the safety and convenience of the patient’s environment are determined, often by a nurse or social worker. Such factors influence the treatment approach used. A checklist can be used to assess home safety. Standardized instruments make evaluation of these domains more reliable and efficient (see table A Geriatric Assessment Instrument A Geriatric Assessment Instrument ).

Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders (eg, infection, myocardial infarction, trauma, tumors, metabolic disorders) but is often idiopathic. Symptoms include chest pain or tightness, often worsened by deep breathing. Cardiac output may be greatly reduced if cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis develops. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, and evidence of pericardial fluid accumulation on x-ray or echocardiogram. Finding the cause requires further evaluation. Treatment depends on the cause, but general measures include analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and rarely surgery. Pericarditis is the most common pericardial disorder. Congenital pericardial disorders are rare. Anatomy in Pericarditis The pericardium has 2 layers. The visceral pericardium is a single layer of mesothelial cells that is attached to the myocardium, folds back (reflects) on itself over the origin of the great vessels, and joins with a tough, fibrous layer to envelop the heart as the parietal pericardium. The sac created by these layers contains a small amount of fluid (< 25 to 50 mL), composed mostly of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. The pericardium limits distention of the cardiac chambers and increases the heart’s efficiency. The pericardium is richly innervated with sympathetic and somatic afferents. Stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors sense changes in cardiac volume and tension and may be responsible for transmitting pericardial pain. The phrenic nerves are embedded in the parietal pericardium and are vulnerable to injury during surgery on the pericardium. Pathophysiology of Pericarditis Pericarditis may be Acute Subacute Chronic Acute pericarditis develops quickly, causing inflammation of the pericardial sac and often a pericardial effusion. Inflammation can extend to the epicardial myocardium (myopericarditis). Adverse hemodynamic effects and rhythm disturbance are rare, although cardiac tamponade is possible. Acute disease may resolve completely, resolve and reoccur (up to 30% of acute cases) or become subacute or chronic. These forms develop more slowly; their prominent feature is effusion. Subacute pericarditis occurs within weeks to months of an inciting event. Chronic pericarditis is defined as pericarditis persisting > 6 months. Pericardial effusion is accumulation of fluid in the pericardium. The fluid may be serous fluid (sometimes with fibrin strands), serosanguineous fluid, blood, pus, or chyle. Cardiac tamponade occurs when a large pericardial effusion impairs cardiac filling, leading to low cardiac output and sometimes shock and death. If fluid (usually blood) accumulates rapidly, even small amounts (eg, 150 mL) may cause tamponade because the pericardium cannot stretch quickly enough to accommodate it. Slow accumulation of up to 1500 mL may not cause tamponade. Loculated effusion may cause localized tamponade on the right or left side of the heart. Occasionally, pericarditis causes a marked thickening and stiffening of the pericardium (constrictive pericarditis). Constrictive pericarditis, which is now less common than in the past, results from marked inflammatory, fibrotic thickening of the pericardium. Sometimes the visceral and parietal layers adhere to each other or to the myocardium. The fibrotic tissue often contains calcium deposits. The stiff, thickened pericardium markedly impairs ventricular filling, decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output. Significant pericardial fluid accumulation is rare. Rhythm disturbance is common. The diastolic pressures in the ventricles, atria, and venous beds become virtually the same. Systemic venous congestion occurs, causing considerable transudation of fluid from systemic capillaries, with dependent edema and, later, ascites. Chronic elevation of systemic venous pressure and hepatic venous pressure may lead to liver scarring, called cardiac cirrhosis, in which case, patients may initially present for evaluation of cirrhosis Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal hepatic architecture.

Often, the cause cannot be identified (called nonspecific or idiopathic pericarditis), but many of these cases are probably viral. Acute myocardial infarction causes 10 to 15% of cases of acute pericarditis. Post-myocardial infarction syndrome (Dressler syndrome) is a less common cause now, occurring mainly when reperfusion with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or thrombolytic drugs is ineffective in patients with transmural infarction. Pericarditis occurs after pericardiotomy (called postpericardiotomy syndrome) in 5 to 30% of cardiac operations. Postpericardiotomy syndrome, post-MI syndrome, and traumatic pericarditis comprise the post-cardiac injury syndrome. Table Subacute pericarditis is a prolongation of acute pericarditis and thus has the same causes. Some patients have transient constriction occurring days to weeks after recovery from acute pericarditis. Chronic pericarditis with pericardial effusion or chronic constrictive pericarditis may follow acute pericarditis of almost any etiology. In addition, some cases occur without antecedent acute pericarditis. Chronic pericarditis with large effusion (serous, serosanguineous, or bloody) is most commonly caused by metastatic tumors, most often by lung carcinoma Lung Carcinoma Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Cholesterol pericarditis is a rare disorder that may be associated with myxedema, in which a chronic pericardial effusion has a high level of cholesterol that triggers inflammation and pericarditis. Sometimes no cause of chronic pericarditis is identified. Transient constrictive pericarditis is most commonly caused by infection or postpericardiotomy inflammation or is idiopathic. Fibrosis of the pericardium, sometimes leading to chronic constrictive pericarditis, may follow purulent pericarditis or accompany a connective tissue disorder. In older patients, common causes are malignant tumors, MI, and tuberculosis. Hemopericardium (accumulation of blood within the pericardium) may lead to pericarditis or pericardial fibrosis; common causes include chest trauma, iatrogenic injury (eg, resulting from cardiac catheterization, pacemaker insertion, central venous line placement), and rupture of a thoracic aortic aneurysm Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms A thoracic aortic diameter ≥ 50% larger than normal is considered an aneurysm (normal diameter varies by location). Most thoracic aortic aneurysms do not cause symptoms, although some patients... read more . Symptoms and Signs of Pericarditis Some patients present with symptoms and signs of inflammation (acute pericarditis); others present with those of fluid accumulation (pericardial effusion) or constriction. Symptoms and signs vary depending on the severity of inflammation and the amount and rate of fluid accumulation. Even a large amount of pericardial fluid may be asymptomatic if it develops slowly (eg, over months). Acute pericarditis Acute pericarditis tends to cause chest pain, fever, and a pericardial rub, sometimes with dyspnea. The first evidence can be tamponade, with hypotension, shock, or pulmonary edema. Because the innervation of the pericardium and myocardium is the same, the chest pain of pericarditis is sometimes similar to that of myocardial inflammation or ischemia: Dull or sharp precordial or substernal pain may radiate to the neck, trapezius ridge (especially the left), or shoulders. Pain ranges from mild to severe. Unlike ischemic chest pain, pain due to pericarditis is usually aggravated by thoracic motion, cough, breathing, or swallowing food; it may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Tachypnea and nonproductive cough may be present; fever, chills, and weakness are common. In 15 to 25% of patients with idiopathic pericarditis, symptoms recur intermittently for months or years (recurrent pericarditis). The most important physical finding is a triphasic or a systolic and diastolic precordial friction rub. However, the rub is often intermittent and evanescent; it may be present only during systole or, less frequently, only during diastole. If no rub is heard with the patient seated and leaning forward, auscultation may be attempted by listening with the diaphragm of the stethoscope while with the patient is on all fours. Sometimes, a pleural component to the rub is noted during breathing, which is due to inflammation of the pleura adjacent to the pericardium. Pericardial effusion Pericardial effusion is often painless, but when it occurs with acute pericarditis, pain may be present. Considerable amounts of pericardial fluid may muffle heart sounds, increase the area of cardiac dullness, and change the size and shape of the cardiac silhouette. A pericardial rub may be heard. With large effusions, compression of the base of the left lung can decrease breath sounds (heard near the left scapula) and cause crackles. Arterial pulse, jugular venous pulse, and blood pressure are normal unless intrapericardial pressure increases substantially, causing tamponade. In the post-MI syndrome, pericardial effusion can occur with fever, friction rub, pleurisy, pleural effusions, and joint pain. This syndrome usually occurs within 10 days to 2 months after MI. It is usually mild but may be severe. Occasionally, the heart ruptures post-MI, causing hemopericardium and tamponade, usually 1 to 10 days post-MI and more commonly in women. Cardiac tamponade (See also Cardiac tamponade due to trauma Cardiac Tamponade Cardiac tamponade is accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac of sufficient volume and pressure to impair cardiac filling. Patients typically have hypotension, muffled heart tones, and distended... read more .) The clinical findings are similar to those of cardiogenic shock: decreased cardiac output, low systemic arterial pressure, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Neck veins are markedly dilated. Severe cardiac tamponade is nearly always accompanied by a fall of > 10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus Pulsus paradoxus Complete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiac disorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart.

Loculated effusions and eccentric or localized hematoma may cause localized tamponade, in which only selected cardiac chambers are compressed. In these cases, physical, hemodynamic, and some echocardiographic signs may be absent. Constrictive pericarditis Fibrosis or calcification rarely causes symptoms unless constrictive pericarditis develops. The only early abnormalities may be elevated ventricular diastolic, atrial, pulmonary, and systemic venous pressures. Symptoms and signs of peripheral venous congestion (eg, peripheral edema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly) may appear with an early diastolic sound (pericardial knock), often best heard during inspiration. This sound is due to abrupt slowing of diastolic ventricular filling by the rigid pericardium. Ventricular systolic function (based on ejection fraction) is usually preserved. Prolonged elevation of pulmonary venous pressure results in dyspnea (particularly during exertion) and orthopnea. Fatigue may be severe. Distention of neck veins with a rise in venous pressure during inspiration (Kussmaul sign) is present; it is absent in tamponade. Pulsus paradoxus is rare and is usually less severe than in tamponade. Lungs are not congested unless severe left ventricular constriction develops.

Blood tests may detect leukocytosis and elevated markers of inflammation (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), which may be used to guide duration of therapy. Acute pericarditis The diagnosis is based on the presence of the following clinical findings and ECG abnormalities, which are not always present in all cases. Characteristic chest pain Pericardial rub ECG abnormalities Pericardial effusion Serial ECGs may be needed to show abnormalities. The ECG in acute pericarditis may show abnormalities confined to ST and PR segments and T waves, usually in most leads. (ECG changes in lead aVR are generally in the opposite direction of other leads.) Unlike MI, acute pericarditis does not cause reciprocal depression in ST segments (except in leads aVR and V1), and there are no pathologic Q waves. ECG changes in pericarditis can occur in 4 stages although not all stages are present in all cases. Stage 1: ST segments show upward concave elevation; the PR segments may be depressed (see figure Acute pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG Acute pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG ). Stage 2: ST segments return to baseline; T waves flatten. Stage 3: T waves are inverted throughout the ECG; T wave–inversion occurs after the ST segment has returned to baseline and thus differs from the pattern of acute ischemia or MI. Stage 4: T wave changes resolve. Echocardiography in acute pericarditis typically shows an effusion, which helps confirm the diagnosis, except in patients with purely fibrinous acute pericarditis in whom echocardiography is often normal. Findings indicating myocardial involvement include new focal or diffuse left ventricular dysfunction. MRI can detect the presence, severity, and acuity of pericardial inflammation but is generally not required to diagnose acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG J points, except aVR and V1, are elevated. T waves are essentially normal. ST segments show upward concave elevation. PR segments, except aVR and V1, are depressed. PR deviations are commonly absent in one limb lead (here, aVL). Because the pain of pericarditis may resemble that of acute MI or pulmonary infarction, additional tests (eg, serum cardiac marker measurement, lung scan) may be required if the history and ECG findings are atypical for pericarditis. Troponin is often elevated in acute pericarditis due to epicardial inflammation, so it cannot discriminate between pericarditis, acute infarction, and pulmonary embolism. Very high levels of troponin may indicate myopericarditis. The CK-MB (creatine kinase muscle band isoenzyme) level, which is less sensitive than the troponin level, is usually normal in acute pericarditis unless myocarditis is also present. Postpericardiotomy and post-MI syndromes may be difficult to identify and must be distinguished from recent MI, pulmonary embolism, and pericardial infection after surgery. Pain, friction rub, and fever appearing 2 weeks to several months after surgery and a rapid response to aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids aids diagnosis. Pericardial effusion Diagnosis is suggested by clinical findings but often is suspected only after finding an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. On ECG, QRS voltage is often decreased, and sinus rhythm remains in about 90% of patients. With large, chronic effusions, the ECG may show electrical alternans (ie, P, QRS, or T wave amplitude increases and decreases on alternate beats). Electrical alternans is associated with variation in cardiac position (swinging heart). Echocardiography estimates the volume of pericardial fluid; identifies cardiac tamponade, sometimes acute myocarditis, and/or heart failure; and may suggest the cause of pericarditis. Although CT can detect a pericardial effusion (often incidentally on a scan done for other conditions), it may overestimate its size and is not a first-line test to evaluate possible pericardial effusion. Patients with a normal ECG, small (< 50 mL) effusion, and no suspicious findings from the history and examination may be observed with serial examination and echocardiography. Other patients must be evaluated further to determine etiology. Constrictive pericarditis Diagnosis may be suspected based on clinical, ECG, chest x-ray, and Doppler echocardiography findings, but cardiac catheterization and CT (or MRI) are usually required.

When the right and left ventricular filling pressures are equally elevated, Doppler echocardiography helps distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by noncompliant ventricular walls that resist diastolic filling; one (most commonly the left) or both ventricles may be affected. Symptoms include... read more . During inspiration, mitral diastolic flow velocity usually falls > 25% in constrictive pericarditis but < 15% in restrictive cardiomyopathy. In constrictive pericarditis, inspiratory tricuspid flow velocity increases more than it normally does, but it does not do so in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Determining tissue velocities at the mitral annulus may be helpful when excessively high left atrial pressure blunts respiratory variation in transvalvular velocities. Mitral annular velocities (especially at the septal location) increase in constrictive pericarditis; they decrease in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Presence of a septal bounce (shift of the interventricular septum towards the left ventricle during inspiration and away from the left ventricle during expiration) and hepatic vein expiratory diastolic flow reversal (which occurs due to reduced filling of the right ventricle) can also be visible in constrictive pericarditis. Respiration-related ventricular septal shift, preserved or increased medial annular velocity, and hepatic vein expiratory diastolic flow reversal collectively are referred to as the Mayo criteria, but each factor is independently associated with constrictive pericarditis (1 Diagnosis reference Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation in the pericardial space.

Cardiac catheterization... read more , right and left sided, is done if clinical and echocardiographic findings suggest constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac catheterization helps confirm and quantify the abnormal hemodynamics that define constrictive pericarditis: Mean pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and mean right atrial pressure are roughly equal, all at about 10 to 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary artery and right ventricular systolic pressures are normal or modestly elevated, so that pulse pressures are small. In the atrial pressure curve, x and y descents are typically accentuated. In the ventricular pressure curve, a diastolic dip occurs at the time of rapid ventricular filling. During peak inspiration, right ventricular pressure increases when left ventricular pressure is lowest (sometimes called mirror-image discordance, suggesting increased ventricular interdependence). Because ventricular filling is restricted, ventricular pressure tracings show a sudden dip followed by a plateau (resembling a square root sign) in early diastole. Measuring these changes requires simultaneous right and left heart cardiac catheterization, using separate transducers. These hemodynamic changes almost always occur with significant constrictive pericarditis but may be masked during hypovolemia. Right ventricular systolic pressure of > 50 mm Hg often occurs in restrictive cardiomyopathy but less often in constrictive pericarditis. When the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure equals the right atrial mean pressure and an early diastolic dip in the ventricular pressure curve occurs with large x and y waves in the right atrial curve, either disorder may be present. CT or MRI can identify pericardial thickening > 5 mm. Pericardial thickening > 5-mm, with typical hemodynamic changes (assessed by echocardiography and catheterization), can confirm constrictive pericarditis. When no pericardial thickening or fluid is seen, the diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy is favored but not proved. A normal pericardial thickness does not exclude constrictive pericarditis. Increased T2-weighted short TI inversion recovery (STIR) signal and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI can document active inflammation and resolution of constriction in response to anti-inflammatory therapy, whereas their absence suggests chronic constrictive pericarditis that is unlikely to be responsive to medical therapy. The degree of late gadolinium enhancement of the pericardium may be especially helpful in identifying patients in whom constriction will reverse or resolve. Cardiac tamponade Low voltage and electrical alternans on the ECG suggest cardiac tamponade, but these findings lack sensitivity and specificity. When tamponade is suspected, echocardiography is done unless even a brief delay might be life threatening. Then pericardiocentesis is done immediately for diagnosis and treatment. Echocardiographic findings that support tamponade include the following: Respiratory variation of transvalvular and venous flows Compression or collapse of right cardiac chambers in the presence of a pericardial effusion Inferior vena caval plethora (decrease in the proximal venal caval diameter by < 50% during deep inspiration) However, cardiac tamponade is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Pearls & Pitfalls Significant cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis; echocardiographic findings alone are not an indication for pericardiocentesis. If tamponade is suspected but not yet confirmed (eg, by clinical findings and echocardiography), right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterization may be done. In cardiac tamponade: There is no early diastolic dip in the ventricular pressure record. Diastolic pressures are elevated (about 10 to 30 mm Hg) and equal in all cardiac chambers and in the pulmonary artery. In the atrial pressure curve, x descent is preserved and y descent is lost. In contrast, in severe congestive states due to dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary artery occlusion or left ventricular diastolic pressure usually exceeds right atrial mean pressure and right ventricular diastolic pressure by ≥ 4 mm Hg. Right heart catheterization should be considered particularly when draining an effusion, not only to confirm tamponade, but also to uncover possible constrictive pericarditis with effusion. Diagnosis of cause After pericarditis is diagnosed, tests to determine etiology and the effect on cardiac function are done. In a young, previously healthy adult who presents with a viral infection and acute pericarditis, an extensive evaluation is usually unnecessary. Differentiating viral from idiopathic pericarditis is difficult, expensive, and generally of little practical importance. In other cases, a biopsy of pericardial tissue or aspiration of pericardial fluid may be needed to establish a diagnosis. Acid-fast stains and cultures of pericardial fluid are essential if tuberculosis (TB) is considered possible (TB pericarditis can be aggressive and can worsen rapidly with corticosteroid therapy). Samples are examined for malignant cells. However, complete drainage of a newly identified pericardial effusion is usually unnecessary for diagnosis. Persistent (usually > 3 months) or progressive effusion, particularly when the etiology is uncertain, also warrants pericardiocentesis. The choice between needle pericardiocentesis and surgical drainage depends on institutional resources and physician experience, the etiology of the effusion, the need for diagnostic tissue samples, and the prognosis of the patient. Needle pericardiocentesis is often best when the etiology is known or the presence of tamponade is in question. Surgical drainage is best when the presence of tamponade is certain but (because pericardial biopsy can be done surgically) the etiology is unclear. Laboratory tests of pericardial fluid other than culture and cytology are usually nonspecific. But specific diagnoses are sometimes possible using newer visual, cytologic, and immunologic analysis of fluid obtained via pericardioscopic-guided biopsy. Cardiac catheterization may be useful for evaluating pericarditis and identifying the cause of reduced cardiac function. CT or MRI can help identify metastases, although echocardiography is usually sufficient. Other tests include complete blood count, acute-phase reactants, routine chemistry tests, cultures, autoimmune tests, and, when appropriate, tests for HIV, histoplasmosis complement fixation (in endemic areas), and antibody tests for coxsackievirus, influenza virus, echovirus, and streptococcus. Anti-DNA and anti-RNA antibody tests may be useful. A tuberculin skin test (usually PPD) or Interferon gamma Release Assay is done, but they can give false negative results; TB pericarditis can be ruled out only by culture of pericardial fluid for acid-fast bacilli. Diagnosis reference 1. Welch TD, Ling LH, Espinosa RE, et al: Echocardiographic diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis: Mayo Clinic criteria. Circ Cardiovasc Imaging 7:526, 2014. Treatment of Pericarditis Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and, infrequently, corticosteroids for pain and inflammation. Pericardiocentesis for tamponade and some large effusions Sometimes intrapericardial drugs (eg, triamcinolone) Sometimes pericardial resection for constrictive pericarditis, particularly when symptomatic Treatment of underlying cause (eg, cancer) Hospitalization is warranted for some patients with an initial episode of acute pericarditis, particularly those with moderate or large effusions or with high-risk features, such as elevated temperature, subacute onset, immunosuppression, recent trauma, oral anticoagulant therapy, failure to respond to an initial course of aspirin or NSAIDs, and myopericarditis. Hospitalization is needed to determine etiology and to observe for the development of cardiac tamponade. Close, early follow-up is important in patients who are not hospitalized. Possible causative drugs (eg, anticoagulants, procainamide, phenytoin) are stopped. For cardiac tamponade, immediate pericardiocentesis (see figure Pericardiocentesis Pericardiocentesis ) is done; removal of even a small volume of fluid may be lifesaving. Ultrasound-Guided Pericardiocentesis VIDEO Pericardiocentesis Except in emergencies (eg, cardiac tamponade), pericardiocentesis, a potentially lethal procedure, should be done using echocardiographic guidance in a cardiac catheterization laboratory and should be supervised by a cardiologist or thoracic surgeon if possible. Resuscitation equipment must be at hand. IV sedation (eg, morphine 0.1 mg/kg or fentanyl 25 to 50 μg plus midazolam 3 to 5 mg) is desirable. The patient should be recumbent, with the head elevated 30° from the horizontal. Under aseptic conditions, the skin and subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated with lidocaine. A 75-mm short-beveled, 16-gauge needle is attached via a 3-way stopcock to a 30- or 50-mL syringe. The pericardium may be entered via the right or left xiphocostal angle or from the tip of the xiphoid process with the needle directed inward, upward, and close to the chest wall. The needle is advanced with constant suction applied to the syringe. Echocardiography may be used to guide the needle as agitated saline is injected through it. Echocardiography is also increasingly used to identify the optimal puncture site and the needle trajectory. Once in place, the needle should be clamped next to the skin to prevent it from entering further than necessary and possibly puncturing the heart or injuring a coronary vessel. ECG monitoring is essential for detecting arrhythmias produced when the myocardium is touched or punctured. As a rule, right atrial pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) are monitored. Fluid is withdrawn until intrapericardial pressure falls below right atrial pressure, usually to subatmospheric levels. If continued drainage is needed, a plastic catheter may be passed through the needle into the pericardium and the needle withdrawn. The catheter may be left in place for 2 to 4 days. Pain can usually be controlled with colchicine or aspirin 325 to 650 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours or other NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours). The intensity of therapy is dictated by the patient’s distress. Severe pain may require opioids. Colchicine 0.5 to 1 mg orally once a day for 3 months as an adjunct significantly decreases the recurrence rate and symptom persistence in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis and is increasingly being used as 1st-line therapy. Although most mild cases of idiopathic and viral pericarditis respond well within a week, the optimal duration of treatment is unclear. Typically, patients should be treated at least until any effusion and evidence of inflammation (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels) have resolved. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 to 80 mg orally once a day for 1 week, followed by rapid tapering of the dose) may be used in patients with speciﬁc indications (eg, connective tissue disorder, autoimmune or uremic pericarditis, failure to respond to colchicine or NSAIDs) but are not given routinely because they enhance viral multiplication and recurrence is common when the dosage is tapered; colchicine may be particularly useful during the taper. An alternative approach is the use of prednisone at a lower dose (0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg orally once a day) for 2 to 4 weeks followed by a slow taper over ~ 3 months. Tuberculous and pyogenic pericarditis should be excluded before corticosteroid therapy is initiated. Intrapericardial instillation of triamcinolone 300 mg/m2 avoids systemic adverse effects and is highly effective but is typically reserved for patients with recurrent or refractory disease. Anticoagulants are usually contraindicated in acute pericarditis because they may cause intrapericardial bleeding and even fatal tamponade; however, they can be given in early pericarditis complicating acute MI. Uncommonly (eg, with chronic constrictive pericarditis), pericardial resection is required. Painful recurrences of acute pericarditis may respond to NSAIDs and/or colchicine 0.5 mg orally twice a day for 6 to 12 months with a gradual taper. If these drugs do not suffice, corticosteroids may be tried, presuming the cause is not infectious. Refractory cases have been treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonists (eg, anakinra, rilonacept). Infections are treated with specific antimicrobials. Complete drainage is often necessary. In postpericardiotomy syndrome, post-MI syndrome, or idiopathic pericarditis, antibiotics are not indicated. An NSAID at full doses may control pain and effusion. When required to control pain, fever, and effusion, prednisone (eg, 20 to 60 mg orally once a day) may be given for 3 to 4 days. If the response is satisfactory, the dose is gradually reduced, and the drug may be stopped in 7 to 14 days. But sometimes many months of treatment are needed. Beginning on postoperative day 3, colchicine 1 mg orally once a day for 30 days, after a 2 mg load may reduce the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome after cardiac surgery. Aspirin should be used when pericarditis occurs in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. For pericarditis due to rheumatic fever, another connective tissue disorder, or tumor, therapy is directed at the underlying process. For pericardial effusion due to trauma, surgery is sometimes required to repair the injury and remove blood from the pericardium. Pericarditis due to uremia may respond to increased frequency of hemodialysis, aspiration, or systemic or intrapericardial corticosteroids. Intrapericardial triamcinolone may be useful. Chronic effusions are best treated by treating the cause, if known. Recurrent or persistent symptomatic effusions may be treated with balloon pericardiotomy or a surgical pericardial window. Asymptomatic effusions of unknown cause may require only observation. Congestion in chronic constrictive pericarditis may be alleviated with salt restriction and diuretics. Digoxin is indicated only if atrial arrhythmias or ventricular systolic dysfunction is present. Patients with symptomatic constrictive pericarditis (eg, with dyspnea, unexplained weight gain, a new or increased pleural effusion, or ascites) and those with markers of chronic constriction (eg, cachexia, atrial fibrillation, hepatic dysfunction, pericardial calcification) usually require pericardial resection. However, patients with mild symptoms (because they derive little benefit), heavy calcification, or extensive myocardial damage may be poor surgical candidates. The mortality rate for pericardial resection may approach 40% in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV patients (see table New York Heart Association Classification of Heart Failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of Heart Failure ). Patients who have constrictive pericarditis due to irradiation or a connective tissue disorder are especially likely to have severe myocardial damage and may not benefit from pericardial resection. Patients with newly diagnosed constrictive pericarditis who are hemodynamically stable and without evidence of chronic constriction may be given a 3-month trial of anti-inflammatory drugs, rather than pericardiectomy. Patients with pericardial inflammation on MRI may also benefit from a trial of medical therapy first, rather than pericardiectomy. Key Points Patients with pericarditis may have symptoms and signs of pericardial inflammation and/or fluid accumulation (effusion). Electrocardiography and echocardiography are usually adequate for diagnosis, but right and left heart catheterization, CT, or MRI may be needed to diagnose constrictive pericarditis. Pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or colchicine; corticosteroids may be added for noninfectious causes. Effusions usually respond to treatment of the cause, but recurrent or persistently symptomatic effusions may require drainage (percutaneous or surgical). Symptomatic chronic constrictive pericarditis usually requires pericardial resection, although patients with early stage constrictive pericarditis can be treated with a trial of medical therapy first.

After developing in the bone marrow, undifferentiated B cells enter peripheral lymphoid tissues, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and gut (eg, Peyer patches). Here, they begin to differentiate into mature cells, each of which can respond to a limited number of antigens. After encountering the appropriate antigen, some B cells undergo clonal proliferation into plasma cells. Each clonal plasma cell line is committed to synthesizing one specific immunoglobulin antibody that consists of 2 identical heavy chains (gamma [γ], mu [μ], alpha [α], delta [δ], or epsilon [ε]) and 2 identical light chains (kappa [κ] or lambda [λ]).

Patients with mild or no fixed obstructions have better long-term outcomes than patients with associated severe fixed obstructions. Symptoms and Signs of Variant Angina Symptoms are anginal discomfort occurring mainly during rest, often at night, and only rarely and inconsistently during exertion (unless significant coronary artery obstruction is also present). Attacks tend to occur regularly at certain times of day. Diagnosis of Variant Angina Provocative testing with ergonovine or acetylcholine during angiography Diagnosis of variant angina is suspected if ST-segment elevation occurs during the attack. Between anginal attacks, the ECG may be normal or show a stable abnormal pattern. Confirmation is by provocative testing with ergonovine or acetylcholine, which may precipitate coronary artery spasm. Coronary artery spasm is identified by finding significant ST-segment elevation on ECG or by observation of a reversible spasm during cardiac catheterization. Testing is done most commonly in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Treatment of Variant Angina Calcium channel blockers Sublingual nitroglycerin Average survival at 5 years is 89 to 97%, but mortality risk is greater for patients with both variant angina and atherosclerotic coronary artery obstruction. Risk increases with increasing obstruction. Usually, sublingual nitroglycerin promptly relieves variant angina. Calcium channel blockers may effectively prevent symptoms. Theoretically, beta-blockers may exacerbate spasm by allowing unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction, but this effect has not been proven clinically. Oral drugs most commonly used are calcium channel blockers: Sustained-release diltiazem 120 to 540 mg once a day Sustained-release verapamil 120 to 480 mg once a day (dose must be reduced in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction) Amlodipine 5 to 10 mg once a day (dose must be reduced in older patients and in patients with hepatic dysfunction) Although all these drugs relieve symptoms, they do not appear to alter prognosis.

PID may include salpingitis, pelvic peritonitis, and pelvic abscesses and may cause lower abdominal discomfort (typically bilateral), dyspareunia, and marked tenderness on palpation of the abdomen, adnexa, or cervix. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is gonococcal (or chlamydial) perihepatitis that occurs predominantly in women and causes right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting, often mimicking biliary or hepatic disease. Rectal gonorrhea is usually asymptomatic. It occurs predominantly in men practicing receptive anal intercourse and can occur in women who participate in anal sex. Symptoms include rectal itching, a cloudy rectal discharge, bleeding, and constipation—all of varying severity. Examination with a proctoscope may detect erythema or mucopurulent exudate on the rectal wall. Gonococcal pharyngitis is usually asymptomatic but may cause sore throat. N. gonorrhoeae must be distinguished from N. meningitidis and other closely related organisms that are often present in the throat without causing symptoms or harm. Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), also called the arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, reflects bacteremia and typically manifests with fever, migratory pain or joint swelling (polyarthritis), and pustular skin lesions. In some patients, pain develops and tendons (eg, at the wrist or ankle) redden or swell. Skin lesions occur typically on the arms or legs, have a red base, and are small, slightly painful, and often pustular. Genital gonorrhea, the usual source of disseminated infection, may be asymptomatic. DGI can mimic other disorders that cause fever, skin lesions, and polyarthritis (eg, the prodrome of hepatitis B infection or meningococcemia); some of these other disorders (eg, reactive arthritis Reactive Arthritis Reactive arthritis is an acute spondyloarthropathy that often seems precipitated by an infection, usually genitourinary or gastrointestinal. Common manifestations include asymmetric arthritis... read more ) also cause genital symptoms. Gonococcal septic arthritis is a more localized form of DGI that results in a painful arthritis with effusion, usually of 1 or 2 large joints such as the knees, ankles, wrists, or elbows. Some patients present with or have a history of skin lesions of DGI. Onset is often acute, usually with fever, severe joint pain, and limitation of movement. Infected joints are swollen, and the overlying skin may be warm and red. Diagnosis of Gonorrhea Nucleic acid–based testing Gram staining and culture Gonorrhea is diagnosed when gonococci are detected via microscopic examination using a nucleic acid–based test, Gram stain, or culture of genital fluids, blood, or joint fluids (obtained by needle aspiration). Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) may be done on genital, rectal, or oral swabs and can detect both gonorrhea and chlamydial infection. NAATs further increase the sensitivity adequately to enable testing of urine samples in both sexes. Gram stain is sensitive and specific for gonorrhea in men with urethral discharge; gram-negative intracellular diplococci typically are seen. Gram stain is much less accurate for infections of the cervix, pharynx, and rectum and is not recommended for diagnosis at these sites. Meningococcal urethritis has been found as a cause of nongonococcal urethritis at some STI (sexually transmitted infection) centers in the US (1 Diagnosis reference Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It typically infects epithelia of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, or conjunctivae, causing irritation or pain and purulent... read more ). Neisseria meningitidis cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain and has similar colony morphology appearance on culture. The diagnosis of presumed gonococcal urethritis on the basis of Gram stain with gram-negative diplococci but negative NAAT for gonorrhea requires confirmation of the Neisseria species by culture. Culture is sensitive and specific, but because gonococci are fragile and fastidious, samples taken using a swab need to be rapidly plated on an appropriate medium (eg, modified Thayer-Martin) and transported to the laboratory in a carbon dioxide–containing environment. Blood and joint fluid samples should be sent to the laboratory with notification that gonococcal infection is suspected. Because NAATs have replaced culture in most laboratories, finding a laboratory that can provide culture and sensitivity testing may be difficult and require consultation with a public health or infectious disease specialist. In the US, confirmed cases of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and syphilis must be reported to the public health system.

Men with urethritis Men with obvious urethral discharge may be treated presumptively if likelihood of follow-up is questionable or if clinic-based diagnostic tools are not available. Samples for Gram staining can be obtained by touching a swab or slide to the end of the penis to collect discharge. Gram stain does not identify chlamydiae, so urine or swab samples for NAAT are obtained. Women with cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease A cervical swab should be sent for culture or NAAT. If a pelvic examination is not possible, NAAT of a urine sample or self-collected vaginal swab can detect gonococcal (and chlamydial) infections rapidly and reliably. Pharyngeal or rectal exposures Swabs of the affected area are sent for culture or NAAT. Arthritis, disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), or both An affected joint should be aspirated, and fluid should be sent for culture and routine analysis (see arthrocentesis Arthrocentesis Some musculoskeletal disorders affect primarily the joints, causing arthritis. Others affect primarily the bones (eg, fractures, Paget disease of bone, tumors), muscles or other extra-articular... read more ). Patients with skin lesions, systemic symptoms, or both should have blood, urethral, cervical, and rectal cultures or NAAT. In about 30 to 40% of patients with DGI, blood cultures are positive during the first week of illness. With gonococcal arthritis, blood cultures are less often positive, but cultures of joint fluids are usually positive. Joint fluid is usually cloudy to purulent because of large numbers of white blood cells (typically > 20,000/microliter). Diagnosis reference 1. Bazan JA, Peterson AS, Kirkcaldy RD, et al.

The following are based on CDC's Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Treatment Guidelines, 2021. Women are screened annually if they are sexually active and < 25 years of age or if they are ≥ 25 years of age, sexually active, and have one or more of the following risk factors: Have a history of a prior STI Engage in high-risk sexual behavior (eg, have a new sex partner or multiple sex partners; engage in sex work; or use condoms inconsistently when not in a mutually monogamous relationship) Have a partner who has an STI or engages in high-risk behavior (eg, a sex partner who has concurrent partners) Have a history of incarceration Pregnant women who are < 25 years or who are ≥ 25 years with one or more of the risk factors are screened during their first prenatal visit and again during their 3rd trimester for women who are < 25 or at high risk. There is insufficient evidence for screening heterosexual men who are at low risk for infection. Men who have sex with men are screened at least annually if they have been sexually active within the previous year (for insertive intercourse, urine screen; for receptive intercourse, rectal swab; and for oral intercourse, pharyngeal swab), regardless of condom use. Those at increased risk (eg, with HIV infection, receive preexposure prophylaxis with antiretrovirals, have multiple sex partners, or whose partner has multiple partners) should be screened more frequently, at 3 to 6-month intervals. Transgender and gender diverse people are screened if they are sexually active on the basis of sexual practices and anatomy (eg, annual screening for all people with a cervix who are < 25 years old; if ≥ 25 years old, people with a cervix should be screened annually if at increased risk; rectal swab based on reported sexual behaviors and exposure). (See also the US Preventive Services Task Force’s summary of recommendations regarding screening for gonorrhea.) Treatment of Gonorrhea For uncomplicated infection, a single dose of ceftriaxone Concomitant treatment for chlamydial infection Treatment of sex partners For disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) with arthritis, a longer course of parenteral antibiotics Uncomplicated gonococcal infection of the urethra, cervix, rectum, and pharynx is treated with the following: A single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg IM (1 g IM for patients weighing ≥ 150 kg) If ceftriaxone is not available, use cefixime 800 mg orally in a single dose. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. In patients who have a doxycycline allergy, treat for chlamydia with a single dose of azithromycin 1 g orally. Patients who are allergic to cephalosporins (including ceftriaxone) are treated with Gentamicin 240 mg IM in a single dose plus azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose DGI with gonococcal arthritis is initially treated with IM or IV antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours, ceftizoxime 1 g IV every 8 hours, cefotaxime 1 g IV every 8 hours) continued for 24 to 48 hours once symptoms lessen, followed by oral therapy guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, for a total treatment course of at least 7 days. If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, add doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days (1 Treatment reference Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It typically infects epithelia of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, or conjunctivae, causing irritation or pain and purulent... read more ). Gonococcal purulent arthritis usually requires repeated synovial fluid drainage either with repeated arthrocentesis or arthroscopically. Initially, the joint is immobilized in a functional position. Passive range-of-motion exercises should be started as soon as patients can tolerate them. Once pain subsides, more active exercises, with stretching and muscle strengthening, should begin. Over 95% of patients treated for gonococcal arthritis recover complete joint function. Because sterile joint fluid accumulations (effusions) may develop and persist for prolonged periods, an anti-inflammatory drug may be beneficial. Posttreatment cultures are unnecessary if symptomatic response is adequate. However, for patients with symptoms for > 7 days, specimens should be obtained, cultured, and tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. Patients should abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed to avoid infecting sex partners. Sex partners All sex partners who have had sexual contact with the patient within 60 days should be tested for gonorrhea and other STIs and treated if results are positive. Sex partners with contact within 2 weeks should be treated presumptively for gonorrhea (epidemiologic treatment). Expedited partner therapy (EPT) involves giving patients a prescription or medications to deliver to their partner. EPT may enhance partner adherence and reduce treatment failure due to reinfection. It may be most appropriate for partners of women with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection. However, a health care visit is preferable to ascertain histories of medication allergies and to screen for other STIs (1 Treatment reference Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It typically infects epithelia of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, or conjunctivae, causing irritation or pain and purulent... read more ). Treatment reference 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021: Gonococcal Infections Among Adolescents and Adults. Accessed June 27, 2022. Key Points Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection typically causes uncomplicated infection of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, and/or conjunctivae. Sometimes gonorrhea spreads to the adnexa, causing salpingitis, or disseminates to skin and/or joints, causing skin lesions or septic arthritis. Diagnose using NAAT, but culture and sensitivity testing should be done when needed to detect antimicrobial resistance. Screen high-risk patients using NAAT. Treat uncomplicated infection with a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg IM (1 g IM for patients weighing ≥ 150 kg); add oral doxycycline (100 mg twice a day for 7 days) when chlamydial infection has not been excluded.

The eyeball is set into the orbit, a socket surrounded by a strong, bony ridge. The eyelids close quickly to form a barrier to foreign objects, and the eye can at times tolerate minor impact without damage. Because of these protective features, many eye injuries may not affect the eyeball or cause significant damage. However, injuries should be evaluated because occasionally there is damage to the eye that needs treatment or impacts vision. In rare instances, vision may be completely lost or the eye must be removed. Structures That Protect the Eye Causes of Eye Injuries Common causes of eye injury include domestic or industrial accidents (for instance, from using a hammer [see Intraocular Foreign Bodies Intraocular Foreign Bodies Foreign bodies that penetrate the eyeball are rare but can lead to a serious infection and complications including a risk of developing blindness.

Evaluation of Eye Injuries A person with an eye injury should be examined by a doctor. Glasses (if worn) should be brought so that the person’s vision can be assessed with their normal correction. This assessment can help the doctor know whether any abnormal vision is a new problem or an old one. The eye examination may include a careful evaluation of the pupil (the black dot in the middle of the eye) and eye movements as well as a slit-lamp examination Slit-Lamp Examination A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor.

The slit lamp contains a light, an adjustable binocular magnifying instrument, and a table that adjusts the position of these components. A slit-lamp examination assesses mainly the front of the eye, particularly the eye surface and eyelid. Ophthalmoscopy assesses mainly the back of the eye. Often, ophthalmoscopy is done after the eye is dilated with eye drops such as cyclopentolate and phenylephrine. After dilation, more of the eye can be seen, particularly the retina. If the injury is serious, particularly if the vision is affected, the doctor who first examines the person arranges for an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in the evaluation and treatment—surgical and nonsurgical—of eye disorders) to evaluate and treat the person. Injured eyes may be very swollen and difficult to open, but doctors need to open the eyes to examine them and determine what injuries will need treatment. The eyes almost always can be opened gently, although instruments may be needed to do so. This should be done with care to avoid pressure on the eyeball in case there is any laceration to the eyeball itself. Prevention of Eye Injuries Use of eye guards, goggles, or special eyeglasses, such as those constructed of polycarbonate lenses in a wrap-around polyamide frame, is a simple precaution that greatly reduces the risk of eye injury. Specific protective eyewear is available for a variety of sports as well as for construction work.

These changes reduce the threshold for activation and increase the response to noxious stimuli. In chronic states, the peripheral nerve continuously triggers nociceptive ectopic signals to the CNS. This bombardment of continuous peripheral nociceptive input leads to changes in receptive nociceptors (central sensitization); they are primed, interpret pain from minor stimuli (including nonpainful stimuli [allodynia]) as substantial pain, and interpret that pain as coming from a wider area than it is. These changes can be reversed, at least for a time, if the peripheral nociceptive input can be interrupted. Central neuropathic pain syndromes (pain caused by dysfunction of somatosensory pathways in the CNS) can result from any CNS lesion, but these syndromes most commonly occur after stroke, result from spinal cord injury, or are associated with a multiple sclerosis demyelinating plaque. To be considered central neuropathic pain, the pain must occur in the area clinically affected by the CNS lesion; however, it does not need to involve the entire affected area. Central neuropathic pain develops only if the spinothalamic tract (pinprick, temperature sensation) malfunctions. If pinprick and temperature sensation are normal in the area of pain suspected to be central neuropathic pain, another pain source should be considered. The cause of pain in neurologically impaired patients is more commonly musculoskeletal (eg. shoulder pain related to arm paresis after a stroke or an upper extremity overuse syndrome in wheelchair-bound patients with a spinal cord injury). Deafferentation pain is due to partial or complete interruption of peripheral or central afferent neural activity.

Symptoms usually begin with pain along the affected... read more Central pain (pain after CNS injury) Phantom limb pain Complications (pain felt in the region of an amputated body part) Mechanisms are unknown but may involve sensitization of central neurons, with lower activation thresholds and expansion of receptive fields. Neuropathic pain syndromes are sometimes associated with overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic overactivity does not cause neuropathic pain, but it can contribute to its clinical features and severity. The pain that results is called sympathetically maintained pain, which depends on efferent sympathetic activity. Complex regional pain syndrome Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is chronic neuropathic pain that follows soft-tissue or bone injury (type I) or nerve injury (type II) and lasts longer and is more severe than expected... read more sometimes involves sympathetically maintained pain. Other types of neuropathic pain may have a sympathetically maintained component. What triggers sympathetic overactivity in some neuropathic pain states and not others is unknown. Mechanisms probably involve abnormal sympathetic-somatic nerve connections (ephapses), local inflammatory changes, and changes in the spinal cord. Symptoms and Signs of Neuropathic Pain Dysesthesias (spontaneous or evoked burning pain, often with a superimposed lancinating component) are typical, but pain may also be deep and aching. Other sensations—eg, hyperesthesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia (pain due to a nonnoxious stimulus), and hyperpathia (particularly unpleasant, exaggerated pain response)—may also occur. Patients may be reluctant to move the painful part of their body, resulting in muscle atrophy, joint ankylosis, bone loss, and limited movement. Symptoms are long-lasting, typically persisting after resolution of the primary cause (if one was present) because the CNS has been sensitized and remodeled. Diagnosis of Neuropathic Pain Clinical evaluation Neuropathic pain is suggested by its typical symptoms when nerve injury is known or suspected. The cause (eg, amputation, diabetes, compression) may be readily apparent. If not, the diagnosis is often assumed based on the description of the symptoms; however, those descriptors (eg, burning) are neither sensitive nor specific for neuropathic pain. Thus, additional evaluation, including neurologic examination and electrophysiologic studies, are useful to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the injured nerve. Pain that is ameliorated by sympathetic nerve block is sympathetically maintained pain. Treatment of Neuropathic Pain Multimodal therapy (eg, physical methods, antidepressants, antiseizure drugs, psychotherapeutic methods, neuromodulation, sometimes surgery) Successful neuropathic pain management starts with confirming the correct diagnosis and managing treatable causes (eg, herniated disk Cervical Herniated Nucleus Pulposus Herniated nucleus pulposus is prolapse of an intervertebral disk through a tear in the surrounding annulus fibrosus.

Diagnosis is suggested by pain out of proportion... read more ; see table Drugs for Neuropathic Pain Drugs for Neuropathic Pain ). Gabapentin is one of the most widely used drugs for such purposes. For effective analgesia, the dose should usually be > 600 mg orally 3 times a day, and many patients need a higher dose. Maximum dosage is usually considered to be 1200 mg orally 3 times a day. Pregabalin is similar to gabapentin but has more stable pharmacokinetics; dosing 2 times a day is as efficacious as dosing 3 times a day and results in better compliance. The dosing goal is at least 300 mg/day orally (eg, a starting dose of 75 mg 2 times a day, increased to 150 mg 2 times a day within 1 week). Neuropathic pain syndromes may require up to 600 mg/day. Some patients who do not respond well to or do not tolerate gabapentin do respond to or tolerate pregabalin and vice versa, even though the two drugs have a similar primary mechanism of action (binding to the alpha-2 delta ligand of the presynaptic calcium channel, which modulates nociceptive signaling). For tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine), the primary mechanism of action is blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Analgesic doses (75 to 150 mg orally once a day) are usually insufficient to treat depression or anxiety. Anticholinergic and adrenergic adverse effects often limit effective dosing. Secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline and desipramine) have a more favorable adverse effect profile than tertiary amine tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline). Duloxetine is a mixed mechanism (serotonin and norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitor, which appears to be effective for diabetic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is a common, incompletely understood nonarticular, noninflammatory disorder characterized by generalized aching (sometimes severe); widespread tenderness of muscles, areas around... read more , chronic musculoskeletal pain (including low back pain Evaluation of Neck and Back Pain Neck pain and back pain are among the most common reasons for physician visits.

Asthma triggers include viral infections, smoke, perfume, pollen, mold, and dust mites. Wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing are symptoms of asthma. The diagnosis is based on a child's repeated wheezing episodes, a family history of asthma, and sometimes the results of tests that measure how well the lungs function. Many children who wheeze in childhood will not have asthma later in life. Asthma symptoms can often be prevented by avoiding triggers. Treatment includes bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. (See also Asthma Asthma Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli. Coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath that occur in response to specific triggers are... read more in adults.) Although asthma can develop at any age, it most commonly begins in childhood, particularly in the first 5 years of life. Some children continue to have asthma into the adult years. In other children, asthma resolves. Sometimes, children who doctors thought had asthma actually had another disorder that caused similar symptoms ( Home.see page Wheezing in Infants and Young Children Wheezing in Infants and Young Children Wheezing is a relatively high-pitched whistling sound that occurs during breathing when the airways are partially blocked or narrowed. Wheezing is caused by a narrowing of the airways. Other... read more ). Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, affecting more than 6 million children in the United States. It occurs more frequently in boys before puberty and in girls after puberty. Asthma has become much more common in recent decades. Doctors are not sure why this is so. More than 8.5% of children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma, which is over a 100% increase in recent decades. The rate soars to 25% to 40% among some populations of urban children. Asthma is a leading cause of hospitalization for children and is the number one chronic condition causing elementary school absenteeism. Most children with asthma are able to participate in normal childhood activities, except during flare-ups. A smaller number of children have moderate or severe asthma and need to take daily preventive drugs to enable them to engage in sports and normal play. Asthma VIDEO Asthma triggers For unknown reasons, children with asthma respond to certain stimuli (triggers) in ways that children without asthma do not. Children with asthma may have certain genes that may make them more susceptible to react to certain triggers. Most children with asthma also have parents and siblings or other relatives with asthma, which is evidence that genes are important in asthma. There are many potential triggers, and most children respond to only a few. In some children, specific triggers for flare-ups cannot be identified. The triggers all result in a similar response. Certain cells in the airways release chemical substances. These substances Cause the airways to become inflamed and swollen Stimulate the muscle cells in the walls of the airways to contract Increase mucus production in the airways Each of these responses contributes to a sudden narrowing of the airways (an asthma attack). In most children, the airways return to normal between asthma attacks. Repeated stimulation by these chemical substances increases mucus production in the airways, causes shedding of the cells lining the airways, and enlarges the muscle cells in the walls of the airways. Table Risk Factors for Asthma Doctors do not completely understand why some children develop asthma, but a number of risk factors are recognized: Inherited and prenatal factors Allergen exposure Viral infections Diet A child with one parent who has asthma has a 25% risk of developing asthma. If both parents have asthma, the risk increases to 50%. Children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy may be more likely to develop asthma. Asthma also has been linked to other factors related to the mother, such as young maternal age, poor maternal nutrition, and lack of breastfeeding. Prematurity Preterm (Premature) Newborns A preterm newborn is a baby delivered before 37 weeks of gestation. Depending on when they are born, preterm newborns have underdeveloped organs, which may not be ready to function outside of... read more and low birth weight are also risk factors. In the United States, children in urban environments are more likely to develop asthma, particularly if they are from lower socioeconomic groups. Although it is not entirely understood, it is believed that poorer living conditions, greater potential exposure to triggers, and less access to health care contribute to the higher incidence of asthma in these groups. Although asthma affects a higher percentage of Black children than White children, the role that genetic aspects of race play in the increasing rate of asthma is controversial because Black children are also more likely to live in urban areas. Children who are exposed to high concentrations of certain allergens, such as dust mites or cockroach feces, at an early age are more likely to develop asthma. However, doctors have noticed that asthma is more common among children living in very clean, hygienic environments where they are exposed to fewer infectious diseases than children living in environments where they are exposed to more infectious diseases. Thus, doctors think that perhaps childhood exposure to certain substances and infections may actually help children's immune system learn not to overreact to triggers. Most children who are having an asthma attack and 90% of children who have been hospitalized for asthma have a viral infection (usually rhinovirus or the common cold Common Cold The common cold is a viral infection of the lining of the nose, sinuses, and throat. Many different viruses cause colds. Usually, colds are spread when a person's hands come in contact with... read more ).

The wheezing may at first be interpreted as asthma, but these children are no more likely than others to have asthma during adolescence. Diet may be a risk factor. Children who do not consume enough of vitamins C and E and omega-3 fatty acids or who are obese may be at higher risk of asthma. Symptoms of Asthma in Children As the airways narrow in an asthma attack, the child develops difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and coughing Cough in Children Cough helps clear materials from the airways and prevent them from going to the lungs. The materials may be particles that have been inhaled or substances from the lungs and/or airways. Most... read more , typically accompanied by wheezing. Wheezing Wheezing in Infants and Young Children Wheezing is a relatively high-pitched whistling sound that occurs during breathing when the airways are partially blocked or narrowed. Wheezing is caused by a narrowing of the airways. Other... read more is a high-pitched noise heard when the child breathes out. Not all asthma attacks cause wheezing, however. Mild asthma, particularly in very young children, may result only in a cough. Some older children with mild asthma tend to cough only when exercising or when exposed to cold air. Also, children with an extremely severe asthma attack may actually not wheeze because there is too little air flowing even to make a noise. In a severe attack, breathing becomes visibly difficult, wheezing usually becomes louder, the child breathes faster and with greater effort, and the ribs stand out when the child breathes in (inspiration). With very severe attacks, the child gasps for breath and sits upright, leaning forward. The skin is sweaty and pale or blue-tinged. Children who have frequent severe attacks sometimes have slowed growth, but their growth usually is similar to that of other children by adulthood. Diagnosis of Asthma in Children Wheezing and family history of asthma or allergies Sometimes allergy testing Sometimes pulmonary function tests A doctor suspects asthma in children who have repeated episodes of wheezing, particularly when family members are known to have asthma or allergies. However, asthma is only one of several causes of wheezing Causes Wheezing is a relatively high-pitched whistling sound that occurs during breathing when the airways are partially blocked or narrowed. Wheezing is caused by a narrowing of the airways. Other... read more . X-rays of the chest are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of asthma in children. X-rays are usually done only if doctors think that the child's symptoms might be caused by a different disorder, such as pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Often, pneumonia is the final... read more .

Pulmonary function tests are better at detecting the general type and severity... read more ). In most children with asthma, lung function is normal between flare-ups. Older children or adolescents known to have asthma often use a peak flow meter (a small handheld device that records how fast a person can blow out air) to measure the degree of airway narrowing. This device can be used at home. Doctors and parents can use this measurement to assess the child's condition during an attack and between attacks. X-rays are not done during an attack in children known to have asthma unless doctors suspect another disorder such as pneumonia or a collapsed lung. Prognosis for Asthma in Children Many children outgrow asthma. However, as many as 1 in 4 children either continue to have asthma attacks or the asthma symptoms resolve only to return (called relapse) when children are older. Children who have severe asthma are more likely to have asthma as adults. Other risk factors for persistence and relapse include female sex, smoking, development of asthma at a younger age, and sensitivity to household dust mites. Although asthma causes a significant number of deaths each year, most of these are preventable with treatment. Thus, the prognosis is good for children who have access to treatment and who are able to follow their treatment plan. Prevention of Asthma in Children It is not yet known how to prevent a child with a family history of asthma from developing asthma. However, there is evidence that children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy are more likely to have asthma. Thus, pregnant women should not smoke, especially if there is a family history of asthma. On the other hand, there are many things that can be done to prevent asthma symptoms or attacks in children who have asthma. Asthma flare-ups often can be prevented by avoiding or trying to control whatever triggers a particular child's attacks. Children who have allergies should have the following items removed from their bedroom: Feather pillows Carpets and rugs Drapes Upholstered furniture Stuffed toys Pets Other potential sources of dust mites and allergens Other ways to reduce allergens include Using synthetic fiber pillows and impermeable mattress covers Washing bed sheets, pillowcases, and blankets in hot water Using dehumidifiers in basements and in other poorly aerated, damp rooms to reduce mold Using steam to clean the home to reduce dust mite allergens Cleaning the house and pest extermination to eliminate cockroach exposure Eliminating smoking in the home Secondhand tobacco smoke often worsens symptoms in children with asthma, so it is important to eliminate smoking at least in areas where the child spends time. Other triggers, such as strong odors, irritating fumes, cold temperatures, and high humidity, should also be avoided or controlled when possible. Because exercise is so important for a child's development, doctors usually encourage children to maintain physical activities, exercise, and sports participation and use an asthma drug immediately before exercising if needed. Allergy shots (immunotherapy) If a particular allergen cannot be avoided, a doctor may try to desensitize the child by using allergy shots Allergen immunotherapy (desensitization) Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions) are inappropriate responses of the immune system to a normally harmless substance. Usually, allergies cause sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, a... read more , although the benefits of allergy shots for asthma are not well known. Allergy shots are typically more effective in children than adults. If asthma symptoms are not significantly relieved after 24 months, the shots are generally stopped. If symptoms are relieved, the shots should be continued for 3 years or more. However, the optimum length of time to continue the shots is unknown. Treatment of Asthma in Children For acute attacks, bronchodilators and sometimes corticosteroids For chronic asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (sometimes combined with bronchodilators) and possibly leukotriene modifiers and/or cromolyn Treatment is given to resolve sudden (acute) attacks and sometimes to prevent attacks. Children who have mild, very infrequent attacks usually take drugs only during an attack. Children who have more frequent or severe attacks also need to take drugs even when they are not having attacks. Different drugs are used depending on the frequency and severity of the attacks. Children with infrequent attacks that are not very severe usually take a low dose of an inhaled corticosteroid or a leukotriene modifier (montelukast or zafirlukast) every day to help prevent attacks. These drugs reduce inflammation by blocking the release of the chemical substances that inflame the airways. Acute attacks (flare-ups) Treatment of an acute asthma attack consists of Opening the airways (bronchodilation) Stopping inflammation A variety of inhaled drugs open the airways (bronchodilators—see Treating Asthma Attacks Treating Asthma Attacks Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli. Coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath that occur in response to specific triggers are... read more ). Typical examples are albuterol and ipratropium. Doctors do not recommend using long-acting bronchodilators, such as salmeterol and formoterol, as the only treatment for children. Bronchodilators VIDEO Children and adolescents should use a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer or valve-holding chamber ( Home.see figure How to Use a Metered-Dose Inhaler How to Use a Metered-Dose Inhaler ). The spacer optimizes delivery of the drug to the lungs and minimizes the chance of side effects. How to Use a Metered-Dose Inhaler Shake the inhaler after removing the cap. Exhale fully for 1 or 2 seconds. Put the inhaler in your mouth or 1 to 2 inches from it and start to breathe in slowly, like sipping hot soup. While starting to breathe in, press the top of the inhaler. Breathe in slowly until your lungs are full. (This should take about 5 or 6 seconds.) Hold your breath for 10 seconds (or as long as you can). Breathe out and, if a second dose is required, repeat the procedure after 1 minute. If you find it difficult to coordinate breathing using this method, a spacer can be used. Infants and very young children sometimes can use an inhaler and spacer if an infant-sized mask is attached. Children who cannot use inhalers may receive inhaled drugs at home through a mask connected to a nebulizer (a small device that creates a mist of the drug by using compressed air). Inhalers and nebulizers are equally effective at delivering the drugs, but most parents find the inhaler and spacer much more convenient and easier to use. Albuterol also can be taken by mouth, but this route is less effective and may have more side effects than inhalation and usually is used only in infants who do not have a nebulizer and are too young to use an inhaler. Children with moderately severe attacks also may be given corticosteroids by mouth or injection. Children with very severe attacks are treated in the hospital with bronchodilators given in a nebulizer or an inhaler at least every 20 minutes initially. Sometimes doctors use injections of epinephrine or terbutaline (bronchodilators) in children with very severe attacks if inhaled drugs are not effective rapidly enough. Doctors usually give corticosteroids by vein to children having a severe attack. Chronic asthma Treatment of chronic asthma consists of Taking inhaled corticosteroids daily and possibly other drugs that control inflammation Using an inhaler before exercise Infants and children under age 5 who need treatment more than 2 times a week, who have more persistent asthma, or those at risk of frequent or more severe attacks should receive daily anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. These children may also be given an additional drug such as a leukotriene modifier (montelukast or zafirlukast), a long-acting bronchodilator (always mixed with an inhaled corticosteroid in a combination inhaler), or cromolyn. Drugs are increased or decreased over time to achieve optimal control of the child’s asthma symptoms and to prevent severe attacks. If these drugs do not prevent severe attacks, children may need to take corticosteroids by mouth. Children over age 5 and adolescents with asthma can be treated similarly to adults (see Treating Asthma Attacks Treating Asthma Attacks Asthma is a condition in which the airways narrow—usually reversibly—in response to certain stimuli. Coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath that occur in response to specific triggers are... read more ). Children who have attacks during exercise usually inhale a dose of bronchodilator just before exercising. Children whose asthma is triggered by aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must avoid using these drugs. This reaction, however, is very uncommon in children. Because asthma is a long-term disorder with a variety of treatments, doctors work with parents and children to make sure they understand the disorder as well as possible. Adolescents and mature younger children should participate in developing their own asthma management plans and establishing their own goals for therapy to improve adherence to treatment. Parents and children should learn how to determine the severity of an attack, when to use drugs and a peak flow meter, when to call the doctor, and when to go to the hospital. Parents and doctors should inform school nurses, child care providers, and others of the child's disorder and the drugs being used. Some children may be permitted to use inhalers in school as needed, and others must be supervised by the school nurse.

Large doses of ionizing radiation can cause acute illness by reducing the production of blood cells and damaging the digestive tract. A very large dose of ionizing radiation can also damage the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system), brain, and skin. Radiation injury due to large and very large doses is referred to as a tissue reaction. The dose needed to cause visible tissue injury varies with tissue type. Ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer. Radiation exposure of sperm and egg cells carries little increased risk of genetic defects in offspring. Doctors remove as much external and internal (that which is inhaled or ingested) radioactive material as possible and treat symptoms and complications of radiation injury. In general, ionizing radiation refers to high-energy electromagnetic waves (x-rays and gamma rays) and particles (alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons) that are capable of stripping electrons from atoms (ionization). Ionization changes the chemistry of affected atoms and any molecules containing those atoms. By changing molecules in the highly ordered environment of the cell, ionizing radiation can disrupt and damage cells. Depending on the magnitude of the dose, organs exposed, and types of radiation cellular damage caused by ionizing radiation can cause acute illness, increase the risk of developing cancer, or both. Ionizing radiation is emitted by radioactive substances (radionuclides), such as uranium, radon, and plutonium. It is also produced by devices, such as x-ray and radiation therapy machines. Radiation Sickness VIDEO Radio waves, such as from cell phones and AM and FM radio transmitters, and visible light also are forms of electromagnetic radiation. However, because of their lower energy, these forms of radiation are not ionizing, and thus public exposure to these common sources does not damage cells. In this discussion, “radiation” refers exclusively to ionizing radiation. Measurement of radiation The amount of radiation is measured in several different units. The roentgen (R) is a measure of the ionizing ability of radiation in air and is commonly used to express the intensity of exposure to radiation. How much radiation people are exposed to and how much is deposited in their body may be very different. The gray (Gy) and sievert (Sv) are measures of the dose of radiation, which is the amount of radiation deposited in matter, and are the units used to measure dose in humans after exposure to radiation. The Gy and Sv are similar, except the Sv takes into account the effectiveness of different types of radiation to cause damage and the sensitivity of different tissues in the body to radiation. Low dose levels are measured in milligrays (mGy, 1 mGy = 1/1000Gy) and millisieverts (mSv, 1 mSv = 1/1000Sv). Contamination vs. irradiation An individual's radiation dose can be increased in two ways, contamination and irradiation. Many of the most significant radiation accidents have exposed people to both. Contamination is contact with and retention of radioactive material, usually as a dust or liquid. External contamination is that on skin or clothing, from which some can fall or be rubbed off, contaminating other people and objects. Internal contamination is radioactive material deposited within the body, which it may enter by ingestion, inhalation, or through breaks in the skin. Once in the body, radioactive material may be transported to various sites, such as the bone marrow, where it continues to emit radiation, increasing the person's radiation exposure, until it is removed or emits all its energy (decays). Internal contamination is more difficult to remove than external contamination. Irradiation is exposure to radiation but not to radioactive material, that is, no contamination is involved. A common example is diagnostic x-rays, used, for example, to evaluate a broken bone. Radiation exposure can occur without direct contact between people and the source of radiation (such as radioactive material or an x-ray machine). When the source of the radiation is removed or turned off, irradiation ends. People who are irradiated but not contaminated are not radioactive, that is, they do not emit radiation, and their dose from that source of radiation does not continue to increase. Did You Know... The average person in the United States receives about the same dose of naturally occurring radiation as that from manufactured sources of radiation (almost all of which is medical radiation used to diagnose or treat disease). Sources of Radiation Exposure People are exposed constantly to low levels of radiation and naturally occurring (background) radiation, and intermittently to radiation from manufactured sources. Natural background radiation varies tremendously worldwide and within countries as well. In the United States, people receive on average about 3 mSv/year from natural sources and the range of exposures varies from about 0.5 to 20 mSv/year depending on the region, elevation above sea level, and local geology. On average, an additional 3 mSv/year is received from manufactured (mostly medical) sources, making the total average per capita effective dose about 6 mSv/year. Background radiation Sources of background radiation include Solar and cosmic radiation from space Naturally occurring radioactive elements in the earth Cosmic and solar radiation is significantly blocked by the earth’s atmosphere but is concentrated at the north and south poles by the earth’s magnetic field. Thus, exposure to cosmic radiation is greater for people living closer to the poles, living at high altitudes, and during airplane flights. Radioactive elements, particularly uranium and the radioactive products into which it naturally decays (such as radon gas), are present in many rocks and minerals. These elements end up in various substances, including food, water, and construction materials. Radon exposure typically accounts for about two thirds of peoples’ exposure to naturally occurring radiation. Even in total, the doses from natural background radiation are far too low to cause radiation injury. To date there have been no demonstrated health effects due to differences in the level of background radiation because the risks of radiation-induced health effects at these low exposure levels are either nonexistent or too small to be observed. Man-made radiation Most people’s exposure to sources of manufactured radiation involves medical imaging tests that use x-rays (particularly computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.

Radiation preferentially... read more may receive very high doses of radiation. However, every effort is made to deliver the radiation only to diseased tissues and to minimize the radiation to normal tissues. Exposure also occurs from other manufactured sources, such as radiation accidents and fallout from previous nuclear weapons testing. However, these exposures represent a minor part of most people’s annual exposure. Typically, radiation accidents involve people who work with radioactive materials and with x-ray sources, such as food irradiators, industrial radiography sources, and x-ray machines. Such workers may receive significant doses of radiation. These accidents are rare and typically result from failure to follow safety procedures. Radiation exposure has also occurred from lost or stolen medical or industrial sources containing large amounts of radioactive material. Radiation injuries have also occurred to patients receiving radiation therapy and certain medical procedures that are guided by a pulsed x-ray beam that shows a moving x-ray image on a screen (fluoroscopy). Some of these injuries to patients are the result of accidents or improper use but sometimes, in more complex cases, appropriate use of such procedures may cause unavoidable radiation-induced complications and tissue reactions. On rare occasions, substantial amounts of radioactive material have been released from nuclear power plants, including the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986, and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. The Three Mile Island accident did not result in major radiation exposure. In fact, people living within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant received only an additional dose of about 0.08 mSv. By contrast, the average dose to the approximately 115,000 people who were evacuated from the area near the Chernobyl plant was about 30 mSv. For comparison, the typical dose from a single CT scan is between 4 and 8 mSv. People working at the Chernobyl plant received significantly more. More than 30 workers and emergency responders died within a few months of the accident, and many more developed acute radiation sickness. There was low-level contamination from Chernobyl as far away as Europe, Asia, and even (to a lesser extent) in North America. The average cumulative radiation dose to populations living in areas with low-level contamination (various regions of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine) over a 20-year period after the accident was estimated to be about 9 mSv. It should be noted that the average annual extra dose (0.5 to 1.5 mSv per year) received by residents of the territories contaminated by Chernobyl fallout is generally lower than typical background radiation in the United States (3 mSv per year). Some workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were exposed to significant doses of radiation; however, there were no deaths or permanent radiation-induced tissue reactions. People living within 12 miles (20 kilometers) of the Fukushima Daiichi plant were evacuated because of concerns about radiation exposure. However, estimates are that almost no nearby residents received more than about 5 mSv. The World Health Organization predicts that cancer deaths related to this accident will be very low. Nuclear weapons release massive amounts of energy and radiation. These weapons have not been used against people since 1945. However, several nations now have nuclear weapons, and terrorist groups have also tried to obtain them or build their own, increasing the possibility that these weapons will again be used. The vast majority of the casualties due to the detonation of a nuclear weapon result from the blast and thermal burns. A smaller fraction of the casualties (although still a high number) result from radiation-induced illness. The possibility of intentional radiation exposure through terrorist activities (see Radiological Weapons Radiological Weapons Radiation exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere. Mass casualties due to radiation can result from the detonation of a nuclear device. A nuclear detonation not only creates a large burst... read more ) includes the use of a device to contaminate an area by dispersing radioactive material (a radiation-dispersal device that uses conventional explosives is referred to as a dirty bomb). Other terrorist scenarios include using a hidden radiation source to expose unsuspecting people to large doses of radiation, attacking a nuclear reactor or radioactive material storage facility, and detonating a nuclear weapon. Table Effects of Radiation The damaging effects of radiation (that is, the severity of the tissue reaction) depend on several factors: The amount (dose) How rapidly the dose is received How much of the body is exposed The sensitivity of particular tissues to radiation The presence of genetic abnormalities that impair normal DNA DNA Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. Chromosomes are structures within cells... read more repair The person's age at time of exposure The person's general state of health prior to the exposure A single, rapid dose of radiation to the entire body can be fatal, but the same total dose given over a period of weeks or months may have much less effect. The effects of radiation also depend on how much of the body is exposed. For example, more than 6 Gy can be fatal when the radiation dose is to the entire body. However, when limited to a small area and spread out over a period of weeks or months, as in radiation therapy for cancer, 10 or more times this amount can be given without serious harm. Some parts of the body are more sensitive to radiation. Organs and tissues in which cells multiply quickly, such as the intestine and bone marrow, are harmed more easily by radiation than those in which cells multiply more slowly, such as muscles and brain cells. The thyroid gland is susceptible to cancer after being exposed to radioactive iodine because radioactive iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland. Other factors can increase the sensitivity to radiation injury.

Some medications and chemotherapeutic agents (for example, actinomycin D, doxorubicin, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate) may also increase sensitivity to radiation injury. Some chemotherapeutic agents (for example, doxorubicin, etoposide, paclitaxel, epirubicin), antibiotics (for example, cefotetan), statins (for example, simvastatin), and herbal preparations can produce an inflammatory skin reaction at the site of prior irradiation (radiation recall) weeks to years after exposure at the same location. Radiation and children In children, some organs and tissues such as the brain, lens of the eye, and thyroid gland, are more sensitive to radiation than in adults. However, some tissues in children are no more sensitive to radiation than in adults, and some, such as the ovaries, are actually less sensitive. The reasons for the differences are complicated and not completely understood, but doctors think that the higher sensitivity of some tissues in children is due, at least in part, to the fact that children's cells grow and mature more quickly and will undergo many more cell divisions than those in adults. The fetus is sensitive to damage from radiation because fetal cells are dividing very quickly and also differentiating from immature into mature cells. In the fetus, exposure in excess of 300 mGy during 8 to 25 weeks after conception may cause reduced intelligence and poor school performance. Birth defects may occur due to exposure in the womb to high doses of radiation. However, at doses less than 100 mGy, particularly at the low doses used in imaging tests that a pregnant woman might typically undergo, there is no apparent increase beyond the normal risk of having a child born with a birth defect. Did You Know... Radiation is not as potent a cause of cancer or birth defects as people might think. Radiation and cancer A large radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer because of damage to the genetic material (DNA) in cells that survive the radiation. However, radiation is a weaker cause of cancer than people might think. Even a whole-body dose of 500 mGy (over 150 times more than the average annual background radiation dose) increases a typical person’s lifetime risk of dying from cancer from 22% to about 24.5%, only a 2.5% absolute risk increase. In a fetus or child, the risk of radiation-induced cancer is several times higher than in an adult. Children may be more susceptible because their cells divide more often and because they have a longer lifespan during which cancer may develop. The lifetime risk of dying as a result of cancer for a 1-year-old who has a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen may be increased by about 0.1%. Recently, concerns about the possible risks due to CT scans have led to controversy about whether CT scans are being used too often. Because of these concerns, CT scan techniques are being optimized to reduce the radiation dose. Doctors also try to do a CT scan only when it is more accurate than other tests that use less or no radiation. When CT is clearly the most accurate test, the risk resulting from not making the correct diagnosis because a less accurate test was used is much greater than the risk of the CT scan. Radiation and inherited defects In animals, high doses of radiation of the ovaries or testes have been shown to lead to defective offspring (hereditary effects). However, no increase in the percentage of birth defects was observed in the children of survivors of the nuclear bomb explosions in Japan. It may be that the radiation exposure was not high enough to cause a measurable increase. No increase in the risk of birth defects is found in children conceived after their parents received radiation therapy for cancer where the average dose to the ovaries was about 0.5 Gy and to the testes was about 1.2 Gy (typical exposure to tissues next to but not directly in the treatment area during radiation therapy). Symptoms of Radiation Injury Symptoms depend on whether radiation exposure involves the whole body or is limited to a small portion of the body. At high doses, whole-body exposure causes acute radiation illness, and partial-body exposure causes local radiation injury. Acute radiation illness Acute radiation illness typically occurs in people whose entire body has been exposed to very high doses of radiation all at once or over a short period of time. Doctors divide acute radiation illness into three groups (syndromes) based on the main organ system affected, although there is overlap among these groups: Hematopoietic syndrome: Affects tissues that produce blood cells Gastrointestinal syndrome: Affects the digestive tract Cerebrovascular syndrome: Affects the brain and nervous system Acute radiation illness usually progresses through three stages: Early symptoms such as nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, tiredness and, when very high radiation doses are received, diarrhea (collectively called the prodrome) A symptom-free period (latent stage) Various patterns of symptoms (syndromes), depending on the amount of radiation received Which syndrome develops, its severity, and its rate of progression depend on the radiation dose. As the dose increases, symptoms develop earlier, progress more rapidly (for example, from prodromal symptoms to the various organ system syndromes), and become more severe. The severity and time course of the early symptoms are fairly consistent from person to person for a given amount of radiation exposure. Thus, doctors can often estimate a person’s radiation exposure based on the timing, nature, and severity of the early symptoms. However, the presence of injuries, burns, or severe anxiety can complicate this estimate. The hematopoietic syndrome is caused by the effects of radiation on the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes—the primary sites of blood cell production (hematopoiesis). Loss of appetite (anorexia), lethargy, nausea, and vomiting may begin 1 to 6 hours after exposure to 1 to 6 Gy of radiation. These symptoms resolve within 24 to 48 hours after exposure, and people feel well for a week or more. During this symptom-free period, the blood-producing cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes begin to waste away and are not replaced, leading to a severe shortage of white blood cells, followed by a shortage of platelets and then red blood cells. The shortage of white blood cells (lymphocytopenia Lymphocytopenia Lymphocytopenia is an abnormally low number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the blood.

The shortage of red blood cells (anemia Overview of Anemia Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that enables them to carry oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to all parts... read more ) causes fatigue, weakness, paleness, and difficulty breathing during physical exertion. If people survive, after 4 to 5 weeks, blood cells begin to be produced once more, but people feel weak and tired for months, and they have an increased risk of cancer. The gastrointestinal syndrome is due to the effects of radiation on the cells lining the digestive tract. Severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may begin in less than 1 hour after exposure to 6 Gy or more of radiation. The symptoms may lead to severe dehydration, but they resolve within 2 days. During the next 4 or 5 days (latent stage), people feel well, but the cells lining the digestive tract, which normally act as a protective barrier, die and are shed. After this time, severe diarrhea—often bloody—returns, once more resulting in dehydration. Bacteria from the digestive tract may invade the body, causing severe infections. People who have received this much radiation also develop the hematopoietic syndrome, which results in bleeding and infection and increases their risk of death. After exposure to 6 Gy or more of radiation, death is common. However, with advanced medical support, about 50% of people may survive. The cerebrovascular syndrome occurs when the total dose of radiation exceeds 20 to 30 Gy. People rapidly develop confusion, nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, tremors, and shock. The latent phase is brief or absent. Within hours, blood pressure falls, accompanied by seizures and coma. The cerebrovascular syndrome is always fatal within a few hours to 1 or 2 days. Local radiation injury Radiation therapy for cancer is one of the most common causes of local radiation injuries. Symptoms depend on the amount of radiation, the rate at which it is received, and the area of the body treated. Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite may occur during or shortly after irradiation of the brain or abdomen. Large amounts of radiation to a limited area of the body often damage the skin over that area. Skin changes include hair loss, redness, peeling, sores, and, possibly eventual thinning of the skin and dilated blood vessels just beneath the skin's surface (spider veins). Radiation to the mouth and jaw can cause permanent dry mouth, resulting in an increased number of dental caries and damage to the jawbone. Radiation to the lungs can cause lung inflammation (radiation pneumonitis). Very high doses can result in severe scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue, which can cause disabling shortness of breath and later death. The heart and its protective sac (pericardium) can become inflamed after extensive radiation to the chest, causing symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. High accumulated doses of radiation to the spinal cord can cause catastrophic damage, leading to paralysis, incontinence, and loss of sensation. Extensive radiation to the abdomen (for lymph node, testicular, or ovarian cancer) can lead to chronic ulcers, scarring, and narrowing or perforation of the intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, vomiting blood, and dark, tarry stools. Occasionally, severe injuries develop long after the completion of radiation therapy. Kidney function may decline 6 months to a year after people have received extremely large amounts of radiation, resulting in anemia Overview of Anemia Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.

Often no cause for high blood pressure can be identified, but sometimes it occurs as a result of an underlying... read more . High accumulated doses of radiation to muscles may cause a painful condition that includes muscle wasting (atrophy) and calcium deposits in the irradiated muscle. Occasionally, radiation therapy may result in a new cancerous (malignant) tumor. These radiation-induced cancers typically occur 10 or more years after exposure. Diagnosis of Radiation Injury Symptoms, severity of symptoms, and time to onset of symptoms after exposure to radiation Lymphocyte counts (to determine severity of exposure) Exposure to radiation may be obvious from people’s history. Radiation injury is suspected when people develop symptoms of illness or skin redness or sores after receiving radiation therapy or being exposed during a radiation accident. The time until symptoms develop can help doctors estimate the radiation dose. No specific tests are available to diagnose radiation exposure, although certain standard clinical tests may be used to detect infection, low blood counts, or organ malfunction. To help determine the severity of radiation exposure, doctors measure the number of lymphocytes Lymphocytes One of the body's lines of defense ( immune system) involves white blood cells (leukocytes) that travel through the bloodstream and into tissues, searching for and attacking microorganisms and... read more (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Typically, the lower the lymphocyte count 48 hours after exposure, the worse the radiation exposure. Radioactive contamination, unlike irradiation, can often be determined by surveying a person’s body with a Geiger-Muller counter, a device that detects radiation. Swabs from the nose, throat, and any wounds also are checked for radioactivity. The early symptoms of acute radiation illness–nausea, vomiting, and tremors–can also be caused by anxiety. Because anxiety is common after terrorist and nuclear incidents, people should not panic when such symptoms develop, particularly if the amount of radiation exposure is unknown and may have been small. Prevention of Radiation Injury Following widespread high-level environmental contamination from a nuclear power plant accident or the intentional release of radioactive material, people should follow the advice of public health officials. Such information is usually broadcast on TV and radio. The advice may be for people to evacuate the contaminated area or to take shelter where they are. Whether evacuation or sheltering is recommended depends on many factors, including time elapsed since the initial release, whether the release has stopped, weather conditions, availability of adequate shelters, and road and traffic conditions. If sheltering is recommended, sheltering in a concrete or metal structure, particularly one below grade (such as in a basement), is best. Halfway between the top and bottom of a tall building, near the center away from windows, is best when no below-grade shelter is available. A nuclear detonation near the ground produces a fireball that rapidly shoots up into the atmosphere and pulls up thousands of tons of dirt and debris. This creates the iconic mushroom-shaped cloud. The cloud stabilizes in the upper atmosphere where radioactive material produced in the explosion mixes with the dirt and small particles of debris from the detonation. Fallout is the term for when these particles fall back to earth, collect on surfaces, and give off dangerous radiation. Significant fallout can extend 10 to 20 miles from the blast. Going inside a building to shelter as far away from these particles is the best protective action. People have at least 10 to 15 minutes after the detonation to get inside before the fallout begins. Shelter in place as quickly as an effective shelter can be found for the first few hours after the detonation and then follow the advice of local emergency response officials. See also FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency): Be Prepared for a Nuclear Explosion. Did You Know... After a radiation-releasing incident, whether evacuation or sheltering in place is recommended depends on many factors, including time elapsed since the initial release, whether the release has stopped, weather conditions, availability of adequate shelters, and road and traffic conditions. Changing clothes and showering are recommended if people suspect they may have been contaminated with radioactive material. People can obtain potassium iodide (KI) tablets from local pharmacies and some public health agencies. However, potassium iodide is only useful if radioactive iodine is released. It does not provide protection from other radioactive materials. People with known iodine sensitivity and certain thyroid conditions should avoid potassium iodide. A doctor should be consulted if iodine sensitivity is suspected. Certain experimental drugs given during or immediately after irradiation have been shown to increase survival rates in animals. However, these drugs can be very toxic and are not currently recommended for people. During imaging procedures that involve ionizing radiation and especially during radiation therapy for cancer, which involves high doses, the most susceptible parts of the body, such as the lenses of the eyes, female breasts, ovaries or testes, and thyroid gland, are shielded when possible (for example, by wearing a lead-filled covering). Did You Know... People living within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of a nuclear power plant should have ready access to potassium iodide tablets. Changing clothes and showering with warm water and regular shampoo are very effective in removing most external contamination. Prognosis for Radiation Injury The outcome depends on the radiation dose, dose rate (how quickly the exposure occurs), and the parts of the body that are affected. Other factors include people's state of health and whether they receive medical care. In general, without medical care, half of all people who receive more than 3 Gy of whole-body radiation at one time die. Nearly all people who receive more than 8 Gy die. Nearly all of those who receive less than 2 Gy fully recover within 1 month, although long-term complications such as cancer may occur. With medical care, about half of people survive 6 Gy of whole-body radiation. Some people have survived doses of up to 10 Gy. Because doctors are unlikely to know the amount of radiation a person has received, they usually predict outcome based on the person's symptoms. The cerebrovascular syndrome is fatal within hours to a few days. The gastrointestinal syndrome generally is fatal within 3 to 10 days, although some people survive for a few weeks. Many people who receive proper medical care survive the hematopoietic syndrome, depending on the radiation dose and their state of health. Those who do not survive typically die within 4 to 8 weeks after exposure. Treatment of Radiation Injury Treatment of serious, life-threatening injuries first Decontamination of wounds, skin, and hair Treatment of internal contamination Sometimes specific measures for particular radionuclides Treatment of compromised immune system Supportive care Serious physical injuries are treated before irradiation is treated because they are more immediately life-threatening. Irradiation has no emergency treatment, but doctors closely monitor people for the development of the various syndromes and treat the symptoms as they arise. Contamination should be removed promptly to prevent the radioactive material from continuing to irradiate the person and to prevent the radioactive material from being taken up by the body. Contaminated wounds are treated before contaminated skin. Doctors decontaminate wounds by flushing them with a salt water solution and wiping them with a surgical sponge. After decontamination, wounds are covered to prevent recontamination as other sites are washed. Contaminated skin should be gently scrubbed with large amounts of warm (not hot) water and soap. Skin folds and nails need extra attention. Harsh chemicals, brushes, or scrubbing that may break the skin surface should be avoided. If hair cannot be decontaminated with soap and water, clipping it off with scissors is preferable to shaving. Shaving may cut the skin and allow contamination to enter the body. Skin and wound decontamination should continue until the Geiger-Muller counter shows that the radioactivity is gone or almost gone, until washing does not substantially reduce the amount of radioactivity measured, or until further cleaning risks damaging the skin. Burns should be gently rinsed but not scrubbed. Certain measures can decrease internal contamination. If people have recently swallowed a significant amount of radioactive material, vomiting may be induced. Some radioactive materials have specific chemical treatments that can reduce their absorption after being swallowed or help speed their removal from the body. If administered shortly before or soon after internal contamination with radioactive iodine, potassium iodide very effectively prevents the thyroid gland from absorbing the radioactive iodine, thus reducing the risk of thyroid cancer and thyroid injury. Potassium iodide is effective only for radioactive iodine, not other radioactive elements. Other drugs, such as zinc or calcium diethylenetriamine penta-acetate (DTPA—for plutonium, yttrium, californium, and americium), calcium or aluminum phosphate solutions (for radioactive strontium), and Prussian blue (for radioactive cesium, rubidium, and thallium), can be given intravenously or by mouth to remove a fraction of certain radionuclides after they have entered the body. However, except for potassium iodide, which is very effective, drugs given to reduce internal contamination reduce exposure by only about 25 to 75%. Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by taking drugs to prevent vomiting (antiemetics). Such drugs are routinely given to people undergoing radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Dehydration is treated with fluids given intravenously. People with the gastrointestinal or hematopoietic syndrome are kept isolated to minimize their contact with infectious microorganisms. Blood transfusions and injections of growth factors that stimulate blood cell production (such as erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factor) are given to increase blood counts.

People with the gastrointestinal syndrome require antiemetics, fluids given intravenously, and sedatives. Some people may be able to eat a bland diet. Antibiotics are given by mouth to kill bacteria in the intestine that may invade the body. Antibiotics as well as antifungal and antiviral medications also are given intravenously when necessary. Treatment for the cerebrovascular syndrome is geared toward providing comfort by relieving pain, anxiety, and breathing difficulties. Medications are given to control seizures.

If these wounds fail to heal satisfactorily over time, they may be repaired surgically with skin grafts or other procedures. People who survive may need regular monitoring for cataracts and thyroid disorders, but no other regular monitoring is needed.

The bacteria deconjugate bile salts, causing failure of micelle formation and subsequent fat malabsorption. Severe bacterial overgrowth also damages the intestinal mucosa. Fat malabsorption and mucosal damage can cause diarrhea. Symptoms and Signs of Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome The most common symptom of SIBO is bloating. The other symptoms are abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and excess flatulence. Some patients have significant diarrhea or steatorrhea. (See also the American Journal of Gastroenterology's guidelines for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.) Diagnosis of Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome Breath tests Quantitative culture of intestinal aspirate Imaging studies Some clinicians advocate response to empiric antibiotic therapy as a diagnostic test.

Symptoms include diarrhea... read more ) and adverse effects of the antibiotics can worsen symptoms of diarrhea, establishing a definitive etiology is preferred. (See also the American Journal of Gastroenterology's guidelines for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.) Breath testing, specifically with glucose hydrogen or lactulose hydrogen, is suggested in symptomatic patients for the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Before breath testing, it is recommended that patients avoid use of antibiotics for 4 weeks and avoid promotility agents and laxatives for at least 1 week. The standard for diagnosis of SIBO is quantitative culture of intestinal fluid aspirate showing a bacterial count > 103 colony-forming units/mL. This method, however, requires endoscopy. If the anatomic alterations are not due to previous surgery, an upper gastrointestinal series with small-bowel follow-through should be done to identify predisposing anatomic lesions. Alternatively, CT enterography or magnetic resonance enterography can be done. Treatment of Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome Oral antibiotics (various) Dietary modification Treatment of bacterial overgrowth syndrome is with 10 to 14 days of oral antibiotics that cover both aerobic and anaerobic enteric bacteria. Empiric regimens include use of one or two of the following: Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 500 mg 3 times a day Cephalexin 250 mg 4 times a day Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg 2 times a day Metronidazole 250 to 500 mg 3 or 4 times a day Rifaximin 550 mg 3 times a day Ciprofloxacin 500 mg 2 times a day Antibiotic treatment can be cyclic, if symptoms tend to recur, and changed based on culture and sensitivity. Changing antibiotic treatment may be difficult, however, due to coexistence of multiple bacteria. Because bacteria metabolize primarily carbohydrates in the intestinal lumen rather than fats, a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates and fiber is beneficial. Underlying conditions and nutritional deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12) should be corrected. Key Points Anatomic alterations in stomach or intestines or intestinal motility disorders lead to gastrointestinal stasis and thus bacterial overgrowth. Bacteria deconjugate bile salts, causing fat malabsorption. Diagnosis is made using a glucose-hydrogen or lactulose-hydrogen breath test or quantitative culture of intestinal aspirate. Oral antibiotics are used, and a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet is followed. More Information The following is an English-language resource that may be useful.

This condition is a reaction to an untreated streptococcal throat infection. Children may have a combination of joint pain, fever, chest pain or palpitations, jerky uncontrollable movements, a rash, and small bumps under the skin. The diagnosis is based on symptoms. Prompt and complete antibiotic treatment of any streptococcal throat infection is the best way to prevent rheumatic fever. Aspirin is given to alleviate pain, and antibiotics are given to eliminate the streptococcal infection. Although rheumatic fever occurs after a streptococcal throat infection (strep throat Sore Throat Sore throat is pain in the back of the throat. The pain can be severe and is usually worsened by swallowing. Many people with sore throat refuse to eat or drink. Sometimes pain is also felt... Common.TooltipReadMore ), it is not an infection. Rather, it is an inflammatory reaction to the streptococcal infection. The parts of the body most commonly affected by the inflammation include the Joints Heart Skin Nervous system Most people with rheumatic fever recover, but the heart is permanently damaged in a small percentage of people. Rheumatic fever can occur at any age but occurs most often between ages 5 years and 15 years. In the United States, rheumatic fever rarely develops before age 3 or after age 21 and is much less common than in developing countries, probably because antibiotics are widely used to treat streptococcal infections at an early stage. However, the incidence of rheumatic fever sometimes rises and falls in a particular area for unknown reasons. Overcrowded living conditions, undernutrition, and lower social and economic status seem to increase the risk of rheumatic fever. Heredity seems to play a part because the tendency to develop rheumatic fever appears to run in families. In the United States, a child who has a streptococcal throat infection but is not treated has only a less than 1 to 3% chance of developing rheumatic fever. However, about half of the children who have had rheumatic fever develop it again after another streptococcal throat infection if that infection is not treated. Rheumatic fever occurs after streptococcal infections of the throat but not after streptococcal infections of the skin (impetigo Impetigo and Ecthyma Impetigo is a superficial skin infection, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both, that leads to the formation of scabby, yellow-crusted sores and, sometimes...

Symptoms of Rheumatic Fever Symptoms of rheumatic fever vary greatly, depending on which parts of the body become inflamed. Typically, symptoms begin 2 to 3 weeks after the disappearance of throat symptoms. The most common symptoms of rheumatic fever are Joint pain Fever Chest pain or palpitations caused by heart inflammation (carditis) Jerky, uncontrollable movements (Sydenham chorea) Rash Small bumps (nodules) under the skin A child may have one symptom or several symptoms. Joints Joint pain and fever are the most common first symptoms. One or several joints suddenly become painful and feel tender when touched. They may also be warm, swollen, and red. Joints may be stiff and may contain fluid. Ankles, knees, elbows, and wrists are usually affected. The shoulders, hips, and small joints of the hands and feet also may be affected. As pain in one joint lessens, pain in another joint starts (called migratory pain). Joint pains may be mild or severe and typically last about 2 weeks and rarely more than 4 weeks. Rheumatic fever does not cause long-term joint damage. Heart Some children with heart inflammation have no symptoms, and the inflammation is recognized years later when heart damage is discovered. Some children feel their heart beating rapidly. Other children have chest pain caused by inflammation of the sac around the heart (pericarditis Acute Pericarditis Acute pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the flexible two-layered sac that envelops the heart) that begins suddenly, is often painful, and causes fluid and blood components such...

Heart inflammation disappears gradually, usually within 5 months. However, it may permanently damage the heart valves, resulting in rheumatic heart disease. The likelihood of developing rheumatic heart disease varies with the severity of the initial heart inflammation and also depends on whether recurring streptococcal infections are treated. In rheumatic heart disease, the valve between the left atrium and ventricle (mitral valve) is most commonly damaged. The valve may become leaky (mitral valve regurgitation Mitral Regurgitation Mitral regurgitation is leakage of blood backward through the mitral valve each time the left ventricle contracts.

It lasts for only a short time, sometimes less than a day. Small, hard, painless lumps (nodules) may form under the skin in children with heart or joint inflammation. The nodules typically appear near the affected joints and go away after a while. Nervous system Jerky, uncontrollable movements, usually of both arms and legs and particularly of the face, feet, and hands, called Sydenham chorea may begin gradually in children with rheumatic fever but usually only after all other symptoms have subsided. A month may go by before the jerky movements become so intense that the child is taken to a doctor. By then, the child typically has rapid, purposeless, sporadic movements that disappear during sleep. The movements may involve any muscle except those of the eyes. They may begin in the hands and spread to the feet and face. Facial grimacing (a distorted expression on the face) is common. Children may cluck their tongue, or the tongue may dart in and out of the mouth. In mild cases, children may seem clumsy and may have slight difficulties in dressing and eating. In severe cases, children may have to be protected from injuring themselves with their flailing arms or legs. The chorea lasts between 4 months and 8 months. Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Established clinical criteria Throat cultures Blood tests Electrocardiography and often echocardiography A doctor bases the diagnosis of rheumatic fever on the a combination of symptoms and test results called the Modified Jones Criteria (see How Do Doctors Diagnose Rheumatic Fever? How Do Doctors Diagnose Rheumatic Fever? ). Although there is no laboratory test that specifically diagnoses rheumatic fever, doctors do blood tests to look for high levels of antibodies to streptococci. Doctors also look for streptococci by swabbing the child's throat and sending the swab to a laboratory for examination. Other blood tests, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein, help doctors determine whether inflammation is present in the body and how widespread it is. The ESR and C-reactive protein are increased when inflammation is present. Doctors do electrocardiography Electrocardiography Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded.

Laboratory tests, imaging tests, or other diagnostic procedures are sometimes... Common.TooltipReadMore ) and do tests on the fluid. How Do Doctors Diagnose Rheumatic Fever? Doctors diagnose children with rheumatic fever if they have had a streptococcal infection and 2 major criteria or 1 major criterion and 2 minor criteria: Major criteria for rheumatic fever: Inflammation of the heart (carditis) Jerky, uncontrollable movements (Sydenham chorea) Rash (erythema marginatum) Redness, pain, and swelling (arthritis) in several joints Bumps (nodules) under the skin Minor criteria for rheumatic fever: Pain in several joints (without redness or swelling) Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein Fever Abnormal heart rhythms Prognosis for Rheumatic Fever Rheumatic fever and some of the problems it causes, such as inflammation of the heart and Sydenham chorea, can return. Episodes of Sydenham chorea usually last several months and resolve completely in most people, but the disorder returns in about one third of people. Joint problems (such as pain and swelling) are not permanent, but the heart inflammation can be permanent and severe, especially if streptococcal infections return and are not treated. Heart murmurs caused by rheumatic fever eventually disappear in some people, but most people have permanent murmurs and some degree of heart valve damage. Treatment of Rheumatic Fever Antibiotics Aspirin Sometimes corticosteroids Treatment of rheumatic fever has three goals: Eliminating any remaining streptococcal infection Reducing inflammation, particularly in the joints and heart, and thus relieving symptoms Preventing future infections Doctors give children with rheumatic fever antibiotics to eliminate any remaining infection. A long-acting penicillin is given as a single injection or penicillin or amoxicillin is given by mouth for 10 days. Aspirin is given in high doses for several weeks to reduce inflammation and pain, particularly if inflammation has reached the joints and heart. Some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen, may be as effective as aspirin, but, in most children, aspirin is preferred for the treatment of rheumatic fever. If heart inflammation is severe, corticosteroids such as prednisone are recommended in addition to aspirin and may be given by vein (intravenously) or by mouth to further reduce inflammation. Children should limit their activities if they have joint pain, chorea, or heart failure. Children who do not have inflammation of the heart do not need to limit their activities after the illness subsides. Prolonged bed rest is not helpful. Preventive treatment (antibiotic prophylaxis) The best way to prevent rheumatic fever is with prompt and complete antibiotic treatment of any streptococcal throat infection. In addition, children who have had rheumatic fever should be given drugs (typically penicillin) by mouth every day or by monthly injections into the muscle to help prevent another streptococcal infection. When antibiotics are given to people who do not yet have an infection, this preventive treatment is called prophylaxis. How long this preventive treatment should be continued is unclear. It depends on the severity of the disease and is usually continued for at least 5 years or until age 21 (whichever is longer). Some doctors recommend that it should be continued for life in certain people, such as those who have lasting heart valve damage and have close contact with young children (because the children may carry streptococcal bacteria, which could reinfect such people).

Pathophysiology of Eye Pain The cornea is richly innervated and highly sensitive to pain.

Table Evaluation of Eye Pain History History of present illness should address the onset, quality, and severity of pain and any history of prior episodes (eg, daily episodes in clusters). Important associated symptoms include true photophobia (shining a light into the unaffected eye causes pain in the affected eye when the affected eye is shut), decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation and pain when blinking, and pain when moving the eye.

Eye examination should be as complete as possible for patients with eye pain. Best corrected visual acuity is checked. Visual fields are typically tested by confrontation in patients with eye pain, but this test can be insensitive (particularly for small defects) and unreliable because of poor patient cooperation. A light is moved from one eye to the other to check for pupillary size and direct and consensual pupillary light responses. In patients who have unilateral eye pain, a light is shined in the unaffected eye while the affected eye is shut; pain in the affected eye represents true photophobia. Extraocular movements are checked. The orbital and periorbital structures are inspected. Conjunctival injection that seems most intense and confluent around the cornea and limbus is called ciliary flush. Slit-lamp examination is done if possible. The cornea is stained with fluorescein and examined under magnification with cobalt blue light. If a slit lamp is unavailable, the cornea can be examined after fluorescein staining with a Wood light using magnification. Ophthalmoscopy is done, and ocular pressures are measured (tonometry). In patients with a foreign body sensation or unexplained corneal abrasions, the eyelids are everted and examined for foreign bodies.

If pain develops in the affected eye in response to shining light in the unaffected eye when the affected eye is shut (true photophobia), the cause is most often a corneal lesion or uveitis. Ciliary flush suggests that inflammation is within the eye (eg, due to uveitis or glaucoma) and not the conjunctiva. If topical anesthetic drops (eg, proparacaine) abolish pain in a red eye, the cause is probably a corneal disorder. Some findings are more suggestive of particular disorders. Pain and photophobia days after blunt eye trauma suggest posttraumatic uveitis. Hammering or drilling metal is a risk factor for occult metal intraocular foreign body. Pain with movement of extraocular muscles and loss of pupillary light response that is disproportionate to loss of visual acuity suggest optic neuritis.

Lung flow rate measurements The assessment of a lung disorder often involves testing how much air the lungs can hold (lung volume) as well as how much and how quickly air can be exhaled (airflow). Airflow measurements are made with a spirometer, which consists of a mouthpiece and tubing connected to a recording device. The person’s lips should be held tightly around the mouthpiece, and nose clips should be worn to ensure that all the air inhaled or exhaled goes through the mouth. A person inhales deeply, then exhales forcefully as quickly as possible through the tubing while measurements are taken. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled and the length of time each breath takes are recorded and analyzed. This measurement is repeated several times to be sure the results are consistent.

Next, a deep inhalation is recorded as a larger dotted semicircle on the bottom, and a full exhalation is recorded as a dotted descending curve on top. Video from Lahey Clinic Media Center. A simpler device for measuring how quickly air can be exhaled is the small, hand-held peak flow meter. After inhaling deeply, a person blows into this device as hard as possible.

Increased stiffness of the lungs causes lower lung volume measurements. In disorders such as COPD, decreased elasticity of the lungs makes it difficult to breathe out. More air is trapped in the lungs, causing higher than expected lung volume measurements. Lung volume measurements made using spirometry are only estimates. More accurate measurements can be made using Body plethysmography Gas dilution In body plethysmography, a person sits inside an airtight plastic box. Because the box is airtight, the volume of air the person breathes in and the change in air pressure during breathing can be measured. A computer calculates lung volumes based on these measurements. Using gas dilution, a person breathes in a known amount of a gas, usually helium. A computer calculates lung volume based on how much gas the person exhales. Flow rate testing Most spirometers can continuously display lung volumes and flow rates during a forced breathing maneuver. These flow rates can be particularly helpful in detecting abnormalities that partially block the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea). Muscle strength assessment The strength of the respiratory muscles can be measured by having the person forcibly inhale and exhale against a pressure gauge.

Muscle strength can also be assessed by having the person do spirometry while sitting up and while lying down. Diffusing capacity measurement A diffusing capacity test can estimate how efficiently oxygen is transferred from the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) to the bloodstream. Because the diffusing capacity of oxygen is difficult to measure directly, a person inhales a small amount of carbon monoxide, holds the breath for 10 seconds, and then exhales into a carbon monoxide detector. If the test shows that carbon monoxide is not well absorbed, oxygen will not be exchanged normally between the lungs and the bloodstream either.

A person is instructed to breathe as rapidly and deeply as possible through a spirometer for a predetermined period of time, usually 15 to 30 seconds. The volume of air moved over that period of time is measured. MVV will be decreased in diseases that affect airflow or weaken respiratory muscles. Because this test is dependent upon the ability of a person to cooperate, it is not used as often as other lung function tests.

The office may be in a medical office building, a clinic, a hospital, or elsewhere. Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or x-rays, are often done in a doctor’s office. Some doctors' offices offer treatments, such as physical therapy. Hospitals Hospitals Hospital Care provide the most comprehensive medical care. For older people in particular, staying in a hospital increases the risk of problems Problems Due to Hospitalization Just being in the hospital can cause certain problems, particularly infections (called hospital-acquired infections). Other problems include Problems associated with extended bed rest, including... read more such as infections, pressure sores, confusion, and incontinence. Because of these risks, older people should be hospitalized only if they are very ill. Older people may enter the hospital through the emergency department or be scheduled for admission by a doctor. A doctor (who may be the person's primary care doctor, a specialist, or a staff doctor at the hospital) is in charge of the person’s care in the hospital. Sometimes several other doctors are involved. Nurses, who are available 24 hours a day, provide much of the care. A nurse is always available, but doctors may come and go at more irregular times.

Observation care is care within a hospital for people who are not well enough to go home but are not ill enough to meet the requirements for actual hospital admission. With observation care, practitioners can do tests and give treatments for a day or two before deciding whether people need to be admitted. Such people are observed briefly in an emergency department, a special observation unit, or a regular hospital room, even though they are not actually admitted to the hospital. The difference between admission and observation is important because Medicare considers observation care an outpatient service. Thus, Medicare does not cover rehabilitation services after observation care. Surgical centers Surgical centers are places where same-day surgery or other procedures may be done. Such procedures include those that typically require anesthesia, that are too complicated to be done in a doctor’s office, but that do not require an overnight stay in a hospital. Common examples are endoscopy, colonoscopy, and removal of cataracts. Surgical centers may be located in a hospital or be a separate, free-standing facility. Many communities without hospitals have surgical centers. Then, people can have procedures in their own community without needing to travel to a more distant hospital. Rehabilitation facilities After discharge from the hospital, people with a severe disability may need to continue their recovery in a rehabilitation facility Rehabilitation . A rehabilitation facility may be located in a hospital or a nursing home or be a separate facility. These facilities provide skilled nursing care and physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Usually, people need to have been admitted to a hospital for 3 days to be eligible for Medicare to pay for the rehabilitation facility. A waiver of the 3-day hospital stay requirement is available in some cases, including with some Medicare Advantage plans. When people are admitted to a rehabilitation facility, an interdisciplinary team tries to anticipate how long their stay will be. For older people, the stay may range from a few days to a few months. Goals for progress are set, and progress is evaluated every day. Thus, the types and amount of therapy can be adjusted as needed. Some older people may be able to stay at home and get rehabilitation therapy as an outpatient at a rehabilitation facility. Home health care People who are frail or who have recently been discharged from a hospital or rehabilitation facility often need care in their home. This care is often provided by family members and/or friends. But when such help is not available or when older people need more help than family members and friends can provide, older people may be eligible to receive home health care services from a home health care agency Care of Older People in the Home Older people may need care in their home when they are frail or weak, particularly after they have been discharged from the hospital or a rehabilitation facility. Simple care is usually provided... read more . These agencies send registered nurses, therapists, home health aides, and/or social workers depending on the person's needs and insurance coverage. Currently, the number of practitioners who will visit people in their home is increasing. Care is provided by teams consisting of doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and social workers. A visit in the home can be very helpful because it is more convenient for older people, and it enables practitioners to see how people are doing in their usual living environment. End-of-life (hospice Hospice care Health care for older people may be provided in a variety of settings. Most older people receive medical care in their primary care doctor's office. The office may be in a medical office building... read more ) care may also be provided in the home. Community services In the United States, one source of support services and health care in the community is a senior center. These centers provide social, recreational, and educational activities, and some serve meals—an important service for people who cannot prepare their own. Day care centers Day Care for Older People Day care for older people may involve Treating a problem Maintaining the person's condition Providing social activities or mental health care (such as group therapy) People can go to day care... read more are another community-based service. Day care centers charge for services. However, they can provide a break for caregivers during the day so that caregivers can, for example, keep their job. Some day care centers also provide some health care. For example, these centers may have a nurse and/or nursing assistants on duty. The nurse can check blood pressure, make sure people are taking their medications as instructed, and provide health information. Nursing assistants can help make sure that older people's toileting needs are taken care of and that they are fed as needed during the day. When there are medical concerns, the nurse may contact the person's primary care practitioner or family members. Some day care centers provide day care for people with mild to moderate dementia, and some provide physical and occupational therapy. Other services available in the community include meal delivery programs (such as Meals on Wheels), transportation services, help with daily activities, support groups, and respite care. Some religious communities provide many of these services. These services are usually inexpensive, and some are free. People can obtain information about community services, including senior centers, from the hospital discharge planning or case management department, home health care agencies, local health departments, and religious communities. Senior centers can also be found by using the internet. Did You Know... Some senior day care centers have a nurse on duty to provide some health care, such as checking blood pressure. Post-acute and long-term care Post-acute care is care immediately after hospital discharge for people who need more care than they can get at home but do not clearly need long-term care. Post-acute care facilities provide a variety of health services including skilled nursing care and physical and occupational rehabilitation to help people regain their strength and function. Most people ultimately return to their home. However, some do not recover all of their function and may require long-term care. The prospect of needing long-term care services concerns many older people. The likelihood of needing long-term care increases greatly as people age because older people are more likely to develop chronic disorders and to have problems functioning. How long care is needed varies from weeks to years to indefinitely. Long-term care is focused on helping people maintain function. It helps them do the activities necessary to care for themselves and to live as independently as possible. These activities include basic daily activities (such as eating, dressing, bathing, grooming, and walking) and other activities (such as shopping, balancing a checkbook, doing laundry, and housecleaning). Long-term care includes help with health care such as taking vital signs, monitoring weight, and giving medicine. Most long-term care facilities also provide social and recreational activities. Table Many people have their first experience with post-acute and long-term care after a hospital stay. During an illness or after an injury, many older people lose some or all of the ability to care for themselves. Thus, although they may be well enough to leave the hospital, they may need to go to a post-acute and long-term care facility for rehabilitation and recovery. This move can be physically and psychologically demanding. People have to adjust to many new faces and to new routines for sleeping, bathing, dressing, eating, and other daily activities. The move happens quickly, with little time to adjust. Most people associate long-term care with a change in residence: To the home of a family member To a retirement community Retirement Communities Retirement communities are designed for people who can live independently but who need or want some help, mainly with caring for a home.

The decision to move to a nursing home may be triggered by a change in... read more Older people may be particularly concerned about moving to an institution. People live in institutions for a variety of social and economic reasons. The most common reasons are physical problems and/or problems with mental function (cognition) plus lack of adequate social support. What type of arrangement is possible depends partly on a person's needs (medical, functional, social, and emotional), preferences, and financial and social resources such as long-term care insurance, availability of state waiver programs, and family members’ willingness and ability to help. One person may be able to live at home with the help of a spouse. Another person with similar problems but without family support may need to go to a nursing home. Learning about the many types of long-term care facilities can help people choose the right time and place for long-term care. Each type of long-term care facility provides different services and levels of health care. After the type of arrangement is determined, a particular facility must be carefully chosen. Even within each type, facilities differ considerably in environment, services (including health care), activities, living arrangements, and rules. Sometimes the difference is simply a matter of what people can afford, but even within a price range, quality varies. Delaying the Need for a Long-Term Care Facility The idea of going to a long-term care facility, particularly a nursing home, does not appeal to most people. The following problems are common reasons for entering a long-term care facility. However, sometimes problems can be solved, and the need for a long-term care facility can be delayed or avoided. Urinary incontinence Urinary Incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. Incontinence can occur in both men and women at any age, but it is more common among women and older people, affecting about 30% of older women... read more : People with urinary incontinence may be hard to care for at home. However, urinary incontinence may be caused by a disorder that can be treated. Treating the disorder may cure the incontinence. People with urinary incontinence, their family members, or their caregivers should talk with a doctor to find out whether treatment is possible. Problems with doing daily activities: Certain devices can help people function better. A physical or occupational therapist or a home health nurse can observe people in their home and can sometimes help them choose and learn how to use appropriate devices that will enable them to continue to function safely at home. Dementia Dementia Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. Typically, symptoms include memory loss, problems using language and... read more : Taking care of people with dementia is difficult and frustrating. However, family members can learn ways of dealing with the older person's frustrating or disruptive behavior. For example, to minimize complications from wandering, family members can place an identification bracelet on the person or purchase or rent a monitoring device. Learning more about how to care for people with dementia may delay the need for a long-term care facility. Caregiver burnout Avoiding Caregiver Burnout : Strongly motivated family members can usually provide elaborate and detailed care. However, providing such care can wear them out physically and emotionally. Talking with health care practitioners can help. They can provide information about caregiving support groups and about groups that provide temporary (respite) care. Financial issues: People can buy long-term care insurance that covers care in the home. This care typically involves helping people with personal care, such as bathing, grooming, and eating. Such insurance may enable people to postpone going to a long-term care facility. Hospice care When people have a progressive, incurable disorder and death is expected in the near future, hospice care Hospice Care Hospice is a concept and a program of care that is specifically designed to minimize suffering for dying people and their family members. In the United States, hospice is the only widely available... read more provides the treatments and services needed to control symptoms, ease pain, and help people and their family members prepare for the death Death and Dying . Hospice care may be provided in a Person's home Nursing home Hospice facility The hospice care team usually involves a primary care practitioner, nurse, social worker, and others who are trained to care for dying people. Pharmacists, counselors, physical therapists, ethicists, and trained volunteers may also be involved. Hospice personnel are needed to make sure that all of the person's physical and psychologic needs are met as well as the needs of the family and caregivers. Most people who receive hospice care do not have to go to a hospital before they die. Thus, they can die in a more comfortable, intimate environment, often with loved ones around them. Hospice care also involves helping family members recognize the physical signs that death is near, understand what to do when the person dies, and help them cope with the loss.

Volar splint Positioning The patient should be positioned so that the operator has appropriate access to the patient's affected hand. Splint the wrist at 10 to 20° extension. Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Wear nonsterile gloves. Apply stockinette, covering the area from distal to the MCP joints to the mid-forearm. Make a hole in the stockinette to allow protrusion of the thumb. Wrap the padding from the MCP joint to the mid-forearm slightly beyond the area to be covered by the splint material; overlap each turn by half the width of the padding and periodically tear the wrapping across its width to decrease the risk of tissue compression. Smooth the padding as necessary. Tear away any areas of excess padding to prevent areas of increased pressure on the skin. Lay out a length of splint material matching the distance from just proximal to the MCP joints to the mid-forearm volar surface of the forearm—it should be just shorter than the area covered by the padding. Unroll additional splint material, folding it back and forth along the first length until there are 8 to 10 layers (when using single-layer rolls). Alternatively, if using ready-made splint material, cut a single piece to the above length. Immerse the splinting material in lukewarm water. Squeeze excess water from the splinting material (do not wring out plaster). Apply the splint material from the MCP joints to the mid-forearm along the volar surface. Fold the extra stockinette and cotton padding over the edges of the splinting material. Wrap the elastic wrap over the splinting material distally to proximally and overlap each revolution by half the width of the elastic wrap. Smooth out the splinting material using your palms rather than your fingertips to conform to the contour of the arm to fill in the interstices in the material. Maintain the wrist at 10 to 20° extension until the splinting material hardens. Check distal neurovascular status (eg, capillary refill, distal sensation, finger flexion and extension). How To Apply a Volar Arm Splint VIDEO Aftercare Advise the patient to keep the splint dry. Arrange or recommend appropriate follow-up. Instruct the patient to watch for complications such as worsening pain, paresthesias/numbness, and color change to the fingers. Instruct the patient to seek further care if pain cannot be controlled with oral drugs at home. Warnings and Common Errors Do not immobilize the wrist at 0° extension/flexion. Avoid flexion of the wrist. Tips and Tricks Warm water makes plaster set more quickly, so if you are unfamiliar with applying splints use cooler water to increase your working time.
