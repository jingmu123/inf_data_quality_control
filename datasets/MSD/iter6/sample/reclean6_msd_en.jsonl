Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography.  Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy.  Treatment usually includes surgical excision, often with radiation therapy, and with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or both.  In the US, breast cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic women (after lung/bronchial cancer) but is the leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic women .  In 2021 in women, there were 281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer 43,600 deaths from it 49,290 new cases of in situ breast cancer  Male breast cancer accounts for about 1% of total cases.  In 2021 in the US, there were 2650 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 530 deaths from it .  In men, manifestations, diagnosis, and management are the same, although men tend to present at a later stage. \n【1】Risk Factors for Breast Cancer For women in the US, cumulative lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 12% .  Much of the risk is incurred after age 60 Risk of dying of breast cancer is about 10% by 5 years after diagnosis .   Factors that may affect breast cancer risk include the following: Age: The strongest risk factor for breast cancer is age.  Median age at diagnosis is about 60 years .  Family history: Having a 1st-degree relative (mother, sister, daughter) with breast cancer doubles or triples risk of developing the cancer, but breast cancer in more distant relatives increases risk only slightly.  When ≥ 2 1st-degree relatives have breast cancer, risk may be 5 to 6 times higher.  Breast cancer gene mutation: About 5 to 10% of women with breast cancer carry a mutation in one of the two known breast cancer genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2.  The risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 is about 72% with a BRCA1 mutation and about 69% with a BRCA2 mutation.  Women with BRCA1 mutations also have an approximate 44% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer; risk among women with BRCA2 mutations is about 17% .  Women without a family history of breast cancer in at least two 1st-degree relatives are unlikely to carry this mutation and thus do not require screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.  Men who carry a BRCA mutation have a 1 to 2% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.  The mutations are more common among Ashkenazi Jews.  Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations require closer surveillance or preventive measures, such as screening with both mammography and MRI, taking tamoxifen or raloxifene, or undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy.  Personal history: Having had in situ or invasive breast cancer increases risk.  Risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast after mastectomy is about 0. 5 to 1%/year of follow-up.  Gynecologic history: Early menarche, late menopause, or late first pregnancy increases risk.  Women who have a first pregnancy after age 30 are at higher risk than those who are nulliparous.  Breast changes: History of a lesion that required a biopsy is associated with a slightly increased risk.  Women with multiple breast masses but no histologic confirmation of a high-risk histology should not be considered at high risk.  Benign lesions associated with a slightly increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer include complex fibroadenoma, moderate or florid hyperplasia (without atypia), sclerosing adenosis, and papilloma.  Risk is about 4 or 5 times higher than average in patients with atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and about 10 times higher if they have a family history of invasive breast cancer in a 1st-degree relative.  Increased breast density seen on screening mammography is associated with a 1. 2- to 2. 1-fold increased risk of breast cancer .  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): Having LCIS increases the risk of developing invasive carcinoma in either breast by about 7 to 12 times ; invasive carcinoma develops in about 1 to 2% of patients with LCIS annually.  Use of oral contraceptives: Study results vary regarding the use of oral contraceptives and risk of breast cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules. \n【2】 Some studies have found a small increased risk in current or recent users .  Hormone therapy Menopause is physiologic or iatrogenic cessation of menses (amenorrhea) due to decreased ovarian function. \n【3】 After 5 years of use, the increased risk is about 7 or 8 more cases per 10,000 women for each year of use (about a 24% increase in relative risk).  Use of estrogen alone does not appear to increase risk of breast cancer (as reported in the Women's Health Initiative).  Selective estrogen-receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene) reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.  Radiation therapy: Exposure to radiation therapy before age 30 increases risk.  Mantle-field radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma about quadruples risk of breast cancer over the next 20 to 30 years.  Diet: Diet may contribute to development or growth of breast cancers, but conclusive evidence about the effect of a particular diet (eg, one high in fats) is lacking.  Obese postmenopausal women are at increased risk, but there is no evidence that dietary modification reduces risk.  For obese women who are menstruating later than normal, risk may be decreased.  Lifestyle factors: Smoking and alcohol may contribute to a higher risk of breast cancer.  Women are counseled to stop smoking and to reduce alcohol consumption.  In epidemiologic studies, alcohol intake is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer; however, causality is difficult to establish.  The American Cancer Society recommends no more than one alcoholic drink a day for women.  The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT), or Gail model Mammography , can be used to calculate a women's 5-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. \n【4】 Accessed 3/7/22.  6.

Cancers are divided into carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer.  Carcinoma in situ is proliferation of cancer cells within ducts or lobules and without invasion of stromal tissue.  There are 2 types: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): About 85% of carcinoma in situ are this type.  DCIS is usually detected only by mammography.  It may involve a small or wide area of the breast; if a wide area is involved, microscopic invasive foci may develop over time.  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS is often multifocal and bilateral.  There are 2 types: classic and pleomorphic.  Classic LCIS is not malignant but increases risk of developing invasive carcinoma in either breast.  This nonpalpable lesion is usually detected via biopsy; it is rarely visualized with mammography.  Pleomorphic LCIS behaves more like DCIS; it should be excised to negative margins.  Invasive carcinoma is primarily adenocarcinoma.  About 80% is the infiltrating ductal type; most of the remaining cases are infiltrating lobular.  Rare types include medullary, mucinous, metaplastic, and tubular carcinomas.  Mucinous carcinoma tends to develop in older women and be slow growing.  Women with most of these rare types of breast cancer have a much better prognosis than women with other types of invasive breast cancer.  However, the prognosis for women with metaplastic breast cancer is significantly worse than other types of ductal breast cancer.  Inflammatory breast cancer is a fast-growing, particularly aggressive, and often fatal cancer.  Cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels in breast skin; as a result, the breast appears inflamed, and the skin appears thickened, resembling orange peel (peau d’orange).  Usually, inflammatory breast cancer spreads to the lymph nodes in the armpit.  The lymph nodes feel like hard lumps.  However, often no mass is felt in the breast itself because this cancer is dispersed throughout the breast.  Paget disease of the nipple Paget disease is a rare type of carcinoma that appears as a unilateral eczematous to psoriasiform plaque of the nipple and areola. \n【6】 Characteristic malignant cells called Paget cells are present in the epidermis.  Women with Paget disease of the nipple often have underlying invasive or in situ cancer.  Pathophysiology of Breast Cancer invades locally and spreads through the regional lymph nodes, bloodstream, or both.  Metastatic breast cancer may affect almost any organ in the body—most commonly, lungs, liver, bone, brain, and skin.  Most skin metastases occur near the site of breast surgery; scalp metastases are uncommon.  Some breast cancers may recur sooner than others; recurrence can often be predicted based on tumor markers.  For example, metastatic breast cancer may occur within 3 years in patients who are negative for tumor markers or occur > 10 years after initial diagnosis and treatment in patients who have an estrogen-receptor positive tumor.  Hormone receptors Estrogen and progesterone receptors, present in some breast cancers, are nuclear hormone receptors that promote DNA replication and cell division when the appropriate hormones bind to them.  Thus, drugs that block these receptors may be useful in treating tumors with the receptors.  About two thirds of postmenopausal patients with cancer have an estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) tumor.  Incidence of ER+ tumors is lower among premenopausal patients.  Another cellular receptor is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also called HER2/neu or ErbB2); its presence correlates with a poorer prognosis at any given stage of cancer.  In about 20% of patients with breast cancer, HER2 receptors are overexpressed.  Drugs that block these receptors are part of standard treatment for these patients.  Breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations increase the risk of developing breast cancer to 70% .  Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer by 90% and should be offered to women with a BRCA mutation.  Other genetic mutations that increase the risk of developing breast cancer include mutations in CHEK2, PALB2, ATM, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1, and TP53, which are usually included in panel genetic testing . \n【7】 Symptoms and Signs of Breast Cancer Many breast cancers are discovered as a mass by the patient or during routine physical examination or mammography.  Infrequently, the presenting symptom is breast enlargement or a nondescript thickening of the breast.  Breast pain may be present but is almost never the sole presenting symptom of breast cancer.  Some types of breast cancer manifest with notable skin changes: Paget disease of the nipple is associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma and manifests as skin changes, including erythema, crusting, scaling, and discharge; these changes usually appear so benign that the patient ignores them, delaying diagnosis for a year or more.  About 50% of patients with Paget disease of the nipple have a palpable mass at presentation.  Inflammatory breast cancer manifests as erythema and enlargement of the breast, often without a mass, and skin may be discolored or appear thickened, resembling orange peel (peau d’orange).  A nipple discharge is common.  A few patients with breast cancer present with signs of metastatic disease (eg, pathologic fracture, abdominal pain, jaundice, dyspnea).  A common finding during physical examination is asymmetry or a dominant mass—a mass distinctly different from the surrounding breast tissue.  Diffuse fibrotic changes in a quadrant of the breast, usually the upper outer quadrant, are more characteristic of benign disorders; a slightly firmer thickening in one breast but not the other may be a sign of cancer.  More advanced breast cancers are characterized by one or more of the following: Fixation of the mass to the chest wall or to overlying skin Satellite nodules or ulcers in the skin Matted or fixed axillary lymph nodes suggest tumor spread, as does supraclavicular or infraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  Screening for Breast Cancer Women should be screened for breast cancer .  All professional societies agree on this concept, although they differ on the recommended age at which to start screening and the precise frequency of screening.  Screening modalities include Mammography (including digital and 3-dimensional) Clinical breast examination (CBE) by health care practitioners Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for high-risk patients Mammography In mammography, low-dose x-rays of both breasts are taken in 2 views (oblique and craniocaudal).  Mammography is more accurate in women over 50, partly because with aging, fibroglandular tissue in breasts tends to be replaced with fatty tissue, which can be more easily distinguished from abnormal tissue.  Mammography is less sensitive in women with dense breast tissue, and some states mandate informing patients that they have dense breast tissue when it is detected by screening mammography.  Women with dense breast tissue may require additional imaging tests (eg, breast tomosynthesis [3-dimensional mammography], MRI).  Screening mammography guidelines for women with average risk of breast cancer vary, but generally, screening starts at age 40, 45, or 50 and is repeated every year or two until age 75 or life expectancy is < 10 years Clinicians should make sure that patients understand what their individual risk of breast cancer is and ask patients what their preference for testing is.  A woman is considered at average risk if her lifetime risk of breast cancer is < 15%.  Concerns about when and how often to do screening mammography include Rate of false-positive results Risks and costs Only about 10 to 15% of abnormalities detected on screening mammography result from cancer—an 85 to 90% false-positive rate.  False-negative results may exceed 15% .  Many of the false-positives are caused by benign lesions (eg, cysts, fibroadenomas), but there are concerns about detecting lesions that meet histologic definitions of cancer but do not develop into invasive cancer during a patient's lifetime.  Breast tomosynthesis (3-dimensional mammography), done with digital mammography, increases the rate of cancer detection slightly and decreases the rate of recall imaging ; this test is helpful for women with dense breast tissue.  However, the test exposes women to almost twice as much radiation as traditional mammography. \n【8】 When radiologic screening is started at a young age, risk of cancer is increased.  Breast examination Clinical breast examination (CBE) is usually part of routine annual care for women > 40 .  In the US, CBE augments rather than replaces screening mammography.  The American Cancer Society and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against screening with clinical breast examination (CBE); the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends counseling patients about its diagnostic limitations .  However, in some countries where mammography is considered too expensive, CBE is the sole screen; reports on its effectiveness in this role vary.  Breast self-examination (BSE) alone as a screening method has not shown a benefit and may result in higher rates of unnecessary breast biopsy.  The major professional organizations do not recommend it as part of routine screening.  However, women should be counseled about breast self-awareness, and if they notice changes in how their breasts appear or feel (eg, masses, thickening, enlargement), they should be encouraged to have a medical evaluation.  MRI is used for screening women with a high (eg, > 20%) risk of breast cancer, such as those with a BRCA gene mutation.  For these women, screening should include MRI as well as mammography and CBE.  MRI has higher sensitivity but may be less specific.  MRI may be recommended for women with dense breast tissue as part of overall assessment that includes evaluation of risk. \n【9】 Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Screening by mammography, breast examination, and imaging (eg, ultrasonography) Biopsy, including analysis for estrogen and progesterone receptors and for HER2 protein Breast symptoms (eg, pain, nipple discharge) or abnormal findings (eg, mass) detected during breast examination are typically evaluated first with breast ultrasonography.  If ultrasound results are abnormal or indeterminate, mammography is done.  Biopsy is done if imaging findings suggest cancer or if a palpable breast mass or other physical findings suggest cancer, even if imaging results are negative.  If advanced cancer is suspected based on physical examination, biopsy should be done first.  A prebiopsy bilateral mammogram may help delineate other areas that should be biopsied and provides a baseline for future reference.  Pearls & Pitfalls Biopsy should be done if physical findings (eg, palpable mass) suggest breast cancer, even if mammogram results are negative.  Biopsy Percutaneous core needle biopsy is preferred to surgical biopsy.  Core biopsy can be done guided by imaging or palpation (freehand).  Routinely, stereotactic biopsy (needle biopsy guided by mammography done in 2 planes and analyzed by computer to produce a 3-dimensional image) or ultrasound-guided biopsy is being used to improve accuracy.  Clips are placed at the biopsy site to identify it.  If core biopsy is not possible (eg, the lesion is too posterior), surgical biopsy can be done; a guidewire is inserted, using imaging for guidance, to help identify the biopsy site.  Any skin taken with the biopsy specimen should be examined because it may show cancer cells in dermal lymphatic vessels.  The excised specimen should be x-rayed, and the x-ray should be compared with the prebiopsy mammogram to determine whether all of the lesion has been removed.  If the original lesion contained microcalcifications, mammography is repeated when the breast is no longer tender, usually 6 to 12 weeks after biopsy, to check for residual microcalcifications.  If radiation therapy is planned, mammography should be done before radiation therapy begins.  Evaluation after cancer diagnosis After cancer is diagnosed, a multidisciplinary evaluation is usually done to plan further testing and treatment.  The core multidisciplinary team typically includes a breast surgical oncologist, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist.  A positive biopsy specimen should be analyzed for estrogen and progesterone receptors and for HER2 protein.  Cells from blood or saliva should be tested for inherited gene mutations that predispose to breast cancer when Breast cancer develops at age < 45.  The cancer does not have estrogen or progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2 protein (triple negative breast cancer).  Breast and ovarian cancers occur in the same patient.  Patients have lobular breast cancer plus a personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer.  Family history includes multiple cases of early-onset breast cancer.  Family history of multiple cases of ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer.  Patients have an Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.  Patient is male or family history includes any cases of male breast cancer.  Some experts have recommended that genetic testing be offered to all patients with breast cancer .  For these tests, the best approach is to refer patients to a genetic counselor, who can document a detailed family history, choose the most appropriate tests, and help interpret the results.  Chest x-ray, a complete blood count (CBC), liver tests, and measurement of serum calcium levels should be done to check for metastatic disease.  An oncologist should determine whether to measure serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, or CA 27-29 and whether bone scanning should be done.  For bone scanning, common indications include the following: Bone pain Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase Stage III or IV cancer Abdominal CT is done if patients have any of the following: Abnormal liver test results Abnormal abdominal or pelvic examination Stage III or IV cancer Chest CT is done if patients have either of the following: Pulmonary symptoms such as shortness of breath Stage III or IV cancer MRI is often used by surgeons for preoperative planning; it can accurately determine tumor size, chest wall involvement, and number of tumors.  Grading and staging Grading is based on histologic examination of the tissue taken during biopsy.  Tumor grade describes how abnormal tumor cells and tissue look under a microscope.  Staging follows the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification Because clinical examination and imaging have poor sensitivity for nodal involvement, staging is refined during surgery, when regional lymph nodes can be evaluated.  However, if patients have palpably abnormal axillary nodes, preoperative ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration or core biopsy may be done: If biopsy results are positive, axillary lymph node dissection is typically done during the definitive surgical procedure.  However, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may make sentinel lymph node biopsy possible if chemotherapy changes node status from N1 to N0.  (Results of intraoperative frozen section analysis determine whether axillary lymph node dissection will be needed. ) If results are negative, a sentinel lymph node biopsy, a less aggressive procedure, may be done instead.  Staging classification follows these models: The anatomic staging model, which is based on anatomy of the tumor and which is used in regions of the world where biomarkers cannot be routinely obtained The prognostic staging model, which is based on anatomy of the tumor as well as status of biomarkers and which is predominantly used in the US  Fertility preservation Patients with breast cancer should not become pregnant while being treated for breast cancer.  However, all patients who wish to preserve fertility should be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist to discuss fertility preservation before systemic therapy is initiated.  Options for fertility preservation include Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) with ovarian stimulation and oocyte and embryo cryopreservation Ovarian or testicular tissue cryopreservation Type of breast cancer, anticipated treatment, and patient preferences affect the type of fertility preservation that can be used.  Ovarian suppression (eg, with leuprolide) has been used to minimize the destruction of ova by chemotherapy, but its efficacy is unproven.  Diagnosis reference 1.  The American Society of Breast Surgeons: Official statement: Consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer.  Prognosis for Breast Cancer Long-term prognosis depends on tumor stage.  Nodal status (including number and location of nodes) correlates with disease-free and overall survival better than any other prognostic factor.  The 5-year survival rate (from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program) depends on cancer stage: Localized (confined to primary site): 99. 0% Regional (confined to regional lymph nodes): 85. 8% Distant (metastasized): 29. 0% Unknown: 57. 8% Poorer prognosis is associated with the following other factors: Young age: Prognosis appears worse for patients diagnosed with breast cancer during their 20s and 30s than for patients diagnosed during middle age.  Race: Breast cancer death rates from 2012 to 2016 were higher in the US in non-Hispanic Black females (28. 9 per 100,000) than in non-Hispanic White females .  Black women are diagnosed at a younger age compared with White women (median 59 versus 63 years) and are more likely to have triple negative disease.  Larger primary tumor: Larger tumors are more likely to be node-positive, but they also confer a worse prognosis independent of nodal status.  High-grade tumor: Patients with poorly differentiated tumors have a worse prognosis.  Absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors: Patients with ER+ tumors have a somewhat better prognosis and are more likely to benefit from endocrine therapy.  Patients with progesterone receptors on a tumor may also have a better prognosis.  Patients with both estrogen and progesterone receptors on a tumor may have a better prognosis than those who have only one of these receptors, but this benefit is not clear.  Presence of HER2 protein: When the HER2 gene (HER2/neu [erb-b2]) is amplified, HER2 is overexpressed, increasing cell growth and reproduction and often resulting in more aggressive tumor cells.  Overexpression of HER2 is an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis; it may also be associated with high histologic grade, ER− tumors, greater proliferation, and larger tumor size, which are all poor prognostic factors.  Presence of BRCA gene mutations: For any given stage, patients with the BRCA1 gene mutation appear to have a worse prognosis than those with sporadic tumors, perhaps because they have a higher proportion of high-grade, hormone receptor–negative cancers.  Patients with the BRCA2 gene mutation probably have the same prognosis as those without the mutation if the tumors have similar characteristics.  With either gene mutation, risk of a 2nd cancer in remaining breast tissue is increased (to perhaps as high as 40%).  Treatment of Breast Cancer Surgery Usually radiation therapy Systemic therapy: Endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or both For more detailed information about treatment, see NCCN Clinical Practice Guideline: Breast Cancer.  For most types of breast cancer, treatment involves surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy.  Choice of treatment depends on tumor and patient characteristics Recommendations for surgery are evolving and include early referral to a plastic or reconstruction surgeon for oncoplastic surgery (which combines cancer removal with reconstruction of the breast).   Surgery involves mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy.  Mastectomy is removal of the entire breast and includes the following types: Skin-sparing mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and enough skin to cover the wound, making breast reconstruction much easier, and spares axillary lymph nodes Nipple-sparing mastectomy: Same as skin-sparing mastectomy plus spares the nipple and areola Simple mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and axillary lymph nodes Modified radical mastectomy: Spares the pectoral muscles and removes some axillary lymph nodes Radical mastectomy: Removes axillary lymph nodes and the pectoral muscles Radical mastectomy is rarely done unless the cancer has invaded the pectoral muscles.  Breast-conserving surgery involves determining the size of the tumor and the required margins (based on the tumor's size relative to the volume of the breast), then surgically removing the tumor with its margins.  Various terms (eg, lumpectomy, wide excision, quadrantectomy) are used to describe how much breast tissue is removed.  For patients with invasive cancer, survival and recurrence rates with mastectomy do not differ significantly from those with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy as long as the entire tumor can be removed.  Thus, patient preference can guide choice of treatment within limits.  The main advantage of breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy is less extensive surgery and opportunity to keep the breasts.  The need for total removal of the tumor with a tumor-free margin overrides any cosmetic considerations.  Consulting a plastic surgeon about oncoplastic surgery may help if patients have ptotic (sagging) breasts, while also achieving good resection margins.  Some physicians use neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before removing it and applying radiation therapy; thus, some patients who might otherwise have required mastectomy can have breast-conserving surgery.  Lymph node evaluation During both mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery, axillary lymph nodes are typically evaluated.  Methods include Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) ALND is a fairly extensive procedure that involves removal of as many axillary nodes as possible; adverse effects, particularly lymphedema, are common.  Risk of lymphedema is increased for patients with a high preoperative body mass index (BMI ≥ 30) and for those with significant weight gain during and after breast cancer treatment .  Most clinicians now first do SLNB unless biopsy of clinically suspect nodes detected cancer; risk of lymphedema is less with SLNB.  Routine use of ALND is not justified because the main value of lymph node removal is diagnostic, not therapeutic, and SLNB has ≥ 95% sensitivity for axillary node involvement.  For SLNB, blue dye and/or radioactive colloid is injected around the breast, and a gamma probe (and when dye is used, direct inspection) is used to locate the nodes the tracer drains into.  Because these nodes are the first to receive the tracers, they are considered the most likely to receive any metastatic cells and are thus called sentinel nodes.  If any of the sentinel nodes contain cancer cells, ALND may be necessary, based on numerous factors such as Tumor stage Hormone receptor status Number of involved nodes Extranodal extension Patient characteristics  Some surgeons do frozen section analysis during mastectomy with SLNB and get prior agreement for ALND in case nodes are positive; others await standard pathology results and do ALND as a 2nd procedure if needed.  Frozen section analysis is not routinely done with lumpectomy.  Impaired lymphatic drainage of the ipsilateral arm often occurs after axillary node removal (ALND or SLNB) or radiation therapy, sometimes resulting in substantial swelling due to lymphedema.  Magnitude of the effect is roughly proportional to the number of nodes removed; thus, SLNB causes less lymphedema than ALND.  The lifetime risk of lymphedema after ALND is about 25%.  However, even with SLNB, there is a 6% lifetime risk of lymphedema.  To reduce risk of lymphedema, practitioners usually avoid giving IV infusions on the affected side.  Wearing compression garments and preventing infection in the affected limbs (eg, by wearing gloves during yard work) are important.  Avoiding ipsilateral blood pressure measurement and venipuncture is sometimes also recommended, even though supporting evidence is minimal .  If lymphedema develops, a specially trained therapist must treat it.  Special massage techniques used once or twice a day may help drain fluid from congested areas toward functioning lymph basins; low-stretch bandaging is applied immediately after manual drainage, and patients should exercise daily as prescribed.  After the lymphedema lessens, typically in 1 to 4 weeks, patients continue daily exercise and overnight bandaging of the affected limb indefinitely.  Reconstructive procedures include the following: Prosthetic reconstruction: Placement of a silicone or saline implant, sometimes after a tissue expander is used Autologous reconstruction: Muscle flap transfer (using the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, or the lower rectus abdominis) or muscle-free flap transfer Breast reconstruction can be done during the initial mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery or later as a separate procedure.  Timing of surgery depends on patient preference as well as the need for adjuvant therapy such as radiation therapy.  However, doing radiation therapy first limits the types of reconstructive surgery that can be done.  Thus, consulting a plastic surgeon early during treatment planning is recommended.  Advantages of breast reconstruction include improved mental health in patients who have a mastectomy.  Disadvantages include surgical complications and possible long-term adverse effects of implants.  Early consultation with a plastic surgeon should also be considered when lumpectomy (especially lower breast or upper inner quadrant lumpectomy) is being done.  The best candidates for oncoplastic surgery (which combines cancer removal with reconstruction of the breast) are patients with ptotic (sagging) breasts.  Contralateral mastopexy may improve symmetry.  Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is an option for some women with breast cancer (eg, those with a genetic mutation conferring a high risk of breast cancer).  In women with lobular carcinoma in situ in one breast, invasive cancer is equally likely to develop in either breast.  Thus, the only way to eliminate the risk of breast cancer for these women is bilateral mastectomy.  Some women, particularly those who are at high risk of developing invasive breast cancer, choose this option.  Advantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include Decreased risk of contralateral breast cancer (especially in women in a family history of breast or ovarian cancer) Improvement in survival in breast cancer patients with an inherited genetic mutation (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) and possibly in women diagnosed at age < 50 years Decreased anxiety in some patients Decreased need for cumbersome follow-up imaging Disadvantages of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy include An almost two-fold increase in surgical complication rates Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is not mandatory for patients with the highest risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast.  Close surveillance is a reasonable alternative.  Radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery significantly reduces incidence of local recurrence in the breast and in regional lymph nodes and may improve overall survival.  However, if patients are > 70 and have early ER+ breast cancer, adding radiation therapy to lumpectomy plus tamoxifen may not be necessary; adding radiation therapy does not significantly decrease the rate of mastectomy for local recurrence or the occurrence of distant metastases nor increase the survival rate .  Radiation therapy is indicated after mastectomy if any of the following is present: The primary tumor is ≥ 5 cm.  Axillary nodes are involved.  Margins are positive for cancer in resected tissue.  In such cases, radiation therapy after mastectomy significantly reduces incidence of local recurrence on the chest wall and in regional lymph nodes and improves overall survival.  Adverse effects of radiation therapy (eg, fatigue, skin changes) are usually transient and mild.  Late adverse effects (eg, lymphedema, brachial plexopathy, radiation pneumonitis, rib damage, secondary cancers, cardiac toxicity) are less common.  To improve radiation therapy, researchers are studying several new procedures.  Many of these procedures aim to target radiation to the cancer more precisely and spare the rest of the breast from the effects of radiation.  Adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy delay or prevent recurrence in almost all patients and prolong survival in some.  However, studies have shown that chemotherapy is not necessary for many small (< 0. 5 to 1 cm) tumors with no lymph node involvement (particularly in postmenopausal patients) because the prognosis is already excellent.  Usual indications for chemotherapy are one or more of the following: Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-negative Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) oncogene-positive ER/PR+ and positive lymph nodes in a premenopausal patient ER/PR+ and HER2- with high Oncotype Dx™ score Relative reduction in risk of recurrence and death with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy is the same regardless of the clinical-pathologic stage of the cancer.  Thus, absolute benefit is greater for patients with a greater risk of recurrence or death (ie, a 20% relative risk reduction reduces a 10% recurrence rate to 8% but a 50% rate to 40%).  Adjuvant chemotherapy reduces annual odds of death (relative risk) on average by 25 to 35% for premenopausal patients; for postmenopausal patients, the reduction is about half of that (9 to 19%), and the absolute benefit in 10-year survival is much smaller.  Postmenopausal patients with ER– tumors benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy For ER+ breast cancer, predictive genomic testing of the primary breast cancer is being used increasingly to stratify risk in patients and to determine whether combination chemotherapy or endocrine therapy alone is indicated.  Common prognostic tests include The 21-gene recurrence score assay (based on Oncotype Dx™) The Amsterdam 70-gene profile (MammaPrint®) The 50-gene risk of recurrence score (PAM50 assay) In the US, most women with breast cancer have ER+/PR+/HER- breast cancer with negative axillary nodes.  In these women, a low or intermediate score on the 21-gene recurrence score assay predicts similar survival rates with chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy and with endocrine therapy alone.  Therefore, in this subset of women with breast cancer, chemotherapy may not be necessary.  Chemotherapy is usually begun soon after surgery.  If systemic chemotherapy is not required, endocrine therapy is usually begun soon after surgery and is continued for 5 to 10 years.  If tumors are > 5 cm, systemic therapy may be started before surgery.   Combination chemotherapy regimens are more effective than a single drug.  Dose-dense regimens given for 4 to 6 months are preferred; in dose-dense regimens, the time between doses is shorter than that in standard-dose regimens.  There are many regimens; a commonly used one is ACT (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel).  Acute adverse effects depend on the regimen but usually include nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, alopecia, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, and thrombocytopenia.  Growth factors that stimulate bone marrow (eg, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim) are commonly used to reduce risk of fever and infection due to chemotherapy.  Long-term adverse effects are infrequent with most regimens; death due to infection or bleeding is rare (< 0. 2%).  If tumors overexpress HER2 (HER2+), anti-HER2 drugs (trastuzumab, pertuzumab) may be used.  Adding the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab to chemotherapy provides substantial benefit.  Trastuzumab is usually continued for a year, although the optimal duration of therapy is unknown.  If lymph nodes are involved, adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab improves disease-free survival.  A serious potential adverse effect of both these anti-HER2 drugs is a decreased cardiac ejection fraction.  With endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors), benefit depends on estrogen and progesterone receptor expression; benefit is Greatest when tumors have expressed estrogen and progesterone receptors Nearly as great when they have only estrogen receptors Minimal when they have only progesterone receptors Absent when they have neither receptor In patients with ER+ tumors, particularly low-risk tumors, endocrine therapy may be used instead of chemotherapy.  Tamoxifen: This drug competitively binds with estrogen receptors.  Adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years reduces annual odds of death by about 25% in premenopausal and postmenopausal women regardless of axillary lymph node involvement; treatment for 2 years is not as effective.  If tumors have estrogen receptors, treatment for 10 years appears to prolong survival and reduce recurrence risk compared with 5 years of treatment.  Tamoxifen can induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms but reduces incidence of contralateral breast cancer and lowers serum cholesterol.  Tamoxifen increases bone density in postmenopausal women and may reduce risk of fractures and ischemic heart disease.  However, it significantly increases risk of developing endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Typically, it manifests as postmenopausal uterine bleeding.  Staging is surgical. \n【10】 Thus, if such women have spotting or bleeding, they must be evaluated for endometrial cancer.  Nonetheless, the improved survival for women with breast cancer far outweighs increased risk of death due to endometrial cancer.  Risk of thromboembolism is also increased.  Aromatase inhibitors: These drugs (anastrozole, exemestane, letrozole) block peripheral production of estrogen in postmenopausal women.  More effective than tamoxifen, these drugs are becoming the preferred treatment for early-stage hormone receptor–positive cancer in postmenopausal patients.  Letrozole may be used in postmenopausal women who have completed tamoxifen treatment.  Optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy is uncertain.  A recent trial showed that extending treatment to 10 years resulted in a lower rate of breast cancer recurrence and higher rate of disease-free survival.  There was no change in overall survival and a higher rate of fractures and osteoporosis in patients treated for an extended time.  Patients with DCIS are often treated with daily oral tamoxifen.  For postmenopausal women, an aromatase inhibitor is preferred.  Metastatic disease Any indication of metastases should prompt immediate evaluation.  Treatment of metastases increases median survival by 6 months or longer.  These treatments (eg, chemotherapy), although relatively toxic, may palliate symptoms and improve quality of life.  Thus, the decision to be treated may be highly personal.  Choice of therapy depends on the following: Hormone-receptor status of the tumor Length of the disease-free interval (from remission to manifestation of metastases) Number of metastatic sites and organs affected Patient’s menopausal status Systemic endocrine therapy or chemotherapy is usually used to treat symptomatic metastatic disease.  Initially, patients with multiple metastatic sites outside the central nervous system (CNS) should be given systemic therapy.  If metastases are asymptomatic, there is no proof that treatment substantially increases survival, and it may reduce quality of life.  Endocrine therapy is preferred over chemotherapy for patients with any of the following: ER+ tumors A disease-free interval of > 2 years Disease that is not immediately life threatening In premenopausal women, tamoxifen is often used first.  Reasonable alternatives include ovarian ablation by surgery, radiation therapy, and use of a luteinizing-releasing hormone agonist (eg, buserelin, goserelin, leuprolide).  Some experts combine ovarian ablation with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.  In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors are being increasingly used as primary endocrine therapy.  If the cancer initially responds to endocrine therapy but progresses months or years later, additional forms of endocrine therapy (eg, progestins, the antiestrogen fulvestrant) may be used sequentially until no further response occurs.  The most effective chemotherapy drugs are capecitabine, doxorubicin (including its liposomal formulation), gemcitabine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, and vinorelbine.  Response rate to a combination of drugs is higher than that to a single drug, but survival is not improved and toxicity is increased.  Thus, some oncologists use single drugs sequentially.  Anti-HER2 drugs (eg, trastuzumab, pertuzumab) are used to treat tumors that overexpress HER2.  These drugs are effective in treating and controlling visceral metastatic sites.  Trastuzumab is used alone or with endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, or pertuzumab.  Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy plus pertuzumab slows the growth of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and increases survival more than trastuzumab plus chemotherapy .  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, lapatinib, neratinib) are being increasingly used in women with HER2+ tumors.  Radiation therapy alone may be used to treat isolated, symptomatic bone lesions or local skin recurrences not amenable to surgical resection.  Radiation therapy is the most effective treatment for brain metastases, occasionally providing long-term control.  Palliative mastectomy is sometimes an option for patients with stable metastatic breast cancer.  IV bisphosphonates (eg, pamidronate, zoledronate) decrease bone pain and bone loss and prevent or delay skeletal complications due to bone metastases.  About 10% of patients with bone metastases eventually develop hypercalcemia, which can also be treated with IV bisphosphonates.  End-of-life issues For patients with metastatic breast cancer, quality of life may deteriorate, and the chances that further treatment will prolong life may be small.  Palliation may eventually become more important than prolongation of life.  Cancer pain Physical, psychologic, emotional, and spiritual distress is common among patients living with fatal illness, and patients commonly fear protracted and unrelieved suffering. \n【11】 Other symptoms (eg, constipation, difficulty breathing, nausea) should also be treated.  Psychologic and spiritual counseling should be offered.  Patients with metastatic breast cancer should be encouraged to prepare advance directives are legal documents that extend a person's control over health care decisions in the event that the person becomes incapacitated. \n【12】 Prevention of Breast Cancer Chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene may be indicated for women with the following: Age > 35 and previous LCIS or atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia Presence of high-risk mutations (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, Li-Fraumeni syndrome) Age 35 to 59 and a 5-year risk of developing breast cancer > 1. 66%, based on the multivariable Gail model, which includes the women’s current age, age at menarche, age at first live childbirth, number of 1st-degree relatives with breast cancer, and results of prior breast biopsies A computer program to calculate breast cancer risk by the Gail model is available from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at 1-800-4CANCER and on the NCI web site.  Recommendations of the U. S.  Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for chemoprevention of breast cancer are available at the USPSTF web site.  Patients should be informed of risks before beginning chemoprevention.  Risks of tamoxifen include Endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma. \n【13】 Raloxifene appears to be about as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal women and to have a lower risk of endometrial cancer, thromboembolic complications, and cataracts.  Raloxifene, like tamoxifen, may also increase bone density.  Raloxifene should be considered as an alternative to tamoxifen for chemoprevention in postmenopausal women.  Key Points Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women; cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 95 is 12%.  Factors that greatly increase risk include breast cancer in close relatives (particularly if a BRCA gene mutation is present), atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, and significant exposure to chest radiation therapy before age 30.  Screen women by doing clinical breast examination, mammography (beginning at age 50 and often at age 40), and, for women at high risk, MRI.  Factors suggesting a poorer prognosis include younger age, absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and presence of HER2 protein or BRCA gene mutations.  For most women, treatment requires surgical removal, lymph node sampling, systemic therapy (endocrine therapy or chemotherapy), and radiation therapy.  Treat with endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor) if tumors have hormone receptors.  Consider treating metastatic disease to relieve symptoms (eg, with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or, for bone metastases, radiation therapy or bisphosphonates), even though survival is unlikely to be prolonged.  Consider chemoprevention with tamoxifen or raloxifene for women at high risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#4#4# Accessed 3/7/22.

Predisposing factors include craniocervical junction abnormalities, previous spinal cord trauma, and spinal cord tumors.  Symptoms include flaccid weakness of the hands and arms and deficits in pain and temperature sensation in a capelike distribution over the back and neck; light touch and position and vibration sensation are not affected.  Diagnosis is by MRI.  Treatment includes correction of the cause and surgical procedures to drain the syrinx or otherwise open the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.   Syrinxes usually result from lesions that partially obstruct flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \n【1】 For unknown reasons, these congenital abnormalities often expand during the teen or young adult years.  A syrinx can also develop in patients who have a spinal cord tumor, scarring due to previous spinal trauma, or no known predisposing factors.  About 30% of people with a spinal cord tumor eventually develop a syrinx.  Syringomyelia is a paramedian, usually irregular, longitudinal cavity.  It commonly begins in the cervical area but may extend downward along the entire length of the spinal cord.  Syringobulbia, which is rare, usually occurs as a slitlike gap within the lower brain stem and may disrupt or compress the lower cranial nerve nuclei or ascending sensory or descending motor pathways.  Symptoms and Signs of Syrinx Symptoms of a syrinx usually begin insidiously between adolescence and age 45.  Syringomyelia develops in the center of the spinal cord, causing a central cord syndrome Pain and temperature sensory deficits occur early but may not be recognized for years.  The first abnormality recognized may be a painless burn or cut.  Syringomyelia typically causes weakness, atrophy, and often fasciculations and hyporeflexia of the hands and arms; a deficit in pain and temperature sensation in a capelike distribution over the shoulders, arms, and back is characteristic.  Light touch and position and vibration sensation are not affected.  Later, spastic leg weakness develops.  Deficits may be asymmetric.  Syringobulbia may cause vertigo, nystagmus, unilateral or bilateral loss of facial sensation, lingual atrophy and weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, hoarseness, and sometimes peripheral sensory or motor deficits due to medullary compression.  Diagnosis of Syrinx MRI of spinal cord and brain with gadolinium A syrinx is suggested by an unexplained central cord syndrome or other characteristic neurologic deficits, particularly pain and temperature sensory deficits in a capelike distribution.  MRI of the entire spinal cord and brain is done.  Gadolinium enhancement is useful for detecting any associated tumor.  Treatment of Syrinx Sometimes surgical decompression Underlying problems (eg, craniocervical junction abnormalities, postoperative scarring, spinal tumors) are corrected when possible.  Surgical decompression of the foramen magnum and upper cervical cord is the only useful treatment, but surgery usually cannot reverse severe neurologic deterioration, and the syrinx may recur.

In addition to purine salvage disorders, purine metabolism disorders include Purine catabolism disorders Purines are key components of cellular energy systems (eg, ATP, NAD), signaling (eg, GTP, cAMP, cGMP), and, along with pyrimidines, RNA and DNA production. \n【1】 Lesch-Nyhan syndrome This is a rare, X-linked recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. \n【2】 HPRT deficiency results in failure of the salvage pathway for hypoxanthine and guanine.  These purines are instead degraded to uric acid.  Additionally, a decrease in inositol monophosphate and guanosyl monophosphate leads to an increase in conversion of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phosphoribosylamine, which further exacerbates uric acid overproduction.  Hyperuricemia predisposes to gout and its complications.  Patients also have a number of cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions, etiology of which is unclear; they do not seem related to uric acid.  The disease usually manifests between 3 months and 12 months of age with the appearance of orange sandy precipitate (xanthine) in the urine; it progresses to central nervous system involvement with intellectual disability, spastic cerebral palsy, involuntary movements, and self-mutilating behavior (particularly biting).  Later, chronic hyperuricemia causes symptoms of gout (eg, urolithiasis, nephropathy, gouty arthritis, tophi).  Diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is suggested by the combination of dystonia, intellectual disability, and self-mutilation.  Serum uric acid levels are usually elevated, but confirmation by DNA analysis is done.  Central nervous system dysfunction has no known treatment; management is supportive.  Self-mutilation may require physical restraint, dental extraction, and sometimes drug therapy; a variety of drugs has been used.  Hyperuricemia is treated with a low-purine diet (eg, avoiding organ meats, beans, sardines) and allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (the last enzyme in the purine catabolic pathway).  Allopurinol prevents conversion of accumulated hypoxanthine to uric acid; because hypoxanthine is highly soluble, it is excreted.  Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency This is a rare autosomal recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. \n【3】 Accumulated adenine is oxidized to 2,8-dihyroxyadenine, which precipitates in the urinary tract, causing problems similar to those of uric acid nephropathy (eg, renal colic, frequent infections, and, if diagnosed late, renal failure).  Onset can occur at any age.  Diagnosis of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is by detecting elevated levels of 2,8-dihyroxyadenine, 8-hyroxyadenine, and adenine in urine and confirmed by DNA analysis; serum uric acid is normal.  Treatment of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is with dietary purine restriction, high fluid intake, and avoidance of urine alkalinization.

Diagnosis is by physical examination, x-rays, and, in some cases, genetic testing.  Treatment is surgical.  The basic genetic defects have been identified in most of the osteochondrodysplasias.  The mutations typically cause perturbation of function in proteins involved in growth and development of connective tissue, bone, or cartilage Dwarfism is markedly short stature (adult height < 4 ft 10 in) frequently associated with disproportionate growth of the trunk and extremities.  Achondroplasia is the most common and best-known type of short-limbed dwarfism, but there are many other distinct types, which differ widely in genetic background, course, and prognosis Lethal short-limbed dwarfism (thanatophoric dysplasia, caused by mutations in the same gene as achondroplasia) causes severe chest wall deformities and respiratory failure in neonates, resulting in death.  \n【1】 Diagnosis of Osteochondrodysplasias X-rays Characteristic x-ray changes may be diagnostic.  A whole-body x-ray of every affected neonate, even if stillborn, should be taken because diagnostic precision is essential for predicting prognosis.  Prenatal diagnosis by fetoscopy or ultrasonography is possible in some cases (eg, when fetal limb shortening is severe).  Standard laboratory tests do not help, but molecular diagnosis is feasible for chondrodysplasias with known molecular defects.  Genetic testing is advised if a diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical grounds or if genetic counseling is desired.  Treatment of Osteochondrodysplasias Sometimes surgical limb-lengthening, surgical correction of leg bowing, or joint replacement In achondroplasia, treatment with human growth hormone is generally not effective.  However, vosoritide (a C-type natriuretic peptide analog) is available and has shown encouraging results in studies  in facilitating bone growth.  An increase in adult height may be achieved by surgical limb-lengthening.  Bowlegs can be corrected surgically.  In achondroplasia and other nonlethal osteochondrodysplasias, surgery (eg, hip replacement) can help improve joint function.  Hypoplasia of the odontoid process can predispose to subluxation of the first and second cervical vertebrae and compression of the spinal cord.  Therefore, the odontoid process should be evaluated preoperatively and, if it is abnormal, the patient’s head should be carefully supported when hyperextended for endotracheal intubation during anesthesia.  Because the inheritance pattern and gene mutations in most types are known, genetic counseling can be effective.  Organizations such as Little People of America provide resources for affected people and act as advocates on their behalf.

Infection during early pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital defects.  Diagnosis is usually clinical.  Cases are reported to public health authorities.  Treatment is usually unnecessary.  Vaccination is effective for prevention.  Most viruses that infect humans can affect both adults and children and are discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL. \n【1】 This topic covers a viral infection that is typically acquired during childhood (although it may also affect adults).  Rubella is caused by an RNA virus, rubella virus, which is spread by respiratory droplets through close contact or through the air.  Patients can transmit rubella during asymptomatic infection or from 7 days before the rash appears until 15 days after onset of the rash; the period of greatest risk is from a few days before the rash appears to 7 days after onset of the rash.  Congenitally infected infants Congenital Rubella is a viral infection acquired from the mother during pregnancy.  Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death. \n【2】 Rubella is less contagious than measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children. \n【3】 Immunity appears to be lifelong after natural infection.  However, in unvaccinated populations, 10 to 15% of young adults have not had childhood infection and are susceptible.  At present, incidence in the US is at a historic low because of routine childhood vaccination; all cases since 2004 have been imported.  Symptoms and Signs of Rubella Many cases are mild.  After a 14- to 21-day incubation period, a 1- to 5-day prodrome, usually consisting of low-grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenopathy, occurs in adults but may be minimal or absent in children.  Tender swelling of the suboccipital, postauricular, and posterior cervical nodes is characteristic.  There is pharyngeal injection at the onset.  The rash is similar to that of measles but is less extensive and more evanescent; it is often the first sign in children.  It begins on the face and neck and quickly spreads to the trunk and extremities.  At onset, a blanching, macular erythema may appear, particularly on the face.  On the 2nd day, the rash often becomes more scarlatiniform (pinpoint) with a reddish flush.  Petechiae form on the soft palate (Forschheimer spots), later coalescing into a red blush.  The rash lasts 3 to 5 days.  Constitutional symptoms in children are absent or mild and may include malaise and occasional arthralgias.  Adults usually have few or no constitutional symptoms but occasionally have fever, malaise, headache, stiff joints, transient arthritis, and mild rhinitis.  Fever typically resolves by the 2nd day of the rash.  Encephalitis has occurred rarely during large military outbreaks.  Complete resolution is typical, but encephalitis is occasionally fatal.  Thrombocytopenic purpura and otitis media occur rarely.  Diagnosis of Rubella Clinical evaluation Serologic testing Rubella is suspected in patients with characteristic adenopathy and rash.  Laboratory diagnosis is necessary for pregnant women, patients with encephalitis, and neonates.  Also, laboratory evaluation is strongly encouraged for all suspected cases of rubella for public health purposes.  A ≥ 4-fold rise between acute and convalescent (4 to 8 weeks) antibody titers confirms the diagnosis, as can serum rubella IgM antibody testing.  Detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing of throat, nasal, or urine specimens may also be done to confirm the diagnosis; genotype analysis is useful in epidemiologic investigations.  Differential diagnosis includes measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children. \n【4】 Some of these conditions can be distinguished from rubella as follows: Measles: Rubella is differentiated from measles by the milder, more evanescent rash, milder and briefer constitutional symptoms, and absence of Koplik spots, photophobia, and cough.  Scarlet fever: Within a day of onset, scarlet fever usually causes more severe constitutional symptoms and pharyngitis than does rubella.  Secondary syphilis: In secondary syphilis, adenopathy is not tender, and the rash is usually prominent on the palms and soles.  Also, laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is usually readily available.  Infectious mononucleosis: Infectious mononucleosis can be differentiated by its more severe pharyngitis, more prolonged malaise, and atypical lymphocytosis and with Epstein-Barr virus antibody testing.  Treatment of Rubella Supportive care Treatment of rubella is symptomatic.  No specific therapy for encephalitis is available.  Prevention of Rubella Live-virus vaccine is given routinely It produces immunity for ≥ 15 years in > 95% of recipients and does not appear to transmit the infection.  Because certain other infections are clinically indistinguishable from rubella, a reported history of rubella does not guarantee immunity.  Vaccination is given to children as a combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine effectively protects against all 3 infections. \n【5】 Routine vaccination is recommended for all susceptible mothers immediately after delivery.  Screening women of childbearing age for rubella antibodies and immunizing those susceptible are also suggested.  However, women receiving the vaccine should prevent conception for at least 28 days afterward.  The vaccine virus may be capable of infecting a fetus during early pregnancy.  The vaccine does not cause congenital rubella syndrome Symptoms and Signs Congenital rubella is a viral infection acquired from the mother during pregnancy. \n【6】 Rubella vaccine use is contraindicated throughout pregnancy.  Fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, polyneuropathy, arthralgia, and arthritis occur rarely after vaccination in children; painful joint swelling occasionally follows vaccination in adults, usually in nonimmune women.  Key Points Rubella causes a scarlatiniform rash and often low-grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenopathy (characteristically involving the suboccipital, postauricular, and posterior cervical nodes).  Most cases are mild and complications are few except for rare cases of encephalitis and the risk during early pregnancy that infection can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital defects.  Laboratory diagnosis is strongly encouraged for all suspected cases for public health purposes; serologic or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing can be done.

The most common manifestation is erysipeloid, an acute but slowly evolving localized cellulitis.  Diagnosis is by culture of a biopsy specimen or occasionally polymerase chain reaction testing.  Treatment is with antibiotics.  Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (formerly E.  insidiosa) are thin, gram-positive, capsulated, nonsporulating, nonmotile, microaerophilic bacilli with worldwide distribution; they are primarily saprophytes.  E.  rhusiopathiae may infect a variety of animals, including shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals (especially swine), and insects.  In humans, infection is chiefly occupational and typically follows a penetrating wound in people who handle edible or nonedible animal matter (eg, infected carcasses, rendered products [grease, fertilizer], bones, shells).  Most commonly, patients handle fish or shellfish or work in slaughterhouses.  Infection can also result from cat or dog bites.  Nondermal infection is rare, usually occurring as septic arthritis Acute Infectious (septic) arthritis is a joint infection that evolves over hours or days. \n【1】 Symptoms and Signs of Erysipelothricosis Within 1 week of injury, a characteristic raised, purplish red, nonvesiculated, indurated, slowly evolving localized cellulitic rash on the hand (erysipeloid) appears, accompanied by itching and burning.  Local swelling, although sharply demarcated, may inhibit use of the hand, the usual site of infection.  The lesion’s border may slowly extend outward, causing discomfort and disability that may persist for 3 weeks.  Localized erysipelothricosis is usually self-limited.  Regional lymphadenopathy occurs in about one third of cases.  Erysipelothricosis rarely becomes generalized cutaneous disease, which is characterized by purple skin lesions that expand as the lesion’s center clears, plus bullous lesions at the primary or distant sites.  Bacteremia is rare and is more often a primary infection than dissemination from cutaneous lesions.  It may result in septic arthritis or infective endocarditis, even in people without known valvular heart disease.  Endocarditis tends to involve the aortic valve, and the mortality rate and percentage of patients needing cardiac valve replacement are unusually high.  Rarely, central nervous system, intra-abdominal, and bone infections occur.  Diagnosis of Erysipelothricosis Culture Polymerase chain reaction amplification for rapid diagnosis Culture of a full-thickness biopsy specimen is superior to needle aspiration of the advancing edge of a lesion because organisms are located only in deeper parts of the skin.  Culture of exudate obtained by abrading a florid papule may be diagnostic.  Isolation from synovial fluid or blood is necessary for diagnosis of erysipelothrical arthritis or endocarditis.  rhusiopathiae may be misidentified as lactobacilli.  Polymerase chain reaction amplification may aid rapid diagnosis of erysipelothricosis.  Rapid diagnosis is particularly important if endocarditis is suspected because treatment of endocarditis due to E.  rhusiopathiae is often different from the usual empiric treatment of gram-positive bacillary endocarditis (eg, E.  rhusiopathiae is resistant to vancomycin, which is typically used).  Treatment of Erysipelothricosis Penicillin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, or clindamycin For localized cutaneous disease, usual treatment is one of the following, given for 7 days: Penicillin V or ampicillin (500 mg orally every 6 hours) Ciprofloxacin (250 mg orally every 12 hours) Clindamycin (300 mg orally every 8 hours) Cephalosporins are also effective.  Daptomycin and linezolid are active in vitro and may be considered if patients are very allergic to beta-lactams.  Tetracyclines and macrolides may no longer be dependable.  rhusiopathiae are resistant to sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin.  Severe diffuse cutaneous or systemic infection is best treated with one of the following: Penicillin G (2 to 3 million units IV every 4 hours) Ceftriaxone (2 g IV once/day) A fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours, levofloxacin 500 mg IV once a day) Endocarditis is treated with penicillin G for 4 to 6 weeks.  Cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are alternatives.  Vancomycin is often used empirically for the treatment of gram-positive bacillary endocarditis; however, E.  Thus, rapid differentiation of E.  rhusiopathiae from other gram-positive organisms is critical.  The same drugs and doses are appropriate for arthritis (given for at least 1 week after defervescence or cessation of effusion), but repeated needle aspiration drainage of the infected joint is also necessary.  Key Points Erysipelothricosis typically results from a penetrating wound in people who handle edible or nonedible animal matter (eg, in a slaughterhouse) or who work with fish or shellfish.  Within 1 week after the injury, a raised, purplish red, nonvesiculated, indurated, maculopapular rash appears, accompanied by itching and burning; about one third of patients have regional lymphadenopathy.  Bacteremia is rare but may result in septic arthritis or infective endocarditis.  Diagnose by culturing a full-thickness biopsy specimen or an exudate obtained by abrading a florid papule.  If endocarditis due to E.  rhusiopathiae is suspected, rapid identification of the pathogen is critical because treatment is often different from the usual empiric treatment of gram-positive bacillary endocarditis; E.

Vasculitis can affect any blood vessel—arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, or capillaries.  Clinical manifestations of specific vasculitic disorders are diverse and depend on the size and location of the involved vessels, the extent of the organ involvement, and the degree and pattern of extravascular inflammation.  Etiology of Vasculitis may be Primary Secondary Primary vasculitis has no known cause.  Secondary vasculitis may be triggered by an infection, a drug, or a toxin or may occur as part of another inflammatory disorder or cancer.  Pathophysiology of Vasculitis Histologic description of an affected vessel should include the following: A description of vessel wall damage (eg, type and location of inflammatory infiltrate, extent and type of damage, presence or absence of fibrinoid necrosis) A description of healing responses (eg, intimal hypertrophy, fibrosis) Certain features (eg, predominant inflammatory cell type, location of inflammation) suggest particular vasculitic processes and may aid in the diagnosis.  For example, in many acute lesions, the predominant inflammatory cells are polymorphonuclear leukocytes; in chronic lesions, lymphocytes predominate.  Inflammation may be segmental or involve the entire vessel.  At sites of inflammation, varying degrees of cellular inflammation and necrosis or scarring occur in one or more layers of the vessel wall.  Inflammation in the media of a muscular artery tends to destroy the internal elastic lamina.  Some forms of vasculitis are characterized by giant cells in the vessel wall. \n【1】 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term used to describe findings in small-vessel vasculitis.  It refers to breakdown of inflammatory cells that leaves small nuclear fragments (nuclear debris) in and around the vessels.  Inflammation is transmural and nongranulomatous.  Polymorphonuclear leukocytes predominate early; later, lymphocytes predominate.  Resolution of the inflammation tends to result in fibrosis and intimal hypertrophy.  Intimal hypertrophy or secondary clot formation can narrow the vessel lumen and cause tissue ischemia or necrosis.   Classification of Vasculitis Vasculitic disorders can be classified according to the size of the predominant vessel affected.  However, there is often substantial overlap.   Classification of Vasculitic Disorders Size of Predominant Affected Vessels Disorders Symptoms and Signs Large Behçet disease is a multisystem, relapsing, chronic vasculitic disorder with mucosal inflammation. \n【2】 It occurs predominantly in young women.  Etiology is unknown. \n【3】 Multiple mononeuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) or polyneuropathy Gastrointestinal tract: Abdominal pain, weight loss, and/or diarrhea.  Mesenteric ischemia Kidneys: New-onset hypertension (with renal artery involvement) Skin: Ulcers, nodules, and livedo reticularis Symptoms and signs in Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years. \n【4】 It occurs most often in children. \n【5】 Regardless of the size of the vessels involved, patients can present with symptoms and signs of systemic inflammation (eg, fever, night sweats, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, arthralgias, arthritis).  Some manifestations are life-threatening or organ-threatening and require immediate treatment: Alveolar hemorrhage Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is persistent or recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage.  There are numerous causes, but autoimmune disorders are most common. \n【6】 It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction. \n【7】 Diagnosis of Vasculitis Clinical evaluation Basic laboratory tests to detect inflammation or organ dysfunction (eg, complete blood count [CBC], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein, serum albumin and total protein, aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT], blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine, urinalysis) and to stage disease process Laboratory tests to help determine the type of vasculitis (eg, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [ANCA]) if suggested by clinical assessment Laboratory and imaging studies that may help determine the cause of vasculitis (eg, cryoglobulins, hepatitis B surface antigen test, hepatitis B core and hepatitis B surface antibody tests and hepatitis C virus antibody test,blood cultures) and extent of organ involvement Biopsy Systemic vasculitis is suspected in patients with the following: Symptoms or signs suggestive of vasculitis (eg, temporal headache and jaw claudication suggesting giant cell arteritis) Ischemic manifestations (eg, ischemic stroke, limb claudication, mesenteric ischemia) out of proportion to a patient's risk factors for atherosclerosis Unexplained combinations of symptoms in more than one organ system that are compatible with vasculitis (eg, hypertension, myalgias, hemoptysis), particularly when symptoms of a systemic illness are present Primary vasculitic disorders are diagnosed based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, physical findings, compatible laboratory test results, and exclusion of other causes (ie, secondary vasculitis).  Histologic examination is done whenever possible and may support the diagnosis of a particular vasculitic disorder Clinical findings determine the differential diagnosis and thus direct laboratory testing.  Most routine laboratory tests yield results that are nonspecific and must be interpreted in the context of the entire clinical presentation.  However, results can often help support the diagnosis, determine the location and degree of organ involvement, or suggest alternative diagnoses.  Tests usually include CBC, ESR or C-reactive protein, serum albumin and total protein, AST, and ALT.  Often, patients present with elevated ESR or C-reactive protein, anemia due to chronic inflammation, elevated platelets, and low serum albumin.  Freshly voided urine must be tested for red blood cells, red blood cell casts, and protein to identify renal involvement.  Serum creatinine levels should be checked and monitored.  Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are not typical of primary vasculitis and suggest an alternate diagnosis. \n【8】 Standardized tests for ANCA include immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Immunofluorescence staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils can detect the cytoplasmic pattern of c-ANCA or the perinuclear pattern of p-ANCA.  Then ELISA is used to check for antibodies specific for the major autoantigens: proteinase-3 (PR3), which produces the c-ANCA staining pattern, or myeloperoxidase (MPO), which produces the p-ANCA staining pattern seen on ethanol-fixed neutrophils.  Because ANCA-associated vasculitides are rare, and the ANCA test is not completely specific, ANCA testing should be done only when the pretest probability for ANCA-associated vasculitis is moderately high.  A positive ANCA test can occur in infections that can cause a secondary vasculitis, including endocarditis.  Other useful laboratory tests include hepatitis B and C serologic testing, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, antinuclear antibody and anti-extractable nuclear antigens panel, testing for the presence of cryoglobulins, and complement levels.  Complement levels may be low in viral vasculitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, lymphoproliferative disorders, or vasculitis secondary to other autoimmune diseases.  Further testing is determined by clinical findings.  If indicated based on clinical findings, a chest x-ray should be done to check for infiltrates, but high-resolution noncontrast CT of the chest may be needed to check for subtle findings, such as small nodules or cavities.  Bilateral diffuse infiltrates suggest possible alveolar hemorrhage, which requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.  Other imaging tests may be required.  For example, magnetic resonance angiography of large blood vessels and the aorta is useful for diagnosis and monitoring when such vessels appear affected.  If symptoms and examination suggest a neuropathy, electromyography may be helpful.  Because vasculitic disorders are rare and treatment may have severe adverse effects, tissue biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis whenever possible.  Clinical findings suggest the best site for biopsy.  Biopsy results are most likely to be positive if taken from affected lung, skin, and kidney tissue.  Blind biopsies of organs without clinical manifestations or laboratory suggestion of involvement have a low likelihood of providing positive results.  Treatment of Vasculitis Induction of remission for life-threatening or organ-threatening vasculitis with corticosteroids, often with cyclophosphamide or rituximab Induction of remission for less severe vasculitis with corticosteroids plus a less potent immunosuppressant (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) or rituximab Maintenance of remission with methotrexate, azathioprine, or rituximab, plus tapering of corticosteroids Treatment of vasculitis depends on the etiology, the type of vasculitis, and extent and severity of disease.  For secondary vasculitic disorders, removing the cause (eg, infection, drug, cancer) usually helps.  For primary vasculitic disorders, treatment aims to induce and maintain remission.  Remission is induced by using cytotoxic immunosuppressants and high-dose corticosteroids, usually for 3 to 6 months, until remission occurs or disease activity is acceptably reduced.  The duration of remission is hard to predict and may depend on the type of vasculitis.  For many patients, maintaining remission requires continuation of immunosuppressive therapy with or without a low dose of corticosteroids.  During this period, the goal is to eliminate corticosteroids or reduce their dose and use alternative, less toxic immunosuppressants as long as needed.  All patients treated with immunosuppressants should be monitored for opportunistic and other infections.  Testing for tuberculosis and hepatitis B, which can become reactivated by some immunosuppressive therapies, should be done. \n【9】 Induction of remission For less severe forms of vasculitis, low doses of corticosteroids and less potent immunosuppressants (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) may be used.  Severe, rapidly progressive and life- or organ-threatening vasculitis (eg, causing alveolar hemorrhage, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, or mesenteric ischemia) is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission and immediate treatment.  Treatment typically consists of the following: Corticosteroids: High-dose corticosteroids (also called pulse corticosteroids) are often prescribed.  Specific doses and drugs must be individualized.  As one example, methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg or 1 g IV once a day for 3 days may be used, followed by 1 mg/kg prednisone or methylprednisolone orally (or, if hospitalized, sometimes IV) once a day for about 4 weeks.  The dose is then tapered slowly, as tolerated, until the drug is stopped.  Changes in tapering schedule may be necessary if the patient fails to improve or relapses.  Cyclophosphamide: A dose of 2 mg/kg orally once a day is usually recommended for at least 3 months or until remission occurs.  The white blood cell (WBC) count must be closely monitored, and the dose must be adjusted to avoid leukopenia.  (WBC count should be maintained at > 3500/microL [> 3. 5 x 109/L]. ) Alternatively, an IV cyclophosphamide regimen of 0. 5 to 1 g/m2 at 2- to 4-week intervals is sometimes used.  The dose should be reduced in patients with significant renal insufficiency, and WBC counts should be monitored frequently. \n【10】 Mesna:Mesna is mixed with IV cyclophosphamide to bind acrolein, a product of cyclophosphamide degradation that is toxic to the bladder epithelium and can lead to hemorrhagic cystitis and sometimes transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.  Long-term use of cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer.  One milligram of mesna is added for each milligram of cyclophosphamide.  Recurrence of hematuria, especially without casts and dysmorphic red cells, should prompt a referral for urologic evaluation.  Cystoscopy and renal imaging should be done to exclude cancer.  Rituximab:Rituximab, a B cell-depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be noninferior to cyclophosphamide in inducing remission of severe ANCA-associated vasculitis.  Rituximab is given as 375 mg/m2 IV once a week for 4 weeks.  A widely used alternative regimen is two 1000-mg infusions given 2 weeks apart. \n【11】 B cell-depleting therapies will markedly blunt the response to vaccines for months after administration.  Remission maintenance Corticosteroids are tapered to zero or to the lowest dose that can maintain remission.  For some forms of vasculitis (most clearly demonstrated in ANCA-associated disease), weekly methotrexate (with folate) or daily azathioprine is prescribed to replace cyclophosphamide because these drugs have a better adverse effects profile.  Periodic IV rituximab may also be used to maintain remission, but the optimal dosage and infusion interval have not been clearly established.  The duration of this treatment varies, from one year to several years, depending on the patient, specific diagnosis, and propensity for relapse.  Patients with frequent relapses may need to take immunosuppressants indefinitely.  Long-term use of corticosteroids can have significant adverse effects.  Patients who are taking ≥ 7. 5 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent doses of other corticosteroids should be given calcium and vitamin D supplements and bisphosphonates to help prevent or minimize osteoporosis Treatment Osteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone mineral density (bone mass per unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure. \n【12】 Additional corticosteroid supplementation may be needed in seriously ill patients or in those undergoing surgery who may have a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, depending on the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy and the duration and intensity of stress.  Recent studies have focused on developing treatments that limit corticosteroid exposure.  Avacopan, a selective C5a receptor antagonist, is an available adjunctive therapy for severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis . \n【13】Key Points Vasculitis can be a primary disorder or secondary to other causes.  Vasculitis tends to affect small-, medium-, or large-sized vessels, each with certain patterns of organ involvement.  Clinical manifestations can be systemic and/or organ-specific, depending on how vessels are affected.  Do blood tests, imaging studies, and tissue biopsy as indicated to determine the cause of vasculitis (including disorders such as infections and cancer), extent of organ involvement, and severity of disease.

Inspection includes observation for erythema, deformity, or skin lesions, including surgical scars, and for asymmetry compared to the unaffected shoulder (suggesting muscle wasting).  Because pain can be referred from other areas to areas around the shoulder, shoulder palpation should include the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints, the coracoid process, clavicle, acromion process, subacromial bursa, biceps tendon, and greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus , as well as the scapula and the neck.  The neck is examined as part of any shoulder evaluation because pain can be referred to the shoulder from the cervical spine (particularly with C5 radiculopathy).  Glenohumeral joint effusions may cause a bulge between the coracoid process and the humeral head.  Possible causes include rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.  Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【1】  Calcium Pyrophosphate Arthritis (CPP arthritis) involves intra-articular and/or extra-articular deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. \n【2】 Limited range of motion, weakness, pain, and other disturbances of mobility caused by rotator cuff impairment Rotator Cuff Injury/Subacromial Bursitis Rotator cuff injury includes tendinitis and partial or complete tears; subacromial bursitis may result from tendinitis.  Symptoms are shoulder area pain and, with severe tears, weakness. \n【3】 Specific maneuvers against resistance can help determine which tendons are affected.  Strength and sensation should be assessed: The infraspinatus and teres minor are assessed by having the patient resist external rotation pressure with the arms held at the sides with elbows flexed to 90°; this position isolates rotator cuff muscle function from that of other muscles such as the deltoid.  Weakness during this test suggests significant rotator cuff dysfunction (eg, a complete tear).  The supraspinatus is assessed by having the patient resist downward pressure on the arms held in flexion (forward) with the thumbs pointing downward and the elbow extended (empty can, or Jobe test).  The subscapularis is assessed by having the patient place the hand behind the back with the back of the hand resting on the lower back.  The examiner lifts the hand off the lower back.  The patient should be able to keep the hand off the skin of the back (Gerber lift-off test).  The Apley scratch test assesses combined shoulder range of motion by having the patient attempt to touch the opposite scapula: Reaching overhead, behind the neck, and to the opposite scapula with the tips of the fingers tests abduction and external rotation; reaching under, behind the back, and across to the opposite scapula with the back of the hand tests adduction and internal rotation.  Impingement tests are considered if pain is elicited.  They include the following: The Neer test is done to check for impingement of the rotator cuff tendons under the coracoacromial arch.  It is done by placing the arm in forced forward flexion, lifted overhead, and fully pronated.  The Hawkins test is done also to check for impingement.  It is done by flexing the arm (forward) to 90°, placing the pronated elbow in 90° of flexion, and then forcibly rotating the shoulder internally (moving the hand downward).  Disorders of the shoulder Rotator cuff tendinitis Diagnosis Tendinitis is inflammation of a tendon, often developing after degeneration (tendinopathy).  Tenosynovitis is tendinitis with inflammation of the tendon sheath lining. \n【4】 The supraspinatus tendon is most frequently involved and the subscapularis is second.  Active abduction in an arc of 40 to 120° and internal rotation cause pain .  Passive abduction causes less pain, but abduction against resistance can increase pain.  Bicipital tendinitis causes pain in the biceps tendon that is aggravated by shoulder flexion or resisted supination of the forearm.  Examiners can elicit palpable tenderness proximally over the bicipital groove of the humerus by rolling (flipping) the bicipital tendon under their thumb.  Also, the Speed test may be done.  In this test, the arm is extended behind the body plane while the elbow is straight and the forearm is supinated.  Acromioclavicular joint injury is tested for using the cross-body adduction test.  In this test, the examiner stabilizes the shoulder with one hand, flexes the shoulder forward to 90° with the elbow pronated, and brings the arm straight across the front of the body, toward the opposite side.  Elicitation of pain is a positive test.  Anterior glenohumeral joint instability is tested by stabilizing the joint by holding it from behind and then pulling back on the arm with the shoulder abducted to 90° and the elbow flexed to 90° (increasing abduction and external rotation).  A positive result is apprehension of joint instability (not pain).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:48:48"}

Successfully managing these adverse effects is important because it improves quality of life .  Cytopenias Decreased blood concentrations of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBC), especially granulocytes, and platelets result from diverse systemic cancer therapies, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs, and radiation therapy.  Anemia Decreased levels of RBCs are common in patients with cancer.  Decreases in RBCs result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially in blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional cancer (chemotherapy) drugs.  Often anemia requires no therapy.  Some patients, especially those with comorbidities such as arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, may benefit from RBC transfusions.  Others may benefit from receiving recombinant erythropoietin, which can substitute for RBC transfusions.  Some data suggest erythropoietin use can have adverse effects on cancer prognosis and is prothrombotic.  Guidelines on RBC transfusion and erythropoietin use are available, but recommendations are controversial .  Thrombocytopenia Decreased platelet concentration is common in patients with cancer.  Decreases in platelets result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs.  The risk of bleeding is inversely proportional to the platelet count Platelet concentrations < 10,000/microL (10 × 109/L) are dangerous and require platelet transfusions.  Molecularly cloned hormones, such as eltrombopag and avatrombopag, which stimulate megakaryocytes to produce platelets, have been used.  Leukocyte depletion of transfused blood products may prevent alloimmunization to platelets and should be used in patients expected to need platelet transfusions during multiple courses of chemotherapy or for candidates for hematopoietic cell transplants.  Leukocyte depletion also lowers the probability of acquiring a cytomegalovirus infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV, human herpesvirus type 5) can cause infections that have a wide range of severity.  A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. \n【2】 Neutropenia A decreased granulocyte concentration is common in patients with cancer.  Neutropenia is considered a reduction in blood neutrophil count to < 1500/mcL (< 1. 5 × 109/L) in White patients and < 1200/mcL (< 1. 2 × 109/L) in people with African ancestry .  Decreases in granulocytes result from a direct effect of the cancer (especially blood and bone marrow cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma) and from effects of cancer therapy, especially conventional chemotherapy drugs.  The risk of infection is inversely proportional to the granulocyte count.  A granulocyte concentration < 500/microL (0. 5 × 109/L) markedly increases the risk of infection.  Measures to protect against infection, including wearing a mask, hand washing, and protective isolation, are important.  Laminar air flow (LAF) rooms are sometimes used but have not proved effective.  Oral nonabsorbable antibiotics are sometimes given prophylactically.  When a prolonged interval of low granulocytes is anticipated, prophylactic antifungal and antiviral drugs are sometimes given, including drugs to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii.  In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in whom there is an expected incidence of febrile neutropenia > 20 %, prophylactic myeloid growth factors such as filgrastrim, sargramostim, or pegfilgastrim are given with the chemotherapy .  Afebrile patients with neutropenia require close outpatient follow-up for detection of fever and should be instructed to avoid contact with sick people or areas frequented by large numbers of people (eg, shopping malls, airports).  Although most patients do not require antibiotics, patients with severe immunosuppression are sometimes given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet/day) as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii.  In transplant patients or others receiving high-dose chemotherapy, antiviral prophylaxis (acyclovir 800 mg orally twice a day or 400 mg IV every 12 hours) should be considered if serologic tests are positive for herpes simplex virus.  Fever > 38. 5° C on two or more occasions in a patient with neutropenia is a medical emergency.  An extensive evaluation for potential infection sources should be made and blood cultures done.  Typically, systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics are given before culture results are known and therapy modified as needed.  Patients with persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics are often started on systemic antifungal and sometimes antiviral drugs.  Evaluation should include immediate chest x-ray and cultures of blood, sputum, urine, stool, and any suspect skin lesions.  Examination includes possible abscess sites (eg, skin, ears, sinuses, perirectal area), skin and mucosa for presence of herpetic lesions, retina for vascular lesions suggestive of infectious emboli, and catheter sites.  Rectal examination and use of a rectal thermometer should be avoided.  Other evaluation should be guided by clinical findings.  Febrile neutropenic patients should receive broad-spectrum antibiotics chosen on the basis of the most likely organism.  Typical regimens include cefepime or ceftazidime 2 g IV every 8 hours immediately after samples for culture are obtained.  If diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are present, sputum should be tested for P.  jirovecii, and if positive, appropriate therapy should be started.  If fever resolves within 72 hours after starting empiric antibiotics, they are continued until the neutrophil count is > 500/microL (0. 5 × 109/L).  If fever continues, antifungal drugs should be added.  Reassessment for infection, often including CT of the chest and abdomen, is also done.  Granulocyte concentrations can be increased by giving molecularly cloned myeloid growth factors such as granulocyte (G) or granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as filgrastim, sargramostim, and peg-filgrastim.  Guidelines for appropriate use of these drugs are available .  In selected patients with neutropenia related to chemotherapy, especially after high-dose chemotherapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may be started to shorten the duration of neutropenia.  G-CSF 5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once/day up to 14 days and longer-acting forms (eg, pegfilgrastim 6 mg subcutaneously single dose once per chemotherapy cycle) may be used to accelerate WBC recovery.  These drugs should not be given in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, and for pegfilgrastim, at least 14 days should elapse until the next planned chemotherapy dose.  These drugs are begun at the onset of fever or sepsis or, in afebrile high-risk patients, when neutrophil count falls to < 500/microL.  Many centers use outpatient treatment with G-CSF in selected low-risk patients with fever and neutropenia.  Candidates must not have hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory distress, uncontrolled pain, or serious comorbid illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or hypercalcemia.  The regimen in such cases requires daily follow-up and often involves visiting nurse services and home antibiotic infusion.  Some regimens involve oral antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice a day plus amoxicillin/clavulanate 875 mg twice a day or 500 mg 3 times a day.  If no defined institutional program for follow-up and treatment of neutropenic fever is available in an outpatient setting, then hospitalization is required. \n【3】 Gastrointestinal Effects Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common in patients with cancer.  These effects may be caused by the cancer itself, cancer therapy, or both.  Anorexia is common in patients with cancer and may be caused by the cancer directly or as a consequence of cancer therapy(ies).  Loss of more than 10% of ideal body weight predicts an adverse prognosis.  Efforts should be made to maintain reasonable nutrition.  Sometimes partial or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is needed.  Patients with surgical interruption of the gastrointestinal tract may need a feeding gastrostomy.  Drugs that may increase appetite include corticosteroids, megestrol acetate, androgenic steroids, and dronabinol.  Whether these drugs convincingly reduce anorexia, reverse weight loss, improve quality of life, or prolong survival is unclear.  Some steroids, such as testosterone, are contraindicated in patients with prostate or liver cancer.  Constipation is common in patients with cancer and is often exacerbated by opioids used to treat pain.  A stimulant laxative such as senna 2 tablets orally at bedtime (maximum 8 tablets/day) or bisacodyl 5 to 15 mg orally at bedtime should be initiated when repeated opioid use is anticipated.  Established constipation can be treated with various drugs ,eg, bisacodyl 5 to 15 mg orally every 24 hours, milk of magnesia 15 to 30 mL orally at bedtime, lactulose 15 to 30 mL (10 to 20 g) every 12 to 24 hours, magnesium citrate 195 to 300 mL once every 24 hours.  Enemas and suppositories should be avoided in patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.  Diarrhea is common after chemotherapy drugs, targeted therapy drugs, and radiation therapy, especially if the abdomen and/or pelvis is included in the radiation field.  It is usually treated with loperamide 2 to 4 mg orally after each loose stool; or diphenoxylate/atropine 2. 5 mg to 5 mg orally every 6 hours.  However, doses can vary depending on various factors.  Patients with cancer who are taking broad-spectrum antibiotics may become infected with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile–Induced Diarrhea Toxins produced by Clostridioides difficile strains in the gastrointestinal tract cause pseudomembranous colitis, typically after antibiotic use. \n【4】 Patients with lower colorectal cancers may have a diverting colostomy, which complicates diarrhea management.  Mouth lesions such as inflammation and ulcers are common in patients receiving chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy.  Sometimes these lesions are complicated by infection, often with Candida albicans.  Candidiasis is usually treated with nystatin.  Oral candidiasis can be treated with nystatin oral suspension 4 to 6 mL (400,000 to 600,000 units) 4 times a day, clotrimazole troches 10 mg 4 times a day, or fluconazole 100 mg orally once a day.  Mucositis due to radiation therapy can cause pain and preclude sufficient oral intake, leading to undernutrition and weight loss.  Rinses with analgesics and topical anesthetics (2% viscous lidocaine 5 to 10 mL every 2 hours or other commercially available mixtures) before meals, a bland diet without citrus food or juices, and avoidance of temperature extremes may allow patients to eat and maintain weight.  If not, a feeding tube may be helpful if the small intestine is functional.  For severe mucositis and diarrhea or an abnormally functioning intestine, parenteral alimentation may be needed.  Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with cancer whether or not they are receiving cancer therapy and decrease quality of life.  Variables that predict the likelihood of causing nausea and vomiting secondary to cancer drugs are Type of drug(s) Dose How the drug is given How frequently the drug is given Interactions between cancer drugs and drugs given to treat cancer-related pain Some chemotherapy drugs are especially likely to cause nausea and vomiting, including platinum-containing drugs such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin.  Patients treated with other cancer modalities, including radiation therapy, hormones, targeted therapy drugs, and immune therapy can also have nausea and vomiting.  Several drugs are effective in controlling and/or preventing nausea and vomiting: Serotonin-receptor antagonists are the most effective drugs but are also the most expensive.  Virtually no toxicity occurs with granisetron and ondansetron aside from headache and orthostatic hypotension.  A 0. 15-mg/kg dose of ondansetron or a 10-mcg/kg dose of granisetron is given IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy.  Doses of ondansetron can be repeated 4 and 8 hours after the first dose.  The efficacy against highly emetogenic drugs, such as the platinum-containing drugs, can be improved with coadministration of dexamethasone 8 mg IV given 30 minutes before chemotherapy with repeat doses of 4 mg IV every 8 hours.  A substance P/neurokinin-1 antagonist, aprepitant, can limit nausea and vomiting resulting from highly emetogenic chemotherapy.  Dosage is 125 mg orally 1 hour before chemotherapy on day 1, then 80 mg orally 1 hour before chemotherapy on days 2 and 3.  Other traditional antiemetics, including phenothiazines (eg, prochlorperazine 10 mg IV every 8 hours, promethazine 12. 5 to 25 mg orally or IV every 8 hours) and metoclopramide 10 mg orally or IV given 30 minutes before chemotherapy with repeated doses every 6 to 8 hours, are alternatives restricted to patients with mild to moderate nausea and vomiting.  Dronabinol (Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]) is an alternative treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.  THC is the principal psychoactive component of marijuana.  Its mechanism of antiemetic action is unknown, but cannabinoids bind to opioid receptors in the forebrain and may indirectly inhibit the vomiting center.  Dronabinol is administered in doses of 5 mg/m2 orally 1 to 3 hours before chemotherapy, with repeated doses every 2 to 4 hours after the start of chemotherapy (maximum of 4 to 6 doses/day).  However, it has variable oral bioavailability, is not effective for inhibiting the nausea and vomiting of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, and has significant adverse effects (eg, drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, mood changes, visual and time sense alterations).  Smoking marijuana may be more effective.  Marijuana for this purpose can be obtained legally in some states, although federal law still prohibits its use.  It is used less commonly because of barriers to availability and because many patients cannot tolerate smoking.  Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam 1 to 2 mg orally or IV given 10 to 20 minutes before chemotherapy with repeated doses every 4 to 6 hours as needed, are sometimes helpful for refractory or anticipatory nausea and vomiting. \n【5】 Pain is often under treated, for several reasons, including Patient reluctance to discuss pain with the physician reluctance to discuss pain Fear of opioid addiction None of these is a sensible reason not to achieve adequate pain control in a patient with cancer.  Treatment of pain Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【6】 However, these drugs are often ineffective in controlling cancer pain, and opioids, including morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, methadone, and oxymorphone, may be needed.  An appropriate dose and schedule of these drugs are essential for adequate pain control Often the patient with cancer is the best judge of when analgesics are needed.  Patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) using an indwelling pump allows the patient to manage dose and timing of analgesics.  Use of multiple drug classes may provide better pain control with fewer or less severe adverse effects than use of a single drug class.  Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in patients with thrombocytopenia.  Neuropathic pain can be treated with gabapentin; the dose required is high (up to 1200 mg orally 3 times a day) but must be started low (eg, 300 mg 3 times a day) and then increased over a few weeks.  Alternatively, a tricyclic antidepressant (eg, nortriptyline, 25 to 75 mg orally at bedtime) can be tried.  Doses can vary to a large degree between patients.  Opioids are the mainstay of pain control in patients with cancer and are often underused.  Pain medication should be given at doses and schedules which achieve the target level of pain control.  Too often people with cancer receive inadequate pain control.  Other approaches may be needed to control pain under special circumstances.  For example, radiation therapy often is needed for bone pain.  Nerve blockade and surgery may be done to interrupt the nerve pathways.  Depression Depressive Disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【7】 It may occur in response to the disease (its symptoms and feared consequences), adverse effects of the treatments, or both.  Patients receiving interferon can develop depression.  Alopecia as a result of radiation therapy or chemotherapy can contribute to depression.  Frank discussion of a patient’s fears can often relieve anxiety.  Treatment of depression Treatment Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【8】 Depending on the phosphate × calcium product, hyperphosphatemia is a serum phosphate concentration > 4. 5 mg/dL (> 1. 46 mmol/L).  Causes include chronic kidney disease, hypoparathyroidism, and metabolic or respiratory acidosis. \n【9】 Hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5. 5 mEq/L (> 5. 5 mmol/L), usually resulting from decreased renal potassium excretion or abnormal movement of potassium out of cells. \n【10】 Symptoms of tumor lysis include lethargy, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and seizures.  Tumor lysis syndrome occurs mainly in leukemias and lymphomas but can also occur in other hematologic cancers and, uncommonly, after treatment of solid cancers.  T-cell vaccines Active Specific Immunotherapy A number of immunologic interventions, both passive and active, can be directed against tumor cells. \n【11】 Although some physicians advocate sodium bicarbonate IV to alkalinize the urine and increase solubilization of uric acid, alkalinization may promote calcium phosphate deposition in patients with hyperphosphatemia, and a pH of > 7 should be avoided.  Treatment of hyperkalemia Treatment Hyperkalemia is a serum potassium concentration > 5. \n【12】 Symptomatic patients with hypocalcemia (eg, with arrhythmias, tetany) should receive IV calcium regardless of the serum phosphate level.  Prevention of tumor lysis syndrome is desirable.  Often it is possible to anticipate development of tumor lysis syndrome (eg, when treating cancers with rapid cell turnover) and to give large volumes of fluids and allopurinol or rasburicase before starting chemotherapy and sometimes prior to immune therapy (such as bispecific monoclonal antibodies or CAR-T-cells) to protect the kidneys from damage from uric acid.  Patients should receive vigorous IV hydration to establish a urine output of at least 100 mL/hour before treatment.  Patients also should receive allopurinol for at least 2 days before and during chemotherapy; for patients with high cell burden, this regimen can be continued for 10 to 14 days after therapy.  Rasburicase is an enzyme that oxidizes uric acid to allantoin (a more soluble molecule) and is given at 0. 15 to 0. 2 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes once a day for 5 to 7 days, typically started 4 to 24 hours before the first chemotherapy treatment.  Adverse effects may include anaphylaxis, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and methemoglobinemia.  Guidelines regarding evaluation and management of tumor lysis syndrome are available .  Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is related to but distinct from tumor lysis syndrome.  Cytokine release syndrome occurs when large numbers of immune cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon gamma. \n【13】 Clinical features include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and headache.  Tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, tremor, loss of coordination, seizures, and delirium may occur.  Typical features include Hypoxia Widened pulse pressure Increased or decreased cardiac output Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), D-dimer, liver enzymes, and bilirubin Low fibrinogen level Grading of cytokine release syndrome  is as follows: Grade 1: Symptoms (eg, fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgias, malaise) are not life-threatening and require symptomatic treatment only.  Grade 2: Symptoms require and respond to moderate intervention with oxygen supplementation up to 40% FiO2, or hypotension that is responsive to fluids or low-dose vasopressor, or grade 2 organ toxicity.  Grade 3: Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention with oxygen supplementation ≥ 40% FiO2, or hypotension requires high-dose or multiple vasopressors, or grade 3 organ toxicity, or grade 4 transaminitis.  Grade 4: Symptoms are life threatening, including need for ventilator support, or indicate grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis).  Grade 5: Death Therapy of low-grade CRS is supportive.  Moderate-grade CRS requires oxygen therapy and fluids and one or more antihypotensive drugs to raise blood pressure.  Moderate and severe-grade (ie, grades 3 and 4) CRS are treated with immune suppressive drugs such as corticosteroids.  Tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) monoclonal antibody, is also used in severe CRS.  Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur in some cancer patients treated with immune therapy.  It is also related to cytokine-mediated toxicity and has been called cytokine release encephalopathy syndrome (CRES).  Symptoms include confusion, depressed level of consciousness, disturbance in attention, lethargy, mental status changes, delirium, dizziness, muscle spasms, and muscle weakness .  Mild neurotoxicity is managed supportively.  More severe neurotoxicity is treated with dexamethasone or methylprednisolone.  Patients with severe neurotoxicity may need treatment in the intensive care unit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:09:39"}

Signs at birth, if present, are intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, microcephaly, jaundice, petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, periventricular calcifications, chorioretinitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and sensorineural hearing loss.  If acquired later in infancy, signs may include pneumonia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, sepsis-like syndrome, and atypical lymphocytosis.  Diagnosis of neonatal infection is best made by viral detection via culture or polymerase chain reaction testing.  Treatment is mainly supportive.  Parenteral ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir may prevent hearing deterioration and improve developmental outcomes and is given to infants with symptomatic disease identified in the neonatal period.  A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. \n【1】 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is frequently isolated from neonates.  Although most infants shedding this virus are asymptomatic, others have life-threatening illness and devastating long-term sequelae.  It is not known when a woman with primary CMV can safely conceive.  Because risk to the fetus is difficult to assess, women who develop primary CMV during pregnancy should be counseled, but few experts recommend routine serologic testing for CMV before or during pregnancy in healthy women.  Etiology of Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Congenital CMV infection, which occurs in 0. 2 to 1% of live births worldwide, may result from transplacental acquisition of either a primary or recurrent maternal infection.  Clinically apparent disease in the neonate is much more likely to occur after a primary maternal exposure, particularly in the first half of pregnancy.  In some higher socioeconomic groups in the US, 50% of young women lack antibody to CMV, making them susceptible to primary infection.  Perinatal CMV infection is acquired by exposure to infected cervical secretions, breast milk, or blood products.  Maternal antibody is thought to be protective, and most exposed term infants are asymptomatic or not infected.  In contrast, preterm infants An infant born before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm.  Prematurity is defined by the gestational age at which infants are born. \n【2】 Efforts should be made to transfuse these infants with only CMV-negative blood or components or to use blood that has been filtered to remove leukocytes, which carry CMV.  Such leukoreduced blood is considered by many experts to be CMV safe.  Symptoms and Signs of Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Many women who become infected with CMV during pregnancy are asymptomatic, but some develop a mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. \n【3】 About 10% of infants with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth.  Manifestations include the following: Intrauterine growth restriction Prematurity Preterm Infants An infant born before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm. \n【4】 However, if transmission is via breast milk, the risk of severe symptomatic disease and long-term sequelae is low.  Diagnosis of Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Viral culture using urine, saliva, or tissue Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing using urine, saliva, blood, or tissue Symptomatic congenital CMV infection must be distinguished from other congenital infections, including toxoplasmosis Congenital toxoplasmosis is caused by transplacental acquisition of Toxoplasma gondii. \n【5】 Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death. \n【6】 In neonates, viral detection using culture or PCR of urine, saliva, or a tissue sample is the primary diagnostic tool; maternal diagnosis can also be made by serologic testing or PCR .  Culture specimens should be refrigerated until inoculation of fibroblast cells.  Congenital CMV is diagnosed if the virus is identified in urine, saliva, or other body fluids obtained within the first 2 to 3 weeks of life; urine and saliva have the highest sensitivity.  After 3 weeks, viral detection may indicate perinatal or congenital infection.  Infants may shed CMV for several years after either type of infection.  A complete blood count (CBC) with differential and liver tests may be helpful but are not specific.  Cranial ultrasonography or CT and an ophthalmologic evaluation should also be done.  Periventricular calcifications are commonly found on CT.  Hearing tests should be routinely done at birth in all infected neonates, and continued close monitoring is required because hearing loss may develop after the neonatal period and be progressive.  Prognosis for Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Symptomatic neonates have a mortality rate of up to 30%, and 40 to 90% of survivors have some neurologic impairment, including Hearing loss Hearing Impairment in Children Common causes of hearing loss are genetic defects in neonates and ear infections and cerumen in children. \n【7】 Treatment of Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Ganciclovir or valganciclovir for symptomatic neonates are given antiviral drugs.  Oral valganciclovir 16 mg/kg 2 times a day for 6 months decreases viral shedding in neonates with congenital CMV and modestly improves hearing and developmental outcomes at 12 and 24 months of age .  In utero treatment of affected fetuses with acyclovir or valacyclovir may also improve neonatal outcomes, but large studies are lacking.  The main toxicity of treatment is neutropenia is a reduction in the blood neutrophil count.  If it is severe, the risk and severity of bacterial and fungal infections increase. \n【8】 Prevention of Congenital and Perinatal CMV Infection Nonimmune pregnant women should attempt to limit exposure to the virus.  For instance, because CMV infection is common among children attending day care centers, pregnant women should always wash their hands thoroughly after exposure to urine and oral or respiratory secretions from children.  Transfusion-associated perinatal CMV disease can be avoided by giving preterm neonates blood products from CMV-seronegative donors or leukoreduced products.  A vaccine to prevent congenital CMV is under development.  CMV hyperimmune globulin given to pregnant women with primary CMV infection did not show a reduction in congenital infection in a randomized, controlled trial .  Maternal antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir to prevent fetal transmission is being investigated . \n【9】 Key Points Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital viral infection and may be asymptomatic or symptomatic.  Multiple organs can be affected, and risk of premature birth increases.  Distinguish symptomatic congenital CMV infection from other congenital infections (eg, toxoplasmosis, rubella, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, syphilis) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or viral culture.

It is typically acute, manifesting with bleeding, but may be subacute or chronic with few or no symptoms.  Diagnosis is by endoscopy.  Treatment is supportive, with removal of the inciting cause and initiation of acid-suppressant therapy.  Certain intensive care unit patients (eg, ventilator-bound, head trauma, burn, multisystem trauma) benefit from prophylaxis with acid suppressants. \n【1】 Common causes of erosive gastritis include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Alcohol Stress Less common causes include Radiation Viral infection (eg, cytomegalovirus) Vascular injury Direct trauma (eg, nasogastric tubes) Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. \n【2】 These may develop as soon as 12 hours after the initial insult.  Deep erosions, ulcers, and sometimes perforation may occur in severe or untreated cases.  Lesions typically occur in the body, but the antrum may also be involved.  Acute stress gastritis, a form of erosive gastritis, occurs in about 5% of critically ill patients.  The incidence increases with duration of intensive care unit stay and length of time the patient is not receiving enteral feeding.  Pathogenesis likely involves hypoperfusion of the gastrointestinal mucosa, resulting in impaired mucosal defenses.  Patients with head injury or burns may also have increased secretion of acid.  Symptoms and Signs of Erosive Gastritis Patients with mild erosive gastritis are often asymptomatic, although some complain of dyspepsia, nausea, or vomiting.  Often, the first sign is hematemesis, melena, or blood in the nasogastric aspirate, usually within 2 to 5 days of the inciting event.  Bleeding is usually mild to moderate, although it can be massive if deep ulceration is present, particularly in acute stress gastritis.  Diagnosis of Erosive Gastritis Endoscopy Acute and chronic erosive gastritis are diagnosed endoscopically.  Treatment of Erosive Gastritis For bleeding: Endoscopic hemostasis For acid suppression: A proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker In severe gastritis, bleeding is managed with IV fluids and blood transfusion as needed.  Endoscopic hemostasis should be attempted, with surgery a fallback procedure if bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically.  Angiography is unlikely to stop severe gastric bleeding because of the many collateral vessels supplying the stomach.  Acid-suppressing drugs Drug Treatment of Gastric Acidity Drugs for decreasing acidity are used for peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and many forms of gastritis. \n【3】 For milder gastritis, removing the offending agent and using drugs to reduce gastric acidity  to limit further injury and promote healing may be all that is required.  Prevention of Erosive Gastritis Prophylaxis with acid-suppressive drugs can reduce the incidence of acute stress gastritis.  However, it mainly benefits certain high-risk intensive care unit patients, including those with severe burns, central nervous system trauma, coagulopathy, sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours, chronic liver disease, acute kidney injury, hepatic or renal failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and history of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.  A 2020 guideline for gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis for critically ill patients recommends that in most critically ill patients the benefit of acid suppression must be weighed against the risk of pneumonia.  The guideline includes a calculator to help assess the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  There is a possible increased risk of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients receiving acid suppression.  A recent meta-analysis concluded that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists may increase the risk of pneumonia .  However, a previous large clinical study of a PPI for patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in the intensive care unit found no increased incidence of pneumonia .  The guideline further recommends using a PPI rather than a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (weak recommendation) and recommends against using sucralfate.  Early enteral feeding also can decrease the incidence of bleeding.

Respiratory infections Overview of Viral Respiratory Infections Viral infections commonly affect the upper or lower respiratory tract. \n【1】 Respiratory viruses include the epidemic influenza viruses Influenza is a viral respiratory infection causing fever, coryza, cough, headache, and malaise.  Mortality is possible during seasonal epidemics, particularly among high-risk patients , H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza A viruses Avian Influenza is caused by strains of influenza A that normally infect only wild birds and domestic poultry.  Infections due to some of these strains have been detected in humans. \n【2】 Diagnosis is clinical. \n【3】 In 2002 and 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. \n【4】 There have been no cases of SARS reported since 2004.  In 2012, a novel coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity from the common cold to fatal pneumonia. \n【5】 In 2019, another coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) that can cause an acute, sometimes fatal respiratory illness ,COVID-19 is an acute, sometimes severe, respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  Prevention is by vaccination and infection control precautions  emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread in a worldwide pandemic that has killed millions .  Respiratory viruses are typically spread from person to person by contact with infected respiratory droplets.

A rotavirus vaccine that is effective against most pathogenic strains is part of the recommended infant vaccination schedule Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 0–6 Years .  Hand washing and good sanitation measures can help prevent spread.  Exanthematous infections  Some viruses cause only skin lesions ; others also cause systemic manifestations or lesions elsewhere in the body.  Transmission is typically from person to person; alphaviruses have a mosquito vector.  Hepatic infections  At least 5 specific viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses) can cause hepatitis Causes of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver characterized by diffuse or patchy necrosis.  Hepatitis may be acute or chronic (usually defined as lasting > 6 months). \n【7】 Hepatitis D virus can infect only when hepatitis B is present.  Transmission is from person to person by contact with infected blood or body secretions or by the fecal-oral route for hepatitis A and E (genotypes 1 and 2).  Other viruses can affect the liver as part of their disease process.  Common examples are cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus (CMV, human herpesvirus type 5) can cause infections that have a wide range of severity.  A syndrome of infectious mononucleosis that lacks severe pharyngitis is common. \n【8】 Less common examples are echovirus, coxsackievirus, and herpes simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex viruses (human herpesviruses types 1 and 2) commonly cause recurrent infection affecting the skin, mouth, lips, eyes, and genitals. \n【9】 For such infections, prevention includes avoiding mosquito and tick bites.  Hemorrhagic fevers  Certain viruses cause fever and a bleeding tendency.  Transmission may involve mosquitoes, ticks, or contact with infected animals (eg, rodents, monkeys, bats) and people.  Prevention involves avoiding the means of transmission.  Cutaneous or mucosal infections  Some viruses cause skin or mucosal lesions that recur and may become chronic.  Mucocutaneous infections are the most common type of herpes simplex virus infection Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections Herpes simplex viruses (human herpesviruses types 1 and 2) commonly cause recurrent infection affecting the skin, mouth, lips, eyes, and genitals. \n【10】 Human papillomavirus causes warts are common, benign, epidermal lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection.  They can appear anywhere on the body in a variety of morphologies.  Diagnosis is by examination. \n【11】 The cause of most cervical cancers is human papillomavirus infection. \n【12】 The main symptom is bleeding with defecation.  Diagnosis is by endoscopy. \n【13】 Transmission is by person-to-person contact.  Multisystem diseases  Enteroviruses Overview of Enterovirus Infections Enteroviruses, along with rhinoviruses and human parechoviruses, are a genus of picornaviruses (pico, or small, RNA viruses). \n【14】 Nonspecific febrile illness  Some viruses cause nonspecific symptoms, including fever, malaise, headaches, and myalgia.  Transmission is usually by an arthropod vector.  Rift Valley fever rarely progresses to ocular disorders, meningoencephalitis, or a hemorrhagic form (which has a 50% mortality rate).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 02:07:22"}

People with avoidant personality disorder are afraid of being rejected, criticized, or embarrassed and thus avoid situations where they may experience such reactions.  Doctors diagnose avoidant personality disorder based on specific symptoms, such as avoiding situations that involve interpersonal contact because of fear of rejection and disapproval or feelings of being socially incompetent, unappealing, or inferior to others.  People with this disorder may benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy, other psychotherapies, and antianxiety drugs and antidepressants. \n【1】 People with avoidant personality disorder feel inadequate.  They manage these feelings by avoiding situations in which they may be evaluated negatively.  Avoidant personality disorder occurs in over 2% of the general population in the United States.  It affects men and women equally.  Other disorders are also often present.  They include one or more of the following: Major depressive disorder A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【2】 Obsessions are recurring, persistent, unwanted, anxiety-provoking, intrusive ideas, images, or urges. \n【3】 These situations are often avoided or endured with much distress. \n【4】 Causes of Avoidant Personality Disorder Genes and environmental factors may contribute to the development of avoidant personality disorder.  For example, people may have an inborn anxiety in social situations, and/or they may experience rejection and marginalization during childhood.  Avoidance in social situations has been observed in children as young as about 2 years old.  Symptoms of Avoidant Personality Disorder Fear of rejection People with avoidant personality disorder avoid social interaction, even at work, because they fear that they will be criticized or rejected or that people will disapprove of them.  For example, they may do the following: They may refuse a promotion because they fear coworkers will criticize them.  They may avoid meetings.  They may avoid making new friends unless they are sure they will be liked.  People with this disorder assume others will be critical and disapproving until there is clear-cut, indisputable proof to the contrary.  Thus, before joining a group and forming a close relationship, people with this disorder require repeated assurances of support and uncritical acceptance.  People with avoidant personality disorder are reluctant to talk about themselves lest they be mocked or humiliated.  People with this disorder are very reluctant to take risks or participate in new activities for similar reasons.  In such cases, they tend to exaggerate the dangers and use minimal symptoms or other problems to explain why they are not participating.  They may prefer a limited lifestyle because of their need for security and certainty.  Extreme sensitivity to criticism People with avoidant personality disorder are very sensitive to anything critical, disapproving, or mocking because they constantly think about being criticized or rejected by others.  They are vigilant for any sign of a negative response to them.  Their tense, anxious appearance may elicit mockery or teasing, thus seeming to confirm their self-doubts.  Other symptoms Low self-esteem and a sense of inadequacy inhibit these people in social situations, especially new ones.  They hold back in interactions with new people because they think of themselves as socially inept, unappealing, and inferior to others.  They tend to be quiet and timid because they tend to think that if they say anything, others will say it is wrong.  People with avoidant personality disorder long for social interaction but fear placing their well-being in the hands of others.  Because these people with avoidant personality limit their interactions with others, they tend to be relatively isolated and to lack a social network that could help them when they need it.  Diagnosis of Avoidant Personality Disorder A doctor's evaluation, based on specific criteria Doctors usually diagnose personality disorders based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition , published by the American Psychiatric Association.  For doctors to diagnose avoidant personality disorder, people must persistently avoid social contact, feel inadequate, and be hypersensitive to criticism and rejection, as shown by at least four of the following: They avoid job-related activities that involve interpersonal contact because they fear that they will be criticized or rejected or that people will disapprove of them.  They are unwilling to get involved with people unless they are sure of being liked.  They are reserved in close relationships because they are afraid of being ridiculed or humiliated.  They are preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.  They are inhibited in new social situations because they feel inadequate.  They view themselves as socially incompetent, unappealing, or inferior to others.  They are reluctant to take risks or participate in any new activity because they may be embarrassed.  Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood.  If people have social phobia and avoidant personality disorder, the following treatments can be effective: Cognitive-behavioral therapy Psychotherapy Extraordinary advances have been made in the treatment of mental illness.  As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated nearly as successfully as physical disorders. \n【5】 This type of psychotherapy focuses on underlying conflicts.

A summary of changes to the 2022 adult immunization schedule is available here.   Preparations Diphtheria (D) vaccines contain toxoids prepared from Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  Tetanus (T) vaccines contain toxoids prepared from Clostridium tetani.  Acellular (a) pertussis (P) vaccines contain semipurified or purified components of Bordetella pertussis.  Whole-cell pertussis vaccine is no longer available in the US because of concerns about adverse effects, but it is still available in other parts of the world.  There are 2 preparations of the acellular vaccine: Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) for children < 7 years Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) for adolescents and adults Tdap contains lower doses of diphtheria and pertussis components (indicated by the lower case d and p).  Indications DTaP is a routine childhood vaccination Tdap is routinely given as a single lifetime dose to children at age 11 or 12 years and to people ≥ 13 years who have never received Tdap  or whose vaccine status is unknown.  This dose is followed by a Td booster Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccine A vaccine for tetanus alone is available, but the tetanus vaccine is typically combined with those for diphtheria and/or pertussis. \n【1】 Additional boosters of Tdap are also recommended for Pregnant women during each pregnancy (preferably at 27 to 36 weeks gestation), regardless of the interval since any previous dose of Tdap Postpartum women who have never received Tdap Adults who require a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as part of wound management and who have not previously received Tdap are given Tdap instead of tetanus-diphtheria (Td).  Those who have previously received Tdap may be given Tdap or Td.  People who have had pertussis should still receive a pertussis-containing vaccine as per routine recommendations.  Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications for DTaP and Tdap are A severe allergic reaction  after a previous dose or to a vaccine component For the pertussis component: Encephalopathy (eg, coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) that occurred within 7 days of a previous dose of DTaP or Tdap and that is not attributable to another identifiable cause Because tetanus vaccination is important, people who have had an anaphylactic reaction to components in DTaP or Tdap should be referred to an allergist to determine whether they are allergic to tetanus toxoid.  If not, they can be vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine.  Adults with a history of encephalopathy can be vaccinated with tetanus-diphtheria, and children can be given diphtheria-tetanus (DT) instead of Tdap.  Precautions vary depending on the formulation.  For DTaP and Tdap, they include Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (vaccination is postponed until illness resolves if possible) Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive but self-limited inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. \n【2】 The DTaP vaccine is given as 5 primary and 1 booster IM injections during childhood as follows: at age 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years (before school entry).  The fifth dose is not necessary if the fourth dose was given at age ≥ 4 years and at least 6 months after the third dose.  A single booster of Tdap is given, except for pregnant women, who should have a dose during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 to 36 weeks gestation.  Pearls & Pitfalls Pregnant women should have a booster dose of Tdap during each pregnancy.  Adverse Effects are rare and are mostly attributable to the pertussis component.  They include the following: Encephalopathy within 7 days A seizure, with or without fever, within 3 days ≥ 3 hours of persistent, severe, inconsolable screaming or crying within 48 hours Collapse or shock within 48 hours Temperature of ≥ 40. 5° C, unexplained by another cause, within 48 hours Immediate severe or anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine If the pertussis vaccine is contraindicated, a combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccine Tetanus-Diphtheria Vaccine A vaccine for tetanus alone is available, but the tetanus vaccine is typically combined with those for diphtheria and/or pertussis. \n【3】 Mild adverse effects include redness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:01:28"}

Hair loss that occurs on the scalp is generally called baldness.  Hair loss is often of great concern to people for cosmetic reasons, but it can also be a sign of a bodywide (systemic) disorder.  Hair grows in cycles These follicles are located in the dermis, which is the skin layer between the epidermis (the surface layer) and the fat layer .  Each cycle consists of A long growing phase (anagen) lasting 2 to 6 years A brief transitional phase (catagen) lasting 3 weeks A short resting phase (telogen) lasting 2 to 3 months At the end of the resting phase, the hair falls out (exogen), and the cycle begins again as a new hair starts growing in the follicle.  Normally, about 50 to 100 scalp hairs reach the end of resting phase each day and fall out.  Disorders of the growth cycle that lead to hair loss include Anagen effluvium: Disruption of the growing phase that causes loss of anagen hairs Telogen effluvium: Many more than 100 hairs a day go into resting phase and then fall out Doctors sometimes classify hair loss as focal (confined to one part of the scalp) or diffuse (widespread).  Hair loss may also be classified by whether or not scarring exists.  Causes of Alopecia The most common cause of hair loss is Male-pattern and female-pattern baldness  Other common causes of hair loss are Alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder. \n【1】 Causes are multifactorial.  Less common causes include primary hair shaft abnormalities (that is, the abnormality originates in the hair shaft), lichen planopilaris (lichen planus of the scalp) and frontal fibrosing alopecia,and rare skin conditions.  out 50 to 100 scalp hairs normally fall out each day.  Androgenetic alopecia This form of alopecia increases with age and affects over 70% of men (male-pattern hair loss) and 57% of women (female-pattern hair loss) over the age of 80.  The hormone dihydrotestosterone plays a major role, along with heredity.  The hair loss can begin at any age during or after puberty, even during adolescence Androgenetic alopecia is more common among White people than among Asian and Black people.  In men, hair loss usually begins at the temples or on the top of the head toward the back.  Some men lose only some hair and have only a receding hairline or a small bald spot in the back.  Other men, especially when hair loss begins at a young age, lose all of the hair on the top of the head but retain hair on the sides and back of the scalp.  This pattern is called male-pattern hair loss.  In women, hair loss occurs on the top of the head and is usually a thinning of the hair rather than a complete loss of hair.  The hairline typically stays intact.  Losing Hair In men, hair is usually first lost at the temples or on the top of the head toward the back.  In women, hair is usually first lost on the top of the head.  Typically, the hair thins rather than is completely lost, and the hairline stays intact.  Alopecia areata In alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder. \n【2】 More extensive loss of scalp and body hair can also occur.  This disorder is believed to be caused by a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues (called an autoimmune reaction).  Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is the most common cause of scarring alopecia in Black women.  The combination of damage to the scalp, possibly resulting from hot combs, chemical relaxers, or hair weaves, and a genetic predisposition to follicular damage due to abnormal hair follicles leads to progressive hair loss and scarring on the top and back of the scalp.  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus In cutaneous lupus erythematosus, areas of hair may be lost.  Hair loss may be permanent if the hair follicle is completely destroyed.  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus can affect people who have or do not have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls. \n【3】 Systemic lupus erythematosus affects various organs throughout the body and can cause widespread nonscarring hair loss.  In cutaneous lupus erythematosus, hair tends to be lost in patches and scarring or permanent hair loss can occur.  Hormone imbalance If women have excessive amounts of male hormones or are more sensitive to the effects of male hormones (for example, genetically), they can develop scalp hair loss, acne is a common skin condition causing pimples and other abnormalities on the face and upper torso. \n【4】 Women who have PCOS usually have excess face and body hair, and some have loss of scalp hair (female-pattern baldness).  Virilization occurs when androgen levels are high enough to cause not only scalp hair loss but also additional signs and symptoms such as deepening of the voice, decrease in the size of the breasts, increased muscle bulk, irregular menstrual periods, an enlarged clitoris (the smaller female organ that corresponds to the penis), and increased libido.  Rarely, an ovarian or adrenal tumor can secrete male hormones, causing virilization.  Virilization may also develop in a female who is taking anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone that are used to increase muscle size. \n【5】 Drugs Male-pattern or female-pattern baldness can occur when anabolic steroids are used.  Chemotherapy drugs typically cause disruption of the growing phase that causes loss of anagen hairs (anagen effluvium).  Other prescription drugs (for example, blood thinners and drugs used to treat high blood pressure, acne, thyroid disorders, or seizures) typically cause hair loss by inducing a telogen effluvium.  Nutritional disorders are a less common cause of hair loss.  Symptoms vary according to the specific nutritional disorder: Excess vitamin A Excess Vitamin A excess (toxicity) can be sudden (acute), usually due to accidental ingestion by children, or chronic. \n【6】 Hair typically falls out a few months after the stress.  This type of hair loss tends not to be permanent.  Psychologic stresses These stresses can lead to the habitual twisting, teasing, or pulling out of normal hair .  The habit is most common among children but may occur in adults.  The hair pulling may not be noticed for a long time, confusing doctors and parents, who may mistakenly think that a disorder such as alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder. \n【7】 Severe, prolonged psychologic stress also can cause hair to fall out on its own (telogen effluvium).  This hair loss, however, involves major, chronic stress and not the routine stresses of daily life.  Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) Scalp ringworm (Tinea Capitis) Scalp ringworm is a dermatophyte (fungal) infection of the scalp.  Symptoms of tinea capitis include a dry patch of scale, a patch of hair loss, or both on the scalp. \n【8】 The infection begins as a dry, scaly patch that gradually enlarges.  Hairs may eventually break off, usually flush with the surface of the scalp, looking like black dots.  Sometimes the hair breaks off above the surface of the scalp, leaving short stubs.  Hair loss may be permanent, especially if the infection is left untreated.  Traction alopecia This disorder is hair loss caused by tight braids, rollers, or ponytails that pull constantly on hair.  Hair loss most often occurs at the hairline of the forehead and temples.  Evaluation of Alopecia The following information can help people decide whether a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs The following are of particular concern: Signs of a bodywide disorder In women, development of masculine characteristics (virilization), such as a deepened voice, hair in locations more typical of male hair growth , irregular menstrual periods, acne, breast atrophy, increased muscle bulk, enlarged clitoris, and increased libido (sex drive) When to see the doctor People who have hair loss and signs of a bodywide disorder should see a doctor promptly.  Women who have developed masculine characteristics should call their doctor to discuss how soon they should be seen.  Other people should see a doctor when possible, but an appointment is not urgent unless other symptoms develop.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history and then do a physical examination.  What doctors find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the hair loss and the tests that may need to be done.  Doctors ask about the hair loss: Whether hair loss began gradually or suddenly How long it has been present Whether hair loss is increasing Whether hair is being lost over the entire head or in one specific area They note other symptoms such as itching and scaling.  They ask about hair care, including whether braids, rollers, and hair dryers are used and whether the hair is routinely pulled or twisted.  Doctors ask whether the person has been recently exposed to drugs, toxins, or radiation or has experienced significant stress (such as that resulting from surgery, chronic illness, fever, or psychologic stress).  They ask about other characteristics that may suggest a cause, including dramatic weight loss, dietary practices (including various restrictive diets), and obsessive-compulsive behavior Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions, compulsions, or both.  Obsessions are recurring, persistent, unwanted, anxiety-provoking, intrusive ideas, images, or urges. \n【9】 Doctors review the person's current and recent drug use and family history of hair loss.  During the physical examination, doctors focus on the scalp, noting the distribution of hair loss, the presence and characteristics of any skin abnormalities, and the presence of any scarring.  They measure the width of the central part of the scalp at several points , Home.  and look at hairs under a microscope for abnormalities of the hair shafts.  Doctors evaluate hair loss elsewhere on the body (such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, arms, and legs).  They look for rashes that may be associated with certain types of alopecia and for signs of virilization in women such as a deepened voice, hirsutism, an enlarged clitoris, and acne.  They also examine the thyroid gland.   Testing is usually unnecessary if a cause is identified based on the doctor's examination.  For example, male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss generally requires no testing.  However, if hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history of hair loss, the doctor may question him about use of anabolic steroids are synthetic (man-made) versions of testosterone that are used to increase muscle size. \n【10】 Women who have significant hair loss and who have developed masculine characteristics may be asked whether they use prescription or illegal drugs and may undergo blood tests to measure levels of the hormones testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).  If the doctor's examination detects signs of other hormonal abnormalities or other serious illness, blood tests to identify those disorders may be needed (for example, tests to measure luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] may be done to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]).  The pull test helps doctors evaluate hair loss.  Doctors gently pull on a bunch of hairs (about 40) on at least 3 different areas of the scalp.  Doctors then count the number of hairs that come out with each pull and examine them under a microscope to determine their phase of growth.  If more than 4 to 6 hairs in the telogen phase come out with each pull, the pull test is positive, and the person most likely has telogen effluvium.  During the pluck test, doctors abruptly pull out about 50 individual hairs (“by the roots”).  Doctors examine the roots and shafts of the plucked hairs under a microscope to assess the hair shaft and determine the phase of growth.  These results help doctors tell whether the person has a telogen effluvium, a primary hair shaft abnormality, or some other problem.  Daily hair counts can be done to quantify hair loss when the pull test is negative and it is not clear whether hair loss is actually excessive.  Hairs lost while combing first thing in the morning or during shampooing are collected in clear plastic bags daily for 14 days.  The number of hairs in each bag is then recorded.  Loss of more than 100 hairs a day is abnormal except after shampooing, when up to 250 hairs may be lost.  Hairs may be brought in by the person for examination under a microscope.  A biopsy Doctors can identify many skin disorders simply by looking at the skin.  A full skin examination includes examination of the scalp, nails, and mucous membranes. \n【11】 A biopsy helps determine whether hair follicles are normal and can help differentiate alopecia that causes scarring (by destroying the hair follicle) from alopecia that does not.  If the hair follicles are abnormal, the biopsy may indicate possible causes.  Treatment of Alopecia Treatment of specific causes Sometimes hair replacement methods Specific causes of hair loss are treated when possible: Drugs that are causing hair loss are switched or stopped.  Hormonal disorders can be treated with drugs or surgery, depending on the cause.  Iron or zinc supplements can be given if these minerals are deficient Iron deficiency usually results from loss of blood in adults .  Vitamin A intake can be decreased in people who have alopecia caused by vitamin A excess.  Alopecia areata Treatment Alopecia areata is sudden loss of patches of hair when there is no obvious cause such as a skin or general internal disorder. \n【12】 Other topical and oral drugs may be given.  Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, and frontal fibrosing alopecia can usually be treated with corticosteroids that are injected into the skin or applied topically or with other topical or oral drugs.  Traction alopecia is treated by eliminating physical traction or stress to the scalp.  Scalp ringworm (Tinea Capitis) Scalp ringworm is a dermatophyte (fungal) infection of the scalp. \n【13】 Trichotillomania Hair-Pulling Disorder (Trichotillomania) In hair-pulling disorder, people repeatedly pull their hair out, resulting in hair loss. \n【14】 Hair loss due to physical stresses such as recent weight loss, surgery, a severe illness with a high fever, or delivery of a baby (telogen effluvium) is not typically treated because it tends to resolve on its own.  Applying minoxidil to the scalp may be helpful for some people.  Hair replacement methods can be tried if hair does not regrow on its own, including Drugs to prevent further hair loss or grow new hair transplantation Wigs Drugs Male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss can sometimes be treated effectively with drugs.  Minoxidil may prevent further hair loss and increase hair growth.  When applied directly to the scalp twice a day, topical minoxidil is effective for male- and female-pattern hair loss.  Hair regrowth can take 8 to 12 months and is noticeable in only about 30 to 40% of people.  The most common side effects are skin irritation, such as itching and rash.  An increase in hair on the face can also occur.  Minoxidil can also be taken by mouth.  Finasteride works by blocking the effects of male hormones on the hair follicles and is taken by mouth daily.  Finasteride is occasionally used in women who are postmenopausal.  It should never be used by pregnant women because it causes birth defects in animals, so whether it is safe in pregnancy is unknown.  In men, its effectiveness at stopping hair loss and stimulating hair growth is usually evident within 6 to 8 months of treatment and increases over time but can vary from person to person.  Finasteride can decrease libido, increase breast size, contribute to erectile dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. \n【15】 Finasteride can also decrease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Men should discuss how finasteride can affect prostate cancer screening Prostate cancer begins in a small area of the prostate gland, an organ found only in males.  The risk of prostate cancer increases as men age. \n【16】 The most important effect of minoxidil or finasteride may be to prevent further hair loss.  The effects last only as long as the drugs are taken.  Hormonal modulators, such as birth control pills  or spironolactone, may be useful in some women.  Hair transplantation is a more permanent solution.  In this procedure, hair follicles are removed from one part of the scalp and transplanted to the bald area.  In this technique, only one or two hairs are transplanted at a time.  Another surgical option involves removing some bald parts of the scalp skin and stretching the parts that have hair over a wider area.  Wigs often offer the best treatment for temporary hair loss (for example, that caused by chemotherapy).  People undergoing chemotherapy should consult a wig maker even before therapy begins so that an appropriate wig can be ready when needed.  When hair regrows, it may be different in color and texture from the original hair.  Other options Laser light therapy is an alternate or additional treatment for male- and female-pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) that has been shown to promote hair growth.  Over-the-counter devices are available, or doctors can do laser light therapy in the office. \n【17】 Platelets are thought to contain substances that trigger hair growth.  In this treatment, called platelet-rich plasma therapy or PRP therapy, blood is taken from a person and processed to remove the platelet-rich plasma.  The platelet-rich plasma is then injected into bald patches and may stimulate the growth of new hair.  Some people conceal thinning hair by using camouflage powders, hair loss concealers (products that contain fibers that bind to existing hair), and a form of tattooing called scalp micropigmentation.  Key Points Male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss is the most common type of hair loss.  Doctors look for an underlying disorder in women with signs of virilization.

Ectopic pregnancies cannot be carried to term and eventually rupture or involute.  Early symptoms and signs include pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.  Hemorrhagic shock can occur with rupture.  Diagnosis is by measurement of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and ultrasonography.  Treatment is with laparoscopic or open surgical resection or with methotrexate.  Ectopic pregnancy can cause life-threatening hemorrhage, and if it is suspected, the patient should be evaluated and treated as soon as possible.  Incidence of ectopic pregnancy is about 2/100 diagnosed pregnancies . \n【1】 Etiology of Ectopic Pregnancy Most ectopic pregnancies are located in the fallopian tube, and any history of infection or surgery that increases the risk of tubal adhesions or other abnormalities increases risk of ectopic pregnancy.  Factors that particularly increase risk of ectopic pregnancy include Prior ectopic pregnancy Prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, particularly tubal surgery, including tubal ligation Tubal abnormalities Current intrauterine device (IUD) use In vitro fertilization in current pregnancy is much less likely to occur after tubal ligation or IUD placement; however, when pregnancy does occur, risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased (eg, about 5% in current IUD users).  Other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include Current use of estrogen/progestin oral contraceptives History of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscess may occur. \n【2】 Pregnancies in the cervix, a cesarean delivery scar, an ovary, or the abdomen are rare.  Heterotopic pregnancy (simultaneous ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies) occurs in only 1/10,000 to 30,000 pregnancies but may be more common among women who have had ovulation induction or used assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) involve manipulation of sperm and ova or embryos in vitro with the goal of producing a pregnancy. \n【3】 The anatomic structure containing the fetus usually ruptures after about 6 to 16 weeks.  Rupture results in bleeding that can be gradual or rapid enough to cause hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. \n【4】 The later in the pregnancy the rupture occurs, the more rapidly blood is lost and the higher the risk of death. \n【5】 Symptoms and Signs of Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy vary and may be absent until rupture occurs.  Most patients have pelvic pain (which can be dull, sharp, or crampy), vaginal bleeding, or both.  Patients who have irregular menses may not be aware that they are pregnant.  Rupture may be heralded by sudden, severe pain, followed by syncope or by symptoms and signs of hemorrhagic shock or peritonitis.  Rapid hemorrhage is more likely in ruptured cornual pregnancies.  Cervical motion tenderness, unilateral or bilateral adnexal tenderness, or an adnexal mass may be present.  Pelvic examination should be done carefully because excessive pressure may rupture the pregnancy.  The uterus may be slightly enlarged (but often less than anticipated based on date of the last menstrual period).  Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy Quantitative serum beta–human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) Pelvic ultrasonography Sometimes laparoscopy Ectopic pregnancy is suspected in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock, regardless of sexual, contraceptive, and menstrual history.  Findings of physical (including pelvic) examination are neither sensitive nor specific.  A ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a surgical emergency because it causes maternal hemorrhage and risk of death; prompt diagnosis is essential.  Pearls & Pitfalls Suspect ectopic pregnancy in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock, regardless of sexual, contraceptive, and menstrual history and examination findings.  The first step is a urine pregnancy test, which is about 99% sensitive for pregnancy (ectopic and otherwise).  If urine beta-hCG is negative and if clinical findings do not strongly suggest ectopic pregnancy, further evaluation is unnecessary unless symptoms recur or worsen.  If urine beta-hCG is positive or if clinical findings strongly suggest ectopic pregnancy and pregnancy may be too early to detect based on urine beta-hCG, quantitative serum beta-hCG and pelvic ultrasonography are indicated.  If ultrasonography detects an intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely except in women who have used assisted reproductive techniques (which increase risk of heterotopic pregnancy, although it is still rare in these patients).  However, cornual and interstitial pregnancies may appear to be intrauterine pregnancies.  Findings diagnostic for an intrauterine pregnancy are a gestational sac with a yolk sac or an embryo (with or without a heartbeat) within the uterine cavity.  In addition to absence of an intrauterine pregnancy, ultrasonographic findings suggesting ectopic pregnancy include a complex (mixed solid and cystic) pelvic mass, particularly in the adnexa, and echogenic free fluid in the cul-de-sac.  If serum beta-hCG is above a certain level (called the discriminatory zone), ultrasonography should detect a gestational sac with a yolk sac in patients with an intrauterine pregnancy.  For transvaginal ultrasonography, this level is may be as high as 3500 mIU/mL, although many institutions use 2000 mIU/mL .  If the beta-hCG level is higher than the discriminatory zone and an intrauterine pregnancy is not detected, an ectopic pregnancy is likely.  If the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone and ultrasonography is unremarkable, patients may have an early intrauterine pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy.  If clinical evaluation suggests ectopic pregnancy with active bleeding or rupture (eg, signs of significant hemorrhage or peritoneal irritation), diagnostic laparoscopy may be necessary for diagnosis and treatment.  If ectopic pregnancy has not been confirmed and patients are stable, serum levels of beta-hCG are measured serially on an outpatient basis (typically every 2 days).  Normally, the level doubles every 1. 4 to 2. 1 days up to 41 days; in ectopic pregnancy (and in potential spontaneous abortions), levels may be lower than expected by dates and usually do not double as rapidly.  If beta-hCG levels do not increase as expected or if they decrease, diagnosis of spontaneous abortion is pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation. \n【6】 Treatment of Ectopic Pregnancy Usually, methotrexate for small, unruptured ectopic pregnancies Surgical resection if rupture is suspected or criteria are not met for methotrexate treatment Rho(D) immune globulin if the woman is Rh-negative Methotrexate Patients with a tubal pregnancy may be treated with methotrexate if all of the following are present: The patient is hemodynamically stable with no signs of current or impending rupture.  Complete blood count and renal and liver function test results are normal and the patient has no other contraindications.  The pregnancy is < 3 to 4 cm in diameter.  No fetal heart activity is detected.  The beta-hCG level is ≤ 5,000 mIU/mL.  The patient is willing and able to comply with posttreatment follow-up.  In a commonly used protocol, beta-hCG is measured on day 1, and the patient is given a single dose of methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IM.  Beta-hCG measurement is repeated on days 4 and 7.  If the beta-hCG level does not decrease by 15% from day 4 to 7, a 2nd dose of methotrexate or surgery is needed.  Alternatively, other protocols can be used.  The beta-hCG level is then measured weekly until it is undetectable.  Success rates with methotrexate are about 87%; 7% of women have serious complications (eg, rupture).  Usually, methotrexate can be used, but surgery is indicated when rupture is suspected, the patient is not able to comply with follow-up after methotrexate therapy, or methotrexate is ineffective.  Surgical resection Hemodynamically unstable patients require immediate laparotomy and treatment of hemorrhagic shock is a state of organ hypoperfusion with resultant cellular dysfunction and death. \n【7】 For stable patients, surgical treatment is usually laparoscopic surgery; sometimes laparotomy is required.  If possible, salpingotomy is done to conserve the tube, and the ectopic pregnancy is removed.  Salpingectomy is indicated in any of the following cases: The ectopic pregnancy has ruptured.  Hemorrhage continues after salpingotomy.  The tube has been reconstructed.  The ectopic pregnancy represents a failure of a previous sterilization procedure, particularly if the pregnancy is in the blind-ending distal segment in women who have had a previous partial salpingectomy.  Only the irreversibly damaged portion of the tube is removed, maximizing the chance that tubal repair can restore fertility.  The tube may or may not be repaired.  After a cornual pregnancy, the tube and ovary involved can usually be salvaged, but occasionally repair is impossible, making hysterectomy necessary.  All patients who are Rh-negative, whether managed with methotrexate or surgery, are given Rho(D) immune globulin Prevention .  Key Points Ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of a pregnancy in a site other than the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity; the most common site for ectopic pregnancies is a fallopian tube.  Symptoms can include pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding in a pregnant woman, but a women may not be aware she is pregnant and symptoms may be absent until rupture occurs, sometimes with catastrophic results.  Suspect ectopic pregnancy in any female of reproductive age with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or unexplained syncope or hemorrhagic shock.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive or clinical findings suggest ectopic pregnancy, determine quantitative serum beta-hCG and do pelvic ultrasonography.  Treatment usually involves methotrexate, but surgical resection is done if rupture is suspected or criteria are not met for methotrexate treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 17:52:32"}

Femoral venous cannulation has the procedural advantages of a relatively superficial and easily accessed vein.  In addition, the nearby anatomy lacks the complexity and vital structures of the jugular and subclavian regions.  However, femoral central venous catheters (CVCs) have higher risks of infection and thrombosis and are appropriate only for bedridden patients. \n【1】 When ultrasonographic guidance and trained personnel are available, this method of placement is preferred.   Indications for Femoral Vein Cannulation Secure or long-term venous access that is not available using other sites Inability to obtain peripheral venous access Peripheral Vein Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. \n【2】 Femoral lines are usually used only as provisional access because they have a high risk of infection.  They should be exchanged for lines above the diaphragm as soon as possible. \n【3】 Contraindications to Femoral Vein Cannulation Absolute contraindications Intra-abdominal hemorrhage or regional trauma Femoral vein thrombosis Local infection at the insertion site Antibiotic-impregnated catheter in an allergic patient For intra-abdominal hemorrhage or regional trauma, sites that drain into the superior vena cava should be used.  Relative contraindications Coagulopathy, including therapeutic anticoagulation* Local anatomic distortion (traumatic or congenital), or gross obesity History of prior catheterization of the intended central vein Uncooperative patient (should be sedated if necessary) Ambulatory patient * Therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, for pulmonary embolism) increases the risk of bleeding with femoral vein cannulation, but this must be balanced against the increased risk of thrombosis (eg, stroke) if anticoagulation is reversed.  Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient.  Femoral vein cannulation may be preferred for coagulopathic patients because, unlike the subclavian or internal jugular sites, the femoral triangle is readily compressible and vital structures (airway, pleural dome, mediastinum, blood vessels to brain) are distant from the venipuncture site.  Complications of Femoral Vein Cannulation  Complications include Infection Thrombosis Arterial puncture Hematoma Retroperitoneal bleeding Damage to the vein Air embolism Catheter misplacement* Nerve damage Bladder or bowel perforation (rare) * Rare complications due to femoral catheter misplacement include arterial catheterization and retroperitoneal infusion.  Guidewire or catheter embolism also rarely occurs.  To reduce the risk of venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis, CVCs should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.  Equipment for Femoral Vein Cannulation Sterile procedure, barrier protection Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, alcohol) Sterile drapes (large), towels Sterile head caps, masks, gowns, gloves Face shields Seldinger (catheter-over-guidewire) technique Cardiac monitor Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, about 5 mL) Small anesthetic needle (eg, 25 to 27 gauge, about 1 inches [3 cm] long) Large anesthetic/finder* needle (22 gauge, about 1. 5 inches [4 cm] long) Introducer needle (eg, thin-walled, 18 or 16 gauge, with internally beveled hub, about 2. 5 inches [6 cm] long) 3- and 5-mL syringes (use slip-tip syringes for the finder and introducer needles) Guidewire, J-tipped Scalpel (#11 blade) Dilator Central venous catheter (adult: 8 French or larger, minimum length for femoral catheter is 24 cm) Sterile gauze (eg, 4 × 4 inch [10 × 10 cm] squares) Sterile saline for flushing catheter port or ports Nonabsorbable nylon or silk suture (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) Chlorhexidine patch, transparent occlusive dressing * A finder needle is a thinner needle used for locating the vein before inserting the introducer needle.  It is not typically used but is optional (eg, in obese patients) for femoral vein cannulation.  Having an assistant or two is helpful.  Additional Considerations for Femoral Vein Cannulation attempts sometimes fail.  Do not exceed 2 or 3 attempts (which increases the risk of complications), and use new equipment with each attempt (ie, do not re-use needles, catheters, or other equipment because they may have become blocked with tissue or blood).  During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood.  If the femoral artery is errantly cannulated by either the tissue dilator or the CVC, leave the dilator or catheter in place and obtain surgical consultation for possible surgical removal.  Relevant Anatomy for Femoral Vein Cannulation The femoral vein and artery are accessible within the femoral triangle, which is defined by the inguinal ligament superiorly, the adductor longus muscle medially, and the sartorius muscle laterally.  The inguinal ligament spans between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine.  The femoral artery is palpated inferior to the inguinal ligament, typically at or just medial to its midpoint.  In the absence of a palpable femoral pulse, the femoral artery is presumed to lie in this region.  The femoral vein lies medially adjacent to the femoral artery.  With increasing distance from the inguinal ligament, the vein runs under the artery.  The desired point of femoral vein puncture is 1 to 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament.  Bleeding due to a vascular impalement here can be controlled by externally compressing the vessels against the femoral head.  The retroperitoneal space lies superior to the inguinal ligament.  Bleeding due to a vascular impalement here causes retroperitoneal bleeding, and external compression of the vessels may be impossible.  Positioning for Femoral Vein Cannulation Raise the bed to a comfortable height for you (ie, so you may stand straight while doing the procedure).  Place the patient supine or in slight reverse Trendelenburg position (bed tilted with the head up) to distend the femoral vein.  Comfortably abduct and externally rotate the leg.  Retract a pannus or a urethral catheter away from the inguinal area using tape (or an assistant if needed).  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Do a preliminary inspection (nonsterile) to identify the symphysis pubis, anterior superior iliac crest, femoral pulse, and umbilicus.  Attach the cardiac monitor to the patient and turn it on.  Excess hair may be clipped but not shaved from the site.  Shaving increases the risk of infection.  Prepare the equipment Place sterile equipment on sterilely covered equipment trays.  Dress in sterile garb and use barrier protection.  Draw the local anesthetic into a syringe.  Optional: Attach a finder needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.  Attach the introducer needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.  Align the bevel of the needle with the volume markings on the syringe.  Pre-flush all lines of the CVC with 3 to 5 mL of sterile saline and then close the ports with caps or syringes.  When flushing a central line, use a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and do not push too hard to avoid rupturing the line.  Prepare the sterile field Swab a broad area of skin with antiseptic solution, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midline and extending down 15 cm below the inguinal ligament.  Allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute.  Place sterile towels around the site.  Place large sterile drapes (eg, a full-body drape) to establish a large sterile field.  Establish the needle insertion path Gently palpate the femoral arterial pulse using 2 or 3 fingers.  Palpate gently so as not to compress the adjacent femoral vein (a compressed venous lumen is difficult to access).  The needle insertion path: Insert procedural needles (local anesthetic, finder, and introducer needles) 2 to 4 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament, 1 cm medial to the femoral artery, at a 45 to 60° angle into the skin, and aim toward the umbilicus.  Maintain femoral artery palpation during needle insertions and keep the needle medial to the artery to avoid impaling the artery.  Anesthetize the cannulation site Place a wheal of anesthetic at the needle entry site and then inject anesthetic into the skin and soft tissues along the anticipated needle insertion path.  Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance to identify intravascular placement and prevent an intravascular injection.  If blood returns into the syringe, stop advancing, hold the syringe in place, and now regard this needle as a finder needle. \n【4】 Insert the introducer needle (or finder needle, optional) Insert the introducer needle (or, optionally, finder needle), with the bevel facing up, along the needle insertion path.  Maintain gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance the needle.  Stop advancing when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe (you may feel the needle pop through the wall as it enters the lumen).  Hold the syringe motionless in this spot.  Even a slight movement may displace the needle tip from the vein.  If no flash of blood appears in the barrel after 2 to 4 cm of insertion, withdraw the needle slowly.  If the needle had initially passed completely through the vein, a flash may now appear as you withdraw the needle tip back into the lumen.  If a flash still does not appear, withdraw the needle almost to the skin surface, change direction, and try again to advance the needle into the vein.  Do not change direction of the needle while it is fully inserted.  Assess the blood return Continue to hold the syringe motionless.  Securely grasp the needle hub and also hold it motionless.  Remove the syringe from the needle hub and briefly let blood flow out to confirm that the blood is venous (ie, dark red and flowing but not pulsatile).  Then immediately cover the hub with your thumb to stop the blood flow and prevent air embolism.  However, if the blood is bright red and pulsatile (arterial), terminate the procedure.  Remove the needle and use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.  Optional: Use the finder needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle If up to this point you have been inserting a finder needle (or an anesthetic needle that found the vein), now you will use this needle to guide insertion of the introducer needle.  Hold the introducer syringe with the needle bevel facing up.  Use one of two insertion methods: Either remove the finder needle and immediately insert the introducer needle along the same path, or keep the finder needle in place and insert the introducer needle underneath and roughly parallel to it (at a slightly shallower angle to the skin).  Stop advancing the introducer needle and hold it motionless when a flash of blood appears in the barrel of the syringe.  If the finder needle has not been removed, remove it now. \n【5】 Insert the guidewire Continue to hold the introducer needle motionless.  Insert the J-curved end of the guidewire into the introducer needle, with the J curve facing up.  Advance the guidewire through the needle and into the vein.  Do not force the wire; it should slide smoothly.  Advance the wire 20 to 30 cm.  If you feel any resistance as you advance the guidewire, stop advancing it.  Try to gently withdraw the wire slightly, rotate it slightly, and then readvance it, or try to gently withdraw the wire entirely, reestablish the needle tip within the vein (confirmed by venous blood return), and then reinsert the wire.  However, if you feel any resistance as you withdraw the wire, terminate the procedure and withdraw the needle and guidewire together as a unit (to prevent the needle tip from shearing through the guidewire within the patient).  Then use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.  Once the guidewire has been inserted, continue to hold it securely in place with one hand and maintain control of it throughout the remainder of the procedure.  Remove the introducer needle (after successful guidewire insertion) First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle and pull the needle from the skin.  Then, securely hold the guidewire at the skin surface and slide the needle down the remaining length of the guidewire to remove the needle.  Widen the insertion tract Extend the skin insertion site: Using the scalpel, make a small stab incision (about 4 mm) into the skin insertion site, avoiding contact with the guidewire, to enlarge the site and allow it to accommodate the larger diameters of the tissue dilator and the catheter.  Advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire: First, grasp the guidewire at the skin and slide the dilator down the length of the wire to the skin.  Then grasp the wire just distal to the dilator, hold the dilator near the skin surface, and use a corkscrew motion as needed to stepwise insert the entire length of the dilator.  Maintain your grasp on the guidewire at all times during the insertion.  Remove the dilator: First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the dilator and pull the dilator from the skin.  When the guidewire is visible at the skin surface, completely remove the dilator by sliding it down the remaining length of the guidewire.  Place the catheter Advance the catheter over the guidewire to the skin surface: Hold the guidewire fixed at the skin surface, thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire, and slide the catheter down to the skin surface.  The distal end of the guidewire should now be protruding from the port hub.  If the distal end of the guidewire is not protruding from the port hub, inch the guidewire outward from the skin surface while holding the catheter tip close to the surface until the guidewire protrudes.  Continue to advance the catheter into the vein: Grasp and control the guidewire where it protrudes from the hub.  Hold the catheter near its tip and insert the tip through the skin.  Then, in increments of several centimeters and using a corkscrew motion as necessary, stepwise advance the entire length of the femoral catheter.  Maintain your grasp on both the guidewire and the catheter.  Remove the guidewire: Withdraw the guidewire while holding the catheter securely in place at the skin surface.  Flush each catheter port with saline: First, draw any air from the line and confirm venous blood flow into the hub.  Then, using a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and nonexcessive force, push 20 mL of saline into the line to clear it.  Dress the site If the patient is awake or minimally sedated, use 1% lidocaine to numb the skin at the planned suture locations.  Place a chlorhexidine-impregnated disk on the skin at the catheter insertion point.  Suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter.  To prevent pulling on the insertion site, suture the catheter at a second site so that a curved or looped segment of catheter lies between the two sites.  Apply a sterile occlusive dressing.  Transparent membrane dressings are commonly used.  Aftercare for Femoral Vein Cannulation If needed (eg, if the femoral catheter is malfunctioning), do a chest x-ray to confirm that the tip of the catheter lies in the inferior vena cava distal to the right atrium.  Warnings and Common Errors for Femoral Vein Cannulation Never lose grasp of the guidewire.  To help prevent air embolism, CVCs should be inserted (and removed) with the vascular cannulation site positioned dependant to the heart.

Patients with indwelling bladder catheters are predisposed to bacteriuria and UTIs.  Symptoms may be vague or may suggest sepsis.  Diagnosis depends on the presence of symptoms.  Testing includes urinalysis and culture after the catheter has been removed and a new one inserted.  The most effective preventive measures are avoiding unnecessary catheterization and removing catheters as soon as possible. \n【1】 A biofilm develops around the outside of the catheter and on the uroepithelium.  Bacteria enter this biofilm, which protects them from the mechanical flow of urine, host defenses, and antibiotics, making bacterial elimination difficult.  Even with thoroughly aseptic catheter insertion and care, the chance of developing significant bacteriuria is 3 to 10% every day the catheter is indwelling.  Of patients who develop bacteriuria, 10 to 25% develop symptoms of UTI.  Fewer develop sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【2】 Risk factors for UTI include duration of catheterization, female sex, diabetes mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is impaired insulin secretion and variable degrees of peripheral insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. \n【3】 Indwelling bladder catheters can also predispose to fungal UTI Fungal Urinary Tract Infections Fungal infections of the urinary tract primarily affect the bladder and kidneys. \n【4】 UTIs can also develop in women during the days after a catheter has been removed.  Symptoms and Signs Patients with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) can not have some of the symptoms typical of UTIs , but they may complain of feeling the need to urinate or of suprapubic discomfort.  However, such symptoms of lower tract UTI may also be caused by obstruction of the catheter or development of bladder calculi Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.  They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【5】 Symptoms of acute or chronic pyelonephritis Acute pyelonephritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【6】 Patients may have nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, fever, flank pain, anorexia, altered mental status, and signs of sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【7】 Diagnosis Urinalysis and urine culture for patients with symptoms or at high risk of sepsis Testing is done only in patients who might require treatment, including those who have symptoms and those at high risk of developing sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【8】 If bacteremia is suspected, blood cultures are done.  Urine cultures should be done, preferably after replacing the catheter (to avoid culturing colonizing bacteria), then by a direct needlestick of the catheter, all done with aseptic technique, so that contamination of the specimen is minimized.  In women who have had a catheter removed, urine culture within 48 hours is recommended regardless of whether symptoms occur.  Treatment Antibiotics Asymptomatic, low-risk patients are not treated.  Symptomatic and high-risk patients are treated using antibiotics and supportive measures.  The catheter should be replaced when treatment begins.  Choice of empiric antibiotic is as for acute pyelonephritis Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) can involve the urethra, prostate, bladder, or kidneys. \n【9】 Sometimes vancomycin is added to the regimen.  Subsequently, antibiotics with the narrowest spectrum of activity, based on culture and sensitivity testing, should be used.  Optimal duration is not well established but 7 to 14 days is reasonable in patients who had a satisfactory clinical response, including resolution of systemic manifestations.  Asymptomatic women and men with recent catheter removal who have urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosed by urine culture should be treated based on the culture results.  Optimal duration of treatment is not known.  Prevention The most effective preventive measures are avoiding catheterization and removing catheters as soon as possible.  Optimizing aseptic technique and maintaining a closed drainage system also reduce risk.  How often and even whether to routinely change indwelling catheters is unknown.  Intermittent catheterization carries less risk than use of an indwelling catheter and should be used instead whenever feasible.  Antibiotic prophylaxis and antibiotic-coated catheters are no longer recommended for patients who require long-term indwelling catheters.  Key Points Long-term use of indwelling bladder catheters increases risk of bacteriuria, although bacteriuria is usually asymptomatic.  Symptomatic UTI may manifest with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, altered mental status, decreased blood pressure) and few or no symptoms typical of UTIs.  Do urinalysis and urine culture if patients have symptoms or are at high risk of sepsis (eg, because of immunocompromise).  Treat similarly to other complicated UTIs.

A whole liver can be obtained only from a person who has died, but a living donor can provide a part of the liver.  A donated liver can be stored for up to 18 hours.  Many people die while waiting for a suitable liver, but after transplantation, the percentage of liver transplant recipients who survive is At 1 year: 90% to 95% At 3 years: 80 to 85% At 5 years: around 75% Most recipients are people whose liver has been destroyed by cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue. \n【3】 Hepatitis is common throughout the world. \n【4】 Other reasons for liver transplantation include primary sclerosing cholangitis is inflammation with progressive scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts in and outside the liver.  Eventually, the ducts become blocked and then obliterated. \n【5】 People whose liver has been destroyed by an alcohol use disorder Alcohol-Related Liver Disease is liver damage caused by drinking too much alcohol for a long time. \n【6】 Liver transplantation is also done for some people who have liver cancer that is not too far advanced.  Although hepatitis C and autoimmune disorders tend to recur in the transplanted liver, survival is still good.  Both donors Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body. \n【7】 This screening is done to be sure that the organ is healthy enough for transplantation and the recipient does not have any medical conditions that would prohibit transplantation.  Donors Nearly all donated livers come from people who are brain dead Brain Death is the permanent loss of brain activity. \n【8】 The blood type and heart size of the donor and recipient must match.  Tissue type Tissue matching Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body. \n【9】 Some transplants come from living donors, who provide part of their liver, which is possible because even part of a healthy liver is enough.  A few transplants come from people who are brain dead and whose heart has stopped beating.  However, the liver from such donors is often damaged because it was not receiving blood.  Procedure for Liver Transplantation The damaged liver is removed through an incision in the abdomen, and the new liver is connected to the recipient’s blood vessels and bile ducts.  Usually, blood transfusions are required.  Typically, the operation lasts 4 1/2 hours or more, and the hospital stay is 7 to 12 days.  Drugs to inhibit the immune system , including corticosteroids, are started the day of transplantation.  These drugs can help reduce the risk that the recipient will reject the transplanted liver.  Compared with transplantation of other organs, liver transplantation requires the lowest doses of immunosuppressants.  Complications of Liver Transplantation can cause various complications After Transplantation is the removal of living, functioning cells, tissues, or organs from the body and then their transfer back into the same body or into a different body. \n【10】 Rejection Even if tissue types are closely matched, transplanted organs, unlike transfused blood, are usually rejected unless measures are taken to prevent rejection.  Rejection results from an attack by the recipient's immune system on the transplanted organ, which the immune system recognizes as foreign material.  Rejection can be mild and easily controlled or severe, resulting in destruction of the transplanted organ.  Liver transplants are rejected somewhat less vigorously than transplants of other organs, such as the kidney and heart.  Nonetheless, immunosuppressants must be taken after transplantation.  If the recipient develops an enlarged liver, nausea, pain, fever, jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.  Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia. \n【11】 Biopsy results help doctors determine whether the liver is being rejected and whether immunosuppressant therapy should be adjusted.  Rejection can be treated with corticosteroids or, if corticosteroids are ineffective, other immunosuppressants (such as antithymocyte globulin).  Another liver, if available, may be transplanted if drugs are ineffective.  Hepatitis Most people are given a liver transplant because they had cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis Overview of Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. \n【12】 Immunosuppressants, which are needed to help prevent rejection of the transplanted liver, also make the body less able to defend against infections.  As a result, hepatitis B or C recurs in nearly all liver transplant recipients.  However, antiviral drugs are effective in treating hepatitis that occurs in liver transplant recipients.  Other complications Some complications of liver transplantation can occur within 2 months.  For example, the liver may malfunction, blood clots may block blood vessels to or from the liver, or bile may leak out of the bile ducts.  Complications that occur soon after transplantation typically cause fever, low blood pressure, and abnormal results on tests done to evaluate the liver.  Later, the most common complication is scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts.  This disorder can cause jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. \n【13】 Sometimes the narrowed ducts can be reopened, but often, another transplant is required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:29:03"}

Pain, weakness, and loss of sensation occur in all or part of an arm or a leg.  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies help doctors locate the damage, and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography helps identify the cause.  Sometimes treating the disorder causing the problem improves nerve function. \n【1】 A plexus is like an electrical junction box, which distributes wires to different parts of a house.  In a plexus, nerve fibers from different spinal nerves (which connect the spinal cord to the rest of the body) are sorted.  The fibers are recombined so that all fibers going to a specific body part are put together in one nerve.  Damage to nerves in the major plexuses causes problems in the arms or legs that these nerves supply.  The major plexuses are the Brachial plexus, which is located in the neck and shoulders and which distributes nerves throughout the arms Lumbosacral plexus, which distributes nerves to the pelvis and legs The lumbosacral plexus includes the Lumbar plexus, located in the lower back Sacral plexus, located in the pelvis Nerve Junction Boxes: The Plexuses A plexus is like an electrical junction box in a house.  In a plexus, nerve fibers from different spinal nerves are sorted and recombined, so that all fibers going to a specific body part are put together in one nerve.  Four nerve plexuses are located in the trunk of the body: The cervical plexus provides nerve connections to the head, neck, and shoulder.  The brachial plexus provides connections to the chest, shoulders, upper arms, forearms, and hands.  The lumbar plexus provides connections to the back, abdomen, groin, thighs, knees, and calves.  The sacral plexus provides connections to the pelvis, buttocks, genitals, thighs, calves, and feet.  Because the lumbar and sacral plexuses are interconnected, they are sometimes referred to as the lumbosacral plexus.  The spinal nerves in the chest do not join a plexus.  They are the intercostal nerves, which are located between the ribs.  Causes of Plexus Disorders The most common causes of damage to a plexus are Physical injury Cancer An accident that pulls the arm or severely bends the arm at the shoulder may damage the brachial plexus (located near the shoulder).  In newborns, the brachial plexus can be damaged during birth if the delivery requires pulling or other maneuvers.  A fall can injure the lumbosacral plexus (located near the hip).  A cancer growing in the breast or upper part of the lung can invade and destroy the brachial plexus.  Cancer of the intestine, bladder, or prostate can invade the lumbosacral plexus.  Other masses, such as a noncancerous (benign) tumor, an abscess, or a pocket of blood (hematoma), may cause plexus disorders by putting pressure on a plexus.  Diabetes or radiation therapy for breast cancer, which can damage nerves throughout the body, may also damage nerves in a plexus.  Acute brachial neuritis (Parsonage-Turner syndrome, or neuralgic amyotrophy) is sudden malfunction of the brachial plexus due to inflammation rather than injury or cancer.  It is probably caused by an autoimmune reaction Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues.  What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known. \n【2】 This disorder occurs primarily in men.  It typically occurs in young adults but can occur at any age.  Symptoms of Plexus Disorders Malfunction of the brachial plexus causes pain, weakness, and loss of sensation in an arm.  All or part of the arm (such as the forearm or biceps) may be affected.  If the cause is an injury, recovery tends to occur slowly, over several months.  Some severe injuries cause permanent weakness.  Acute brachial neuritis causes severe pain in the upper arms and shoulders.  Usually, the arm becomes weak and reflexes are impaired as the pain resolves.  People may not be able to make an ο with their thumb and index finger.  Weakness develops within 3 to 10 days.  Then people typically regain their strength over the next few months.  Malfunction of the lumbosacral plexus causes pain in the lower back and leg as well as weakness and loss of sensation in all or part of a leg (such as the foot or calf).  Recovery depends on the cause.  Diagnosis of Plexus Disorders Electromyography and nerve conduction studies Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography Doctors suspect that a plexus is involved when symptoms are located in a part of the body supplied by a specific plexus.  The location of the symptoms indicates which plexus is affected.  Electromyography and nerve conduction studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【3】 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can help determine whether a cancer, another mass, or an injury is causing the plexus disorder.  Treatment of Plexus Disorders Treatment of the cause When cancer or injury is the cause, sometimes surgery Treatment of a plexus disorder depends on the cause.  Cancer near the plexus may be treated with radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both.  Occasionally, a cancer or another mass that is damaging the plexus must be removed surgically.

Most cases are due to an increase in melanin production and deposition.   Focal hyperpigmentation is most often postinflammatory in nature, occurring after injury  or other causes of inflammation . \n【1】 Acanthosis nigricans causes focal hyperpigmentation and a velvety plaque most often on the axillae and posterior neck.  Diffuse hyperpigmentation Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. \n【2】 After eliminating drugs as a cause of diffuse hyperpigmentation, patients should be tested for the most common systemic causes.  These causes include Addison disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. \n【3】 Skin findings are nondiagnostic; therefore, a skin biopsy is not necessary or helpful.  The search for underlying cancer should be based on a review of systems.  Melasma (Chloasma) Melasma consists of dark brown, roughly symmetric patches of hyperpigmentation with irregular borders on the face (usually on the forehead, temples, cheeks, cutaneous upper lip, or nose).  It occurs primarily in pregnant women (melasma gravidarum, also called the mask of pregnancy) and in women taking oral contraceptives (OCs) mimic ovarian hormones. \n【4】 Ten percent of cases occur in nonpregnant women and dark-skinned men.  Melasma is more prevalent among and lasts longer in people with dark skin.  Because melasma risk increases with increasing sun exposure, the mechanism probably involves overproduction of melanin by hyperfunctional melanocytes.  Other than sun exposure, aggravating factors include Autoimmune thyroid disorders Photosensitizing drugs In women, melasma fades slowly and incompletely after childbirth or cessation of hormone use.  In men, melasma rarely fades.  The mainstay of melasma management is strict photoprotection agents.  Patients should use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher, wear protective clothing and hats, and avoid direct sun exposure.  During and after therapy, strict sun protection must be maintained.  Because visible light is not blocked by most sunscreens, patients should use a tinted sunscreen (eg, that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide).  The addition of antioxidants to the sunscreen and oral adjunctive photoprotection agents such as Polypodium leucotomas can enhance protection .  Because of potential health and environmental toxicities, oxybenzone and benzophenone-3 are usually not preferred sunscreens .  Other treatment depends on whether the pigmentation is epidermal or dermal; epidermal pigmentation becomes accentuated with a Wood light Diagnostic tests are indicated when the cause of a skin lesion or disease is not obvious from history and physical examination alone. \n【5】 Only epidermal pigmentation responds to treatment.  Most topical melasma treatments are used in combination rather than individually.  Triple topical therapy is first-line treatment that is often effective and consists of a combination of Hydroquinone 2 to 4% Tretinoin 0. 05 to 1% A class V to VII topical corticosteroid Hydroquinone depigments the skin by blocking the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and inhibiting melanocyte metabolic processes.  Hydroquinone should be tested behind one ear or on a small patch on the forearm for 1 week before use on the face because it may cause irritation or an allergic reaction.  Tretinoin promotes keratinocyte turnover and can exfoliate skin that contains epidermal pigment.  Corticosteroids help block synthesis and secretion of melanin.  Two promising technologies being tried in conjunction with triple topical therapy are the Q-switched Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser and nonablative fractional resurfacing.  If triple topical therapy is not available, then hydroquinone 3 to 4% applied twice a day for up to 8 weeks at a time (chronic continuous use can theoretically increase the risk of exogenous ochronosis, which is a permanent form of hyperpigmentation) may be considered; 2% hydroquinone is useful as maintenance.  Azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream can be used in place of or with hydroquinone and/or tretinoin.  Azelaic acid is a tyrosinase inhibitor that reduces melanin production.  In addition, topical kojic acid has been increasingly used; it is a chelating agent that blocks tyrosine conversion to melanin.  During pregnancy, azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream and chemical peeling with glycolic acid are safe to use.  Hydroquinone and tretinoin are not safe to use.  Second-line treatment options for patients with severe melasma unresponsive to topical bleaching agents include chemical peeling with glycolic acid or 30 to 50% trichloroacetic acid.  Laser treatments also have been used but are not standard therapy.  Oral therapies have been studied.  A randomized study has shown improvement with oral tranexamic acid in patients with moderate-to-severe melasma . \n【6】 Lentigines (singular: lentigo) are flat, tan to brown, oval macules.  They are commonly due to chronic sun exposure (solar lentigines; sometimes called liver spots but are not related to hepatic dysfunction) and occur most frequently on the face and back of the hands.  They typically first appear during middle age and increase in number with age.  Although progression from lentigines to melanoma has not been established, lentigines are an independent risk factor for melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).  Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【7】 If lentigines are a cosmetic concern, they are treated with cryotherapy or laser; hydroquinone is not effective.  Nonsolar lentigines are sometimes associated with systemic disorders, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease with multiple hamartomatous polyps in the stomach, small bowel, and colon along with distinctive pigmented skin lesions. \n【8】 Drug-Induced Hyperpigmentation Changes are usually diffuse but sometimes have drug-specific distribution patterns or hues Mechanisms include Increased melanin in the epidermis (tends to be more brown) Increased melanin in the epidermis and high dermis (mostly brown with hints of gray or blue) Increased melanin in the dermis (tends to be more grayish or blue) Dermal deposition of the drug, metabolite, or drug–melanin complexes (usually slate or bluish gray) Drugs may cause secondary hyperpigmentation. \n【9】  In fixed drug eruptions, red plaques or blisters form at the same site each time the causative drug is taken; residual postinflammatory hyperpigmentation usually persists, especially in darker skin types.  Typical lesions occur on the face (especially the lips), hands, feet, and genitals.  Typical inciting drugs include antibiotics (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim, and fluoroquinolones), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and barbiturates.  Treatment of drug-induced hyperpigmentation involves stopping the causative drug; the hyperpigmentation fades very slowly in some if not all cases.  Because many drugs that cause skin pigmentation also cause photosensitivity reactions Photosensitivity is a cutaneous overreaction to sunlight. \n【10】 Key Points Common causes of focal hyperpigmentation include injury, inflammation, phytophotodermatitis, lentigines, melasma, freckles, café-au-lait macules, and acanthosis nigricans.  Common causes of widespread hyperpigmentation include melasma, drugs, cancers, and other systemic disorders.  Test patients who have widespread hyperpigmentation not caused by drugs for disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis, and Addison disease.  Treat melasma initially with a combination of hydroquinone 2 to 4%, tretinoin 0. 05 to 1%, and a class V to VII topical corticosteroid.

These symptoms usually resolve by age 30 years.  Hyperostoses affect the long bones and skull.  Cranial nerve compression and elevated intracranial pressure occur occasionally.  Some patients are severely handicapped; others are virtually asymptomatic.  Diagnosis of diaphyseal dysplasia is suspected by the combination of muscular deficits and hyperostoses of the long bones and skull.  Typically, plain x-rays are done.  The predominant x-ray feature is marked thickening of the periosteal and medullary surfaces of the diaphyseal cortices of the long bones, but findings vary.  Medullary canals and external bone contours are irregular.  The extremities and axial skeleton usually are spared.  Rarely, the skull is involved, with calvarial widening and basal sclerosis.

It is experienced and described differently by patients depending on the cause. \n【3】 Hemoptysis occurs later. \n【4】 The most common symptoms in adults are exertional dyspnea and fatigue due to pulmonary hemorrhage and iron deficiency anemia Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia and usually results from blood loss; malabsorption, such as with celiac disease, is a much less common cause. \n【5】 Diagnosis Bronchoalveolar lavage Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis involves demonstration of a combination of characteristic clinical findings, iron deficiency anemia, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy specimens plus no evidence of small-vessel vasculitis (pulmonary capillaritis) or another explanatory diagnosis; it is confirmed by lung biopsy if other findings are inconclusive.  Treatment Corticosteroids may reduce the morbidity and mortality of acute episodes of alveolar bleeding and may control the disease progression of pulmonary fibrosis.  Some patients may require additional immunosuppressive drugs.

Bacteria infect a blocked gland in the anus or rectum and create an abscess.  The infection produces pus and causes pain and swelling.  The diagnosis is based on an examination and the results of imaging tests if needed.  Cutting and draining the abscess is the best form of treatment.  The rectum is the section of the digestive tract above the anus where stool is held before it passes out of the body through the anus.  The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body. \n【1】 The Digestive System An abscess develops when a mucus-secreting gland in the anus or rectum is blocked, and bacteria grow and multiply.  Although the anus is an area that is rich in bacteria, infection generally does not occur because blood flow to the area is rich.  When infection does occur, it usually is caused by a combination of different types of bacteria.  An abscess can cause substantial damage to nearby tissues and may rarely lead to loss of bowel control . \n【2】 Sometimes, abscesses are a complication of diverticulitis is inflammation of one or more balloon-like sacs (diverticula).  Infection may or may not develop.  Diverticulitis usually affects the large intestine (colon). \n【3】 An abscess may be deep in the rectum or close to the opening of the anus.  Symptoms of Anorectal Abscess Abscesses just under the skin can be swollen, red, tender, and very painful.  Rarely, people have fever.  Abscesses deep in the rectum may be less painful but may cause fever and pain in the lower abdomen.  Diagnosis of Anorectal Abscess A doctor's evaluation Rarely computed tomography A doctor can usually see an abscess if it is in the skin around the anus.  When no external swelling or redness is seen, however, a doctor can make the diagnosis of anorectal abscess by examining the rectum with a gloved finger.  A tender swelling in the rectum indicates an abscess.  If the doctor suspects a deep abscess or Crohn disease, a computed tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【4】 Treatment of Anorectal Abscess Cutting and draining the abscess Antibiotics for some people For an abscess just under the skin, treatment consists of cutting into the abscess and draining the pus after a local anesthetic Local anesthesia and regional anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities. \n【5】 For a deeper abscess, the person is usually hospitalized, and the abscess is drained in the operating room after general anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities. \n【6】 Antibiotics are typically given only to people who have fever, a weakened immune system, diabetes, cellulitis, or an infection elsewhere in the body.  People who have an abnormally low number of a type of white blood cell  are given antibiotics but usually do not have the abscess drained.

Vaginal bleeding is when you pass blood from your vagina (birth canal).  Is vaginal bleeding normal? Sometimes yes and sometimes no.  Vaginal bleeding is normal during your monthly period.  Your period usually starts every 21 to 35 days (or up to 45 days in teenagers).  Bleeding during a period usually lasts for 3 to 7 days.  Girls usually get their first period when they are between 10 and 16 years old.  Newborn girls may have a little bit of vaginal bleeding for up to 2 weeks after being born—this is normal too.  If the bleeding continues in newborns for more than 2 weeks, they should be seen by a doctor.  When is vaginal bleeding abnormal? Bleeding is considered abnormal when you bleed: Before you get your very first period Between your periods While you're pregnant After you’ve stopped having periods  Bleeding during your period may also be considered abnormal if your period: Lasts more than 7 days Is very heavy (you use more than 1 or 2 tampons or pads in an hour) Happens too frequently (starting fewer than 21 days apart) Happens too infrequently (starting more than 90 days apart) Is abnormal vaginal bleeding serious? It can be serious if you have a lot of bleeding.  It can also be serious even if there's not much bleeding but the cause is serious (for example, cancer).  If you have bleeding that goes on for a long time, your blood count will be low .  Anemia makes you look pale and feel tired all the time.  Your body will also be low on iron, because red blood cells have iron in them.  If you have a lot of bleeding all at once, your blood pressure may become dangerously low  and you may pass out.  What causes abnormal vaginal bleeding? Common causes of abnormal bleeding depend on how old you are.  Little girls may be hurt or have something stuck in their vagina, like toilet paper or a toy.  Girls younger than 8 years old may be starting puberty too early.  Sexual abuse can also be a cause of vaginal bleeding.  Girls just starting to have periods or women just ending their periods may have abnormal bleeding because of changes in their hormones.  Some girls or women may have an inherited problem with blood clotting.  Young and middle-aged women may have: Pregnancy problems ,miscarriage is when you lose your baby before 20 weeks of pregnancy.  Most miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. \n【1】 Fibroids A fibroid is a tumor in a woman's uterus (womb).  The uterus is the organ where babies grow before they are born. \n【2】 When should I see a doctor? See a doctor right away if you have vaginal bleeding and any of these warning signs: Fainting, weakness, dizziness, cold and sweaty skin, trouble breathing, or a heart beat that is weak or very fast Bleeding during pregnancy Bleeding too much during your period—using more than 1 pad or tampon in an hour for a few hours Passing large blood clots or clumps of tissue You should also see a doctor right away if you have signs of a bleeding disorder: You bruise easily You bleed a lot when you brush your teeth or get a small cut You have tiny reddish-purple dots or larger splotches on your skin See a doctor within a week if you don’t have any warning signs but have abnormal bleeding, including if you have vaginal bleeding before your menstrual periods start (before puberty) or after they stop .  A newborn girl who bleeds for more than 2 weeks should be seen by a doctor.  What will happen when I go to the doctor? Doctors will ask questions about your vaginal bleeding, other symptoms, and your usual monthly period.  Doctors typically do a pelvic exam.  During a pelvic exam, your doctor looks inside your vagina and cervix (the lower part of your uterus).  In order to see inside, your doctor will hold your vagina open with a small instrument called a speculum.  They may do a urine pregnancy test, blood tests, and maybe an ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.  Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays). \n【3】 How do doctors treat abnormal vaginal bleeding? Doctors will treat the cause of your bleeding.  For example, if you have a tumor or other growth, doctors may do surgery to remove it.  If the bleeding has caused you to have too little iron in your blood, you may need to take iron pills.  If you’ve lost too much blood all at once and are in shock is a medical emergency caused by your organs not getting enough blood and oxygen.  It has nothing to do with the \"shock\" we feel when something scares or upsets us. \n【4】 This will help raise your blood pressure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:25:29"}

Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity.  Diagnosis is by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.  Treatment is with antibiotics and corticosteroids given as soon as possible.  It may result from infections, other disorders, or reactions to drugs.  Severity and acuity vary. \n【1】 Signs are those of sepsis, central nervous system irritation  Pathophysiology of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Most commonly, bacteria reach the subarachnoid space and meninges via hematogenous spread.  Bacteria may also reach the meninges from nearby infected structures or through a congenital or acquired defect in the skull or spine .  Because white blood cells (WBCs), immunoglobulins, and complement are normally sparse or absent from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bacteria initially multiply without causing inflammation.  Later, bacteria release endotoxins, teichoic acid, and other substances that trigger an inflammatory response with mediators such as WBCs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).  Typically in CSF, levels of protein increase, and because bacteria consume glucose and because less glucose is transported into the CSF, glucose levels decrease.  Brain parenchyma is typically affected in acute bacterial meningitis.  Inflammation in the subarachnoid space is accompanied by cortical encephalitis and ventriculitis.  Complications of bacterial meningitis are common and may include Hydrocephalus is accumulation of excessive amounts of CSF, causing cerebral ventricular enlargement and/or increased intracranial pressure. \n【2】 The eye may be slightly adducted when the patient looks straight ahead. \n【3】 Subdural empyema is a collection of pus between the dura mater and the underlying arachnoid mater. \n【4】 Symptoms may include headache, lethargy, fever, and focal neurologic deficits.  Diagnosis is by contrast-enhanced MRI or CT. \n【5】 Sepsis caused by N.  meningitidis sometimes results in coagulopathy and bilateral adrenal hemorrhagic infarction (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome).  Haemophilus influenzae type B, previously the most common cause of meningitis in children < 6 years and overall, is now a rare cause in the US and Western Europe, where the H.  influenzae vaccine is widely used.  However, in areas where the vaccine is not widely used, H.  influenzae is still a common cause, particularly in children aged 2 months to 6 years.  In middle-aged and in older adults, the most common cause of bacterial meningitis is S.  pneumoniae Less commonly, N.  meningitidis causes meningitis in middle-aged and older adults.  As host defenses decline with age, patients may develop meningitis due to L.  monocytogenes or gram-negative bacteria.  In people of all ages, Staphylococcus aureus occasionally causes meningitis.   Route of entry Routes of entry include the following: By hematogenous spread (the most common route) From infected structures in or around the head (eg, sinuses, middle ear, mastoid process), sometimes associated with a CSF leak Through a penetrating head wound After a neurosurgical procedure (eg, if a ventricular shunt becomes infected) Through congenital or acquired defects in the skull or spine Having any of the above conditions increases the risk of acquiring meningitis.   Immune status Overall, the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in immunocompromised patients are S.  pneumoniae L.  monocytogenes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Mycobacterium tuberculosis N.  meningitidis Gram-negative bacteria But the most likely bacteria depend on the type of immune deficiency: Defects in cell-mediated immunity Cellular immunity deficiencies Immunodeficiency disorders are associated with or predispose patients to various complications, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and lymphomas and other cancers. \n【6】 meningitidis (both can cause fulminant meningitis) Neutropenia is a reduction in the blood neutrophil count.  If it is severe, the risk and severity of bacterial and fungal infections increase. \n【7】 monocytogenes.  Symptoms and Signs of Acute Bacterial Meningitis In most cases, bacterial meningitis begins with 3 to 5 days of insidiously progressive nonspecific symptoms including malaise, fever, irritability, and vomiting.  However, meningitis may be more rapid in onset and can be fulminant, making bacterial meningitis one of the few disorders in which a previously healthy young person may go to sleep with mild symptoms and never awaken.  Typical symptoms and signs of meningitis include Fever Tachycardia Headache Photophobia Changes in mental status (eg, lethargy, obtundation) Nuchal rigidity (although not all patients report it) Back pain (less intense than and overshadowed by headache) However, fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity may be absent in neonates and infants Signs are those of sepsis, central nervous system irritation .  So-called paradoxical irritability, in which cuddling and consoling by a parent irritates rather than comforts the neonate, suggests bacterial meningitis.  If meningitis becomes severe in neonates and infants, skull fontanelles may bulge because of increased intracranial pressure.  Seizures occur early in up to 40% of children with acute bacterial meningitis and may occur in adults.  Up to 12% of patients present in coma.  Severe meningitis increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and typically causes papilledema is swelling of the optic disk due to increased intracranial pressure. \n【8】 Accompanying systemic infection by the organism may cause Rashes, petechiae, or purpura (which suggest meningococcemia) Pulmonary consolidation (often in meningitis due to S.  pneumoniae) Heart murmurs (which suggest endocarditis—eg, often caused by S.  aureus or S.  pneumoniae) Atypical presentations in adults Fever and nuchal rigidity may be absent or mild in immunocompromised or older patients and in patients with alcohol use disorder.  Often, in older patients, the only sign is confusion in those who were previously alert or altered responsiveness in those who have dementia.  In such patients, as in neonates, the threshold for doing lumbar puncture should be low.  Brain imaging (MRI or, less optimally, CT) should be done if focal neurologic deficits are present or increased ICP is suspected.  If bacterial meningitis develops after a neurosurgical procedure, symptoms often take days to develop. \n【9】 Blood should be analysed when lumbar puncture is done so that blood glucose levels can be compared with CSF glucose levels.  Treatment should be started as follows: If bacterial meningitis is suspected and the patient is very ill, antibiotics and corticosteroids are given immediately, even before lumbar puncture.  If bacterial meningitis is suspected and lumbar puncture will be delayed pending CT or MRI, antibiotics and corticosteroids should be started after blood cultures but before neuroimaging is done; the need for confirmation should not delay treatment.  Clinicians should suspect bacterial meningitis in patients with typical symptoms and signs, usually fever, changes in mental status, and nuchal rigidity.  However, clinicians must be aware that symptoms and signs are different in neonates and infants and may be absent or initially mild in older patients, patients with alcoholic use disorder, and immunocompromised patients.  Diagnosis can be challenging in the following patients: Those who have had a neurosurgical procedure because such procedures can also cause changes in mental status and neck stiffness Older patients and patients with alcohol use disorder because changes in mental status may be due to metabolic encephalopathy (which may have multiple causes) or to falls and subdural hematomas Focal seizures or focal neurologic deficits may indicate a focal lesion such as a brain abscess A brain abscess is an intracerebral collection of pus. \n【10】 Because untreated bacterial meningitis is lethal, tests should be done if there is even a small chance of meningitis.  Testing is particularly helpful in infants, older patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, immunocompromised patients, and patients who had neurosurgical procedure because symptoms may be atypical.  Pearls & Pitfalls Do a lumbar puncture even if clinical findings are not specific for meningitis, particularly in infants, older patients, patients with alcohol use disorder, immunocompromised patients, and patients who have had neurosurgery. \n【11】 Contraindications to immediate lumbar puncture are signs suggesting markedly increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or an intracranial mass effect (eg, due to edema, hemorrhage, or tumor).  Thus, lumbar puncture should be considered high risk with any of the following: Papilledema Focal neurologic deficits Focal seizures A known central nervous system mass lesion Large stroke Suspected central nervosus system focal infection In such cases, lumbar puncture may cause brain herniation occurs when increased intracranial pressure causes the abnormal protrusion of brain tissue through openings in rigid intracranial barriers (eg, tentorial notch). \n【12】 When lumbar puncture is deferred, treatment is best begun immediately (after blood sampling for culture and before neuroimaging).  After ICP, if increased, has been lowered or if no mass effect or obstructive hydrocephalus is detected, lumbar puncture can be done.  CSF should be sent for analysis: cell count, protein, glucose, Gram staining, culture, PCR, and other tests as indicated clinically.  A multiplex film-array PCR panel can provide rapid screening for multiple bacteria and viruses plus Cryptococcus neoformans in a CSF sample.  This test, which is not always available, is used to supplement, not replace, culture and traditional tests.  Simultaneously, a blood sample should be drawn and sent to have the CSF:blood glucose ratio determined.  CSF cell count should be determined as soon as possible because white blood cells (WBCs) may adhere to the walls of the collecting tube, resulting in a falsely low cell count; in extremely purulent CSF, WBCs may lyse.  Typical CSF findings in bacterial meningitis include the following : Increased pressure Fluid that is often turbid A high WBC count (consisting predominantly of polymorphonuclear neutrophils) Elevated protein A low CSF:blood glucose ratio A CSF:blood glucose level of < 50% suggests possible meningitis.  A CSF glucose level of ≤ 18 mg/dL or a CSF:blood glucose ratio of < 0. 23 strongly suggests bacterial meningitis.  However, changes in CSF glucose may lag 30 to 120 minutes behind changes in blood glucose.  In acute bacterial meningitis, an elevated protein level (usually 100 to 500 mg/dL) indicates blood-brain barrier injury.  CSF cell count and protein and glucose levels in patients with acute bacterial meningitis are not always typical.  Atypical CSF findings may include Normal in early stages except for the presence of bacteria Predominance of lymphocytes in about 14% of patients, particularly in neonates with gram-negative meningitis, patients with meningitis due to L.  monocytogenes, and some patients with partially treated bacterial meningitis Normal glucose in about 9% of patients Normal WBC counts in severely immunosuppressed patients When initial CSF findings are equivocal, a repeat lumbar puncture 12 to 24 hours later can sometimes clarify which direction CSF changes are heading or whether there was a laboratory error.   Identification of the causative bacteria in CSF involves Gram staining, culture, and, when available, PCR.  Gram staining provides information rapidly, but the information is limited.  For bacteria to be reliably detected with Gram stain, about 105 bacteria/mL must be present.  Results may be falsely negative if any of the following occur: CSF is handled carelessly.  Bacteria are not adequately resuspended after CSF has been allowed to settle.  Errors in decolorization or reading of the slide occur.  If clinicians suspect an anaerobic infection or other unusual bacteria, they should tell the laboratory before samples are plated for cultures.  Prior antibiotic therapy can reduce the yield from Gram staining and culture.  PCR, if available, and latex agglutination tests to detect bacterial antigens may be a useful adjunctive tests, especially in patients who have already received antibiotics.  Determination of antibiotic sensitivity requires bacterial culture.  Until the cause of meningitis is confirmed, other tests using samples of CSF or blood may be done to check for other causes of meningitis, such as viruses (particularly herpes simplex), fungi, and cancer cells.  Other tests Samples from other sites suspected of being infected (eg, urinary or respiratory tract) should also be cultured.  Prognosis for Acute Bacterial Meningitis With antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate for children < 19 years may be as low as 3% but is often higher; survivors may be deaf and neuropsychologically impaired.  The mortality rate, even with antibiotic treatment, is about 17% for adults < 60 years but up to 37% in those > 60.  Community-acquired meningitis due to S.  aureus has a mortality rate in the range of 43%.  In general, mortality rate correlates with depth of obtundation or coma.  Factors associated with a poor prognosis include Age > 60 years Coexisting debilitating disorders A low Glasgow coma score at admission Focal neurologic deficits A low CSF cell count Increased CSF pressure (particularly) Seizures and a low CSF:serum glucose ratio may also indicate a poor prognosis.  Treatment of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Antibiotics Corticosteroids to decrease cerebral inflammation and edema Antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy for acute bacterial meningitis.  In addition to antibiotics, treatment includes measures to decrease brain and cranial nerve inflammation and increased intracranial pressure (ICP).  Most patients are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).  Antibiotics must be bactericidal for the causative bacteria and must be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.  If patients appear ill and findings suggest meningitis, antibiotics and corticosteroids are started as soon as blood cultures are drawn and even before lumbar puncture.  Also, if lumbar puncture is delayed pending neuroimaging results, antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment begins before neuroimaging.  Pearls & Pitfalls If patients appear ill and acute meningitis is suspected, treat them with antibiotics and corticosteroids as soon as blood for cultures is drawn.  Appropriate empiric antibiotics depend on the patient's age and immune status and route of infection In general, clinicians should use antibiotics that are effective against S.  meningitidis, and S.  In pregnant women, neonates, older patients, and immunocompromised patients, Listeria meningitis is possible; it requires specific antibiotic treatment, usually ampicillin.  Herpes simplex encephalitis can clinically mimic early bacterial meningitis; thus, acyclovir is added.  Antibiotic therapy may need to be modified based on results of culture and sensitivity testing.  Commonly used antibiotics include 3rd-generation cephalosporins for S.  meningitidis Ampicillin for L.  monocytogenes Vancomycin for penicillin-resistant strains of S.  pneumoniae and for S.  aureus  Corticosteroids Dexamethasone is used to decrease cerebral and cranial nerve inflammation and edema; it should be given when therapy is started.  Adults are given 10 mg IV; children are given 0. 15 mg/kg IV.  Dexamethasone is given immediately before or with the initial dose of antibiotics and every 6 hours for 4 days.  Use of dexamethasone is best-established for patients with pneumococcal meningitis.  Other measures The effectiveness of other measures is less well-proved.  Patients presenting with papilledema or signs of impending brain herniation are treated for increased ICP with the following: Elevation of the head of the bed to 30˚ Hyperventilation to a PCO2 of 27 to 30 mm Hg for not more than 24 hours to cause intracranial vasoconstriction Osmotic diuresis with IV mannitol Hyperventilation is used until other measures become effective and is not used for more than 24 hours.  When stopped, the PCO2 should be gradually increased to normal because a sudden increase may cause a significant increase in ICP.  Usually, adults are given mannitol 1 g/kg IV bolus over 30 minutes, repeated as needed every 3 to 4 hours or 0. 25 g/kg every 2 to 3 hours, and children are given 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/kg over 30 minutes, repeated as needed.  Additional measures can include IV fluids Antiseizure drugs Treatment of concomitant infections Treatment of specific complications (eg, corticosteroids for Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, surgical drainage for subdural empyema) Prevention of Acute Bacterial Meningitis Use of vaccines for H.  influenzae type B and, to a lesser extent, for N.  pneumoniae has reduced the incidence of bacterial meningitis.  Physical measures Keeping patients in respiratory isolation (using droplet precautions) for the first 24 hours of therapy can help prevent meningitis from spreading.  Gloves, masks, and gowns are used.  Vaccination can prevent certain types of bacterial meningitis.  A conjugated pneumococcal vaccine Pneumococcal disease (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis) is caused by some of the > 90 serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). \n【13】 influenzae bacteria.  H. \n【14】 A quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine The meningococcal serogroups that most often cause meningococcal disease in the US are serogroups B, C, and Y.  Serogroups A and W cause disease outside the US. \n【15】 The effort is expensive and requires public education and support, but it saves lives and reduces morbidity.  The meningococcal vaccine does not protect against serotype B meningococcal meningitis; this information should kept in mind when a vaccinated patient presents with symptoms of meningitis.  Chemoprophylaxis Anyone who has prolonged face-to-face contact with a patient who has meningitis (eg, household or day care contacts, medical personnel and other people who are exposed to the patient's oral secretions) should be given postexposure chemoprophylaxis.  For meningococcal meningitis, chemoprophylaxis consists of one of the following: Rifampin 600 mg (for children > 1 month, 10 mg/kg; for children < 1 month, 5 mg/kg) orally every 12 hours for 4 doses Ceftriaxone 250 mg (for children < 15 years, 125 mg) IM for 1 dose For adults, a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin 500 mg or ofloxacin 400 mg) orally for 1 dose For meningitis due to H.  influenzae type b, chemoprophylaxis is rifampin 20 mg/kg orally once a day (maximum: 600 mg/day) for 4 days.  There is no consensus on whether children < 2 years require prophylaxis for exposure at day care.  Chemoprophylaxis is not usually needed for contacts of patients with other types of bacterial meningitis.  Key Points Common causes of acute bacterial meningitis include N.  pneumoniae in children and adults and Listeria species in infants and older adults; S.  aureus occasionally causes meningitis in people of all ages.  Typical features may be absent or subtle in infants, patients with alcohol use disorder, older patients, immunocompromised patients, and patients who develop meningitis after a neurosurgical procedure.  If patients have focal neurologic deficits, obtundation, seizures, or papilledema (suggesting increased ICP or an intracranial mass effect), defer lumbar puncture pending results of neuroimaging.  Treat acute bacterial meningitis as soon as possible, even before the diagnosis is confirmed.  Common empirically chosen antibiotic regimens often include 3rd-generation cephalosporins ,for S.  Routine vaccination for H.  influenza, S.  meningitidis and chemoprophylaxis against N.  meningitidis help prevent meningitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#13#13#与上下文内容不联接", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:58:13"}

It is defined as delay or difficulty in defecation.  Normal frequency and consistency of stool varies with children's age, and diet; there is also considerable variation from child to child.  Most (90%) normal neonates pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life.  During the first week of life, infants pass an average of 4 to 8 stools/day; breastfed infants typically have more stools than formula-fed infants.  During the first few months of life, breastfed infants pass a mean of 3 stools/day, versus about 2 stools/day for formula-fed infants.  By age 2 years, the number of bowel movements decreases to slightly < 2/day.  After age 4 years, it is slightly > 1/day.  In general, signs of effort (eg, straining) in a young infant do not signify constipation.  Infants only gradually develop the muscles to assist a bowel movement.  Etiology of Constipation in Children is divided into 2 main types: Organic (5%) Functional (95%) Organic causes of constipation involve specific structural, neurologic, toxic/metabolic, or intestinal disorders.  They are rare but important to recognize The most common organic cause is Hirschsprung disease is a congenital anomaly of innervation of the lower intestine, usually limited to the colon, resulting in partial or total functional obstruction. \n【1】 Spinal cord abnormalities Spina Bifida is defective closure of the vertebral column.  Although the cause is not known, low folate levels during pregnancy increase risk. \n【2】 Children are prone to develop functional constipation during 3 periods: After the introduction of cereals and solid food During toilet training involves recognition of readiness for and implementation of the separate steps of toileting: discussion, undressing, eliminating, dressing again, flushing, and hand washing. \n【3】 Children may put off having bowel movements because the stools are hard and uncomfortable to pass or because they do not want to interrupt play.  To avoid having a bowel movement, children may tighten the external sphincter muscles, pushing the stool higher in the rectal vault.  If this behavior is repeated, the rectum stretches to accommodate the retained stool.  The urge to defecate is then decreased, and the stool becomes harder, leading to a vicious circle of painful defecation and worsened constipation. \n【4】 In older children, diets low in fiber and high in dairy may lead to hard stools that are uncomfortable to pass and can cause anal fissures Anal Fissure An anal fissure is an acute longitudinal tear or a chronic ovoid ulcer in the squamous epithelium of the anal canal. \n【5】 Anal fissures cause pain with stool passage, leading to a similar vicious circle of delayed bowel movements, resulting in harder stool that is more painful to pass. \n【6】  Evaluation of Constipation in Children Evaluation should focus on differentiating functional constipation from constipation with an organic cause.  History of present illness in neonates should determine whether meconium has been passed at all and, if so, when.  For older infants and children, history should note onset and duration of constipation, frequency and consistency of stools, and timing of symptoms—whether they began after a specific event, such as introduction of certain foods or a stressor that could lead to stool retention (eg, introduction of toilet training).  Important associated symptoms include soiling (stool incontinence), discomfort during defecation, and blood on or in the stool.  The composition of the diet, especially the amount of fluids and fiber, should be noted.  Review of systems should ask about symptoms that suggest an organic cause, including new onset of poor suck, hypotonia, and ingestion of honey before age 12 months ; cold intolerance, dry skin, fatigue, hypotonia, prolonged neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, urinary frequency, and excessive thirst (endocrinopathies); change in gait, pain or weakness in lower extremities, and urinary incontinence (spinal cord defects); night sweats, fever, and weight loss (cancer); and vomiting, abdominal pain, poor growth, and intermittent diarrhea (intestinal disorders).  Past medical history should ask about known disorders that can cause constipation, including cystic fibrosis and celiac disease.  Exposure to constipating drugs or lead paint dust should be noted.  Clinicians should ask about delayed passage of meconium within the first 24 to 48 hours of life, as well as previous episodes of constipation and family history of constipation.  Physical examination The physical examination begins with general assessment of the child’s level of comfort or distress and overall appearance (including skin and hair condition).  Height and weight should be measured and plotted on growth charts.  Examination should focus on the abdomen and anus and on the neurologic examination.  The abdomen is inspected for distention, auscultated for bowel sounds, and palpated for masses and tenderness.  The anus is inspected for a fissure (taking care not to spread the buttocks so forcefully as to cause one).  A digital rectal examination is done gently to check stool consistency and to obtain a sample for occult blood testing.  Rectal examination should note the tightness of the rectal opening and presence or absence of stool in the rectal vault.  Examination includes placement of the anus and presence of any hair tuft or pit superior to the sacrum.  In infants, neurologic examination focuses on tone and muscle strength.  In older children, the focus is on gait, deep tendon reflexes, and signs of weakness in the lower extremities.  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Delayed passage of meconium (> 24 to 48 hours after birth) Hypotonia and poor suck (suggesting infant botulism) Abnormal gait and deep tendon reflexes (suggesting spinal cord involvement) Interpretation of findings A primary finding that suggests an organic cause in neonates is constipation from birth; those who have had a normal bowel movement are unlikely to have a significant structural disorder.  In older children, clues to an organic cause include constitutional symptoms (particularly weight loss, fever, or vomiting), poor growth (decreasing percentile on growth charts), an overall ill appearance, and any focal abnormalities detected during examination A well-appearing child who has no other complaints besides constipation, who is not taking any constipating drugs, and who has a normal examination likely has a functional disorder Functional Constipation is responsible for up to 5% of pediatric office visits. \n【7】 A distended rectum filled with stool or the presence of an anal fissure is consistent with functional constipation in an otherwise normal child.  Constipation that began after starting a constipating drug or that coincides with a dietary change can be attributed to that drug or food.  Foods that are known to be constipating include dairy (eg, milk, cheese, yogurt) and starches and processed foods that do not contain fiber. \n【8】 History of a new stress (eg, a new sibling) or other potential causes of stool retention behavior, with normal physical findings, support a functional etiology.  Testing For patients whose histories are consistent with functional constipation, no tests are needed unless there is no response to conventional treatment of constipation.  An abdominal x-ray should be done if patients have been unresponsive to treatment or an organic cause is suspected.  Tests for organic causes should be done based on the history and physical examination : Barium enema, rectal manometry, and biopsy  Plain x-rays of lumbosacral spine; MRI considered (tethered spinal cord or tumor) Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine  Blood lead level  Stool for botulinum toxin  Sweat test and genetic testing  Calcium and other electrolytes  Serologic screening usually for IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase  Treatment of Constipation in Children Specific organic causes of constipation should be treated.  Functional constipation is ideally initially treated with Dietary changes Behavior modification Dietary changes include adding prune juice to formula for infants; increasing fruits, vegetables, and other sources of fiber for older infants and children; increasing water intake; and decreasing the amount of constipating foods (eg, milk, cheese).  Behavior modification for older children involves encouraging regular stool passage after meals if they are toilet trained and providing a reinforcement chart and encouragement to them.  For children who are in the process of toilet training involves recognition of readiness for and implementation of the separate steps of toileting: discussion, undressing, eliminating, dressing again, flushing, and hand washing. \n【9】 Unresponsive constipation is treated by disimpacting the bowel and maintaining a regular diet and stool routine.  Disimpaction can occur through oral or rectal agents.  Oral agents require consumption of large volumes of liquid.  Rectal agents can feel invasive and can be difficult to give.  Both methods can be done by parents under medical supervision; however, disimpaction sometimes requires hospitalization if outpatient management is unsuccessful.  Usually, infants do not require extreme measures, but if intervention is required, a glycerin suppository is typically adequate.  For maintenance of healthy bowels, some children may require over-the-counter dietary fiber supplements.  These supplements require consuming 32 to 64 oz of water/day to be effective  Key Points Functional constipation accounts for about 95% of cases.  Organic causes are rare but need to be considered.  Delayed passage of meconium for > 24 to 48 hours after birth raises suspicion of structural disorders, especially Hirschsprung disease.  Early intervention with dietary and behavior changes can successfully treat functional constipation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#1#1#与上下文内容并不联接", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:04:27"}

These concerns have led some parents to not allow their children to receive some or all of the recommended vaccines.  In the US, rates of vaccine exemptions increased from 1% in 2006 to 2% in 2016 to 2017 ; some states reported that 6% of children received exemptions.  The rate of vaccine-preventable diseases is higher in children whose parents have refused ≥ 1 vaccines for nonmedical reasons.  For example, in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data, from 2009 to 2018 there were 36 Haemophilus influenzae cases in patients younger than 5 years of age.  Two (5. 6%) were too young to receive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, 12 (33. 3%) were unvaccinated, and 14 (38. 9%) had not received the complete vaccination series .  The decision to defer or refuse vaccines also affects public health.  When the proportion of the overall population that is immune to a disease (herd immunity) decreases, disease prevalence increases, increasing the possibility of disease in people at risk.  People may be at risk because They were previously vaccinated, but the vaccine did not induce immunity (eg, 2 to 5% of recipients do not respond to the first dose of measles vaccine).  Immunity may wane over time (eg, in older people).  They (ie, some immunocompromised patients) cannot receive live-virus vaccines (eg, measles-mumps-rubella, varicella) and rely on herd immunity for protection against such diseases.  Conversations with reluctant parents typically require asking about specific concerns and explaining the risks and benefits of vaccines and the supporting evidence in plain language.  These conversations provide opportunities to clarify misconceptions and engage in shared decision-making . \n【1】 COVID-19 vaccines The COVID-19 pandemic COVID-19 COVID-19 is an acute, sometimes severe, respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  Prevention is by vaccination and infection control precautions  from the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020.  Since that time, more than 200 million Americans have received at least one COVID vaccine dose.  However, many people remain unvaccinated.  Serious adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare.  For example, the Ad26. COV2. S COVID-19 vaccine (adenovirus vector) produced by Janssen/Johnson & Johnson has been associated with rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, and the mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA) produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA) produced by Moderna, have been associated with myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium with necrosis of cardiac myocytes. \n【2】 Similar to other vaccine-preventable diseases, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are much more common among unvaccinated people.  Some parents think that COVID-19 infection is not dangerous to children, but this is not the case.  Although COVID-19 infection is typically milder in children than adults, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality.  Nearly 8. 5 million children in the US have been infected during the pandemic , leading to more than 6851 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children Symptoms and Signs COVID-19 is an acute, sometimes severe, respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  As in adults, hospitalization is more frequent in unvaccinated versus vaccinated adolescents . \n【3】 Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a brief report in The Lancet. \n【4】 According to the report, parents claimed that 8 of the 12 children had received the combined MMR vaccine within 1 month before the development of symptoms.  Wakefield postulated that the measles virus in the MMR vaccine traveled to the intestine where it caused inflammation, enabling proteins from the GI tract to enter the bloodstream, travel to the brain, and cause autism.  This study received significant media attention worldwide, and many parents began to doubt the safety of the MMR vaccine.  In another study, Wakefield claimed to find the measles virus in intestinal biopsy specimens of 75 of 90 children with autism and in only 5 of 70 control patients, leading to speculation that the live measles virus in the MMR vaccine was somehow implicated in autism.  Because Wakefield's methodology could show only a temporal association rather than a cause-and-effect relationship, numerous other researchers studied the possible connection between the MMR vaccine and autism.  Gerber and Offit reviewed at least 13 large epidemiologic studies, all of which failed to support an association between MMR vaccine and autism .  Many of these studies showed that national trends of MMR vaccination were not directly associated with national trends in the diagnosis of autism.  For example, in the UK between 1988 and 1999, the rate of MMR vaccination did not change, but the rate of autism increased.  Other studies compared the risk of autism in individual children who did or did not receive the MMR vaccine.  In the largest and most compelling of these studies, Madsen et al assessed 537,303 Danish children born between 1991 and 1998, 82% of whom had received MMR vaccine .  After controlling for possible confounders, they found no difference in relative risk of autism or other autism-spectrum disorders in vaccinated and unvaccinated children.  Overall incidence of autism or an autistic-spectrum disorder was 608 of 440,655 (0. 138%) in the vaccinated group and 130 of 96,648 (0. 135%) in the unvaccinated group.  A follow-up study of all children born in Denmark between 1999 and 2010, for a total of 657,461 children concluded that MMR does not cause autism (hazard ratio 0. 93 [95% CI, 0. 85 to 1. 02]) overall, nor does it increase the risk in children who are at high risk of autism because of their family history .  Other population-based studies from across the world have reached similar conclusions.  In response to Wakefield's increased detection of measles virus in intestinal biopsy specimens from autistic children, Hornig et al searched for the measles virus in biopsy samples taken from 38 children who had GI symptoms and were having a colonoscopy; 25 children had autism, and 13 did not .  The measles virus was not detected more often in the children with autism than in those without.  In 2010, The Lancet fully retracted the 1998 publication based on the findings of the British General Medical Council .  Three months after The Lancet's retraction, Wakefield was removed from the UK medical register, with a statement regarding his intentional falsification of his research; as a result, he was barred from practicing medicine in the UK.  Despite the overwhelming evidence to support the safety of the MMR vaccines, many parents remain unconvinced.  As a result, the US experienced the largest number of measles cases in 2019 since 1992.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most infected people were not vaccinated . \n【5】 Thimerosal and autism Thimerosal is a mercury compound previously used as a preservative in many multidose vaccine vials; preservatives are not needed in single-dose vials and cannot be used in live-virus vaccines.  Thimerosal is metabolized to ethylmercury, which is eliminated quickly from the body.  Because environmental methylmercury (which is a different compound that is not eliminated from the body quickly) is toxic to humans, there was concern that the very small amounts of thimerosal used in vaccines might cause neurologic problems, particularly autism, in children.  Because of these theoretical concerns, even though no studies had shown evidence of harm, thimerosal was removed from routine childhood vaccines in the US, Europe, and several other countries by 2001.  However, in these countries, thimerosal continues to be used in certain influenza vaccines and in several other vaccines intended for use in adults It is also used in many vaccines used in medically underserved countries; the World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended its removal because there is no clinical evidence of toxicity due to routine use.  Despite the removal of thimerosal, rates of autism have continued to increase, strongly suggesting that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism.  Also, 2 separate Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) studies have concluded that there is no association between thimerosal and autism.  In a cohort study of 124,170 children in 3 managed care organizations (MCOs), Verstraeten et al found no association between thimerosal and autism or other developmental conditions, although inconsistent associations (ie, seen in one MCO but not another) were seen between thimerosal and certain language disorders .  In a case-control study of 1000 children (256 with an autism-spectrum disorder and 752 matched controls without autism), Price et al, using regression analysis, found no association between exposure to thimerosal and autism .  Practitioners who work with parents who are still concerned about thimerosal in the influenza vaccine may use single-dose vials of injectable vaccine or the live-attenuated nasal spray vaccine, neither of which contains thimerosal. \n【6】 Use of multiple, simultaneous vaccines A nationally representative survey done in the late 1990s revealed that nearly one fourth of all parents felt that their children receive more immunizations than they should.  Since then, additional vaccines have been added to the immunization schedule so that by age 6, children are now recommended to receive multiple doses of vaccines for 10 or more infections To minimize the number of injections and visits, practitioners give many vaccines as combination products (eg, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, measles-mumps-rubella).  However, some parents have become concerned that children's (particularly infants') immune system cannot handle multiple simultaneously presented antigens.  This concern has caused some parents to request alternative immunization schedules that delay and sometimes completely exclude certain vaccines.  A recent nationally representative survey found that 13% of parents use such a schedule.  The use of alternative schedules is risky and scientifically unfounded.  The official schedule is designed to protect children against diseases when they are most susceptible.  Delaying vaccination increases the amount of time children are at risk of acquiring these diseases.  In addition, although parents may plan to only delay vaccination, the increased number of visits needed for alternative schedules increases the difficulty of adherence and thus the risk that children will not receive a full series of vaccines.  Regarding the immunologic challenges, parents should be informed that the amount and number of antigens contained in vaccines is miniscule compared with that encountered in everyday life.  Even at birth, an infant's immune system is prepared to respond to the hundreds of antigens the infant is exposed to while passing through the birth canal and being handled by the (unsterile) mother.  Children typically encounter and respond immunologically to dozens and perhaps hundreds of antigens during an ordinary day without difficulty.  A typical infection with a single organism stimulates an immune response to multiple antigens of that organism (perhaps 4 to 10 in a typical upper respiratory infection).  Furthermore, because current vaccines contain fewer antigens overall (ie, because key antigens have been better identified and purified), children are exposed to fewer vaccine antigens today than they were for most of the 20th century.  In summary, alternative vaccine schedules are not evidence-based and put children at increased risk of infectious diseases.  More importantly, they offer no advantage.  Using data from the VSD, Smith and Woods compared neurodevelopmental outcomes in a group of children who received all vaccines on time with those who did not .  The children in the delayed group did not do better on any of the 42 outcomes tested.  These results should reassure parents who are concerned that children receive too many vaccines too soon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:16:05"}

Achilles tendinitis is very common in runners.  During running, the calf muscles help with the lift-off phase of gait (raising up on the toes from the foot being flat on the ground).  Repetitive forces from running combined with insufficient recovery time from exercise can inflame the Achilles tendon.  Pain in the lower calf and back of the heel is usually the first symptom of tendinitis.  Pain initially increases when exercise is begun and often lessens as exercise continues.  Doctors diagnose Achilles tendinitis based on the symptoms and results of an examination.  Ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) relieve pain and inflammation.  Refraining from running and from pedaling a bicycle as long as the pain persists is important.  Exercises to stretch and strengthen the hamstring muscles can be started as soon as they can be done without pain.  Other measures depend on what conditions are causing tendinitis.  Measures may include wearing shoes with flexible soles or placing heel lifts in running shoes to reduce tension on the tendon and stabilize the heel.  People should return to running gradually, stretch the tendon before running, and, at the beginning, apply ice after running.

These fractures may be stable or unstable.  Diagnosis is with x-rays and sometimes MRI.  Treatment is usually casting or a walking boot for stable fractures and often open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) for unstable fractures.   Ankle fractures are common and can result from multiple injury mechanisms, but inversion injury while running or jumping is most common.  The ankle bones and ligaments form a ring that connects the tibia and fibula to the talus and calcaneus.  Within the ring, stability is provided by 2 bones: Medial malleolus of the tibia and lateral malleolus of the fibula 2 ligament complexes: Medially, the deltoid ligament; laterally, mainly the anterior and posterior talofibular ligaments and calcaneofibular ligament Fractures that disrupt the ring in one place often disrupt it in another (eg, if only one bone is fractured, a ligament is often simultaneously and severely torn).  If fractures disrupt ≥ 2 of the structures that stabilize the ankle ring, the ankle is unstable.  Disruption of the medial deltoid ligament also causes instability.  The proximal fibula may also be fractured (called a Maisonneuve fracture) when the medial malleolus is fractured, the ankle mortise (the joint between the tibia and the talus) is open, and the distal fibula is not fractured.  The peroneal nerve can be damaged with a Maisonneuve fracture.  Without a fracture of the distal fibula, the joint can be disrupted only if the interosseous ligament between the tibia and fibula tears, as sometimes occurs when the proximal fibula is fractured.  Ligaments of the ankle Pain and swelling occur first at the injury site, then often extend diffusely around the ankle.  Diagnosis of Ankle Fractures X-rays Sometimes stress x-rays and/or MRI Ankle x-rays are taken in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique (mortise) views.  Specific criteria (eg, Ottawa ankle rules) are often used to avoid x-rays in patients unlikely to have a fracture.  Based on the Ottawa ankle rules, ankle x-ray is required only if patients have ankle pain and one of the following: Age >55 Inability to bear weight without assistance immediately after the injury and in the emergency department (for 4 steps), with or without limping Bone tenderness within 6 cm of the posterior edge or tip of either malleolus Ankle fractures are usually evident on x-rays.  Images of Ankle Fractures Subtle Distal Fibular Fracture (Lateral View) In this lateral view, a fracture of the distal fibula is visible as a small lucency and discontinuity (step-off) of the cortex.   Posterior Ankle (Fibular) Fracture This lateral view of the ankle shows a fracture of the distal fibula. \n【1】 Ankle Fracture of Both Malleoli This ankle fracture involves the medial malleolus (of the tibia) and lateral malleolus (of the fibula). \n【2】 Fracture of Lateral Malleolus This ankle fracture affects the lateral malleolus but spares the medial malleolus. \n【3】 Proximal Fibular Fracture The proximal fibula may be fractured (called a Maisonneuve fracture—shown here), when the medial malleolus is fractured, the ankle mortise (the joint between the tibia and the talus) is open, and the distal fibula is not fractured. \n【4】 Maisonneuve Fracture  This x-ray shows a disruption (widening) of the medial mortise joint (blue arrow).  Normally, the space of the mortise joint should be symmetric around the talus.  With a concomitant proximal fibular fracture, this is known as a Maisonneuve fracture. \n【5】 Maisonneuve Fracture  This x-ray shows a proximal fibula fracture.  With a concomitant disruption (widening) of the medial mortise joint, this is known as a Maisonneuve fracture. \n【6】 Determining stability helps guide treatment.  Instability may be obvious when the ankle is inspected or gently palpated.  The knee, particularly the proximal fibula, should also be examined to look for a concomitant Maisonneuve fracture.  Peroneal nerve function should be tested in patients with a Maisonneuve fracture by asking the patient to dorsiflex at the ankle.  If both the medial and lateral malleoli are fractured, the injury is probably unstable.  If only the fibula is fractured and the tibiotalar joint appears normal, an external rotation stress x-ray can be done; it may detect tibiotalar subluxation, which suggests deltoid ligament and thus ankle joint instability.  Pearls & Pitfalls If the medial malleolus is fractured, particularly if it is displaced and the mortise is open on the medial side, take knee x-rays to look for an associated fracture of the proximal fibula (Maisonneuve fracture).  If a proximal fibula fracture seems possible, x-rays of the knee should also be taken.  Treatment of Ankle Fractures Walking boot or casting Sometimes open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) Most stable ankle fractures can be treated nonsurgically with a walking boot or cast.  For unstable ankle injuries, ORIF is often done to align the bone fragments correctly and to better maintain alignment during fracture healing.  The prognosis is usually good if the ankle is stable and if treatment results in correct alignment.  If bone fragments do not remain correctly aligned, arthritis may develop and fractures may recur.  Maisonneuve fractures are significant syndesmosis injuries that require ORIF.  Key Points If an ankle fracture disrupts the ankle ring (formed by the ankle bones and ligaments) in one place, it often disrupts it in another; if ≥ 2 of the structures that stabilize the ankle ring are disrupted, the ankle is unstable.  Use the Ottawa ankle rules to try to limit x-rays to patients more likely to have a fracture.  Evaluate ankle stability (which determines treatment) by physical examination and, if needed, x-rays.  Treat most stable ankle fractures with a walking boot or cast and many unstable fractures with ORIF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:08:42"}

Treatment is often supportive, but Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or pacritnib, may decrease symptoms and stem cell transplantation may be curative.

Myelofibrosis may be Primary (more common) Secondary to a number of hematologic, malignant, and nonmalignant conditions Primary myelofibrosis results from neoplastic transformation of a multipotent bone marrow stem cell.  These primary myelofibrosis progeny cells stimulate bone marrow fibroblasts (which are not part of the neoplastic transformation) to secrete excessive collagen.  The peak incidence of primary myelofibrosis is between 50 and 70 years and predominantly in males.  Mutations of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene are present in a high proportion of cases of primary myelofibrosis.  JAK2 is a member of the class I type tyrosine kinase family of enzymes and is involved in signal transduction for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors among other entities.  Mutations of the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL) or the calreticulin (CALR) gene also may be the cause of primary myelofibrosis.  However, there are rare cases of primary myelofibrosis in which none of these three mutations are present (triple negative primary myelofibrosis).  Some of these patients have other uncommon MPL mutations, which can only be detected by next generation sequencing.  In primary myelofibrosis, nucleated red blood cells (normoblasts) and myelocytes are released into the circulation (leukoerythroblastosis) when there is extramedullary hematopoiesis (ie, non-marrow organs have taken over blood cell production because of the fibrosed marrow).  The serum lactate dehydrogenase level is often elevated.  Bone marrow failure eventually occurs, with consequent anemia and thrombocytopenia. \n【1】 Malignant myelofibrosis (sometimes called acute myelofibrosis), is a rare variant of myelofibrosis characterized by pancytopenia, myeloblastosis, and marrow fibrosis that has a more rapidly progressive downhill course and is generally due to a type of acute leukemia called acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.   Symptoms and Signs of Primary Myelofibrosis In many patients, myelofibrosis is asymptomatic.  Other patients have anemia, splenomegaly, or, in later stages, general malaise, weight loss, fever, or splenic infarction.  Hepatomegaly occurs in some patients.  Lymphadenopathy is rare.  Severe extramedullary hematopoiesis can disturb the function of organs in which it occurs, including the brain.  Diagnosis of Primary Myelofibrosis Complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral blood smear Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Testing for JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations Primary myelofibrosis should be suspected in patients with splenomegaly, splenic infarction, and anemia.  If the disorder is suspected, CBC should be done and peripheral blood morphology and a bone marrow biopsy should be examined.  If myelofibrosis is present on bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (as detected by reticulin staining or trichrome staining, indicating excess collagen and osteosclerosis), other disorders associated with myelofibrosis should be excluded by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation.  The diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis is confirmed by detecting a mutation in JAK2, CALR, or MPL.  In some cases, none of these mutations is expressed (triple-negative myelofibrosis).  A broader next-generation sequencing panel may detect gene mutations associated with increased risk of leukemic transformation and may therefore be useful for prognosis.  Anemia is typically present and usually increases over time.  Blood cell morphology is variable.  Red blood cells (RBCs) are poikilocytic.  Reticulocytosis and polychromatophilia may be present; teardrop-shaped RBCs (dacryocytes) are characteristic morphologic features.  Nucleated RBCs and neutrophil precursors are typically present in peripheral blood.  White blood cell counts are usually increased but are highly variable.  In advanced stages, myeloblasts may be present, even in the absence of acute leukemia.  Platelet counts initially may be high, normal, or decreased; however, thrombocytopenia tends to supervene as the disorder progresses. \n【2】 Unfavorable prognostic markers include hemoglobin < 10 g/dL (< 100 g/L), a history of transfusions, leukocytosis, and a platelet count < 100,000/mcL (< 100,000 × 109/L).  Patients in the least favorable risk group usually survive < 1 year, but those with low-risk disease have a median survival of 10 years.  Several prognostic scoring systems are available to predict survival.  A number of useful risk stratification systems are available to aid prognosis and guide decisions to institute medical therapy or stem cell transplantation.  The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) for Myelodysplastic Syndromes can be used to predict progression or survival as the disease evolves .  Some scoring systems also incorporate cytogenetics and molecular markers (eg, DIPSS-Plus).  Validated symptom assessment tools (eg, Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form) are also available for patients with myelofibrosis and can be useful to monitor therapeutic responses.  Patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia with myelofibrosis have a better prognosis than those with primary myelofibrosis, and their outcome can be predicted by using the MYelofibrosis SECondary to PV and ET Prognostic Model . \n【3】 Treatment of Primary Myelofibrosis Symptomatic therapy Sometimes interferon Sometimes ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or pacritinib Sometimes allogeneic stem cell transplantation Treatment is directed at symptoms and complications.  Some patients can be observed without treatment.  In early primary myelofibrosis, pegylated interferon has been shown to reduce marrow fibrosis and spleen size and can be used for low-risk patients as defined by various prognostic scoring systems .  Currently, for advanced primary myelofibrosis, the nonspecific JAK pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib is the therapy of choice in patients with a platelet count > 50,000/mcL (50,000 × 109/L).  Ruxolitinib is effective whether or not a JAK2 mutation or splenomegaly is present.  The main adverse effects of ruxolitinib are anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Care must be taken when stopping ruxolitinib because a withdrawal syndrome may occur, with significant worsening of symptoms in part due to splenic enlargement and a rebound in inflammatory cytokines.  Low-dose corticosteroids may be used short term for symptom control.  When splenomegaly is significant, ruxolitinib can precipitate tumor lysis syndrome.  Fedratinib, also a JAK-2 inhibitor, can be used when there is resistance or intolerance to ruxolitinib.  Some patients who develop intolerance to ruxolitinib may be able to tolerate it again after a period off the drug.  A third JAK-2 inhibitor, pacritinib is available for patients whose platelets counts are too low to initiate ruxolitinib. \n【4】 Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used in older patients.  Androgens, erythropoietin, splenectomy, chemotherapy, thalidomide, lenalidomide, splenic embolization, and radiation therapy have been tried for palliation.  Of these, low-dose thalidomide and prednisone can be effective in controlling splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and circulating blast cells.  However, the other modalities are of limited effectiveness or have significant adverse effects.  Splenectomy should be avoided if possible; splenic irradiation has only a temporary effect and can cause severe neutropenia and infection.  Among agents that are under investigation for treatment of myelofibrosis is luspatercept, an activin receptor ligand trap. \n【5】 Key Points Myelofibrosis is excessive bone marrow fibrosis, often with loss of hematopoietic cells and consequent extramedullary hematopoiesis.  Myelofibrosis is often primary but may occur secondary to a number of hematologic, malignant, and nonmalignant disorders, including polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis.  Primary myelofibrosis is a clonal hematopoietic disorder and often involves JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations.  Diagnose with blood count, examination of peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, and molecular testing for JAK2, MPL, and/or CALR mutations.  Some patients have an indolent course and do not require therapy immediately, but some patients have a rapidly progressive downhill course with short survival.

They are usually obvious within the first year of life. \n【1】 Infants may develop intestinal obstruction.  The diagnosis is based on a physical examination and x-rays.  Surgery is needed to correct the defect. \n【2】 In anorectal malformations, skin may be covering the area where the anus should be, and the skin may be several centimeters thick or just a thin membrane.  The opening to the anus may be narrow or may be missing completely.  Anal atresia occurs when the intestines do not develop properly while the fetus is growing.  It is not known why the intestines do not develop properly.  Most infants with anal atresia develop some type of abnormal connection (fistula) between the anus and either the urethra, the area between the urethra and anus (the perineum), the vagina, or rarely the bladder.  Anal atresia commonly occurs along with other birth defects, such as defects of the spine, heart Overview of Heart Defects About one in 100 babies is born with a heart defect.

The colostomy stays in place until the infant is older and the structures that need to be repaired have grown larger.  The colostomy is closed when surgery to fully repair the defect is done.  Understanding Colostomy In a colostomy, the large intestine (colon) is cut.  The part that remains connected to the colon is brought to the skin surface through an opening that has been formed.

Initial hearing loss is typically unilateral (unless drug-induced) and may range in severity from mild to profound.  Many also have tinnitus is a noise in the ears.  It is experienced by 10 to 15% of the population. \n【2】 Sudden hearing loss has some causes that differ from chronic hearing loss and must be addressed urgently . \n【3】 Etiology of Sudden Hearing Loss The following are common characteristics of sudden hearing loss: Most cases are idiopathic Some occur in the course of an obvious explanatory event.  A few represent the initial manifestation of another, initially occult, but identifiable disorder.  Idiopathic There are numerous theories for which some evidence (although conflicting and incomplete) exists.  The most promising possibilities include viral infections , autoimmune attacks, and acute microvascular occlusion.  Obvious event Some causes of sudden hearing loss are readily apparent.  Blunt head trauma with temporal bone fracture or severe concussion involving the cochlea can cause sudden hearing loss.  Large ambient pressure changes Ear and Sinus Barotrauma is tissue injury caused by a pressure-related change in body compartment gas volume. \n【4】 Perilymphatic fistula can also be congenital; it can spontaneously cause a sudden loss or loss may occur after trauma or severe pressure changes.  Ototoxic drugs Drug-Induced Ototoxicity A wide variety of drugs can be ototoxic. \n【5】 There is a rare genetic mitochondrial-transmitted disorder that increases the susceptibility to aminoglycoside ototoxicity.  A number of infections cause sudden hearing loss during or immediately after acute illness.  Common causes include bacterial meningitis Acute bacterial meningitis is rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the meninges and subarachnoid space.  Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity. \n【6】 The most common viral causes in the developed world are mumps is an acute, contagious, systemic viral disease, usually causing painful enlargement of the salivary glands, most commonly the parotids. \n【7】 Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children. \n【8】 Other disorders Sudden hearing loss rarely can be an isolated first manifestation of some disorders that usually have other initial symptoms.  For example, sudden hearing loss rarely may be the first manifestation of an acoustic neuroma Vestibular Schwannoma A vestibular schwannoma, also called an acoustic neuroma, is a Schwann cell–derived tumor of the 8th cranial nerve.  Symptoms include unilateral hearing loss. \n【9】 There is no reliable diagnostic test. \n【10】 Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum and is characterized by 3 sequential symptomatic stages separated by periods of asymptomatic latent infection. \n【11】 Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease involving the eye and the inner ear.  Cogan syndrome affects young adults, with 80% of patients between 14 and 47 years. \n【12】 About 10 to 30% of patients also have a severe systemic vasculitis, which may include life-threatening aortitis.  Some vasculitic disorders can cause hearing loss, some of which is acute.  Hematologic disorders, such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a malignant plasma cell disorder in which B cells produce excessive amounts of IgM M-proteins. \n【13】  Evaluation of Sudden Hearing Loss Evaluation consists of detecting and quantifying hearing loss and determining etiology (particularly reversible causes).  History of present illness should verify that loss is sudden and not chronic.  The history should also note whether loss is unilateral or bilateral and whether there is a current acute event ,eg, head injury, barotrauma Otic barotrauma is ear pain or damage to the tympanic membrane caused by rapid changes in pressure. \n【14】 Important accompanying symptoms include other otologic symptoms (eg, tinnitus, ear discharge), vestibular symptoms (eg, disorientation in the dark, vertigo), and other neurologic symptoms (eg, headache, weakness or asymmetry of the face, abnormal sense of taste).  Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including transient, migratory neurologic deficits  and eye irritation and redness .  Past medical history should ask about known HIV or syphilis infection and risk factors for them (eg, multiple sex partners, unprotected intercourse).  Family history should note close relatives with hearing loss (suggesting a congenital fistula).  Drug history should specifically query current or previous use of ototoxic drugs Drug-Induced Ototoxicity A wide variety of drugs can be ototoxic. \n【15】 Physical examination The examination focuses on the ears and hearing and on the neurologic examination.  The tympanic membrane is inspected for perforation, drainage, or other lesions.  During the neurologic examination, attention should be paid to the cranial nerves (particularly the 5th, 7th, and 8th) and to vestibular and cerebellar function because abnormalities in these areas often occur with tumors of the brain stem and cerebellopontine angle.  The Weber Physical examination and Rinne Physical examination tests require a tuning fork to differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss.  Additionally, the eyes are examined for redness and photophobia , and the skin is examined for rash .  Red flags Findings of particular concern are Abnormalities of cranial nerves (other than hearing loss) Significant asymmetry in speech understanding between the 2 ears Other neurologic symptoms and signs (eg, motor weakness, aphasia, Horner syndrome, sensory or temperature sensation abnormalities) Interpretation of findings Traumatic, ototoxic, and some infectious causes are usually apparent clinically.  A patient with perilymphatic fistula may hear an explosive sound in the affected ear when the fistula occurs and may also have sudden vertigo, nystagmus, and tinnitus.  Focal neurologic abnormalities are of particular concern.  The 5th cranial nerve, 7th cranial nerve, or both are often affected by tumors that involve the 8th cranial nerve, so loss of facial sensation and weak jaw clench (5th) and hemifacial weakness and taste abnormalities (7th) point to a lesion in that area.  Fluctuating unilateral hearing loss accompanied by aural fullness, tinnitus, and vertigo also suggests Meniere syndrome Meniere Disease is an inner ear disorder that causes vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus. \n【16】 Systemic symptoms suggesting inflammation (eg, fevers, rash, joint pains, mucosal lesions) should raise suspicion of an occult infection or autoimmune disorder.  Testing Audiometry Testing MRI and CT Patients should have an audiogram, and unless the diagnosis is clearly an acute infection or drug toxicity, most clinicians do gadolinium-enhanced MRI to diagnose inapparent causes, particularly for unilateral losses.  Patients with an acute traumatic cause also should have MRI.  A perilymphatic fistula is typically suspected from an inciting event (eg, excessive strain, barotrauma), and testing may be done by using positive pneumatic pressure to evoke eye movements (nystagmus).  CT of the temporal bones is usually done to show the bony characteristics of the inner ear and can help elucidate congenital abnormalities (eg, enlarged vestibular aqueduct), fractures of the temporal bone from trauma, or erosive processes (eg, cholesteatoma).  Patients who have risk factors for or symptoms that suggest causes should have appropriate tests based on clinical evaluation (eg, serologic tests for possible HIV infection or syphilis, complete blood count [CBC] and coagulation profile for hematologic disorders, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and antinuclear antibodies for vasculitis).  Treatment of Sudden Hearing Loss focuses on the causative disorder when known.  Fistulas are explored and repaired surgically when bed rest fails to control symptoms.  In viral and idiopathic cases, hearing returns to normal in about 50% of patients and is partially recovered in others.  In patients who recover their hearing, improvement usually occurs within 10 to 14 days.  Recovery from an ototoxic drug varies greatly depending on the drug and its dosage.  With some drugs (eg, aspirin, diuretics), hearing loss resolves within 24 hours, whereas other drugs (eg, antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs) often cause permanent hearing loss if safe dosages have been exceeded.  For patients with idiopathic loss, many clinicians empirically give a course of glucocorticoids (typically prednisone 60 mg orally once a day for 7 to 14 days followed by a 5 day taper).  Glucocorticoids can be given orally and/or by transtympanic injection.  Direct transtympanic injection avoids the systemic side effects of oral glucocorticoids and appears equally effective except in profound (> 90 decibels) hearing loss.  There are data showing that using both oral and intratympanic steroids leads to better outcomes than either alone.  Although clinicians often give antiviral drugs effective against herpes simplex (eg, valacyclovir, famciclovir), data show that such drugs do not affect hearing outcomes.  There are some limited data suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial in idiopathic sudden hearing loss.  Key Points Most cases of sudden hearing loss are idiopathic.  A few cases have an obvious cause (eg, major trauma, acute infection, drugs).  A very few cases represent unusual manifestations of treatable disorders.  Evaluation includes audiometry, CT and MRI, and other tests for suspected causes.  Treatment focuses on known causes, and corticosteroids are given in cases of idiopathic sudden hearing loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#7#7#与上下文不联接更像是独立的句子", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:33:36"}

Bacterial meningitis in older infants and children usually results from bacteria carried in the respiratory system, and, in newborns, meningitis often results from a bacterial infection in the bloodstream .  Older children and adolescents have a stiff neck with a fever, headache, and confusion, and newborns and young infants are usually irritable, stop eating, vomit, or have other symptoms.  The diagnosis is based on the results of a spinal tap and blood and urine tests.  Some children die of meningitis even after receiving appropriate treatment.  Vaccination can help prevent certain bacterial infections that cause meningitis.  Antibiotics are given to treat the infection.  For an overview of meningitis, see Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space). \n【1】 Meningitis can occur at any age. \n【2】 Children with birth defects of the face and skull may have defects in the bones that allow bacteria access to the meninges.  Children who have a weakened immune system, such as those with AIDS or those who have received chemotherapy, are more susceptible to meningitis.  Only some bacteria cause disease in people. \n【3】 Causes of Meningitis in Children Meningitis in newborns usually results from an infection of the bloodstream .  The infection is typically caused by bacteria acquired from the birth canal, most commonly group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes.  Older infants and children usually develop infection through contact with respiratory secretions (such as saliva or mucus from the nose) containing the bacteria that cause meningitis.  Bacteria that infect older infants and children include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. \n【4】 Current vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Neisseria meningitidis ,called meningococcal conjugate vaccines Meningococcal Vaccine The meningococcal vaccine protects against infections caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci).  Meningococcal infections can lead to meningitis  also are making these organisms rare causes of childhood meningitis.  Symptoms of Meningitis in Children Symptoms of meningitis vary by age.  Once children develop symptoms involving their brain (such as abnormal drowsiness or confusion), meningitis can progress very quickly.  As many as 15% of children who have bacterial meningitis are unconscious (comatose) or nearly unconscious by the time they are taken to a hospital.  Newborns and children under 12 months of age Newborns and children under 12 months of age rarely develop a stiff neck (a common symptom in older children) and are unable to communicate specific discomfort.  In these younger children, important signs of illness that should alert parents to a possibly serious problem include Unusual fussiness and irritability (particularly when they are held) Abnormal drowsiness (lethargy) Poor feeding Temperature too high or too low Vomiting Rash Seizures About one third of newborns who have bacterial meningitis have seizures in Children Seizures are a periodic disturbance of the brain’s electrical activity, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction. \n【5】 And about one in five infants and young children who have bacterial meningitis have seizures.  Occasionally, the nerves controlling some eye and facial movements may be damaged by the bacteria, causing an eye to turn inward or outward or the facial expression to become lopsided.  In about 33 to 50% of newborns with meningitis, increased pressure of the fluid around the brain may make the fontanelles (the soft spots between the skull bones) bulge or feel firm.  These symptoms usually develop over at least 1 to 2 days, but some infants, particularly those between birth and 3 or 4 months of age, become ill very rapidly, progressing from health to near death in less than 24 hours.  Rarely, certain bacteria cause pockets of pus (abscesses) to form within the brain of infants with meningitis.  As the abscesses grow, pressure on the brain increases (called intracranial pressure), resulting in vomiting, head enlargement, and bulging fontanelles.  Older children and adolescents with meningitis typically have a few days of increasing Fever Headache Confusion Stiff neck They may have had an upper respiratory tract infection Overview of Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Children Viral respiratory tract infections affect the nose, throat, and airways and may be caused by any of several different viruses. \n【6】 Seizures, pressure on the brain, and nerve damage may also occur.  Diagnosis of Meningitis in Children Spinal tap Blood and urine tests Sometimes imaging tests A doctor diagnoses bacterial meningitis by removing a sample of cerebrospinal fluid obtained through a procedure called a spinal tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【7】 The fluid is analyzed, and any bacteria in that sample are examined and grown  in a laboratory for identification.  Sometimes the symptoms of bacterial meningitis are caused by other infections, such as inflammation of the brain  or another type of meningitis that is not caused by bacteria, so the sample is also examined to look for and rule out these other causes of the child's symptoms.  Sometimes a spinal tap cannot be done because the child has signs of increased pressure on the brain, a brain injury, or a bleeding disorder.  In these instances, doctors also do blood cultures to look for bacteria in the bloodstream.  These children will get a spinal tap as soon as it is safe to do it.  Other blood tests and urine tests  are also done.  Ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissues. \n【8】 Prognosis for Meningitis in Children Even with timely, appropriate treatment, as many as 5 to 25% of newborns with bacterial meningitis and 5 to 10% of older infants and children with bacterial meningitis die.  In older infants and children, death rates vary from 3 to 5% when the cause is Haemophilus influenzae type b, 5 to 10% when the cause is Neisseria meningitidis, and 10 to 20% when the cause is Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n【9】 About 15 to 25% of older infants and children develop brain and nerve problems such as hearing loss, intellectual disability, and seizures.  Prevention of Meningitis in Children Routine vaccinations for Infants, Children, and Adolescents can prevent many cases of bacterial meningitis.  People who have been in contact with someone who has meningitis are often given antibiotics to help prevent infection (called chemoprophylaxis).  Women can be screened for group B streptococcus while pregnant and are given antibiotics at the time of delivery to prevent passing the bacteria to the newborn.  Vaccination Health care practitioners and parents can help prevent bacterial meningitis by ensuring that all young children receive the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine Haemophilus influenzae Type b Vaccine The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine helps protect against bacterial infections due to Hib, such as pneumonia and meningitis.  These infections may be serious in children. \n【10】 Some infants and young children who are at high risk of Neisseria meningitidis infection also may be given the meningococcal vaccine.  Chemoprophylaxis Doctors usually give antibiotics to people who have been in close contact with someone who has meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis or Haemophilus influenzae.  Close contacts are defined somewhat differently depending on which of these two bacteria has caused the meningitis but they typically include Members of the household (especially those under 2 years of age) Workers at child care centers (especially workers in the infected child's classroom) Anyone who has been directly exposed to the infected child's saliva (such as through kissing or sharing toothbrushes or utensils, or health care personnel doing certain procedures) Exposed children who are not immunized or who are only partially immunized Exposed children who have a weakened immune system Chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts as soon as the infected child has been identified.  Ideally, it is given within 24 hours.  Drugs for chemoprophylaxis include rifampin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin and are selected depending on the age of the close contact.  Treatment of Meningitis in Children Antibiotics Doctors give high doses of antibiotics by vein (intravenously) as soon as they suspect meningitis.  Very sick children may receive antibiotics even before a spinal tap is done.  When culture results from the spinal tap become available, doctors change the antibiotics, if needed, based on the type of bacteria causing the meningitis.  The child's age also helps doctors determine which antibiotics to give.  Some children older than 6 weeks may be given corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone) by vein to help reduce the risk of hearing loss.  Sometimes a second blood culture and spinal tap are done to determine whether the antibiotics are working fast enough.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:23:05"}

The hamstrings move the hip and knee backward.  A hamstring injury often occurs when the hamstrings are contracted suddenly and violently, as can occur when a person sprints.  It causes sudden pain in the back of the thigh.  Hamstring injury can also develop more slowly, usually caused by inadequate flexibility training.  Doctors make the diagnosis based on the person’s symptoms and results of a physical examination.  Sometimes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also needed.  Treatment of Hamstring Injury Compression and support Rehabilitation Ice and use of a thigh sleeve for compression and support are needed immediately after injury.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other analgesics are used to relieve pain.  If walking is painful, the person may need crutches initially.

Femoral venous cannulation has the procedural advantages of a relatively superficial and easily accessed vein as well as nearby anatomy that lacks the complexity and vital structures of the jugular and subclavian regions.  However, femoral central venous catheters (CVCs) have higher risks of infection and thrombosis and are appropriate only for bedridden patients.  Ultrasound guidance for placement of femoral lines increases the likelihood of successful cannulation and reduces the risk of complications.  When ultrasound guidance and trained personnel are available, this method of placement is preferred.   Indications for Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided Secure or long-term venous access that is not available using other sites Inability to obtain peripheral venous access Peripheral Vein Catheterization A number of procedures are used to gain vascular access.  Most patients’ needs for IV fluid and drugs can be met with a percutaneous peripheral venous catheter. \n【1】 Femoral lines are usually used only as provisional access because they have a high risk of infection.  They should be exchanged for lines above the diaphragm as soon as possible. \n【2】 Contraindications to Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided Absolute contraindications Untrained or inexperienced ultrasound operator Intra-abdominal hemorrhage or regional trauma (sites that drain into the superior vena cava should be used) Unsuitable femoral vein, thrombosed (uncompressible) or inaccessible as seen by ultrasound Local infection at the insertion site Antibiotic-impregnated catheter in allergic patient Relative contraindications Coagulopathy, including therapeutic anticoagulation* Local anatomic distortion, traumatic or congenital, or gross obesity History of prior catheterization of the intended central vein Uncooperative patient (should be sedated if necessary) Ambulatory patient * Therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, for pulmonary embolism) increases the risk of bleeding with femoral vein cannulation, but this must be balanced against the increased risk of thrombosis (eg, stroke) if anticoagulation is reversed.  Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient.  Femoral vein cannulation may be preferred for coagulopathic patients because, unlike the subclavian or internal jugular sites, the femoral triangle is readily compressible and vital structures (airway, pleural dome, mediastinum, blood vessels to brain) are distant from the venipuncture site.  Complications of Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided  Complications include Infection Thrombosis Arterial puncture Hematoma Retroperitoneal bleeding Damage to the vein Air embolism Catheter misplacement* Nerve damage Bladder or bowel perforation * Rare complications due to femoral catheter misplacement include arterial catheterization and retroperitoneal infusion.  Guidewire or catheter embolism also rarely occurs.  To reduce the risk of venous thrombosis and catheter sepsis, CVCs should be removed as soon as they are no longer needed.  Equipment for Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided Sterile procedure, barrier protection Antiseptic solution (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, alcohol) Large sterile drapes, towels Sterile head caps, masks, gowns, gloves Face shields Ultrasound guidance Ultrasound machine with a high-frequency (eg, 5 to 10 MHz), linear array probe (transducer) Ultrasound gel, nonsterile and sterile probe cover to ensheathe probe and probe cord, sterile rubber bands (alternatively, the probe may be placed within a sterile glove and the cord wrapped within a sterile drape) Seldinger (catheter-over-guidewire) technique Cardiac monitor Local anesthetic (eg, 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, about 5 mL) Small anesthetic needle (eg, 25 to 27 gauge, about 1 inch [3 cm] long) Large anesthetic/finder* needle (22 gauge, about 1. 5 inches [4 cm] long) Introducer needle (eg, thin-walled, 18 or 16 gauge, with internally beveled hub, about 2. 5 inches [6 cm] long) 3- and 5-mL syringes (use slip-tip syringes for the introducer needle) Guidewire, J-tipped Scalpel (#11 blade) Dilator Central venous catheter (adult: 8 French or larger, minimum length for femoral catheter is 24 cm) Sterile gauze (eg, 4 × 4 inch [10 × 10 cm] squares) Sterile saline for flushing catheter port or ports Nonabsorbable nylon or silk suture (eg, 3-0 or 4-0) Chlorhexidine patch, transparent occlusive dressing * A finder needle is a thinner needle used for locating the vein before inserting the introducer needle.  It is usually not needed for ultrasound-guided cannulation.  The external diameter of the CVC should be less than or equal to one third of the internal diameter of the vein (as measured by ultrasound) to reduce the risk of thrombosis.  Having an assistant or two is helpful.  Additional Considerations The short-axis (cross-sectional, transverse) ultrasound view is easy to obtain and is the better view for identifying veins and arteries and their orientation to each other.  Identifying a needle tip in cross section requires some skill, because the needle appears as an echogenic (ie, white) dot and the tip can be distinguished only by the dot's disappearance and reappearance as the needle tip traverses back and forth across the imaging plane.  The short-axis view typically is used to determine a suitable venous impalement site and to guide steeply angled (eg, ≥ 45°) needle insertions.  The long-axis (longitudinal, in-plane) ultrasound view is technically more difficult to obtain (must keep probe, vein, and needle in one plane), but it shows the needle longitudinally, so the entire needle—including the tip—can be imaged continuously as it approaches and enters the vein; this helps avoid aberrant placement.  The long-axis view is helpful when the angle of needle insertion is shallow (eg, in axillary/subclavian cannulations) and to affirm proper longitudinal needle alignment during short-axis insertions.  Cannulation attempts sometimes fail.  Do not exceed 2 or 3 attempts (which increases the risk of complications), and use new equipment with each attempt (ie, do not re-use needles, catheters, or other equipment because they may have become blocked with tissue or blood).  During cardiopulmonary arrest, or even low blood pressure and hypoxia, arterial blood may be dark and not pulsatile and may be mistaken for venous blood.  If the femoral artery is errantly cannulated by either the tissue dilator or the CVC, leave the dilator or catheter in place and obtain surgical consultation for possible surgical removal.  Relevant Anatomy for Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided The femoral vein and artery are accessible within the femoral triangle, which is defined by the inguinal ligament superiorly, the adductor longus muscle medially, and the sartorius muscle laterally.  The inguinal ligament is defined as a line drawn between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine.  The femoral artery is imaged inferior to the midpoint of the inguinal ligament.  The femoral vein is imaged medially adjacent to the artery.  With increasing distance from the inguinal ligament, the vein runs under the artery.  The desired point of femoral vein impalement is proximal to the saphenous vein entrance and 1 to 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament.  Bleeding due to a vascular impalement here can be controlled by externally compressing the vessels against the femoral head.  The retroperitoneal space lies superior to the inguinal ligament.  Bleeding due to a vascular impalement here causes retroperitoneal bleeding, and external compression of the vessels is nearly impossible.  The skin insertion site is influenced by both the imaging and the dimensions of the transducer tip (ie, the skin insertion site for long-axis ultrasound guidance may be several centimeters distal to that for short-axis ultrasound guidance).  Positioning for Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided Raise the bed to a comfortable height for you (ie, so you may stand straight while doing the procedure).  Place the patient supine or in slight reverse Trendelenburg position (bed tilted with the head up) to distend the femoral vein and prevent air embolism.  Comfortably abduct and externally rotate the leg.  Retract a pannus or a urethral catheter away from the inguinal area using tape (or an assistant if needed).  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Preliminary preparation (nonsterile) Check that the ultrasound machine is configured and functioning correctly.  Ensure that the screen image correlates to the spatial orientation of the probe as you are holding and moving it.  The side mark on the probe tip corresponds to the teal blue marker dot on the ultrasound screen.  Adjust the screen settings and probe position if needed to attain an accurate left-right orientation.  Do a nonsterile ultrasound inspection (ie, using an uncovered probe and nonsterile gel) of the femoral vein 1 to 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament and determine whether the vein is suitable for cannulation.  Use a short-axis (cross-sectional) view.  Blood vessels are hypoechoic (appear black on the ultrasound screen).  Veins are generally larger, thin-walled, and ovoid (rather than thick-walled and round) and are more easily compressed (by gentle pressure on overlying skin) than their paired arteries.  Venous thrombosis may appear as an echogenicity (gray irregularity) in the lumen but often is diagnosed because the thrombosed vein is incompressible.  Thrombosis disqualifies the vein as a suitable cannulation site.  Cannulate a central vein at a site of optimal short-axis imaging (ie, large-diameter cross section of the vein, with no overlying artery).  Attach the cardiac monitor to the patient and turn it on.  Excess hair may be clipped but not shaved from the site.  Shaving increases the risk of infection.  Prepare the equipment Place sterile equipment on sterilely covered equipment trays.  Dress in sterile garb and use barrier protection.  Draw the local anesthetic into a syringe.  Attach the introducer needle to a 5-mL syringe with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline in it.  Align the bevel of the needle with the volume markings on the syringe.  Pre-flush all lines of the CVC with sterile saline (3 to 5 mL) and then close the ports with caps or syringes.  When flushing a central line, use a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and do not push too hard to avoid rupturing the line.  Prepare the sterile field Swab a broad area of skin with antiseptic solution, from the anterior superior iliac spine to the midline and extending down 15 cm below the inguinal ligament.  Allow the antiseptic solution to dry for at least 1 minute.  Place sterile towels around the site.  Place large sterile drapes (eg, a full-body drape) to establish a large sterile field.  Place a sterile cover over the ultrasound probe Direct your assistant (nonsterile) to coat the probe tip with nonsterile ultrasound gel and then hold the probe, with the tip pointing up, just outside the sterile field.  Insert your gloved dominant hand into the sterile probe cover.  Grasp the tip of the probe with your dominant hand (now covered by the probe cover).  Use your gloved nondominant hand to unroll the sterile cover over the probe and completely down the cord.  Do not touch the uncovered cord or allow it to touch the sterile field as you unroll the cover.  Pull the cover tightly over the probe tip to eliminate all air bubbles.  Wrap sterile rubber bands around the probe to secure the cover in place.  The covered probe may now rest on the sterile drapes.  Anesthetize the cannulation site Apply sterile ultrasound gel to the covered probe tip.  Use short-axis ultrasound guidance: Attain an optimal cross-sectional image of the femoral vein 1 to 2 cm inferior to the inguinal ligament.  Press lightly with the probe tip to avoid distorting the image size and shape of the vein.  Slide the probe transversely as needed to place the imaged vein at the center of the ultrasound screen.  When the vein is centered on the ultrasound screen, the midpoint of the probe becomes a surface marker designating the luminal center of the underlying vein.  Keep the probe in this spot.  On the ultrasound screen, measure the depth to the center of the vein.  When using short-axis ultrasound guidance, insert procedural needles (local anesthetic and introducer needles) into the skin at a point distal and perpendicular to the midpoint of the probe by the same distance as the vein depth.  Then, initially advance the needle into the skin at a 45° angle directed toward the midpoint of the probe.  Keep gentle negative pressure on the syringe plunger as you advance.  Place a wheal of anesthetic at the needle entry point and then inject anesthetic into the skin and soft tissues along the 45° path leading toward the vein.  Slightly tilt the probe fore and aft as you advance the anesthetic needle to continually identify the needle tip and keep it safely distant from the vein and artery.  Insert the introducer needle Continue to use short-axis ultrasound guidance (as described above for the local anesthetic injection).  Insert the introducer needle (with needle bevel facing up).  Maintain ultrasound visualization of the needle tip as you advance by continually tilting the probe slightly fore and aft (the needle tip appears and disappears as the ultrasound plane sweeps back and forth over it).  If the needle tip strays from the vein, adjust the lateral direction of the needle to keep the needle tip above the center of the vein.  If the needle tip is approaching the vein too slowly, withdraw the needle a bit, increase the angle of insertion, and re-advance.  As the needle tip approaches the vein, temper your speed and angle of insertion so the needle enters with as much control as possible.  The superficial wall of the vein will indent when the needle tip encounters it.  The needle then pops through the wall to enter the lumen, accompanied by a flash of dark red blood in the barrel of the syringe.  Hold the syringe motionless in this spot and visualize the tip of the needle at all times.  Displacement is common, and even a slight movement may displace the needle tip from the vein.  Optional: If the accessible vein segment is long enough to accommodate the long axis of the probe, you may prefer to use the short-axis (cross-section) view first to aim the needle at the vein, and then rotate the probe 90° to attain the long-axis (in-plane, longitudinal) view of the needle and vein, which provides better imaging of the venipuncture.  Move the probe as needed to keep both the needle and the vein in sight (in-plane).  Press lightly with the probe tip so the vein remains under the tip and does not roll to the side.  Assess the blood return Continue to hold the syringe motionless.  Securely grasp the needle hub and also hold it motionless.  Remove the syringe from the needle hub and briefly let blood flow out to confirm that the blood is venous (ie, dark red and flowing but not pulsatile).  Then immediately cover the hub with your thumb to stop the blood flow and prevent air embolism.  However, if the blood is bright red and pulsatile (arterial), terminate the procedure.  Remove the needle and use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.  Insert the guidewire Continue to hold the introducer needle motionless.  Insert the J-curved end of the guidewire into the introducer needle, with the J curve facing up.  Advance the guidewire through the needle and into the vein.  You may use ultrasound guidance (either short- or long-axis) to verify the guidewire entering the vein.  Do not force the wire; it should slide smoothly.  Advance the wire 20 to 30 cm.  If you feel any resistance as you advance the guidewire, stop and use ultrasound guidance to check the position of the wire and the needle.  Try to gently withdraw the wire slightly, rotate it slightly, and then readvance it, or try to gently withdraw the wire entirely, reestablish the needle tip within the vein (confirmed by venous blood return), and then reinsert the wire.  However, if you feel any resistance as you withdraw the wire, terminate the procedure and withdraw the needle and guidewire together as a unit (to prevent the needle tip from shearing through the guidewire within the patient).  Then use 4 × 4 gauze squares for 10 minutes to hold external pressure on the area and to help prevent bleeding and hematoma.  Once the guidewire has been inserted, continue to hold it securely in place with one hand and maintain control of it throughout the remainder of the procedure.  Remove the introducer needle (after successful guidewire insertion) First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the needle as you pull the needle from the skin.  Then, securely hold the guidewire at the skin surface as you slide the needle down the remaining length of the guidewire to remove the needle.  Widen the insertion tract Extend the skin insertion site: Using the scalpel, make a small stab incision (about 4 mm) into the skin insertion site, avoiding contact with the guidewire, to enlarge the site and allow it to accommodate the larger diameters of the tissue dilator and the catheter.  Advance the tissue dilator over the guidewire: First, grasp the guidewire at the skin and slide the dilator down the length of the wire to the skin.  Then grasp the wire just distal to the dilator, hold the dilator near the skin surface, and use a corkscrew motion as needed to stepwise insert the entire length of the dilator.  Maintain your grasp on the guidewire at all times during the insertion.  Remove the dilator: First, securely hold the guidewire distal to the dilator and pull the dilator from the skin.  When the guidewire is visible at the skin surface, completely remove the dilator by sliding it down the remaining length of the guidewire.  Place the catheter Advance the catheter over the guidewire to the skin surface: Hold the guidewire fixed at the skin surface, thread the catheter tip over the distal end of the guidewire, and slide the catheter down to the skin surface.  The distal end of the guidewire should now be protruding from the port hub.  If the distal end of the guidewire is not protruding from the port hub, inch the guidewire outward from the skin surface while holding the catheter tip close to the surface until the guidewire protrudes.  Continue to advance the catheter into the vein: Grasp and control the guidewire where it protrudes from the hub.  Hold the catheter near its tip and insert the tip through the skin.  Then, in increments of several centimeters and using a corkscrew motion as necessary, stepwise advance the entire length of the femoral catheter.  Use ultrasonography to verify intravenous placement of the catheter.  Maintain your grasp on both the guidewire and the catheter.  Remove the guidewire: Withdraw the guidewire while holding the catheter securely in place at the skin surface.  Flush each catheter port with saline: First, draw any air from the line and confirm venous blood flow into the hub.  Then, using a 10-mL syringe (or one of equal or greater diameter) and nonexcessive force, push 20 mL of saline into the line to clear it.  Dress the site If the patient is awake or minimally sedated, use 1% lidocaine to numb the skin at the planned suture locations.  Place a chlorhexidine-impregnated disk on the skin at the catheter insertion point.  Suture the skin to the mounting clip on the catheter.  To prevent pulling on the insertion site, suture the catheter at a second site so that a curved or looped segment of catheter lies between the two sites.  Apply a sterile occlusive dressing.  Transparent membrane dressings are commonly used.  Aftercare for Femoral Vein Cannulation, US-Guided If needed (eg, if the femoral catheter is malfunctioning), do a chest x-ray to confirm that the tip of the catheter lies in the inferior vena cava distal to the right atrium.  Warnings and Common Errors Never lose grasp of the guidewire.  To help prevent air embolism, CVCs should be inserted (and removed) with the vascular cannulation site positioned dependant to the heart.

The ball at the top (head) of the upper arm bone (humerus) fits into the socket of the shoulder blade (scapula), and the ball-and-socket joint allows the arm to move in all directions.  The rotator cuff consists of the muscles that attach the shoulder blade to the head of the humerus.  The rotator cuff strengthens the shoulder joint and helps rotate the upper arm.  The glenoid labrum is a lip of strong connective tissue at the rim of the socket of the shoulder joint.  The labrum helps keep the ball securely in the socket.  When people injure their shoulder, doctors can often diagnose the problem based on the physical examination.  However, sometimes x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed.  Many shoulder injuries resolve with rest followed by rehabilitation exercises.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen) may also be used for short-term pain relief (for up to 72 hours).  If pain persists for longer than 72 hours, the person should be referred to a specialist to determine if additional treatment (for example, corticosteroid injection or surgery) is needed.  Exercises to Strengthen Shoulder Muscles Prone Shoulder Extension 1.  Lie on stomach with involved arm hanging off edge of bed with thumb pointed out away from body.  2.  Keep elbow straight and extend arm to trunk level while squeezing the scapula down and back.  3.  Return to starting position.  4.  Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions.  5.  Add light weight as tolerated.   Side-Lying Shoulder External Rotation 1.  Lie on uninvolved side with pillow between arm and body on the involved side.  Bend involved elbow to 90°.  Squeeze the shoulder blade toward spine and downward.  Move forearm up by rotating at the shoulder, so the back of the hand is up toward the ceiling.  Slowly return to start position and repeat.  6.  7.   Prone Shoulder Horizontal Abduction 1.  Lift arm upward to shoulder level.  Lower arm toward the floor and repeat.  Special instructions a.  Do not let shoulder blade move when lifting arm.  b.  Keep thumb facing up toward the ceiling.  Lie on stomach on bed with involved arm out to the side, off edge of bed and elbow bent to 90° with thumb toward the body.  Rotate forearm upward.   Standing Shoulder Scaption 1.  Begin with arm at side, keep elbow straight and thumb up.  Move arm forward approximately 30°.  In this position raise arm up staying in a pain-free range.   Standing Resisted Shoulder External Rotation 1.  Place one end of elastic band to a secure object at waist level.  Place pillow or towel roll between elbow and body on involved side.  Grasp band in involved hand, with elbow bent to 90° and thumb up.  Externally rotate arm, then slowly return to start position.  Start with least resistance band.  Keep arm at side and elbow flexed at 90°.  Internally rotate arm (pull hand inward across body), then slowly return to start position.   Resisted Bent-Over Row 1.  Hold weight in hand on involved side.  Slightly bend hips and knees and support upper body with other hand placed on table or bed.  Bend elbow to 90° and raise elbow to shoulder height by retracting (squeezing) the scapula.

It's stretched tight like a drum and vibrates when sound hits it.  The vibrations go into your middle and inner ear and are turned into nerve signals.  The nerve signals go to your brain so you hear the sound.  Your eardrum also keeps water and dirt out to protect the tiny bones inside your ear.  What is an eardrum perforation? Inside the Ear An eardrum perforation is a hole in your eardrum.  It's also called a ruptured eardrum.  Ear infections are the most common cause of eardrum perforations Symptoms include sudden ear pain and sometimes bleeding from your ear, hearing loss, or noise in your ear Your doctor can see an eardrum perforation by looking in your ear with a handheld light Usually, your eardrum heals on its own What causes an eardrum perforation? Causes of an eardrum perforation include: An ear infection (Acute Otitis Media) Your middle ear is a hollow space behind your eardrum.  The middle ear contains 3 tiny bones that send your eardrum's vibrations to the nerves in your inner ear. \n【1】 Don't do this, because it'll just push the earwax deeper in your ear and may injure your eardrum.  What are the symptoms of an eardrum perforation? Your symptoms depend on what caused the perforation.  An ear infection that perforates actually relieves the pain of the ear infection.  An ear infection is painful because fluid or pus builds up behind your eardrum.  When your eardrum gets a hole in it (perforates), the fluid drains out, lessening your pain.  If pressure change or poking something in your ear caused the perforation, you will have: Sudden severe pain Sometimes a little bleeding What are the complications of an eardrum perforation? You may not have any complications or symptoms after an eardrum perforation.  But some people have: Hearing loss Noise in your ear  A feeling like you're spinning or moving (vertigo) If water or dirt gets through the perforation, you might get an ear infection.  How can my doctor tell if I have an eardrum perforation? Doctors can see an eardrum perforation by looking in your ear with a handheld light.  Sometimes, doctors do a hearing test to see if the perforation affected your hearing.  How do doctors treat an eardrum perforation? You need to keep your ear dry, but you may not need any other treatment.  Many perforations heal on their own.

Some of the cranial nerves are involved in the special senses  A Look Inside the Ear Cochlea The cochlea, a hollow tube coiled in the shape of a snail's shell, is filled with fluid.  Within the cochlea is the organ of Corti, which consists, in part, of about 20,000 specialized cells called hair cells.  These cells have small hairlike projections (cilia) that extend into the fluid.  Sound vibrations come into your ear and are transmitted from the eardrum to a series of 3 small bones in the middle ear (the ossicles).  The ossicles connect to the oval window in the inner ear.  Movement of the oval window causes the fluid and cilia to vibrate.  Vibrations of the cilia make the hair cells send signals through nerves to the brain.  The brain interprets the nerve signals as sound.  Despite the protective effect of the acoustic reflex, in which tiny muscles in the middle ear contract to dampen the amount of movement of the ossicles, loud noise can damage and destroy hair cells.  Once a hair cell is destroyed, it does not regrow.  Continued exposure to loud noise causes progressive damage, eventually resulting in hearing loss Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss. \n【1】 Vestibular system The vestibular system consists of two fluid-filled sacs called the saccule and the utricle and three fluid-filled tubes called the semicircular canals.  These sacs and tubes gather information about the position and movement of the head.  The brain uses this information to help maintain balance.  The saccule and utricle are located in the vestibule and contain cells that sense movement of the head in a straight line, that is, back and forth, sensing acceleration, or up and down, sensing gravity.  The semicircular canals are three fluid-filled tubes at right angles to one another that sense rotation of the head.  Rotation of the head causes the fluid in the canals to move.  Depending on the direction the head moves, the fluid movement will be greater in one of the canals than in the others.  The canals contain hair cells that respond to this movement of fluid.  The hair cells initiate nerve impulses that tell the brain which way the head is moving so that appropriate action can be taken to maintain balance.  If the semicircular canals malfunction, which can occur in an upper respiratory infection or other temporary or permanent disorder, the person's sense of balance may be lost or a false sensation of moving or spinning (vertigo) may develop. \n【2】 The labyrinth is the bony cavity that contains the inner ear.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:26:07"}

Causes and associated disorders are myriad but often represent an allergic reaction or a parasitic infection.  Eosinophilia can be reactive (secondary) or the primary manifestation of a hematologic disorder.  Diagnosis involves selective testing directed at clinically suspected causes.  Treatment is directed at the cause.  Eosinophilia has features of an immune response: an agent such as Trichinella spiralis invokes a primary response with relatively low levels of eosinophils, whereas repeated exposures result in an augmented or secondary eosinophilic response.  Several compounds released by mast cells and basophils induce IgE-mediated eosinophil production and Function Eosinophils are granulocytes (white blood cells that contain granules in their cytoplasm) derived from the same progenitor cells as monocytes-macrophages, neutrophils, and basophils. \n【1】 Such substances include eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, leukotriene B4, complement complex (C5-C6-C7), and histamine (over a narrow range of concentration).  Peripheral eosinophilia is characterized as Mild: 500 to 1500/mcL (0. 5 to 1. 5 × 109/L) Moderate: 1500 to 5000/mcL (1. 5 to 5 × 109/L) Severe: > 5000/mcL (> 5 × 109/L) Mild eosinophilia itself does not cause symptoms, but levels ≥ 1500/mcL (> 1. 5 × 109/L) may cause organ damage if they persist.  Organ damage typically occurs because of tissue inflammation and reaction to the cytokines and chemokines released by the eosinophils as well as to immune cells that are recruited to the tissues.  Although any organ may be involved, the heart, lungs, spleen, skin, and nervous system are typically affected . \n【2】 Occasionally, patients with very severe eosinophilia (eg, eosinophil counts of > 100,000/mcL [> 100 × 109/L]), usually with eosinophilic leukemia, develop complications when eosinophils form aggregates that occlude small blood vessels, causing tissue ischemia and microinfarctions.  Manifestations typically include those of brain or lung hypoxia (eg, encephalopathy, dyspnea, respiratory failure). \n【3】 Of hematologic tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma is a localized or disseminated malignant proliferation of cells of the lymphoreticular system, primarily involving lymph node tissue, spleen, liver, and bone marrow. \n【4】 The pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilic syndrome comprise a spectrum of clinical manifestations characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates Overview of Eosinophilic Pulmonary Diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in alveolar spaces, the interstitium, or both. \n【5】 Patients with eosinophilic drug reactions may be asymptomatic or have various syndromes, including interstitial nephritis Tubulointerstitial nephritis is primary injury to renal tubules and interstitium resulting in decreased renal function. \n【6】 Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is rare; the cause is unknown.  However, in 1989, several hundred patients were reported to have developed this syndrome after taking L-tryptophan for sedation or psychotropic support.  This syndrome was probably caused by a contaminant rather than by L-tryptophan.  The symptoms, including severe muscle pain, tenosynovitis, muscle edema, and rash, lasted weeks to months, and several deaths occurred.  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare syndrome characterized by fever, rash, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and signs and symptoms related to end-organ involvement (typically, heart, lungs, spleen, skin, nervous system). \n【7】 To make a diagnosis, biopsy should show at least 15 eosinophils per high power field.  Treatment includes proton pump inhibitors, budesonide, food elimination trials, and sometimes esophageal dilation . \n【8】 Evaluation of Eosinophilia The number of possible causes and associated disorders is very large.  Common causes (eg, allergic, infectious, or neoplastic disorders) should be considered first, but even they are often difficult to identify, so a thorough history and physical examination are always required.  History The questions most likely to be helpful pertain to the following: Travel (suggesting possible parasite exposure) Allergies Drug use of herbal products and dietary supplements, including L-tryptophan Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, rashes, lymphadenopathy) Systemic symptoms suggest that a minor allergic or drug cause is less likely, and a detailed evaluation for an infectious, neoplastic, connective tissue, or other systemic disorder should be done.  Other important parts of the history include family history of blood dyscrasias and a complete review of systems, including symptoms of allergies and pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), and neurologic dysfunction.  Physical examination General physical examination should focus on the heart, skin, and neurologic and pulmonary systems.  Certain physical findings may suggest causes or associated disorders.  Examples include rash (allergic, dermatologic, or vasculitic disorders), abnormal lung findings (asthma, lung infections, or syndromes of pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia), and generalized lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly (myeloproliferative disorders or cancer).  Testing Eosinophilia is typically recognized when a complete blood count (CBC) is done for other reasons.  Additional testing often includes the following : Stool ova and parasite testing Other tests to detect organ damage or for specific causes based on clinical findings In general, if a drug or allergic cause is not suspected based on clinical findings, 3 stool specimens should be examined for ova and parasites; however, negative findings do not rule out a parasitic cause .  Other specific diagnostic tests are determined by the clinical findings (particularly travel history) and may include chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver and kidney tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue disorders.  If patients have generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or systemic symptoms, blood tests are done.  An elevated serum vitamin B12 level or abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear suggest an underlying myeloproliferative disorder, and a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetic studies may be helpful.  If routine evaluation does not reveal a cause, tests are done to detect organ damage.  Testing can include some of the tests previously mentioned as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and liver tests , echocardiography, and pulmonary function tests. \n【9】 Once a specific cause has been determined, additional testing also may be needed. \n【10】 Drugs known to be associated with eosinophilia are stopped.  Other identified causes are treated.  Asthma mediated by eosinophils can sometimes be treated with antibodies against IL-5 (eg, mepolizumab, reslizumab) or with antibodies against the IL-5 receptor such as benralizumab .  Dupilumab, an IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor, may be used to treat chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis .  If no cause is detected, the patient is followed for complications.  A brief trial with low-dose corticosteroids may lower the eosinophil count if eosinophilia is secondary (eg, to allergy, connective tissue disorder, or parasitic infection) rather than primary.

Symptoms, usually severe, include headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, lethargy, rash, multiple organ failure, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by culture.  Treatment is penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin.  Meningococci are gram-negative aerobic diplococci that belong to the family Neisseriaceae.  There are 13 serogroups; 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) cause most human disease.  Worldwide, the incidence of endemic meningococcal disease is 0. 5 to 5/100,000, with an increased number of cases during winter and spring in temperate climates.  Local outbreaks occur most frequently in sub-Saharan Africa between Gambia and Senegal in the west and Ethiopia, Eritrea, and northern Kenya in the east; this area is known as the sub-Saharan (African) meningitis belt, which includes 26 countries.  In major African epidemics (which were often caused by serogroup A), attack rates ranged from 100 to 800/100,000 and affected up to 200,000 people each year.  After widespread use of the meningococcal A vaccine in the African meningitis belt, serogroup A has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and by Streptococcus pneumoniae.  In the US, the annual incidence ranges from 0. 12 to 1. 1/100,000.  Over the past 20 years, incidence of meningococcal disease has declined annually.  Most cases are sporadic, typically in children < 2 years of age.  Outbreaks of meningococcal disease are rare in the US, and only about 1 in 20 cases (5%) is related to an outbreak Outbreaks tend to occur in semiclosed communities (eg, military recruit camps, college dormitories, schools, day care centers) and most often involve patients 16 to 23 years of age.  Serogroups B and C cause 50 to 80% of invasive disease .  Serogroup A is rare in the US. \n【1】Diseases Caused by Meningococci Over 90% of meningococcal infections involve Meningitis Acute Bacterial meningitis is rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the meninges and subarachnoid space.  Findings typically include headache, fever, and nuchal rigidity. \n【2】 N.  meningitidis has been reported to cause urethritis and cervicitis.  Recently, the incidence of meningococcal urethritis has been increasing in men who have sex with men and typically follows orogenital contact with an oropharyngeal meningococcal carrier.  meningitidis colonizes the nasopharynx.  meningitidis may also cause proctitis is inflammation of the rectal mucosa, which may result from infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or radiation.  Symptoms are rectal discomfort and bleeding. \n【3】 Pathophysiology of Meningococcal Diseases Meningococci can asymptomatically colonize the nasopharynx (carrier state).  Despite documented high rates of colonization (5 to 40% of healthy people), which may be transient, brief, or prolonged, transition to invasive disease is rare (< 1%).  A combination of factors is probably responsible for transition from carrier state to invasive disease, which occurs primarily in previously uninfected patients.  Carriers (and infected patients) may transmit the organism to people who have direct contact with respiratory secretions or who inhale large-droplet nuclei from a carrier or patient.  Nasopharyngeal carriage rates are highest in adolescents and young adults, who serve as reservoirs for transmission of N.  meningitidis.  Carrier rates rise dramatically during epidemics.  After invading the body, N.  meningitidis causes meningitis Acute Bacterial meningitis is rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the meninges and subarachnoid space. \n【4】 Infection can rapidly become fulminant.  The case-fatality rate is 4 to 6% for meningitis alone, compared with up to 40% for meningococcemia with septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a clinical syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated response to infection. \n【5】 Risk factors The most frequently infected are Children aged 6 months to 3 years Other high-risk groups include Adolescents and young adults (16 to 20 years of age) Military recruits College freshmen living in dormitories Travelers to places where meningococcal disease is common (eg, certain countries in Africa and in Saudi Arabia during the Hajj) People with functional or anatomic asplenia or a complement deficiency People living with HIV infection People treated with eculizumab or ravulizumab Microbiologists working with N.  meningitidis isolates Close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease Infection or vaccination confers serogroup-specific immunity.  Antecedent viral infection, household crowding, chronic underlying illness, and both active and passive smoking are associated with increased risk of meningococcal disease . \n【6】 Symptoms and Signs of Meningococcal Diseases Patients with meningitis Acute Bacterial meningitis is rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the meninges and subarachnoid space. \n【7】 Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and lethargy.  A maculopapular or hemorrhagic petechial rash often appears soon after disease onset.  Meningeal signs are often apparent during physical examination.  Fulminant meningococcemia syndromes include Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome (septicemia, profound shock, cutaneous purpura, adrenal hemorrhage), sepsis with multiple organ failure, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.  A rare, chronic meningococcemia causes recurrent mild symptoms (mostly joint and cutaneous).  Complications of meningococcal meningitis are common and serious.  Of patients who recover, 10 to 20% have serious sequelae, such as permanent hearing loss, intellectual disability, or loss of phalanges or limbs.  Images of Meningococcemia Fulminant meningococcemia initially causes petechiae, which become confluent and rapidly progress to ecchymoses. \n【8】 Petechiae and Purpura Secondary to Meningococcemia Petechiae and purpura are visible on the child's face.  Hemorrhagic return from the nasogastric tube is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation, also secondary to meningococcemia. \n【9】 Widespread Rash Secondary to Meningococcemia Petechiae and purpura secondary to meningococcemia are widespread.  Lesions tend to be common on the trunk and lower extremities. \n【10】 A large area of necrosis is seen (right). \n【11】 Serologic methods, such as latex agglutination and coagglutination tests, allow rapid presumptive diagnosis of N.  meningitidis in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, and urine.  However, both positive and negative results should be confirmed by culture.  PCR testing of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and other normally sterile sites for N.  meningitidis is more sensitive and specific than culture and may be useful when the cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain is negative and when prior antibiotic administration interferes with isolating the organism.  Because meningococci and gonococci appear similar on Gram stain, meningococcal urethritis should be considered if the urethral discharge shows gram-negative diplococci, but the NAAT is negative for gonococci; this situation requires culture of the urethral discharge to identify the Neisseria species causing the infection Treatment of Meningococcal Diseases Ceftriaxone Dexamethasone While awaiting definitive identification of the causal organism, immunocompetent adults suspected of having meningococcal infection are given a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, cefotaxime 2 g IV every 4 to 6 hours, ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours) or meropenem (2 g IV every 8 hours) plus vancomycin 15 to 20 mg/kg IV every 8 to 12 hours.  In immunocompromised patients and patients > 50 years, coverage for Listeria monocytogenes should be considered by adding ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 hours.  The fluoroquinolone antibiotic, moxifloxacin, is an alternative in patients allergic to penicillin and cephalosporins.  Once N.  meningitidis has been definitively identified, the preferred treatment is one of the following: Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours Penicillin 4 million units IV every 4 hours In many countries, penicillin G is still the first choice for invasive meningococcal disease.  However, because many countries, including the US, have increasing incidence of isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin, those countries typically give initial treatment with a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime.  Also, when penicillin is used, follow-up treatment with ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or rifampin is necessary to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage.  There have been reports of isolates resistant to both penicillin and third-generation cephalosporins.  Corticosteroids decrease the incidence of neurologic complications in children and adults with suspected bacterial meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b or S.  pneumoniae.  The evidence is less clear when N.  However, high-dose corticosteroids worsen the outcome in meningococcal shock without meningitis and should not be used in such cases; however, low-dose corticosteroids can be used in patients with inadequate adrenal function.  When corticosteroids are used, they should be given with or before the first dose of antibiotics.  Dexamethasone 0. 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours in children and 10 mg IV every 6 hours in adults is given for 4 days.  Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same drug regimens as gonococcal urethritis.  The risk of sexual transmission of meningococcal urethritis is unclear; however, treatment of sex partners can be considered Prevention of Meningococcal Diseases Antibiotic prophylaxis Close contacts of people with meningococcal disease are at increased risk of acquiring disease and should receive a prophylactic antibiotic.  Options include Rifampin 600 mg (for children ≥ 1 month, 10 mg/kg; for children < 1 month, 5 mg/kg) orally every 12 hours for 4 doses Ceftriaxone 250 mg (for children < 15 years, 125 mg; for children ≥ 15 years, 250 mg) IM for 1 dose In adults, a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin 500 mg or ofloxacin 400 mg) orally for 1 dose; for children ≥ 1 month, ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg orally for 1 dose (maximum dose 500 mg) Azithromycin is not routinely recommended, but a recent study showed that a single 500-mg dose was equivalent to rifampin for chemoprophylaxis and so could be an alternative for patients with contraindications to recommended drugs.  Ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease is rare but has been reported in several countries (Greece, England, Wales, Australia, Spain, Argentina, France, and India) and in 2 US states (North Dakota and Minnesota).  When choosing an antibiotic for postexposure prophylaxis, clinicians should consider reports of local ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci. \n【12】 Serogroups A and W cause disease outside the US. \n【13】 See also the vaccine schedules for children and adults from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and meningococcal vaccine recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).  There are several meningococcal vaccines: Three quadrivalent conjugate vaccines (MenACWY-D, MenACWY-CRM, and MenACWY-TT) that protect against 4 of the 6 common pathogenic serogroups of meningococcus (all but B and X) are available.  A bivalent conjugate vaccine that protects against serogroups C and Y is available only in combination with tetanus toxoid and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib-MenCY-TT) is approved for children 6 weeks through 18 months of age at increased risk of meningococcal disease; however, Hib-MenCY-TT is no longer available in the US .  A quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) for use in selected patients ≥ 56 years is no longer available in the US.  Two monovalent vaccines that protect against serogroup B (MenB-4C and MenB-FHbp) are available.  All children should receive a quadrivalent conjugate vaccine at age 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years .  These vaccines are also recommended for adults who are at increased risk.  MenB-4C or MenB-FHbp is recommended for people ≥ 10 years who are at increased risk of serogroup B meningococcal disease. \n【14】 Key Points Over 90% of meningococcal infections involve meningitis or meningococcemia.  An asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier state is common; transmission usually occurs via direct contact with respiratory secretions from a carrier.  In the US, most cases are sporadic, typically in children < 2 years of age, but outbreaks can occur, primarily in semiclosed communities (eg, military recruit camps, dormitories, day care centers) and often involve patients aged 16 to 23 years.  Treat with ceftriaxone or penicillin; add dexamethasone for patients with meningitis.  Give close contacts a prophylactic antibiotic.  Vaccinate all children starting at age 11 or 12 years, and selectively vaccinate high-risk younger children and other high-risk people.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 02:26:10"}

Indications Laceration or other surgically treated lesion of the frontal scalp, forehead, eyebrow, or upper eyelid A nerve block has advantages over local anesthetic infiltration when accurate approximation of wound edges is important (eg, in facial skin repair), because a nerve block does not distort the tissue as does local infiltration. \n【1】 Coagulopathy*: When feasible, correct prior to procedure, or use a different means of analgesia.  * Therapeutic anticoagulation (eg, for pulmonary embolism) increases the risk of bleeding with nerve blocks, but this must be balanced against the increased risk of thrombosis (eg, stroke) if anticoagulation is reversed.  Discuss any contemplated reversal with the clinician managing the patient's anticoagulation and then with the patient.  Complications Adverse reaction to the anesthetic or delivery vehicle Local anesthesia for laceration treatment (eg, allergic reaction to the anesthetic [rare] or to methylparaben [a preservative]) Toxicity due to anesthetic overdose (eg, seizure, cardiac arrhythmias) or sympathomimetic effects due to epinephrine (if using an anesthetic-epinephrine mixture) Intravascular injection of anesthetic or epinephrine Hematoma Neuritis Spread of infection, by passing the needle through an infected area Most complications result from inaccurate needle placement.

NOTE: A 1% solution (of any substance) represents 10 mg/mL (1 g/100 mL).  Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction, which prolongs the anesthetic effect.  Patients with cardiac disease should receive only limited amounts of epinephrine (maximum 3. 5 mL of solution containing 1:100,000 epinephrine); alternatively, use local anesthetic without epinephrine.  Additional Considerations Document any preexisting nerve deficit before doing a nerve block.  Stop the nerve block procedure if you are unsure where the needle is or if the patient is uncooperative. \n【3】 Relevant Anatomy The ophthalmic nerve is the 1st branch of the trigeminal nerve.  The ophthalmic nerve exits the cranium through the supraorbital foramen/notch, which is palpable on the supraorbital rim, directly above the pupil when the patient is looking straight ahead.  The ophthalmic nerve may branch intraorbitally before exiting the cranium—as the supraorbital nerve and (more medially) the supratrochlear nerve.  Several cutaneous branches of the ophthalmic nerve then spread over the forehead.  Positioning Position the patient inclined or supine.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Check sensation in the ophthalmic nerve distribution.  Wear gloves and use appropriate barrier precautions.  Palpate the supraorbital rim and identify the supraorbital notch (the injection site).  Cleanse the skin site with antiseptic solution, keeping it out of the eye.  Place a skin wheal of anesthetic, if one is being used, at the supraorbital notch.  Insert the needle farther and gently probe medially and slightly cephalad to elicit paresthesias.  Do not insert the needle into the supraorbital foramen.  When paresthesia occurs, withdraw the needle 1 to 2 mm.  Aspirate to exclude intravascular placement and then slowly (ie, over 30 to 60 seconds) inject about 3 mL of anesthetic.  While injecting, apply pressure (using your finger or some gauze) under the supraorbital rim to prevent swelling of the upper eyelid.  If no paresthesia occurs during needle insertion, inject the anesthetic over the supraorbital notch (identified by palpation).  Massage the area for about 10 seconds to hasten the onset of anesthesia.  If these injections are unsuccessful, place a line of anesthetic subcutaneously along the orbital rim to block the branches of the ophthalmic nerve.  Allow about 5 to 10 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect.  Aftercare Ensure hemostasis at the injection site.  Instruct patient regarding anticipated time to anesthesia resolution.  Warnings and Common Errors To minimize the risk of needle breakage, do not bend the needle at its hub, insert it to its full depth (ie, to the hub), or attempt to change direction of the needle while it is inserted.  To help prevent nerve injury or intraneural injection, instruct patients to report paresthesias or pain during the nerve block procedure.  To help prevent intravascular injections, aspirate before injecting.  Tricks and Tips Minimize the pain of injection Local anesthesia for laceration treatment by injecting slowly (eg, 30 to 60 seconds), warming the anesthetic solution to body temperature, and buffering the anesthetic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#1#1#with epinephrine† 1:100,000   里面的† \n无关文本#2#2# † Maximum dose  里面的† ", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:58:01"}

Claims Astragalus is said to be useful for many conditions, including upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic kidney disease.  It is also said to strengthen the immune system and prevent physiologic and psychologic stress.  Astragalus is used topically to improve blood flow and speeding wound healing.  Evidence There are no high-quality studies in people demonstrating that astragalus is effective for treating any health condition A systematic review of astragalus for treating chronic kidney disease included 22 studies that involved 1323 participants, of whom 241 were on dialysis.  Overall, study quality was low.  This analysis found that astragalus, as an adjunctive treatment to conventional therapies, offers some promising effects in reducing proteinuria and increasing hemoglobin and serum albumin.  However, because of the suboptimal study quality, definitive conclusions could not be made based on available evidence .  Adverse Effects from astragalus are uncommon, but rash, itching, nasal symptoms, or stomach discomfort may occur.  Astragalus might make the immune system more active, which can worsen the symptoms of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Astragalus should not be used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  Animal studies suggest that astragalus can be toxic to the mother and fetus.  Drug Interactions Astragalus may interact with medications that suppress the immune system.

A tick’s mouthparts become cemented within 5 to 30 minutes of contact with the host’s skin.  Positioning Patient comfort with excellent exposure of tick Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Grasp the tick's mouth parts as close to the skin as possible using a blunt forceps with medium-sized, curved tips placed parallel to the skin.  Apply gentle, steady traction to remove the tick.  Do not squeeze, crush, twist, or jerk the tick’s body.  Doing so may expel infective agents.  If mouth parts are left behind, remove as much of them as possible with tweezers or the point of a scalpel blade.  Clean the area with soap and water or a mild antibacterial wound cleanser such as chlorhexidine.  Aftercare The main concern is transmission of various tick-borne illnesses.  The bite itself is superficial and rarely problematic.  Patients should return if any local pain, swelling, or erythema develops or if they develop systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache, joint pains, malaise) within 4 weeks of the bite; most tick-borne illnesses except for Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia species. \n【2】 The tick may be saved for laboratory analysis to check for tick-borne disease in the geographic area where the patient acquired the tick.  Prophylactic antibiotics Prophylactic doxycycline (a single dose 200 mg orally for adults or 4 mg/kg for children under 8 years old) can prevent Lyme disease but should be given only when all of the following criteria are met: The patient is from an area where the incidence of Lyme disease is high.  A partially engorged deer tick in the nymphal stage is discovered on the body.  The tick is suspected to have been attached for at least 36 hours.  Some experts recommend a longer course of doxycycline (100 mg 2 times a day for 10 to 20 days) to ensure eradication.  Prophylactic antibiotic treatment of tick bites is otherwise not recommended.  Warnings and Common Errors Nonmechanical, traditional, and folk methods of forcing the tick to disengage (such as the use of petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, a hot match, or alcohol) are not recommended.  These methods can cause the tick to regurgitate and therefore increase the likelihood of infection.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can cause substantial weight loss, slower-than-expected growth in children, difficulty participating in normal social activities, and sometimes life-threatening nutritional deficiencies.  Doctors base the diagnosis on the nature of the restricted food intake and its effects after they have ruled out other causes of eating very little.  Cognitive behavioral therapy can help people learn to eat normally and help them feel less anxious about what they eat.  The exact cause of avoidant/restrictive food intake is unknown, but there may be genetic, psychologic, and social factors involved ,for example, trauma Overview of Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders result from exposure to a traumatic or stressful event.  Specific disorders include acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. \n【1】 Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder typically begins during childhood and may initially resemble the picky eating that is common during this phase of life.  For example, children may refuse to eat certain foods or foods of a certain color, consistency, or odor.  However, picky eating typically involves only a few foods, and children who are picky eaters, unlike those with this disorder, have a normal appetite, eat enough food overall, and grow and develop normally.  People with avoidant/restrictive food intake may not eat because they lose interest in eating or because they think eating has harmful consequences.  Symptoms People with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder eat very little and/or avoid eating certain foods.  They may eat so little that they lose a substantial amount of weight.  Children with the disorder may not grow as expected.  Nutritional deficiencies are common and may become life threatening.  Because of their problems with eating, people with this disorder may have difficulty participating in normal social activities, such as eating with other people and maintaining relationships with others.  Diagnosis A doctor's evaluation Tests to check for physical disorders Evaluation for other mental disorders Doctors suspect avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder in people who avoid food or eat very little and have one or more of the following: Significant weight loss or, in children, not growing as expected A severe nutritional deficiency The need for tube feeding or for nutritional supplements taken by mouth Great difficulty participating in normal social activities and interacting with others No evidence of a distorted body image When people eat so little that they lose weight and develop nutritional deficiencies, doctors typically do tests for physical disorders that can cause such problems. \n【2】 Doctors do not diagnose avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder if people restrict their food intake because food is unavailable or is part of a cultural tradition (such as religious fasting).  Usually, doctors also do not diagnose avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder if they identify another disorder or a medical treatment (such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy) as the cause.

The cause of most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown.  The fingers and thumb can be painful and tingle and become numb.  Doctors base the diagnosis on an examination and, if needed, the results of nerve function studies, or sometimes magnetic resonance imaging Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination. \n【1】 Symptoms can usually be relieved by pain relievers, a splint, or sometimes injection of a corticosteroid or surgery. \n【2】 The carpal tunnel is called a tunnel because it is the narrow passageway through which nerves and tendons pass through the wrist to the hand.  The tunnel is made of the surrounding tendons and Bursae Tendons are tough bands of connective tissue made up mostly of a rigid protein called collagen.  Tendons firmly attach each end of a muscle to a bone. \n【3】 The elastic fibers allow the ligaments to stretch to some extent. \n【4】 The median nerve is located at the palm side of the wrist and passes through the carpal tunnel.  This nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring finger.  Carpal tunnel syndrome is very common, especially among women aged 30 to 50 years.  It may affect one or both hands.  Causes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome results from compression (pinching) of the median nerve.  The compression can be caused by swelling of tissue around or in the tunnel or by bands of fibrous tissue that form on the palm side of the wrist.  Pregnant women and people who have diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【5】 Also at risk are people whose work requires repeated forceful movements with the wrist extended, such as using a screwdriver.  Another potential (but controversial) factor is use of a computer keyboard that is not positioned properly.  Prolonged exposure to vibrations (for example, by using certain power tools) has also been claimed to cause carpal tunnel syndrome.  However, most cases develop for unknown reasons.  Proper Keyboard Position Using a computer keyboard that is positioned improperly may cause or contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome.  To prevent injury, the user should keep the wrist in a neutral position.  That is, the line from the hand to the forearm should be straight.  The hand may be slightly lower than the forearm.  But the hand should never be higher, and the wrist should not be cocked.  The keyboard should be positioned relatively low, keeping the hand slightly lower than the elbow.  A wrist pad can be used to support the wrist.  Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are odd sensations, numbness, tingling, and pain in the first three fingers and half of the fourth finger on the thumb side of the hand.  Sometimes the entire hand may be affected.  Occasionally, there is also pain and a burning or tingling sensation in the forearm.  Burning or aching pain with numbness and tingling often wake people at night because of the way the hand is positioned.  The person may shake the hand to try to restore normal feeling.  With time, the muscles in the hand on the thumb side can weaken and shrink through lack of use (atrophy).  Diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome A doctor's examination Sometimes nerve conduction studies Sometimes imaging tests The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made largely by examining the affected hand and wrist.  A doctor may do nerve conduction studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【6】 Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome A splint Treatment of underlying disorders Sometimes injections of a corticosteroid Sometimes surgery Avoiding positions that overextend the wrist or put extra pressure on the median nerve and adjusting the angle of a computer keyboard sometimes provide some relief.  Wearing wrist splints that hold the hand in a neutral position (especially at night) and taking mild pain relievers often help.  Wrist Splint Wrist splints can help reduce the pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome because they keep the hand in a neutral position.  Treating underlying disorders ,such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints. \n【7】 Injections of a corticosteroid Corticosteroids Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis in which joints, usually including those of the hands and feet, are inflamed, resulting in swelling, pain, and often destruction of joints. \n【8】 If pain or numbness is severe or if the muscle atrophies or weakens, surgery is the best way to relieve pressure on the median nerve.

Relevant Anatomy Aligning the external auditory canal with the sternal notch may help open the upper airway and establishes the best position to view the airway if endotracheal intubation becomes necessary.  The degree of head elevation that best aligns the ear and sternal notch varies (eg, none in children with a large occiput, a large degree in obese patients).  Positioning The sniffing position—only in the absence of cervical spine injury Position the patient supine on the stretcher.  Align the upper airway for optimal air passage by placing the patient into a proper sniffing position.  Proper sniffing position aligns the external auditory canal with the sternal notch.  To achieve the sniffing position, folded towels or other materials may need to be placed under the head, neck, or shoulders, so that the neck is flexed on the body and the head is extended on the neck.  In obese patients, many folded towels or a commercial ramp device may be needed to sufficiently elevate the shoulders and neck.  In children, padding is usually needed behind the shoulders to accommodate the enlarged occiput.  Head and neck positioning to open the airway: Sniffing position A: The head is flat on the stretcher; the airway is constricted.  B: The ear and sternal notch are aligned, with the face parallel to the ceiling (in the sniffing position), opening the airway.  \n【4】 If cervical spine injury is a possibility Position the patient supine or at a slight incline on the stretcher.

In patients with possible cervical spine injury, avoid extending the neck.  Lift the mandible upward with your fingers, at least until the lower incisors are higher than the upper incisors.

Such women are at risk of losing the baby or of bleeding excessively (hemorrhaging).  Sometimes so much blood is lost that blood pressure becomes dangerously low  or small blood clots form throughout the bloodstream .  Causes The most common cause of bleeding during late pregnancy is The start of labor Usually, labor starts with a small discharge of blood mixed with mucus from the vagina.  This discharge, called the bloody show, occurs when small veins are torn as the cervix begins to open (dilate), enabling the fetus to pass through the vagina.  The amount of blood in the discharge is small.  More serious but less common causes include the following: Placental abruption is the premature detachment of the placenta from the wall of the uterus, usually after 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n【1】 Rupture of the uterus is very rare. \n【2】 What causes this detachment is unclear, but it may occur because blood flow to the placenta is inadequate.  Sometimes the placenta detaches after an injury, as may occur in a car crash.  Bleeding may be more severe than it appears because some or most of the blood may be trapped behind the placenta and thus not be visible.  Placental abruption is the most common life-threatening cause of bleeding during late pregnancy, accounting for about 30% of cases.  Placental abruption may occur at any time but is most common during the 3rd trimester.  In placenta previa, the placenta is attached to the lower rather than the upper part of the uterus.  When the placenta is lower in the uterus, it may partly or completely block the cervix (the lower part of the uterus), which the fetus must pass through.  Bleeding may occur without warning, or it may be triggered when a practitioner examines the cervix to determine whether it is dilating or whether labor has started.  Placenta previa accounts for about 20% of bleeding during late pregnancy and is most common during the 3rd trimester.  It may occur during early pregnancy, but the placenta usually moves out of the way on its own before delivery.  In vasa previa, the blood vessels that provide blood to the fetus (through the umbilical cord) grow across the cervix, blocking the fetus's passageway.  When labor starts, these small blood vessels may be torn, depriving the fetus of blood.  Because the fetus has a relatively small amount of blood, loss of even a small amount can be serious, and the fetus may die.  Rupture of the uterus may occur during labor.  It almost always occurs in women whose uterus has been damaged and contains scar tissue.  Such damage may occur during a cesarean delivery or surgery or result from an infection or a severe abdominal injury.  Bleeding may also result from disorders unrelated to pregnancy.  Risk factors Various conditions (risk factors) increase the risk of disorders that can cause bleeding during late pregnancy.  For placental abruption, risk factors include High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries. \n【3】 In the United States, up to 30% of deliveries are cesarean. \n【4】 The number of twin, triplet, and other multiple births has been increasing during the last two decades. \n【5】 If the evaluation rules out these more serious causes, doctors usually diagnose the most common cause—the start of labor, indicated by the bloody show.  Warning signs Any vaginal bleeding late during pregnancy is considered a warning sign, except for the bloody show, which is only a small amount of blood mixed with mucus and which does not last long.  Doctors are particularly concerned about women who have fainted, feel light-headed, or have a racing heart—symptoms that suggest very low blood pressure.  The following symptoms are also cause for concern: A tight, tender uterus No heartbeat or a slow heart rate in the fetus Labor that stops and loss of muscle tone in the uterus When to see a doctor A woman with vaginal bleeding late during pregnancy should go to the hospital immediately.  However, if she suspects that the bleeding is the bloody show, she should call the doctor first.  The doctor can determine how quickly she needs to be seen based on the amount and duration of bleeding and the presence of signs of labor.  What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the bleeding and other symptoms and about the medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the pain and the tests that may need to be done Doctors ask about the bleeding: How long it lasts How severe it is What color the blood is Whether the woman has or has had other symptoms (such as abdominal pain, light-headedness, or fainting) The woman is asked about her pregnancies: how many times she has been pregnant, how many children she has had, and whether she has had any miscarriages or abortions or any problems in previous pregnancies.  The woman is asked whether the membranes have ruptured (whether her water broke), usually a sign that labor is starting or has started.  Doctors ask about conditions that increase the risk of the most common and serious causes of bleeding and about risk factors for these causes , particularly a cesarean delivery in a previous pregnancy.  During the physical examination, doctors first check for signs of substantial blood loss, such as a racing heart and low blood pressure.  They also check the heart rate of the fetus and, if possible, start monitoring the fetus’s heart rate constantly .  Doctors gently press on the abdomen to determine how large the uterus is, whether it is tender, and whether its muscle tone is normal. \n【6】 They examine the cervix using an instrument that spreads the walls of the vagina apart (speculum). \n【7】 However, if bleeding occurs during late pregnancy, ultrasonography is done to check for placenta previa and vasa previa before this examination is done.  If either disorder is present, the examination is not done because it may make the bleeding worse.   Testing The following tests are done: Ultrasonography A complete blood cell count Blood type and Rh status (positive or negative) Ultrasonography is required if bleeding occurs late in pregnancy.  If doctors have not confirmed that the placenta is normal, an ultrasound device placed in the vagina (transvaginal ultrasonography) may be used to determine the location of the placenta, umbilical cord, and blood vessels.  Thus, it can help doctors rule out or identify placenta previa and vasa previa.  However, ultrasonography cannot reliably distinguish placental abruption from rupture of the uterus.  Doctors distinguish them based on results of the examination, including information about risk factors.  Laparotomy is done to confirm a ruptured uterus.  For this surgical procedure, doctors make an incision into the abdomen and pelvis so that they can directly view the uterus.  A complete blood cell count is done.  Blood type and Rh status are determined so that a donor with a compatible blood type can be identified in case the woman needs a transfusion.  If bleeding is profuse or if placental abruption is suspected, blood tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation are done.  These tests include the following: Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (to determine whether blood can clot normally) Measurement of substances that help blood clot (clotting factors) and of proteins produced when clots are broken up (fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products) If the woman has Rh-negative blood, a blood test (Kleihauer-Betke test) may be done to measure how many of the fetus’s red blood cells are in the woman’s bloodstream. \n【8】 Treatment The disorder causing the bleeding is treated.  For placental abruption or placenta previa, if delivery is not required, bed rest in the hospital is usually recommended.  There, the woman and fetus can be monitored, and treatment is readily available.  If the bleeding stops, the woman is encouraged to walk and may be sent home.  If bleeding continues or worsens or if the pregnancy is near term, the baby is delivered.  When a baby is delivered in women with placenta previa, cesarean delivery is required.  Women who have a placental abruption may have a vaginal or cesarean delivery.  If vasa previa is diagnosed before labor starts, doctors schedule a cesarean delivery before labor starts, typically a few weeks before the due date.  If placenta previa is diagnosed during labor, cesarean delivery is done.  If the baby has lost a lot of blood, the baby may require a blood transfusion.  If the uterus has ruptured, the baby is delivered immediately.  The uterus is repaired surgically.  If the woman has lost a lot of blood, she is given fluids intravenously.  If this treatment is inadequate, she is given blood transfusions.  Key Points Usually, a small vaginal discharge of blood mixed with mucus (bloody show) signals the start of labor.  The severity of the bleeding does not always indicate the seriousness of the cause.  Ultrasonography is done to help doctors identify serious disorders that can cause bleeding during late pregnancy.  A woman with bleeding during late pregnancy may be hospitalized so that she and her fetus can be monitored and treated as needed.  If bleeding is profuse, the woman may need to be given fluids intravenously or a blood transfusion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#4#与上下文的内容不联接更像是独立的句子", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:30:18"}

Ultimately, all patients develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【6】 Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (previously known as medullary cystic kidney disease) is a group of uncommon genetic disorders.  A consensus report  from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has proposed classifying these disorders based on the causative gene, of which 4 are currently known  Histopathologic changes common to these disorders include Interstitial fibrosis Tubular atrophy Thickening of tubular basement membranes Possible cyst formation as a result of tubular dilation Absence of complement and immunoglobulin staining on immunofluorescence Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease affects people in their 30s through 70s.  About 15% of patients have no family history, suggesting a sporadic new mutation. \n【7】 Hyperuricemia and gout is common and can precede the onset of significant renal insufficiency.  ESRD typically develops at age 30 to 50.  ADTKD should be suspected in patients with the following, particularly if the urinary sediment is benign: Polydipsia and polyuria Gout at a young age Family history of gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is long-standing, progressive deterioration of renal function. \n【8】 Results of imaging studies have many similarities to that of nephronophthisis; however, renal medullary cysts are only sometimes visible.  Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.  Kidney biopsy Renal biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【9】 Allopurinol can help control gout. \n【10】Key Points Nephronophthisis and autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease cause inability to concentrate urine (with polydipsia and polyuria), sodium wasting, anemia, and ESRD.  Nephronophthisis is autosomal recessive and causes ESRD during childhood, whereas ADTKD is autosomal dominant and causes ESRD at age 30 to 50.

Your rectum is a pouch at the end of your colon where stool is stored until you pass it.  Locating the Large Intestine What is colon cancer? Cancer Overview of Cancer is the out-of-control growth of cells in your body.  Cells are the tiny building blocks of your body.  Cells specialize in what they do.  Different organs are made of different kinds of cells.  Almost any kind of cell can become cancerous.  Colon cancer is cancer Overview of Cancer is the out-of-control growth of cells in your body. \n【1】 Rectal cancer is very similar.  The two cancers are sometimes referred to as colorectal cancer.  The most common symptoms are bleeding when you pass stool and feeling tired and weak Everyone over the age of 45 should be screened for colorectal cancer caught early is more curable Doctors usually remove the cancer with surgery What causes colon cancer? Colorectal cancer is caused by the out-of-control growth of cells in the lining of your colon or rectum.  You're more likely to get colorectal cancer if you: Have polyps of the Colon and Rectum A polyp is a round, smooth growth inside a hollow space in your body.  For example, you may have polyps in your nose or on your vocal cords. \n【2】 Food goes from your mouth (eating) to your anus (passing stool). \n【3】 Colon cancer grows slowly and doesn't cause symptoms for a long time.  Symptoms may include: Feeling weak and tired—in some people this is the only symptom Belly pain Constipation (trouble passing stool) Blood in your stool Feeling like your rectum isn’t completely empty after passing stool Sometimes the cancer blocks your colon, and you get symptoms of a bowel obstruction Intestinal Obstruction You have a small intestine and a large intestine.  The small intestine is a long coiled tube that connects your stomach to your large intestine. \n【4】 How can doctors tell if I have colon cancer? If you have symptoms that doctors think might be from colon cancer, they usually do: Colonoscopy, also called a lower endoscopy Endoscope is an instrument doctors use to look inside your body.  Endoscopes can also be used to do tests and treat diseases. \n【5】 A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your body. \n【6】 It uses a low dose of x-ray radiation.  X-rays show body parts according to how dense (solid) they are. \n【7】 Because colon cancer is so common, doctors recommend screening tests to look for cancer before it causes symptoms.  Screening for colon cancer usually begins at age 45 but earlier if you have certain high risk factors.  Talk to your doctor about when you need to start screening.  Screening tests include: Testing your stool for blood you can't see Sigmoidoscopy (doctors use a flexible viewing tube inserted through your anus to look at the lower part of your large intestine) Colonoscopy (to have a more complete view of the intestine than is possible with sigmoidoscopy, doctors thread a thin, lighted tube with a small camera through your anus to look at all of your colon) CT colonography ,CT (computed tomography) scan Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles. \n【8】 How do doctors treat colon cancer? Doctors treat colon cancer with: Surgery to take out the cancerous part of your colon and join the two cut ends together Sometimes, chemotherapy is a medicine that destroys cancer cells.  Chemotherapy works by shutting down cell growth. \n【9】 The part that remains connected to the colon is brought to the skin surface through an opening that has been formed.  The part is then stitched to the skin.  Stool passes through the opening and into a disposable bag.  For rectal cancer, doctors do: Surgery to take out part or all of the rectum Chemotherapy is a medicine that destroys cancer cells. \n【10】 With a colostomy, doctors attach the end of your colon to an opening in the wall of your belly.  Your stool comes out of this opening into a plastic colostomy bag.  The bag is stuck onto your belly with adhesive and you change it when it fills up.  After your treatment, doctors will continue to care for you and check on your health with regular testing, such as: Colonoscopy Blood test Liver tests CT (computed tomography) scan Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles. \n【11】 A computer records changes in the magnetic field around your body.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#2#2#与上下文内容不联接 更像是单独的句子", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:53:25"}

The cause of the spasm of the muscle near the anus is generally not known.  Pain may be brief or may last for several hours.  The diagnosis is based on an examination.  Treatment includes pain relievers and sitz baths and sometimes physical therapy.  The rectum is the section of the digestive tract above the anus where stool is held before it passes out of the body through the anus.  The anus is the opening at the end of the digestive tract where stool leaves the body. \n【1】 The Digestive System Proctalgia fugax is fleeting pain in the rectum.

Pain may be brief and intense or a vague ache high in the rectum.  It may occur spontaneously or with sitting and can waken a person from sleep.  The pain may feel as if it would be relieved by the passage of gas or a bowel movement.  In severe cases, the pain can persist for many hours and can recur frequently.

Diagnosis is clinical and sometimes confirmed by electromyographic testing.  Treatment includes correction of reversible causes and, when necessary, oral drugs to relieve symptoms.   Classification of myoclonus may be classified as physiologic (benign) or pathologic .  Physiologic myoclonus may occur when a person is falling asleep and during early sleep phases (called hypnic myoclonus).  Hypnic myoclonus can be focal, multifocal, segmental, or generalized and may resemble a startle reaction.  Another type of physiologic myoclonus is hiccuping (diaphragmatic myoclonus).  Pathologic myoclonus can result from various disorders and drugs The most common causes are Hypoxia Drug toxicity Metabolic disturbances Other causes of pathologic myoclonus include degenerative disorders affecting the basal ganglia and some dementias.  Myoclonus may also be classified as follows: By its distribution: Focal, segmental (contiguous areas), multifocal (noncontiguous areas), or generalized By its site of origin: Cortical, subcortical, segmental, or peripheral By clinical presentation: Positive or negative By its etiology: Essential (primary), acquired, or idiopathic By its trigger: Sensory or spontaneous Myoclonus classified by site of origin is as follows: Cortical: Cortical myoclonus is associated with cerebral cortex damage or epilepsy.  Photic visual stimuli or touching may trigger myoclonic jerks, which may cause abnormalities on an electroencephalogram (eg, focal or generalized spike-and-wave or polyspike-and-wave epileptiform discharges, giant somatosensory evoked potentials).  The myoclonic jerks may be less evident at rest but aggravated during motor action.  This type of myoclonus can severely impair speech and gait.  Subcortical: Subcortical myoclonus is associated with disorders that affect the basal ganglia or other subcortical structures.  Its effects are similar to those of cortical myoclonus.  However, there are no electroencephalogram abnormalities or giant somatosensory evoked potentials, and photic visual stimuli are not a trigger.  The category of subcortical myoclonus includes essential myoclonus, myoclonus-dystonia, reticular reflex myoclonus, startle syndromes, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common human prion disease.  It occurs worldwide and has several forms and subtypes. \n【1】 Segmental and peripheral: Forms of segmental or peripheral myoclonus are relatively rare.  Segmental myoclonus includes spinal segmental and propriospinal myoclonus.  Spinal segmental myoclonus refers to myoclonus in spinal muscles of one or several contiguous segments of the spinal cord.  Propriospinal myoclonus is characterized by slowly propagated movements that spare the face, often with a burst duration incompatible with other types of myoclonus.  Palatal myoclonus, now mainly considered a misnomer, has been reclassified as palatal tremor. \n【2】 Hemimasticatory spasm is much rarer; it is characterized by unilateral, paroxysmal contractions of the jaw muscles.  It may be caused by compression of the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve.  Classifying myoclonus based on site of origin is thought to be the most helpful when choosing the most effective treatment.  Clinical presentation of patients with myoclonus may be classified as positive or negative: Positive: Patients have an active muscle twitch leading to a jerk.  Negative: Muscle tone suddenly lapses (with electrographic silence on electromyography); when antigravity muscles lose muscle tone, the patient may fall.  Negative myoclonus includes asterixis (eg, flapping of the hands that occurs in patients with severe liver failure).  Positive and negative myoclonus often occur in the same patient.  Etiology of myoclonus may be essential (primary), acquired (most common), or idiopathic.  Essential (primary) myoclonus has no identifiable cause and/or is suspected to involve genetic factors.  Acquired myoclonus has multiple causes, including many metabolic disorders Most cases of myoclonus are acquired.  Idiopathic myoclonus is myoclonus whose presence is completely unexplained.  Myoclonus may have a trigger or not: Sensory sensitive: Myoclonus is triggered by a stimulus (eg, sudden noise, movement, light, visual threat), as can occur when a person is suddenly startled (startle response).  Spontaneous: Myoclonus occurs without a trigger, as often occurs when the cause is metabolic. \n【3】 Symptoms and Signs of Myoclonus can vary in amplitude, frequency, and distribution.  Muscle jerks may occur spontaneously or be induced by a stimulus (eg, sudden noise, movement, light, visual threat).  Myoclonus that occurs when patients are suddenly startled (startle myoclonus) may be an early symptom of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common human prion disease. \n【4】 Myoclonus due to metabolic disturbances may be multifocal, asymmetric, and stimulus-induced; it usually involves facial or proximal limb muscles.  If the disturbance persists, generalized myoclonic jerks and, ultimately, seizures may occur.  Diagnosis of Myoclonus Clinical evaluation Diagnosis of myoclonus is clinical.  Testing is done based on clinically suspected causes.  Brain imaging is done.  Treatment of Myoclonus Correcting the metabolic disturbance or other cause if possible Stopping or reducing the dose of the causative drug therapy to relieve symptoms Treatment of myoclonus begins with correction of underlying metabolic disturbances or other causes if correctable.  If a drug is the cause, the drug is stopped, or the dose is reduced.  For symptom relief, clonazepam 0. 5 to 2 mg orally 3 times a day is often effective.  Valproate 250 to 500 mg orally 2 times a day or levetiracetam 250 to 500 mg orally 1 or 2 times a day may be effective; rarely, other antiseizure drugs help.  Doses of clonazepam or valproate may need to be lower in older patients.  Site of origin for myoclonus can help guide treatment.  For example, valproate, levetiracetam, and piracetam tend to be effective in cortical myoclonus but ineffective in other types of myoclonus.  Clonazepam may be effective in all types of myoclonus.  In some cases, a combination of drugs is necessary.  In the past, many types of myoclonus seemed to respond to the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan, which was used with the oral decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa, but 5-hydroxytryptophan is not used anymore because better drugs are now available.  Key Points Myoclonus is a brief, shocklike muscle contraction that can vary in severity and distribution.  Myoclonus can be physiologic (eg, hiccuping, sleep-related muscle contractions) or secondary to various brain disorders, systemic disorders, or drugs.

Possible complications include Bleeding Infection Bowel perforation (rare, usually in patients with bowel distention from a gastrointestinal disorder).  In these patients, ultrasound guidance can reduce the risk of bowel perforation.  Equipment Sterile drapes and gloves An absorbent underpad Antiseptic solution (eg, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine) with applicator sticks, cotton balls, or gauze pads Lidocaine (1% with or without epinephrine), 25-gauge needle, and 5-mL syringe For aspiration, a 5-mL syringe, 22-gauge 1. 5-inch needle Sterile cup for urine specimen Washcloth for removing povidone iodine after the procedure Sterile bandage Additional Considerations The bladder should be relatively full (confirmed by physical examination and/or ultrasonography).  Relevant Anatomy The bladder lies posterior to the pubic bone and anterior to the uterus in girls and anterior to the rectum in boys.  Positioning Place the patient in a supine, frog position (hips and knees partially flexed, heels on the bed, hips comfortably abducted).  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Locate the bladder by percussion and palpation or using ultrasound.  Locate the point of entry, which is 1 to 2 cm cephalad to the superior edge of the symphysis pubis in the midline.  Cleanse the area from the pubic symphysis to the umbilicus with antiseptic solution.  Begin at the planned entry site and use a circular motion outward.  If using povidone iodine, clean 3 times then allow the area to dry and remove the iodine with an alcohol swab.  Place sterile drapes around the area or use a fenestrated sterile drape.  Inject local anesthetic subcutaneously and into the dermis at the planned entry site.  Insert the 22-gauge needle attached to a 5-mL syringe into the entry site perpendicular to the abdominal wall (this is typically pointing 10 to 20° caudally from the true vertical because the abdominal wall in children slopes down to the symphysis pubis).  Aspirate while advancing.  Urine will appear in the syringe.  If urine is not obtained, withdraw the needle to the subcutaneous tissue but do not withdraw completely.  Then redirect the needle in a more caudad direction, this time keeping the needle and syringe vertical to the abdominal wall.  Consider using ultrasound to identify the bladder for real-time ultrasound guidance.  Place a sterile cover on the ultrasound probe.  Place the probe on the abdominal wall just inferior to the planned needle-insertion site.  Follow the needle as it advances through the anterior abdominal wall and into the bladder.  When the needle is in the bladder, aspirate the urine.  After collecting adequate urine, withdraw the syringe and needle.  Aftercare Place a bandage over the puncture site.  Warnings and Common Errors Microscopic hematuria is common after the procedure; gross hematuria is uncommon.  Tips and Tricks Frequently the child may spontaneously urinate stimulated by the procedure.  Be prepared to collect this urine in a sterile container.  During pre-procedure examination or ultrasound, apply minimal pressure to the abdominal wall to avoid triggering urination.  If the bladder appears as a hypoechoic area 2 cm in each dimension, it is possible to obtain about 2 mL of urine.  If the bladder cannot be visualized with ultrasound, there is probably not enough urine due to dehydration or recent voiding.  Provide hydration if permitted by the patient's clinical condition and repeat the ultrasound after a few minutes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:41", "update_time": "2024-04-14 22:36:50"}

The associated symptoms and signs help identify patients with a serious disorder and often suggest the diagnosis Bullae and/or sloughing suggest staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is an acute epidermolysis caused by a staphylococcal toxin. \n【10】 Conjunctival inflammation may occur in Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years. \n【11】 Any child presenting with fever and petechiae or purpura must be evaluated carefully for the possibility of meningococcemia Meningococcal Diseases Meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis) are gram-negative diplococci that cause meningitis and meningococcemia. \n【12】 Bloody diarrhea with pallor and petechiae should raise concern about the possibility of hemolytic uremic syndrome Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute, fulminant disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. \n【13】 Fever for > 5 days with evidence of mucosal inflammation and rash should prompt consideration of and further evaluation for Kawasaki disease.  Testing For most children, the history and physical examination are sufficient for diagnosis.  Testing is targeted at potential life threats; it includes Gram stain and cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid for meningococcemia; complete blood count, renal function tests, and stool tests for hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Treatment of Rash in Infants and Young Children Treatment of rash is directed at the cause (eg, antifungal cream for candidal infection).  For diaper rash, the goal is to keep the diaper area clean and dry, primarily by changing diapers more frequently and gently washing the area with mild soap and water.  Sometimes a barrier ointment containing zinc oxide or vitamins A and D may help.  Pruritus in infants and children can be lessened by oral antihistamines: Diphenhydramine: For children > 6 months, 1. 25 mg/kg every 6 hours (maximum 50 mg every 6 hours) Hydroxyzine: For children > 6 months, 0. 5 mg/kg every 6 hours (maximum for children < 6 years, 12. 5 mg every 6 hours; for those ≥ 6 years, 25 mg every 6 hours) Cetirizine: For children 6 to 23 months, 2. 5 mg once a day; for those 2 to 5 years, 2. 5 to 5 mg once a day; for those > 6 years, 5 to 10 mg once a day Loratadine: For children 2 to 5 years, 5 mg once a day; for those > 6 years, 10 mg once a day Some common adverse effects of antihistamines include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, restlessness or moodiness (in some children), urinary hesitancy, blurred vision, and confusion.  Key Points Most rashes in children are benign.  For most rashes in infants and children, the history and physical examination are sufficient for diagnosis.

Normal body temperature is highest in children who are preschool aged.  Several studies have documented that peak temperature tends to be in the afternoon and is highest at about 18 to 24 months of age when many normal healthy children have a temperature as high as 38. 3° C (101° F).  However, fever usually is defined as a core body (rectal) temperature ≥ 38. 0° C (100. 4° F).  Significance of fever depends on clinical context rather than peak temperature; some minor illnesses cause high fever, whereas some serious illnesses cause only a mild temperature elevation.  Although parental assessment is frequently clouded by fear of fever, the history of a temperature taken at home should be considered equivalent to a temperature taken in the office.   Pathophysiology of Fever in Infants and Children Fever occurs in response to the release of endogenous pyrogenic mediators called cytokines (in particular interleukin-1 [IL-1]).  Cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins by the hypothalamus; prostaglandins readjust and elevate the temperature set point.  Fever plays an integral role in fighting infection and, although it may be uncomfortable, does not necessitate treatment in an otherwise healthy child.  Some studies even indicate that lowering the temperature can prolong some illnesses.  However, fever increases the metabolic rate and the demands on the cardiopulmonary system.  Therefore, fever can be detrimental to children with pulmonary or cardiac compromise or neurologic impairment. \n【1】 Response to antipyretics and height of the temperature have no direct relationship to the etiology.  Acute fever Most acute fevers in infants and young children are caused by infection.  The most common are Viral respiratory or gastrointestinal infections (most common causes overall) Certain bacterial infections (otitis media, pneumonia, urinary tract infections) However, potential infectious causes of acute fever vary with the child’s age.  Neonates (infants < 28 days) are considered functionally immunocompromised because they often fail to contain infection locally and, as a result, are at higher risk of serious invasive bacterial infections most commonly caused by organisms acquired during the perinatal period.  The most common perinatal pathogens in neonates are group B streptococci, Escherichia coli (and other gram-negative enteric organisms), Listeria monocytogenes Neonatal Listeriosis is acquired transplacentally or during or after delivery.  Symptoms are those of sepsis. \n【2】 A typical sign is vesicular eruption, which may be accompanied by or progress to disseminated disease. \n【3】 These organisms can cause bacteremia (viremia with herpes simplex), pneumonia Neonatal pneumonia is lung infection in a neonate.  Onset may be within hours of birth and part of a generalized sepsis syndrome or after 7 days and confined to the lungs. \n【4】 Most febrile children 1 month to 2 years of age without an obvious focus of infection on examination  have self-limited viral disease.  However, a small number (perhaps < 1% in the postconjugate vaccine era) of such patients are early in the course of a serious infection (eg, bacterial meningitis).  Thus, the main concern in a patient with FWS is whether occult bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. \n【5】 The most common causative organisms of occult bacteremia are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b.  The widespread use of vaccinations against both of these organisms has made occult bacteremia much less common.  Noninfectious causes of acute fevers include Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis, sometimes involving the coronary arteries, that tends to occur in infants and children between the ages of 1 year and 8 years. \n【6】 Some vaccinations can cause fever either in the first 24 to 48 hours after the vaccine is given  or 1 to 2 weeks after the vaccine is given .  These fevers typically last from a few hours to a day.  If the child is otherwise well, no evaluation is necessary.  Teething does not cause significant or prolonged fevers. \n【7】 Potential categories of causes include localized or generalized infection, connective tissue disease, and cancer. \n【8】 Pseudo FUO is likely much more common than true FUO because frequent, minor viral illness may be overinterpreted.  In children, despite the numerous possible causes, true FUO is more likely to be an uncommon manifestation of a common disease rather than an uncommon disease; respiratory infections account for almost one half of cases of infection-associated FUO.   Evaluation of Fever in Infants and Children History of present illness should note degree and duration of fever, method of measurement, and the dose and frequency of antipyretics (if any).  Important associated symptoms that suggest serious illness include poor appetite, irritability, lethargy, and change in crying (eg, duration, character).  Associated symptoms that may suggest the cause include vomiting, diarrhea (including presence of blood or mucus), cough, difficulty breathing, favoring of an extremity or joint, and strong or foul-smelling urine.  Drug history should be reviewed for indications of drug-induced fever.  Factors that predispose to infection are identified.  In neonates, these factors include prematurity, prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal fever, and positive prenatal tests (usually for group B streptococcal infections, cytomegalovirus infections, or sexually transmitted diseases).  For all children, predisposing factors include recent exposures to infection (including family, caregiver, and school or daycare infection), indwelling medical devices (eg, catheters, ventriculoperitoneal shunts), recent surgery, travel and environmental exposures (eg, to endemic areas, to ticks, mosquitoes, cats, farm animals, or reptiles), and known or suspected immune deficiencies.  Review of systems should note symptoms suggesting possible causes, including runny nose and congestion (viral upper respiratory infection), headache (sinusitis, Lyme disease, meningitis), ear pain or waking in the night with signs of discomfort (otitis media), cough or wheezing (pneumonia, bronchiolitis), abdominal pain (pneumonia, strep pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, abdominal abscess), back pain (pyelonephritis), and any history of joint swelling or redness (Lyme disease, osteomyelitis).  A history of repeated infections (immunodeficiency) or symptoms that suggest a chronic illness, such as poor weight gain or weight loss (tuberculosis, cancer), is identified.  Certain symptoms can help direct the evaluation toward noninfectious causes; they include heart palpitations, sweating, and heat intolerance (hyperthyroidism) and recurrent or cyclic symptoms (a rheumatoid, inflammatory, or hereditary disorder).  Past medical history should note previous fevers or infections and known conditions predisposing to infection (eg, congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer, immunodeficiency).  A family history of an autoimmune disorder or other hereditary conditions (eg, familial dysautonomia, familial Mediterranean fever) is sought.  Vaccination history is reviewed to identify patients at risk of infections that can be prevented by a vaccine.  Physical examination Vital signs are reviewed, noting abnormalities in temperature and respiratory rate.  In ill-appearing children, blood pressure should also be measured.  Temperature should be measured rectally in infants for accuracy.  Any child with cough, tachypnea, or labored breathing requires pulse oximetry.  The child’s overall appearance and response to the examination are important.  A febrile child who is overly compliant or listless is of more concern than one who is uncooperative.  However, an irritable infant or child who is inconsolable is also of concern.  The febrile child who looks quite ill, especially when the temperature has come down, is of great concern and requires in-depth evaluation and continued observation.  However, children who appear more comfortable after antipyretic therapy do not always have a benign disorder.  The remainder of the physical examination seeks signs of causative disorders  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Age < 1 month Lethargy, listlessness, or toxic appearance Respiratory distress Petechiae or purpura Inconsolability Interpretation of findings Although serious illness does not always cause high fever and many high fevers result from self-limited viral infections, a temperature of ≥ 39° C in children < 36 months indicates higher risk of serious bacterial infection.  Other vital signs also are significant.  Hypotension should raise concern about hypovolemia, sepsis, or myocardial dysfunction.  Tachycardia in the absence of hypotension may be caused by fever (10 to 20 beats/minute increase for each degree above normal) or hypovolemia.  An increased respiratory rate may be a response to fever, indicate a pulmonary source of the illness, or be respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Acute fever is infectious in most cases, and, of these, most are viral.  History and examination are adequate to make a diagnosis in children > 36 months who are otherwise well and not toxic-appearing.  Typically, they have a viral respiratory illness (recent ill contact, runny nose, wheeze, or cough) or gastrointestinal illness (ill contact, diarrhea, and vomiting).  Other findings also suggest specific causes In infants and children < 36 months, the possibility of occult bacteremia and Fever Without Apparent Source in Infants and Young Children Occult bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream of febrile young children who have no apparent foci of infection and look well. \n【9】 Evaluation varies by age group.  Accepted categories are neonates (≤ 28 days), young infants (1 to 3 months), and older infants and children (3 to 36 months).  Regardless of clinical findings, a neonate with fever requires immediate hospitalization and testing to rule out a dangerous infection.  Young infants may require hospitalization depending on screening laboratory results and the likelihood that they will be brought in for follow-up. \n【10】 However, certain findings can suggest the disorder: aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis ; intermittent headaches with runny nose or congestion ; weight loss, high-risk exposure, and night sweats ; weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, heart palpitations, and sweating ; and weight loss, anorexia, and night sweats .  Testing depends on age, appearance of the child, and whether the fever is acute Testing for Acute Fever Normal body temperature varies from person to person and throughout the day. \n【11】 Testing for Acute Fever, testing for infectious causes is directed by the age of the child.  Typically, children < 36 months, even those who do not appear very ill and those who have an apparent source of infection (eg, otitis media), require a thorough search to rule out serious bacterial infections (eg, meningitis, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary tract infection).  In this age group, early follow-up (by phone and/or outpatient visit) is important for all those managed at home.  Febrile children < 1 month of age All febrile children < 1 month of age require a white blood cell (WBC) count with a manual differential, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation with culture and appropriate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (eg, for herpes simplex, enterovirus) as indicated by historical risk factors.  Inflammatory marker levels (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, or both) may be measured to assist with risk assessment.  Chest x-ray is done in neonates with respiratory manifestations.  Stool is sent for culture or enteric PCR stool test in neonates with diarrhea.  Neonates are hospitalized and given empiric IV antibiotic coverage for the most common neonatal pathogens (eg, using ampicillin and gentamicin or ampicillin and cefotaxime); antibiotics are continued until a serious bacterial infection is ruled out by negative blood, urine, and CSF cultures or a specific diagnosis is made.  Acyclovir also should be given if neonates are ill-appearing, have mucocutaneous vesicles, have a maternal history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, or have seizures, hypothermia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT); acyclovir is stopped if CSF HSV PCR testing and mucocutaneous vesicle HSV culture (if done) results are negative.  Febrile children between 1 month and 3 months of age Febrile children between 1 month and 3 months of age require a different approach, which has evolved over the last few decades because the number of children in this age group who turn out to have a potentially serious bacterial infection has been markedly reduced by routine immunization against H.  influenzae type b and S.  pneumoniae.  Clinicians must nonetheless maintain vigilance because, although serious bacterial infections have been reduced, they have not been eliminated.  Therefore, clinicians who choose to observe without treatment or send home under parental observation need to have a greater certainty regarding that child's low-risk status than that of a child who is tested, admitted, and treated.  Infants in this 1- to 3-month age group are differentiated based on Temperature Clinical appearance (ill- or well-appearing, as below) Laboratory results Ill-appearing febrile infants between 1 month and 3 months of age who are ill-appearing (eg, abnormal cry, lethargy, rectal temperature > 38. 5° C) or who have risk factors for serious bacterial infection (eg, significant congenital anomalies, prematurity, technology dependence, unvaccinated) should be admitted to the hospital and have a WBC count with a manual differential, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag), and lumbar puncture with CSF evaluation, including culture and, if available, PCR panel.  Chest x-ray and a respiratory PCR panel should be done in those with respiratory manifestations, and stool is sent for stool culture or enteric PCR stool test in those with diarrhea.  These infants should be given age-specific empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy (eg, ceftriaxone) until serious bacterial infection is ruled out by negative cultures or a specific diagnosis is made.  Well-appearing febrile infants between 29 days and 60 days of age with all of the following are at low risk of serious bacterial infections: Rectal temperature < 38. 5° C Normal WBC count (5,000 to 15,000/mcL [5 to 15 × 109/L] and an absolute neutrophil count < 4000/mcL (≤ 4 × 109/L)) Normal inflammatory marker levels (procalcitonin < 0. 5 ng/mL [< 0. 5 mg/L] and/or CRP < 2 mg/dL [< 20 mg/L]) Normal urinalysis (and CSF analysis and chest x-ray, if done) Blood and urine cultures should be obtained.  Some experts defer lumbar puncture in these infants who meet the above criteria, but guidelines regarding minimum necessary testing in this age group continue to evolve based on changing bacteriology and advances in testing (eg, inflammatory markers, pathogen identification with rapid PCR testing) .  In addition, well-appearing febrile infants in this age group with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, or other viral infection documented by PCR testing during a period of high seasonal prevalence and who have a normal urinalysis seem to have a markedly reduced risk of serious bacterial infection, which some experts believe permits modifications to the above recommendations, meaning the infants might not necessarily require blood or CSF studies.  These infants can be managed as outpatients if reliable follow-up is arranged within 24 to 36 hours either by telephone or by return visit, at which time preliminary culture results are reviewed.  If the family's social situation suggests that follow-up within 24 to 36 hours is problematic, infants should be admitted to the hospital and observed.  If infants are sent home, any deterioration in clinical status or worsening of fever, a positive blood culture not thought to be a contaminant, or a positive urine culture in an infant who remains febrile warrants immediate hospitalization with repeat cultures and age-specific empiric antibiotic therapy (eg, ceftriaxone) until serious bacterial infection is ruled out by repeat culture results or a specific diagnosis is made.  In well-appearing febrile infants between 61 days and 90 days of age without risk factors for serious bacterial infection, many experts defer blood and CSF studies pending urinalysis results.  When testing is done in well-appearing infants between 1 month and 3 months of age, infants who have any of the following should be admitted to the hospital for treatment with age-specific empiric parenteral antibiotics as described above: CSF pleocytosis An abnormal urinalysis or chest x-ray A peripheral WBC count ≤ 5,000/mcL (≤ 5 × 109/L) or ≥ 15,000/mcL (≥ 15 × 109/L) An absolute neutrophil count ≥ 4000/mcL (≤ 4 × 109/L) Abnormal inflammatory marker levels (procalcitonin > 0. 5 mg/L] and/or CRP > 2 mg/dL [> 20 mg/L] If empiric antibiotics are to be given, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis should be strongly considered if not previously done, especially in infants 29 to 60 days of age.  Some experts believe that well-appearing infants between 1 month and 3 months of age with an abnormal urinalysis but otherwise reassuring examination and laboratory results can be safely managed with antibiotics at home if close follow-up is assured within 24 hours .  Febrile children between 3 months and 36 months of age Febrile children between 3 months and 36 months of age who have an apparent source of fever on examination and who do not appear ill or toxic can be managed based on the clinical diagnosis.  Children in this age group who are ill-appearing should be fully evaluated for serious bacterial infection with WBC count and cultures of blood, urine, and, when meningitis is suspected, CSF.  Those with tachypnea or a WBC count > 20,000/mcL (> 20 × 109/L) should have a chest x-ray.  These children should be given parenteral antibiotic therapy (usually using ceftriaxone) targeting the likely pathogens in this age group (S.  pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, H.  influenzae type b) and be admitted to the hospital pending culture results.  Well-appearing children in this age group who have a temperature > 39° C and no identifiable source on examination (fever without source) and who are not fully immunized have a risk of occult bacteremia as high as 5% (equal to the risk before the pneumococcal and H.  influenzae conjugate vaccines came into use).  These children should have a complete blood count with differential, blood culture, and urinalysis and urine culture.  A chest x-ray should be done if the WBC count is ≥ 20,000/mcL (≥ 20 × 109/L) .  Children who have a WBC count ≥ 15,000/mcL (≥ 15 × 109/L) should be given parenteral antibiotics pending blood and urine culture results.  Ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg IM) is preferred because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum and prolonged duration of action.  Children who received parenteral antibiotics should have follow-up within 24 hours by telephone or by return visit, at which time preliminary culture results are reviewed.  If the social situation suggests that follow-up within 24 hours is problematic, children should be admitted to the hospital.  Children who are not treated with antibiotics should be brought for reevaluation if they are still febrile (≥ 38° C) after 48 hours or earlier if they become sicker or if new symptoms or signs develop.  Well-appearing children in this age group who have a temperature > 39° C and fever without identifiable source and who are completely immunized have a risk of bacteremia < 0. 5%.  At this low-risk level, most laboratory testing and empiric antibiotic therapy are neither indicated nor cost-effective.  However, because urinary tract infection (UTI) can be an occult source of infection in fully immunized children in this age group, girls < 24 months, circumcised boys < 6 months, and uncircumcised boys < 12 months should have a urinalysis and urine culture (obtained by catheterization, not an external bag) and be appropriately treated if UTI is detected.  For other completely immunized children, urine testing is done only when they have symptoms or signs of UTI, they have a prior history of UTI or urogenital anomalies, or fever has lasted > 48 hours.  For all children, caregivers are instructed to return immediately if fever becomes higher, the child looks sicker, or new symptoms or signs develop.  Febrile children > 36 months of age For febrile children > 36 months of age, testing is directed by history and examination.  In this age group, a child's response to serious illnesses is sufficiently developed to be recognized clinically (eg, nuchal rigidity is a reliable finding of meningeal irritation), so empiric testing (eg, screening WBC counts, urine and blood cultures) is not indicated.  Acute recurrent or periodic fever For acute recurrent or periodic fever, laboratory tests and imaging should be directed toward likely causes based on findings from the history and physical examination. \n【12】 Between episodes and even during the episodes, the children appear healthy.  Diagnosis requires 6 months of stereotypic episodes, negative throat cultures during episodes, and exclusion of other causes (eg, specific viral infections).  In patients with attacks of fever, arthralgia, skin lesions, mouth ulcers, and diarrhea, IgD levels should be measured to look for hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS).  Laboratory features of HIDS include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and markedly elevated IgD (and often IgA).  Genetic testing is available for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), TNF receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), and HIDS. \n【13】 Testing for Chronic Fever (fever of unknown origin [FUO]), laboratory tests and imaging should be directed toward likely causes of fever based on the patient's age and findings from the history and physical examination.  Indiscriminate ordering of laboratory tests is unlikely to be helpful and can be harmful (ie, because of adverse effects of unnecessary confirmatory testing of false positives).  The pace of the evaluation is dictated by the appearance of the child.  The pace should be rapid if the child is ill-appearing, but can be more deliberate if the child appears well.  All children with FUO should have Complete blood count with manual differential Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) Blood cultures Urinalysis and urine culture Chest x-ray Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, and hepatic enzymes HIV serology Tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay The results of these studies in conjunction with findings from the history and physical examination can focus further diagnostic tests.  Anemia may be a clue to malaria, infective endocarditis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or tuberculosis (TB).  Thrombocytosis is a nonspecific acute-phase reactant.  The total WBC count and the differential generally are less helpful, although children with an absolute neutrophil count > 10,000/mcL (> 10 × 109/L) have a higher risk of serious bacterial infection.  If atypical lymphocytes are present, a viral infection is likely.  Immature WBCs should prompt further evaluation for leukemia Diagnosis Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer; it also strikes adults of all ages. \n【14】 Eosinophilia may be a clue to parasitic, fungal, neoplastic, allergic, or immunodeficiency disorders.  The ESR and CRP are nonspecific acute-phase reactants that are general indicators of inflammation; an elevated ESR or CRP makes factitious fever less likely.  A normal ESR or CRP can slow the pace of the evaluation.  However, ESR or CRP may be normal in noninflammatory causes of FUO Blood cultures should be done in all patients with FUO at least once and more often if suspicion of serious bacterial infection is high.  Three blood cultures should be done over 24 hours in patients who have any manifestations of infective endocarditis.  A positive blood culture, particularly for S.  aureus, should raise suspicion for occult skeletal or visceral infection or endocarditis and lead to performance of a bone scan and/or echocardiography.  Urinalysis and urine culture are important because UTI is among the most frequent causes of FUO in children.  Patients with FUO should have a chest x-ray to check for infiltrates and lymphadenopathy even if lung examination is normal.  Serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and hepatic enzymes are measured to check for renal or hepatic involvement.  HIV serologic tests HIV-specific tests Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is caused by the retrovirus HIV-1 (and less commonly by the related retrovirus HIV-2). \n【15】 Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【16】 Other tests are done selectively based on findings: Stool testing Bone marrow examination Serologic testing for specific infections Testing for connective tissue and immunodeficiency disorders Imaging Stool cultures or examination for ova and parasites may be warranted in patients with loose stools or recent travel.  Salmonella enteritis can infrequently manifest as FUO without diarrhea.  Bone marrow examination in children is most useful in diagnosing cancer (especially leukemia) or other hematologic disorders (eg, hemophagocytic disease) and may be warranted in children with otherwise unexplained hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or cytopenias.  Serologic testing that may be warranted, depending on the case, includes but is not limited to Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, toxoplasmosis, bartonellosis (cat-scratch disease), syphilis, and certain fungal or parasitic infections.  An antinuclear antibody (ANA) test should be done in children > 5 years with a strong family history of rheumatologic disease.  A positive ANA test suggests an underlying connective tissue disorder, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus.  Immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM) should be measured in children with a negative initial evaluation.  Low levels may indicate an immunodeficiency.  Elevated levels can occur in chronic infection or an autoimmune disorder.  Imaging of the nasal sinuses, mastoids, and gastrointestinal tract should be done initially only when children have symptoms or signs related to those areas but may be warranted in children in whom FUO remains undiagnosed after initial testing.  Children with elevated ESR or CRP, anorexia, and weight loss should have studies to exclude inflammatory bowel disease Diagnosis Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. \n【17】 However, imaging of the gastrointestinal tract should be done eventually in children whose fevers persist without other explanation and may be caused by disorders such as psoas abscess or cat-scratch disease.  Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI can be useful in evaluating the abdomen and can detect abscesses, tumors, and lymphadenopathy.  Imaging of the central nervous system is generally not helpful in the evaluation of children with FUO.  However, lumbar puncture may be warranted in children with persistent headache, neurologic signs, or an indwelling ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  Other imaging techniques, including bone scan or tagged WBC scan, can be helpful in selected children whose fevers persist without other explanation when suspicion for a source that could be detected by these tests exists.  Ophthalmologic examination by slit lamp is useful in some patients with FUO to look for uveitis (eg, as occurs in juvenile idiopathic arthritis) or leukemic infiltration.  Biopsy (eg, of lymph nodes or liver) should be reserved for children with evidence of involvement of specific organs.  Empiric treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics should not be used as a diagnostic measure except when juvenile idiopathic arthritis is suspected; in such cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) is the recommended first-line therapy.  Response to anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics does not help distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes.  Also, antibiotics can cause false-negative cultures and mask or delay the diagnosis of important infections (eg, meningitis, parameningeal infection, endocarditis, osteomyelitis).  Treatment of Fever in Infants and Children Treatment is directed at the underlying disorder.  Fever in an otherwise healthy child does not necessarily require treatment.  Although antipyretics can provide comfort, they do not change the course of an infection.  In fact, fever is an integral part of the inflammatory response to infection and can help the child fight the infection.  However, most clinicians use antipyretics to help alleviate discomfort and to reduce physiologic stresses in children who have cardiopulmonary disorders, neurologic disorders, or a history of febrile seizures.  Antipyretic drugs that are typically used include Acetaminophen Ibuprofen Acetaminophen tends to be preferred because ibuprofen decreases the protective effect of prostaglandins in the stomach and, if used chronically, can lead to gastritis.  Epidemiologic studies have suggested a possible association between the development of asthma and maternal and infant use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen.  A randomized drug trial comparing the two showed that these drugs in usual doses do not lead to worsening of existing asthma .  However, the question remains whether the use of these drugs during pregnancy or early childhood increases the risk of developing asthma.  If used, the dosage of acetaminophen is 10 to 15 mg/kg orally, IV, or rectally every 4 to 6 hours.  The dosage of ibuprofen is 10 mg/kg orally every 6 hours.  Use of one antipyretic at a time is preferred.  Some clinicians alternate the 2 drugs to treat high fever (eg, acetaminophen at 6 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM and ibuprofen at 9 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM), but this approach is not encouraged because caregivers may become confused and inadvertently exceed the recommended daily dose. \n【18】 Nondrug approaches to fever include putting the child in a warm or tepid bath, using cool compresses, and undressing the child.  Caregivers should be cautioned not to use a cold water bath, which is uncomfortable and which, by inducing shivering, may paradoxically elevate body temperature.  As long as the temperature of the water is slightly cooler than the temperature of the child, a bath provides temporary relief.  Things to avoid Wiping the body down with isopropyl alcohol should be strongly discouraged because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and cause toxicity.  Numerous folk remedies exist, ranging from the harmless (eg, putting onions or potatoes in socks) to the uncomfortable . \n【19】 Key Points Most acute fever is caused by viral infections.  Causes and evaluation of acute fever differ depending on the age of the child; in young infants, fever may indicate a serious, life-threatening disease and requires careful evaluation.  A small but real number of children < 36 months of age with fever without localizing signs (primarily those who are incompletely immunized) can have pathogenic bacteria in their bloodstream (occult bacteremia) and be early in the course of a potentially life-threatening infection.

Uncontrollable loss of urine (urinary incontinence) is the primary symptom.  Bladder catheterization, imaging, and tests to measure urine flow are done.  Treatment is aimed at periodic emptying of the bladder (for example, by intermittent catheterization and/or drugs). \n【1】 Neurogenic bladder may be Flaccid: A flaccid bladder does not contract and the bladder fills up until it overflows.  Then urine dribbles out.  Spastic: The person has involuntary bladder contractions and feels the need to urinate even when there is little or no urine in the bladder.  Bladder contractions are typically poorly coordinated with the muscle that closes the opening of the bladder (urinary sphincter).  Mixed: Some people have elements of both flaccid and spastic bladder.  Any condition that damages or interferes with nerves that control the bladder or the bladder outlet can cause neurogenic bladder. \n【2】 Symptoms of Neurogenic Bladder The primary symptom is urinary incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. \n【3】 People continually release small amounts of urine.  Men tend to have erectile dysfunction (ED) Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to attain or sustain an erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. \n【4】 Some people with spastic neurogenic bladder also need to urinate frequently, often with an urgent need, and need to get up during the night to urinate.  People with spastic neurogenic bladder may have damage to other nerves that causes weakness, muscle spasms, and/or loss of sensation in the legs.  People with neurogenic bladder are at risk for urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present. \n【5】 People are also at risk of hydronephrosis when urine retained in the bladder causes urine to back up in the kidneys.  Diagnosis of Neurogenic Bladder Measurement of the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination Ultrasonography of the urinary tract Sometimes more detailed studies such as cystography Doctors may suspect neurogenic bladder in people with nerve disorders who have incontinence.  Usually, doctors measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder after the person urinates (postvoid residual volume) by inserting a catheter into the bladder or using ultrasonography. \n【6】 Further tests may be needed depending on the person's condition.  More detailed studies of the urinary tract  may be done to check bladder function or to help determine the duration and cause of neurogenic bladder.  Treatment of Neurogenic Bladder Catheterization (with intermittent catheterization over the long term) Maintenance of fluid intake Surgery, rarely Prompt treatment can help prevent permanent dysfunction and kidney damage.  Catheterization or techniques to trigger urination can help prevent urine from remaining too long in the bladder.  For example, some people with spastic bladder can trigger urination by pressing their lower abdomen or scratching their thighs.  When urine remains in the bladder for too long, the person is at risk of urinary tract infections Overview of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) In healthy people, urine in the bladder is sterile—no bacteria or other infectious organisms are present. \n【7】 Inserting a catheter into the bladder periodically is usually safer than leaving a catheter in continuously.  People are encouraged to drink sufficient fluids and to limit calcium in the diet to prevent stones from developing Prevention Stones (calculi) are hard masses that form in the urinary tract and may cause pain, bleeding, or an infection or block of the flow of urine. \n【8】 Doctors also monitor kidney function regularly.

People often have bone pain and fractures, and they may also have kidney problems, a weakened immune system (immunocompromise), weakness, and confusion.  Diagnosis is made by measuring the amounts of different types of antibodies in blood and urine and confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy.  Treatment often includes some combination of conventional chemotherapy drugs, corticosteroids, and one or more of the following: proteasome inhibitors (such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib), immunomodulatory drugs (such as lenalidomide, thalidomide, or pomalidomide), a nuclear export inhibitor selinexor, or monoclonal antibodies (including daratumumab, isatuximab, or elotuzumab). \n【1】 Antibodies are proteins that help the body fight infection. \n【2】 Because this antibody is made by a single clone, it is called a monoclonal antibody and also is known as the M-protein.  They begin when a single plasma cell multiplies excessively. \n【3】 The average age of people with multiple myeloma is about 65.  Although its cause is not certain, the increased occurrence of multiple myeloma among close relatives indicates that heredity plays a role.  Exposure to radiation is thought to be a possible cause, as is exposure to benzene and other solvents. \n【4】 In multiple myeloma, typically the majority of bone marrow elements are cancerous plasma cells. \n【5】 In addition to producing a large amount of monoclonal antibody, the production of normal, defensive antibodies is markedly reduced.  Often, collections of cancerous plasma cells develop into tumors within bones.  The cancerous cells also secrete substances that cause loss of bone, most commonly in the pelvic bones, spine, ribs, and skull.  Infrequently, these tumors develop in areas other than bone, particularly in the lungs, liver, and kidneys.  Symptoms of Multiple Myeloma Because plasma cell tumors often invade bone, bone pain, often in the back, ribs, and hips, may occur.  Other symptoms result from the complications.  Complications Fractures may occur if plasma cell tumors cause loss of bone density  and weaken bones.  In addition, calcium released from the bones may result in abnormally high levels of calcium Hypercalcemia (High Level of Calcium in the Blood) In hypercalcemia, the level of calcium in blood is too high. \n【6】 The reduced production of red blood cells often leads to anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. \n【7】 Decreased production of white blood cells leads to repeated infections, which may cause fever and chills.  Decreased platelet production impairs the blood's ability to clot and results in easy bruising or bleeding.  Pieces of monoclonal antibodies, known as light chains, frequently end up in the collecting system of the kidneys, sometimes permanently damaging them by interfering with their filtering function and leading to kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).  Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood. \n【8】 The light chain pieces of the antibody in the urine (or blood) are called Bence Jones proteins.  The increased number of growing cancerous cells can lead to the overproduction and excretion of uric acid in the urine, which can lead to kidney stones. \n【9】 In rare instances, multiple myeloma interferes with blood flow to the skin, fingers, toes, nose, kidneys, and brain because the blood thickens .  Diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma Laboratory tests Bone marrow biopsy X-rays or other imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography) Multiple myeloma may be discovered even before people have symptoms, when laboratory tests done for another reason show elevated protein levels in the blood or protein in the urine, or an x-ray done for another reason shows specific areas of bone loss.  Bone loss may be widespread or, more often, appears as isolated punched-out areas in bones.  Multiple myeloma is sometimes suspected because of symptoms, such as back pain or bone pain in other sites, fatigue, fevers, and bruising.  Blood tests done to investigate such symptoms may reveal that a person has anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. \n【10】 The most useful laboratory tests are protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis of serum and urine.  They detect and identify an overabundance of a single type of antibody found in most people who have multiple myeloma.  Doctors also measure the different types of antibodies, especially IgG, IgA, and IgM.  IgD and IgE types of multiple myeloma are extremely rare.  Calcium levels are usually measured as well.  A urine specimen collected over a 24-hour period is analyzed for the amount and types of protein in it.  Bence Jones proteins, which represent part of the monoclonal antibody, are found in the urine of half of the people who have multiple myeloma.  A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Bone Marrow Examination Red blood cells, most white blood cells, and platelets are produced in the bone marrow, the soft fatty tissue inside bone cavities. \n【11】 In people with multiple myeloma, bone marrow specimens show a large number of plasma cells abnormally arranged in sheets and clusters.  Individual cells also may appear abnormal.  In addition, other blood tests are useful in determining how advanced multiple myeloma is (staging).  Certain changes in levels of specific protein (eg, higher levels of beta-2 microglobulin and lower levels of albumin) in the person's blood when the disease is diagnosed usually indicate the likelihood of a shortened survival and are likely to affect treatment decisions.  In addition, specific chromosomal abnormalities and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels predict shortened survival as part of staging.  Even if x-ray findings suggest the diagnosis, imaging is needed to determine what bones are affected.  X-rays of the entire body (skeletal survey) are usually done.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) may also be done to examine specific sites of bone pain.  Prognosis of Multiple Myeloma Currently, no cure is available for multiple myeloma, but most people respond to treatment.  The number of effective treatments has increased, and as a result, the average survival has nearly doubled.  But survival time varies widely depending on certain features at the time of diagnosis and response to treatment, including Kidney problems Blood levels of certain proteins, including beta2-microglobulin, serum albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Genetic characteristics in the cancerous plasma cells, including specific chromosomal abnormalities and changes in genes Newer drugs have lengthened survival in people with multiple myeloma.  In addition, bisphosphonates given by infusion monthly to reduce bone complications, substances that stimulate the production of blood cells (growth factors) to increase the number of red and white blood cells, and better pain relievers have also greatly improved the quality of life.  Occasionally, people who survive for many years after successful treatment of multiple myeloma develop leukemia Overview of Leukemia Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells or of cells that develop into white blood cells.  White blood cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. \n【12】 These late complications may result from chemotherapy and often lead to severe anemia and an increased susceptibility to infections and bleeding.  Because multiple myeloma is ultimately fatal, people with multiple myeloma are likely to benefit from discussions of end-of-life care Introduction to Death and Dying Death is an intrinsic part of life, and talking about the likely outcomes of illness, including death and dying, is an important part of health care. \n【13】 Points for discussion may include advance directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions. \n【14】 Treatment of Multiple Myeloma Some combination of different types of drugs (for example, corticosteroids with one of the immunomodulatory agents thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide, and/or proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib, or the nuclear export inhibitor selinexor).  In addition, traditional chemotherapy drugs may be also be used in combination with these types of drugs.  Monoclonal antibodies (for example, elotuzumab, isatuximab, and daratumumab) most commonly combined with steroids and an immunomodulatory agent or proteasome inhibitor Possibly stem cell transplantation Possibly radiation therapy to treat bone pain Treatment of complications Multiple myeloma remains incurable despite recent remarkable advances in therapy.  Treatment is aimed at preventing or relieving symptoms and complications, destroying abnormal plasma cells and slowing progression of the disorder.  Treatment usually does not begin until the person develops symptoms or complications, although certain patients with high-risk features who are asymptomatic and have no obvious complications may also be required to start treatment.  These high-risk features include greater extent of disease, blood levels of certain proteins, and specific genetic abnormalities in the tumor cells.  Several different drugs are usually used to slow the progression of multiple myeloma by killing the abnormal plasma cells.  Doctors use different combinations of drugs depending on characteristics of the myeloma and whether or not people are eligible for stem cell transplantation.  Combinations may include drugs from more than one or each of the following: An immunomodulatory agent (thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide), and/or proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib, carfilzomib, or ixazomib), plus corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone, prednisone, or methylprednisolone) More traditional chemotherapy drugs The monoclonal antibodies elotuzumab, isatuximab, and daratumumab Traditional chemotherapy drugs include an alkylating agent (melphalan, cyclophosphamide, or bendamustine) or anthracycline (doxorubicin or its pegylated liposomal formulation).  Because chemotherapy kills normal cells as well as abnormal ones, the person's blood cell counts are monitored and the dose is adjusted if the number of normal white blood cells and platelets decreases too much.  Sometimes doctors recommend stem cell transplantation is the removal of stem cells (undifferentiated cells) from a healthy person and their injection into someone who has a serious blood disorder. \n【15】 Stem cells (unspecialized cells that transform into immature blood cells, which eventually mature to become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) are collected from the person's blood before high-dose chemotherapy is given.  These stem cells are then returned (transplanted) to the person after the high-dose treatment.  Generally, this procedure is reserved for people who are younger than 70.  However, many of the newer drug combinations are highly effective, so stem cell transplantation is now being used less often.  Strong analgesics and radiation therapy directed at the affected bones can help relieve bone pain, which can be severe.  Radiation therapy may also prevent the development of fractures.  However, radiation therapy may damage bone marrow function, which can impact the ability of the patient to be treated with antimyeloma drugs.  Monthly intravenous administration of pamidronate (a bisphosphonate—a drug that slows loss of bone density) or the more potent drug zoledronic acid can reduce the development of bone complications, and most people with multiple myeloma receive these drugs as part of their treatment forever.  Monthly denosumab may be an option for patients who do not tolerate zoledronic acid or have poor renal function.  People are encouraged to take calcium and vitamin D supplements to help reduce bone loss as long as they do not have high levels of calcium in their blood, and doctors encourage them to stay active because these actions help prevent bone loss.  Prolonged bed rest tends to accelerate bone loss and makes the bones more vulnerable to fractures.  Most people can enjoy a normal lifestyle that includes most activities.  Drinking plenty of fluids dilutes the urine and helps prevent dehydration, which can make kidney failure more likely.  People who do develop kidney problems may benefit from plasma exchange In apheresis, blood is removed from a person and then returned after substances are removed from it. \n【16】 People who have signs of infection—fever, chills, cough productive of sputum, or reddened areas of the skin—should seek medical attention promptly because they may need antibiotics.  People also may be at risk of infections with the herpes zoster virus Shingles is a painful skin rash caused by a viral infection that results from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. \n【17】 An oral antiviral drug called acyclovir taken long-term may help prevent herpes infections.  Because people are at increased risk of infection, they should receive pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.  People who have severe anemia Overview of Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low. \n【18】 Erythropoietin or darbepoietin, drugs that stimulate red blood cell formation, may adequately treat the anemia in some people.  Some people with anemia also may benefit from being given iron supplements.  High levels of calcium in the blood can be treated with intravenous fluids and often require intravenous bisphosphonates.  Avoiding vitamin D and calcium-containing foods also is helpful to reduce elevated calcium levels.  People who have high levels of uric acid in the blood or widespread disease may benefit from allopurinol, a drug that blocks the body's production of uric acid, which can damage the kidneys.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:13:34"}

People with schizoid personality disorder seem to have no interest in close relationships with others and prefer to be by themselves.  Doctors diagnose schizoid personality disorder based on specific symptoms, including detachment from and disinterest in social relationships and limited expression of emotions.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy that focuses on acquiring social skills may help people with this disorder change. \n【1】 People with schizoid personality disorder have difficulty relating to others meaningfully.  Schizoid personality disorder occurs in about 3 to 5% of the general population in the United States.  It is slightly more common among men.  Other disorders are often also present.  Up to half of people with schizoid personality disorder have had at least one episode of major depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【2】 They often also have other personality disorders. \n【3】 Having caregivers who were emotionally cold, neglecting, and detached during childhood may contribute to the development of schizoid personality disorder.  Having such caregivers may reinforce the child's feeling that relationships with other people are not satisfying.  Symptoms of Schizoid Personality Disorder Detachment from others People with schizoid personality disorder seem to have no desire for close relationships with other people, including relatives.  They have no close friends or confidants, except sometimes a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling).  They rarely date and often do not marry.  Because they prefer being by themselves, they tend to choose activities and hobbies that do not require interaction with others (such as computer games).  Sexual activity with others is of little, if any, interest to them.  They also seem to experience less enjoyment from sensory and bodily experiences (such as walking on the beach).  People with schizoid personality disorder do not seem bothered by what others think of them—whether good or bad.  They may seem aloof or self-absorbed.  They do not notice normal social cues and thus may seem socially inept.  Limited expression of emotions People with schizoid personality disorder rarely react (for example, by smiling or nodding) or show emotion in social situations.  They have difficulty expressing anger, even when they are provoked.  They do not react appropriately to important life events and may seem passive in response to changes in circumstances.  As a result, they may seem to have no direction to their life.  Rarely, when these people feel comfortable revealing themselves, they admit that they feel pain, especially in social interactions.  Persistence of symptoms of schizoid personality disorder tend to remain the same over time, more so than those of other personality disorders.  Diagnosis of Schizoid Personality Disorder A doctor's evaluation, based on specific criteria Doctors usually diagnose personality disorders based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition , published by the American Psychiatric Association.  For doctors to diagnose schizoid personality disorder, people must have a persistent detachment from and general disinterest in social relationships and limited expression of emotions in interpersonal interactions, as shown by at least four of the following: They do not want or enjoy close relationships, including those with family members.  They strongly prefer solitary activities.  They have little, if any, interest in sexual activity with another person.  They enjoy few, if any, activities.  They appear to be indifferent to the praise or criticism of others.  They are emotionally cold and detached and do not express emotion in response to events or interactions with others.  Also, symptoms must have begun by early adulthood. \n【4】 Because people with schizoid personality disorder are detached and aloof, doctors have difficulty establishing a cooperative, mutually respectful relationship with them.  To establish a relationship and thus encourage people to participate in treatment, doctors may try to discuss topics that appeal to people who prefer activities that do not require interaction with others (such as stamp collecting).  There is not much information about the effect of psychotherapy or drug therapy on schizoid personality disorder.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy Psychotherapy Extraordinary advances have been made in the treatment of mental illness.  As a result, many mental health disorders can now be treated nearly as successfully as physical disorders. \n【5】 For example, people may learn how to recognize social cues (spoken and unspoken, such as facial expressions and body language).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:26:09"}
{"id": 973800, "user_id": "65e7dd68e6dc6a3a8618a668", "user_name": "王磊", "task_id": 625, "source_info": {"seq_id": "e9f50be0-28f5-4ee8-a36e-e97efcaafa73", "title": null, "text": "【0】A number of immunologic interventions, both passive and active, can be directed against tumor cells.   Passive Cellular Immunotherapy In passive cellular immunotherapy, specific effector cells are directly infused and are not induced within the patient.  Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells are produced from the patient’s endogenous T cells, which are extracted and grown in a cell culture system by exposing them to the lymphokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  The proliferated LAK cells are then returned to the patient’s bloodstream.  Animal studies have shown that LAK cells are more effective against cancer cells than are the original endogenous T cells, presumably because of their greater number.  Clinical trials of LAK cells in humans are ongoing.  Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may have greater tumoricidal activity than LAK cells.  These cells are grown in culture in a manner similar to LAK cells.  However, the progenitor cells consist of T cells that are isolated from resected tumor tissue.  This process theoretically provides a line of T cells that has greater tumor specificity than those obtained from the bloodstream.  Clinical studies have shown highly promising results .  Genetically modified T cells can express T-cell receptors (TCR) that recognize tumor-associated antigens Tumor Antigens Many tumor cells produce antigens, which may be released in the bloodstream or remain on the cell surface. \n【1】 Results of initial trials are encouraging.  Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize specific proteins on the surface of tumor cells.  CAR T cells are currently used for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors arising in the reticuloendothelial and lymphatic systems. \n【2】 In contrast to TCR T cells, CAR T cells recognize only relatively large proteins on the surface of tumor cells.  Therefore CAR T cells and TCR T cells may represent complementary approaches to cancer therapy.  Concomitant use of interferon enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and TAAs on tumor cells, thereby augmenting the killing of tumor cells by the infused effector cells. \n【3】 Passive Humoral Immunotherapy Administration of exogenous antibodies constitutes passive humoral immunotherapy.  Antilymphocyte serum has been used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in T-cell and B-cell lymphomas, resulting in temporary decreases in lymphocyte counts or lymph node size.  T-cell engagers are bispecific antibodies that recruit cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells.  The most frequently used engagers are antibodies targeting one tumor antigen and one molecule on T cells (mostly CD3).  Antibodies targeting two tumor antigens and CD3 are being tested.  T-cell engagers demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer; it also strikes adults of all ages. \n【4】 Clinical efficacy in solid tumors is under investigation.  Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) may be used.  Monoclonal antitumor antibodies may also be conjugated with different cell toxic drugs or with radioisotopes so that the antibodies deliver these toxic agents selectively to the tumor cells.  For example, phase III trial of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeting antibody conjugated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer . \n【5】 Active Specific Immunotherapy Inducing cellular immunity The immune response to foreign antigens consists of Humoral mechanisms (eg, antibodies) Cellular mechanisms Most humoral responses cannot prevent tumor growth. \n【6】 Cellular immunity can be induced to specific, very well-defined antigens.  Several techniques can be used to stimulate a host response; these techniques may involve giving peptides, DNA, or tumor cells (from the host or another patient).  Peptides and DNA can be delivered directly, transcutaneously to myeloid or dendritic cells using electroporation or injection with adjuvants, or indirectly using antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells).  These dendritic cells can also be genetically modified to secrete additional immune-response stimulants (eg, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]).  Peptide-based vaccines use peptides from defined TAAs.  An increasing number of TAAs have been identified as the targets of T cells in cancer patients and are being tested in clinical trials.  Recent data indicate that responses are most potent if the TAAs are delivered using dendritic cells.  These cells are obtained from the patient, loaded with the desired TAA, and then reintroduced intradermally; they stimulate endogenous T cells to respond to the TAA.  The peptides also can be delivered by co-administration with immunogenic adjuvants.  DNA vaccines use recombinant DNA that encodes a specific (defined) antigenic protein.  The DNA is delivered directly via transcutaneous electroporation, incorporated into viruses that are injected directly into patients, or introduced into dendritic cells obtained from the patients, which are then injected back into them.  The DNA expresses the target antigen, which triggers or enhances patients’ immune response.  Clinical trials of DNA vaccines have shown promising results.  Allogeneic tumor cells (cells taken from other patients) have been used in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer; it also strikes adults of all ages. \n【7】 Remission is induced by intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Then, irradiated allogeneic tumor cells that have been modified either genetically or chemically to increase their immunogenic potential are injected into the patient.  Sometimes patients are also given bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine or other adjuvants  to enhance the immune response against the tumor.  Prolonged remissions or improved reinduction rates have been reported in some series but not in most.  Immunotherapy and Targeting Inhibitors of Immune Responses Immune checkpoint blockers are antibodies that target molecules involved in natural inhibition of immune responses.  These target molecules include the following: Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) Others Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) can downregulate the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that is triggered by antigen-presenting cells (APCs).  The mechanism may be the higher affinity of CTL4 for CD80 and CD86 (costimulatory receptors) than the costimulatory receptor CD28 on APCs.  CTLA-4 is upregulated by activation of T cell receptor and by cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-12.  The CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab prolongs survival in metastatic melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).  Metastasis is correlated with depth of dermal invasion. \n【8】 Tremelimumab, another CTLA-4 inhibitor, is being studied in mesothelioma Pleural mesothelioma is the only known pleural cancer and is caused by asbestos exposure in nearly all cases.  Diagnosis is based on history and chest x-ray or CT findings and tissue biopsy. \n【9】 PD-1 and PD ligand 1 and 2 inhibitors can counteract certain immune inhibitory effects triggered by the interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1 or PD-L2.  PD-1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and some others (eg, monocytes, dendritic cells).  It binds to PD-L1 (expressed on many tumor cells, hematopoietic cells, and some other cells) and PD-L2 (expressed mainly on hematopoietic cells).  This binding inhibits tumor cell apoptosis and facilitates T-cell exhaustion and the conversion of T-cell cytotoxic and helper T cells to regulatory T cells.  PD-1 and PD-L1/2 are upregulated by cytokines such as interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma in the tumor microenvironment and prevent T-cell activation and recognition of tumor cells.  Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are IgG4 PD-1 inhibitors that increase T-cell activation and infiltration of tumors and prolong survival in metastatic melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system). \n【10】 About 85% of cases are related to cigarette smoking. \n【11】 Symptoms can include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). \n【12】 Clinical trials continue on the use of these drugs in the treatment of other cancers.  Lymphocyte activator gene 3 (LAG-3) increases T cell regulator activity by interacting with MHC on tumor cells.  Blockade of LAG3 with monoclonal antibody has demonstrated strong clinical benefit in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma (1 Pearls & Pitfalls ).  Others targeting inhibitors under study are generally in earlier stages of clinical development.  These include, for example, B and T cell lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), which decreases production of cytokines and CD4 cell proliferation; T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), which kill helper Th1 cells; and V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), inhibition of which increases T-cell activity in tumors.  In recent years, bispecific antibodies targeting several of these molecules together have been developed and currently are being tested in clinical trials.  Combinations of immune checkpoint blockers (eg, blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 for metastatic melanoma or advanced renal cell carcinoma) are under investigation.  Clinical trials have demonstrated substantial clinical benefits but are associated with higher toxicity than single therapy.  Combining immunotherapy and conventional chemotherapy is a novel approach to cancer treatment.  It has shown some success (vs historic controls) in nonrandomized phase I and phase II clinical trials involving various cancers, types of vaccines, and chemotherapy.  The combination of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy is used as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non–small cell lung cancer Lung Carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. \n【13】 The combination of the check-point inhibitor atezolizumab with chemotherapy can be used to treat patients with triple-negative breast cancer Breast cancers are most often epithelial tumors involving the ducts or lobules.  Most patients present with an asymptomatic mass discovered during examination or screening mammography. \n【14】 The PD-L1 check-point inhibitor durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in patients with small cell lung cancer and after conventional chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (4 Pearls & Pitfalls ). \n【15】 Nonspecific Immunotherapy Interferons (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma) are glycoproteins that have antitumor and antiviral activity.  Depending on dose, interferons may either enhance or decrease cellular immune function and humoral immune function Host Response to Tumors The immune response to foreign antigens consists of Humoral mechanisms (eg, antibodies) Cellular mechanisms Most humoral responses cannot prevent tumor growth. \n【16】 Interferons also inhibit cell division and certain synthetic processes in a variety of cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. \n【17】 However, interferons can have significant adverse effects, such as fever, malaise, leukopenia, alopecia, myalgia, cognitive and depressive effects, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypothyroidism.  Certain bacterial adjuvants (bacille Calmette–Guérin [BCG] and derivatives, killed suspensions of Corynebacterium parvum) have tumoricidal properties.  They have been used with or without added tumor antigen to treat a variety of cancers, usually along with intensive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  For example, direct injection of BCG into cancerous tissues has resulted in regression of melanoma Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes in a pigmented area (eg, skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or central nervous system).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 22:43:42"}

Garlic can also be eaten raw or cooked.  Because the active ingredients are volatile and destroyed by the act of crushing, the amount of active ingredient in the various forms of garlic varies greatly.  Supplements are best standardized by the amount of active compound.  Aged garlic extract (AGE), made from garlic allowed to age for at least 20 months, has more stable active compounds than most forms.  Consuming garlic supplements in this form appears to confer the greatest health benefits and freedom from adverse effects.  : Garlic.  Claims Garlic is said to have favorable effects on several cardiac risk factors, including reduction of blood pressure and serum lipid and glucose levels; garlic inhibits platelets in vitro.  Garlic is also said to protect against laryngeal, gastric, colorectal, and endometrial cancer and adenomatous colorectal polyps.  Garlic is also said to prevent the common cold and to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  Evidence The strongest evidence available for garlic supplementation, specifically AGE, is lowering blood pressure.  A 2016 meta-analysis evaluated 20 trials (970 subjects) in which study duration ranged from 2 to 24 weeks.  A variety of garlic preparations included garlic powder and AGE.  Mean systolic and diastolic pressure decreases were 5. 1 mm Hg and 2. 5 mm Hg, respectively .  A 2020 meta-analysis of 12 randomized control trials (553 hypertensive subjects) lasting at least 2 months found a mean decrease of 8. 3 mm Hg in systolic pressure and 5. 5 mm Hg in diastolic pressure .  Results of the lipid-lowering effects of garlic supplementation have been quite inconsistent.  A 2013 meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled studies (2298 participants) found that garlic lowered total cholesterol by 17 mg/dL (0. 4 mmol/L) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL (0. 2 mmol/L) .  A 2015 meta-analysis of 7 studies (513 subjects) has verified efficacy of garlic in lowering fasting glucose .  Other studies are needed to assess impact on hemoglobin A1C.  A randomized, placebo controlled trial found that garlic can improve hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD, evidenced by changes in the ultrasound findings.  Garlic also significantly decreased weight and liver enzymes .  Scientific evidence of either garlic intake or garlic supplement use shows limited or no protection against cancer.  A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating garlic intake in relation to colorectal cancer incidence did not find any protective effect .  Garlic consumed in high doses has general antimicrobial effects in vitro .  In a randomized controlled trial, 146 participants were treated with an allicin-containing garlic supplement or placebo, one capsule a day, for 12 weeks.  During the 12 weeks of the study, those treated with garlic had significantly fewer colds than the placebo group (24 versus 65, P < . 001).  The authors concluded that an allicin-containing garlic supplement can prevent attack by the common cold virus .  Most of these studies lack the specific details with regard to the supplement and/or concentration of active ingredients in the supplement, which may account for the variable results.  Adverse Effects Breath and body smell and nausea may occur; high doses may cause burning in the mouth, esophagus, and stomach.  Drug Interactions Theoretically, garlic is contraindicated in patients who have bleeding diatheses or who take antihypertensives, antiplatelet drugs, or warfarin.

Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.  Fractures usually result from injuries or overuse.  The injured part hurts  Lower Humeral Fractures occur in the lower part of the upper arm bone (humerus), which is part of the elbow joint.  Lower humeral fractures usually result from a fall on an outstretched arm or direct force.  Fractures of the lower humerus may damage an artery in the arm, cause bleeding in the joint, or damage nerves that run through the elbow, causing numbness and problems moving the hand and fingers.  Doctors base the diagnosis on results of the physical examination and x-rays.  Treatment involves consultation with an orthopedic surgeon and splinting (when the bones have not moved out of alignment) or surgery (when the broken pieces are separated and/or out of alignment).  Lower humeral fractures often occur in children aged 3 to 11 years old.  They usually result from a fall on an outstretched arm or direct force.  The fracture usually extends into the joint and may cause bleeding in the joint.  The main artery of the upper arm (brachial artery) may be damaged, particularly if the broken bones are separated (displaced) or out of alignment.  When this artery is damaged, compartment syndrome is increased pressure in the space around certain muscles.  It occurs when injured muscles swell so much that they cut off their blood supply. \n【1】 As a result, the elbow and wrist may become a permanently stiff (called a contracture).  Sometimes nerves that run through the elbow (radial or median nerve) are damaged.  When the radial nerve is damaged, people cannot cock their hand up.  When the median nerve (the nerve that is compressed in carpal tunnel syndrome) is damaged, people may have difficulty pinching their thumb and little finger together.  Symptoms of Lower Humeral Fractures The elbow area is painful and swollen in people with lower humeral fractures.  The ability to bend the elbow may be limited.  People may have bruises on their lower forearm.  The bruises suggest that a blood vessel is injured.  The forearm and hand may be numb, and people may not be able to move their hand and fingers normally.  These symptoms suggest that a nerve is injured.  Diagnosis of Lower Humeral Fractures X-rays Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.  The injured part hurts  If people think they or a child may have fractured their elbow, the injured person should be seen by a doctor immediately.  ople who may have an elbow fracture should see a doctor immediately.  Doctors ask people to describe what happened and what their symptoms are.  Doctors also examine the elbow.  To determine whether there is a fracture, doctors take x-rays of the elbow joint from different angles.  If doctors suspect a lower humeral fracture but x-rays do not show one, they splint the elbow and have the person come back for additional x-rays, usually in 7 to 10 days.  If doctors suspect a fracture, they also check for damage to blood vessels and nerves in the arm.  For example, they check the pulse at the wrist to determine whether blood flow to the hand is normal.  To check whether a nerve is damaged, they ask the person to move the fingers and hand and ask whether the person can feel things with the fingers.  Treatment of Lower Humeral Fractures Consultation with an orthopedic surgeon Usually surgery to realign the broken bones Rarely only a splint An orthopedic surgeon is usually consulted because lower humeral fractures that are close to the elbow often involve nerves or blood vessels and can cause long-term problems.  If the bones have not moved out of alignment, a splint can be used to immobilize the broken bone.  Most people are admitted to the hospital so that doctors can determine whether blood vessels or nerves have been damaged.  However, if people agree to return for another examination the next day, they may be allowed to go home.  Typically, if the broken pieces are separated and/or out of alignment, surgery (open reduction with internal fixation Surgery , or ORIF) is done to realign and immobilize the broken pieces.  Because aligning the broken pieces (reduction) can damage nearby nerves and blood vessels, surgery is usually done by a specialist.  Fractures of Part of the Elbow The pointy bony area of the ulna that projects behind the elbow is called the olecranon (or the olecranon process).  Fractures of the olecranon are usually due to a fall on an outstretched hand or a direct blow to the elbow.  Avulsion fractures of the olecranon (which occurs when a small chunk of bone attached to a tendon or ligament gets pulled away from the main part of the bone) rarely occur when the triceps tendon pulls off a piece of the olecranon.  Symptoms of Olecranon Fractures A fractured olecranon is painful, swollen, and tender.  It may also be deformed.  Elbow extension (straightening the elbow joint) may be limited or impossible.  Because the ulnar nerve is sometimes damaged when the olecranon is fractured, the doctor checks for such damage, which may cause numbness and/or tingling in the little finger and part of the ring finger.  Diagnosis of Olecranon Fractures X-rays Typically, the doctor x-rays the fracture from two different angles to determine the exact location of the fracture.  Treatment of Olecranon Fractures Splinting Sometimes surgery Sometimes antibiotics (for open fractures) Most olecranon fractures are treated with a long arm posterior splint.  Often, the bone fragments can be put back in place (reduced) by manipulation, then held in place by a splint.  However, sometimes surgery is required.  Severely displaced fractures (those with a wide gap between the pieces of bone) and those that are comminuted (fractured in at least two places) usually require surgery to align the pieces of bone, which helps them heal in the correct position.  People with open fractures (where the bone pieces break through the skin) are immediately given antibiotics and need to be seen by an orthopedist.  Fractures of the Upper Forearm fractures can occur in the top (head) of the larger forearm bone (radius), which is part of the elbow joint.  Upper forearm (radial head) fractures usually result from a fall on an outstretched arm.  The elbow is swollen and painful.  Doctors take x-rays from different angles, but these fractures are often hard to see, so diagnosis relies heavily on results of the physical examination.  Most of these fractures can be treated with a sling, but some require surgery.  Range-of-motion exercises are started as soon as possible.  Radial head fractures usually result from a fall on an outstretched arm.  They often occur in active adults.  They are more common among adults than children.  Fractures in the lower end of the forearm bones are considered wrist fractures may involve the lower end of one or both of the forearm bones (radius or ulna) or, less often, a bone in the base of the hand. \n【2】 Symptoms of Upper Forearm Fractures Moving the elbow is painful, and one side of the elbow is tender when touched.  Blood may leak into the elbow joint, causing swelling.  Often, people cannot fully straighten their arm.  Diagnosis of Upper Forearm Fractures A doctor's evaluation X-rays Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.  The injured part hurts  Doctors ask people to describe what happened and what their symptoms are.  To check for radial head fractures, doctors take x-rays from different angles.  But radial head fractures may be hard to see, so diagnosis relies heavily on results of the physical examination.  However, x-rays usually show fluid inside the elbow joint if a fracture is present.  Doctors may insert a needle into the space around the elbow joint and remove fluid (called joint aspiration or arthrocentesis).  With the fluid removed, doctors can sometimes determine whether the elbow's movement is limited because of a fracture or because of pain and muscle spasms.  Doctors also gently try to move the elbow to determine whether ligaments are affected.  Treatment of Upper Forearm Fractures Usually a sling Range-of-motion exercises For severe fractures, surgery Most radial head fractures can be treated with a sling Commonly Used Techniques for Immobilizing a Joint .  If the fracture is severe, surgery is done.  Exercises to move the elbow through its full range of motion are started as soon as people can tolerate them (often after a few days).

The diagnosis is based on symptoms and the results of blood tests to detect levels of characteristic antibodies.  Treatment varies depending on the severity of symptoms and may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or a combination.  Many autoimmune disorders affect connective tissue and a variety of organs. \n【2】 Mixed connective tissue disease is more common among women than men.  Mixed connective tissue disease occurs worldwide and affects people of all ages, often peaking in incidence during adolescence and the 20s.  The cause of mixed connective tissue disease is unknown, but it is an autoimmune disease. \n【3】 In dysphagia, foods and/or liquids do not move normally from the throat (pharynx) to the stomach. \n【4】 Raynaud syndrome may precede other symptoms by many years.  Regardless of how mixed connective tissue disease starts, it tends to worsen, and symptoms spread to several parts of the body.  Lupus Skin and mucous membrane problems Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls. \n【5】 The hair may thin.  Almost everyone with mixed connective tissue disease has aching joints.  About 75% of people develop the swelling and pain typical of arthritis.  Mixed connective tissue disease damages the muscle fibers, so the muscles may feel weak and sore, especially in the shoulders and hips.  Tasks such as lifting the arms above the shoulders, climbing stairs, and getting out of a chair can become very difficult.  The lungs are affected in up to 75% of people with mixed connective tissue disease.  Fluid may collect in or around the lungs.  In some people, abnormal lung function is the most serious problem, causing shortness of breath during exertion.  Interstitial lung diseases Overview of Interstitial Lung Diseases Interstitial lung disease (also called diffuse parenchymal disease) is a term used to describe a number of different disorders that affect the interstitial space. \n【6】 Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (the pulmonary arteries) is abnormally high.  Many disorders can cause pulmonary hypertension. \n【7】 Symptoms of heart failure may include fluid retention, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

Sjögren syndrome is a common autoimmune connective tissue disorder and is characterized by excessive dryness of the eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes. \n【8】 Over time, many people develop symptoms that are more typical of lupus Symptoms Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls. \n【9】 Diagnosis of MCTD Blood tests Sometimes other tests The diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease is based on all of the information doctors gather, including symptoms, physical examination results, and all test results.  Doctors suspect mixed connective tissue disease when symptoms of lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis overlap.  Blood tests are done to detect levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and an antibody to ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which are present in most people who have mixed connective tissue disease.  People who have a high level of these antibodies but who do not have other antibodies present in similar disorders are most likely to have the disease.  Although blood test results can help doctors diagnose the disease, they alone cannot confirm a definite diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease because sometimes the abnormalities they detect are present in healthy people or in people who have other disorders.  To determine whether people have pulmonary hypertension, doctors do pulmonary function testing (PFT) Pulmonary function tests measure the lungs' capacity to hold air, to move air in and out, and to absorb oxygen. \n【10】 It uses no x-rays. \n【11】 If doctors suspect other organs are affected, they may do other tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a muscle biopsy (removal of a piece of muscle tissue for examination and testing), to detect problems.  Prognosis for MCTD Overall, the 10-year survival rate is about 80%, but the prognosis depends largely on a person's symptoms. \n【12】 Causes of death include pulmonary hypertension (mainly), kidney failure, and heart disease.  Treatment of MCTD Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antimalarial drugs, or very low doses of corticosteroids for mild illness Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for moderate to severe illness Other treatments as needed for other symptoms The treatment of mixed connective tissue disease is similar to that of lupus, systemic sclerosis, and autoimmune myositis.  Corticosteroids are usually effective, especially when the disease is diagnosed early.  Mild cases can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antimalarial drugs (such as hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine), or very low doses of corticosteroids.  The more severe the disease, the higher the dose of corticosteroid needed.  In moderate to severe cases, immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil) may also be needed.  People whose major organs are severely affected usually require higher doses of corticosteroids and additional immunosuppressive drugs.  In general, the more advanced the disease and the greater the organ damage, the less effective the treatment.  Systemic sclerosis–like damage to the skin and esophagus is least likely to respond to treatment.  People who develop myositis Autoimmune myositis causes inflammation and weakness in the muscles (polymyositis) or in the skin and muscles (dermatomyositis). \n【13】 People who have Raynaud syndrome are treated based on their symptoms and may be given a calcium channel blocker (such as nifedipine) and drugs that increase blood flow (such as sildenafil or tadalafil).  People who take corticosteroids are at risk of fractures related to osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely. \n【14】 To prevent osteoporosis, these people are given the drugs used to treat osteoporosis, such as bisphosphonates Drugs Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely. \n【15】 People who are receiving immunosuppressants are also given drugs to prevent infections such as by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in people whose immune system is weakened or impaired  and vaccines against common infections such as pneumonia Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). \n【16】 Two types of influenza virus, type A and type B, regularly cause seasonal epidemics of influenza in the United States. \n【17】 COVID-19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \n【18】 Doctors monitor people with mixed connective tissue disease for pulmonary hypertension by doing pulmonary function testing (PFT) Pulmonary function tests measure the lungs' capacity to hold air, to move air in and out, and to absorb oxygen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#3#3#与上下文内容不联接\n无关文本#16#16#与上下文内容不联接", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:22:55"}

Your heart rate is how fast your heart beats.  Your heart should always have a regular, rhythmic beat, like the ticking of a clock.  Your heart has four chambers.  The atria are the two upper chambers.  The ventricles are the two lower chambers.  The atria pump blood into the ventricles.  The ventricles pump blood to your lungs and your body .  Special pacemaker cells in a part of the atria called the SA node (sinoatrial node) send out regular electrical signals to your heart muscle to make it contract.  Your heart's conduction system has tiny strips of tissue sort of like electrical wires.  The conduction system carries the pacemaker signals to the rest of your heart.  The signals must get to all your heart muscle cells at just the right time so your heart gives a good, strong beat that pumps blood properly.  What are premature beats? Premature beats are a type of abnormal heart rhythm Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Your heart is a muscle that pumps blood through your body. \n【1】 They're extra heartbeats caused by an electrical signal in your heart coming too early.  An atrial premature beat is when the early signal comes from your atria.  These premature beats are common in many healthy people.  A ventricular premature beat is when the early signal comes from your ventricles.  You may not have symptoms, or you may feel changes to your heartbeat  You may not need treatment, but sometimes doctors prescribe medicines to control your heart rate What causes premature beats? Atrial premature beats are common, especially among people who have lung disorders ,such as COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) COPD is a disease in your lungs that makes it hard to breathe.

Premature beats don't usually cause symptoms.  Some people can feel the extra heartbeats (palpitations).  If you have a lot of premature ventricular beats when you exercise, you may feel weak or unable to exert yourself as much as normal.  How can doctors tell if I have premature beats? Doctors feel your pulse and do: An electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity.  It's quick, painless, and harmless.  The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram. \n【5】 How do doctors treat premature beats? Usually no treatment is needed, other than avoiding: Physical or emotional stress Coffee, tea, or alcohol Some cold, allergy, and asthma medicines If you have many atrial premature beats that are very uncomfortable, doctors may give you medicines to make your heart beat in a normal rhythm.  If you have ventricular premature beats and recently had a heart attack or have heart failure that causes symptoms, doctors may prescribe medicine called beta-blockers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:00:07"}

Acidemia is serum pH < 7. 35.  Alkalemia is serum pH > 7. 45.  Acidosis refers to physiologic processes that cause acid accumulation or alkali loss.  Actual changes in pH depend on the degree of physiologic compensation and whether multiple processes are present. \n【1】 Causes are Increased acid production Acid ingestion Decreased renal acid excretion Gastrointestinal or renal HCO3− loss Metabolic alkalosis is primary increase in bicarbonate (HCO3−) with or without compensatory increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be high or nearly normal. \n【2】 Cause is Decrease in minute ventilation (hypoventilation) Respiratory alkalosis is a primary decrease in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2) with or without compensatory decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3−); pH may be high or near normal. \n【3】 Cause is Increase in minute ventilation (hyperventilation) Compensatory mechanisms begin to correct the pH whenever an acid-base disorder is present.  Compensation cannot return pH completely to normal and never overshoots.  A simple acid-base disorder is a single acid-base disturbance with its accompanying compensatory response.  Mixed (sometimes called complex) acid-base disorders comprise ≥ 2 primary disturbances.  Pearls & Pitfalls Compensatory mechanisms for acid-base disturbances cannot return pH completely to normal and never overshoot.   Symptoms and Signs Compensated or mild acid-base disorders cause few symptoms or signs.  Severe, uncompensated disorders have multiple cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, and metabolic consequences  Diagnosis Arterial blood gases (ABG) Serum electrolytes Anion gap calculated If metabolic acidosis is present, delta gap calculated and Winters formula applied Search for compensatory changes Evaluation is with ABG and serum electrolytes.  The ABG directly measures arterial pH and Pco2.  HCO3− level reported on the arterial blood gas panel is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.  The HCO3− level on serum chemistry panel is directly measured.  Directly measured HCO3− levels are considered more accurate in cases of discrepancy.  Acid-base balance is most accurately assessed with measurement of pH and Pco2 in an arterial blood sample.  In cases of circulatory failure or during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, measurements from a sample of venous blood may more accurately reflect conditions at the tissue level and may be a more useful guide to bicarbonate administration and adequacy of ventilation.  The pH establishes the primary process (acidosis or alkalosis), although pH moves toward the normal range with compensation.  Changes in Pco2 reflect the respiratory component, and changes in HCO3− reflect the metabolic component.  Complex or mixed acid-base disturbances involve more than one primary process.  In these mixed disorders, values may be deceptively normal.  Thus, when evaluating acid-base disorders, it is important to determine whether changes in Pco2 and HCO3− show the expected compensation If not, then a second primary process should be suspected of causing the abnormal compensation.  Interpretation must also consider clinical conditions (eg, chronic lung disease, renal failure, drug overdose).  The anion gap Calculation of the anion gap Acid-base disorders are pathologic changes in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2) or serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) that typically produce abnormal arterial pH values. \n【4】 A normal anion gap with a low HCO3− (eg, < 24 mEq/L [< 24 mmol/L]) and high serum chloride (Cl−) indicates a non-anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis.  If metabolic acidosis is present, a delta gap is calculated to identify concomitant metabolic alkalosis, and Winters formula is applied to determine whether respiratory compensation is appropriate or reflects a second acid-base disorder (predicted Pco2 = 1. 5 [HCO3−] + 8 ± 2; if Pco2 is higher, there is also a primary respiratory acidosis—if lower, respiratory alkalosis). \n【5】 Greater increase in HCO3− implies a primary metabolic alkalosis; lesser increase suggests no time for compensation or coexisting primary metabolic acidosis.  Metabolic alkalosis is primary increase in bicarbonate (HCO3−) with or without compensatory increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be high or nearly normal. \n【6】 The Pco2 should compensate by increasing about 0. 6 to 0. 75 mm Hg for each 1 mEq/L (1 mmol/L) increase in HCO3− (up to about 55 mm Hg).  Greater increase implies concomitant respiratory acidosis; lesser increase, respiratory alkalosis.  Respiratory alkalosis is a primary decrease in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2) with or without compensatory decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3−); pH may be high or near normal. \n【7】 The HCO3− should compensate over 4 to 12 hours by decreasing 4 to 5 mEq/L (4 to 5 mmol/L) for every 10 mm Hg decrease in Pco2.  Lesser decrease means there has been no time for compensation or a primary metabolic alkalosis coexists.  Greater decrease implies a primary metabolic acidosis.  Nomograms (acid-base maps) are an alternative way to diagnose mixed disorders, allowing for simultaneous plotting of pH, HCO3−, and Pco2.  Equations for Calculating Acid-Base Balance Clinical Calculator Calculation of the anion gap is defined as serum sodium (Na) concentration minus the sum of serum chloride (Cl−) and serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) concentrations.  Na+− (Cl−+ HCO3−) The term “gap” is misleading, because the law of electroneutrality requires the same number of positive and negative charges in an open system; the gap appears on laboratory testing because certain cations (+) and anions (−) are not measured on routine laboratory chemistry panels.  Thus, Na++ unmeasured cations (UC) = Cl− + HCO3−+ unmeasured anions (UA) and the anion gap, Na+ − (Cl−+ HCO3−) = UA − UC The predominant \"unmeasured\" anions are phosphate (PO43−), sulfate (SO4−), various negatively charged proteins, and some organic acids, accounting for 20 to 24 mEq/L (20 to 24 mmol/L).  The predominant \"unmeasured\" extracellular cations are potassium (K+), calcium (Ca++), and magnesium (Mg++) and account for about 11 mEq/L (5. 5 mmol/L).  Thus, the typical anion gap is 23 − 11 = 12 mEq/L (12 mmol/L).  The anion gap can be affected by increases or decreases in the UC or UA. \n【8】 Decreased anion gap is unrelated to metabolic acidosis but is caused by hypoalbuminemia (decreased anions); hypercalcemia is a total serum calcium concentration > 10. 4 mg/dL (> 2. 60 mmol/L) or ionized serum calcium > 5. 2 mg/dL (> 1. 30 mmol/L). \n【9】 The major cause is renal failure. \n【10】 The effect of low albumin can be accounted for by adjusting the normal range for the anion gap 2. 5 mEq/L (2. 5 mmol/L) downward for every 1g/dL (10 g/L) fall in albumin. \n【11】 The delta gap: The difference between the patient’s anion gap and the normal anion gap is termed the delta gap.  This amount is considered an HCO3− equivalent, because for every unit rise in the anion gap, the HCO3− should lower by 1 (by buffering).  Thus, if the delta gap is added to the measured HCO3−, the result should be in the normal range for HCO3−; elevation indicates the additional presence of a metabolic alkalosis is primary increase in bicarbonate (HCO3−) with or without compensatory increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be high or nearly normal. \n【12】 Example: A vomiting, ill-appearing patient with alcohol use disorder has laboratory results showing Na: 137 K: 3. 8 Cl: 90 HCO3−: 22 pH: 7. 40 Pco2: 41 Po2: 85 At first glance, results appear unremarkable.  However, calculations show elevation of the anion gap: 137 − (90 + 22) = 25 (normal, 10 to 12) indicating a metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory compensation is evaluated by Winters formula: Predicted Pco2= 1. 5 (22) + 8 ± 2 = 41 ± 2 Predicted = measured, so respiratory compensation is appropriate.  Because there is metabolic acidosis, the delta gap is calculated, and the result is added to measured HCO3−: 25 − 10 = 15 15 + 22 = 37 The resulting corrected HCO3− is above the normal range for HCO3−, indicating a primary metabolic alkalosis is also present.  Thus, the patient has a mixed acid-base disorder.  Using clinical information, one could theorize a metabolic acidosis arising from alcoholic ketoacidosis combined with a metabolic alkalosis from recurrent vomiting with loss of acid (HCl) and volume.  Key Points Acidosis and alkalosis refer to physiologic processes that cause accumulation or loss of acid and/or alkali; blood pH may or may not be abnormal.  Acidemia and alkalemia refer to an abnormally acidic (pH < 7. 35) or alkalotic (pH > 7. 45) serum pH.  Acid-base disorders are classified as metabolic if the change in pH is primarily due to an alteration in serum bicarbonate (HCO3−) and respiratory if the change is primarily due to a change in Pco2 (increase or decrease in ventilation).  The pH establishes the primary process (acidosis or alkalosis), changes in Pco2 reflect the respiratory component, and changes in HCO3− reflect the metabolic component.  All acid-base disturbances result in compensation that tends to normalize the pH.  Metabolic acid-base disorders result in respiratory compensation (change in Pco2); respiratory acid-base disorders result in metabolic compensation (change in HCO3− ).  More than one primary acid-base disorder may be present simultaneously.  It is important to identify and address each primary acid-base disorder.  Initial laboratory evaluation of acid-base disorders includes measurement of arterial blood gases and serum electrolytes and calculation of the anion gap.  Use one of several formulas, rules-of-thumb, or an acid-base nomogram to determine if laboratory values are consistent with a single acid-base disorder (and compensation) or if a second primary acid-base disorder is also present.

When symptoms of H.  pylori infection do occur, they include indigestion and pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen.  Doctors often base the diagnosis on the results of a breath test and an examination of the stomach using a flexible viewing tube (upper endoscopy).  Treatment is with antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor.  These disorders are usually caused by Stomach acid  Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the most common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease worldwide.  Infection is very common and increases with age.  By age 60, about 50% of people in the United States are infected.  However, recent studies show fewer young people are becoming infected with H.  Infection is most common among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.  H.  pylori infects the lining of the stomach and can also be found in stool, saliva, and plaque on the teeth.  pylori can be transmitted from person to person, especially if people who are infected do not thoroughly wash their hands after a bowel movement.  Because people may also spread the bacteria through kissing or other close contact, infections tend to cluster in families and among people who live in nursing homes and other supervised facilities.  rtain bacteria, called Helicobacter pylori, are the most common cause of gastritis and peptic ulcers.  pylori bacteria grow in the protective mucus layer of the stomach lining, where they are less exposed to the highly acidic juices produced by the stomach.  Additionally, H.  pylori produces ammonia, which helps protect it from stomach acid and enables it to disrupt and penetrate the mucus layer.  Complications of H.  pylori infection Virtually all people who have H.  pylori infection have stomach inflammation , which may affect the entire stomach or only the lower part (antrum).  Infection can sometimes lead to erosive gastritis and perhaps even a stomach (gastric) ulcer Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices.  pylori contributes to ulcer formation by increasing acid production, interfering with the stomach's normal defenses against stomach acid, and producing toxins.

People may also describe the sensation as gassiness, a sense of fullness, or gnawing or burning. \n【4】 Ulcers caused by H.  pylori infection cause symptoms similar to ulcers caused by other disorders, including pain in the upper abdomen.

Sometimes doctors use a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) to do an upper endoscopy is an examination of internal structures using a flexible viewing tube (endoscope). \n【5】 The sample can be tested for H.  pylori by several methods.  Prognosis The likelihood that a peptic ulcer caused by H.  pylori infection will return during the course of 3 years is greater than 50% in people who have not been treated with antibiotics.

Plain X-Rays Without Contrast Abdominal x-rays without radiopaque contrast agents may be done to check for positioning of ureteral stents or to monitor position and growth of kidney stones.  However, for initial diagnosis of urolithiasis Urinary Calculi are solid particles in the urinary system.  They may cause pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, and, possibly, chills and fever due to secondary infection. \n【1】 X-Rays With Use of Contrast Images taken after administration of water-soluble contrast agents highlight the kidneys and urinary collecting system.  Nonionic iso-osmolal agents (eg, iohexol, iopamidol) are now widely used; they have fewer adverse effects than older hyperosmolal agents but still pose a risk of acute kidney injury .  In urography, an x-ray is taken after IV, percutaneous antegrade or retrograde, or cystoscopic retrograde administration of a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity.  Most contrast agents are iodine based. \n【2】 Primary contraindications for all patients are iodine allergy and risk factors for contrast nephropathy.  IV urography (IVU) IVU (sometimes called IVP, for intravenous pyelography) has been largely superseded by rapid multidimensional CT and MRI with or without a contrast agent.  When IVU is done, abdominal compression may improve visualization of the renal pelvis and proximal ureters (with application) and distal ureters (after release).  Additional x-rays at 12 and 24 hours after contrast administration may be indicated for detection of postrenal obstruction or hydronephrosis.  Percutaneous antegrade urography For percutaneous antegrade urography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【3】 Occasionally, a ureterostomy or an ileal conduit can be used.

This technique can be used when CT and MRI with IV contrast agents are contraindicated  or unavailable or when results are equivocal (eg, in renal insufficiency).  It is also useful for detailed examination of the pelvicaliceal collecting system and ureters to check for injury, stricture, or fistula.  Overdistention and backflow from a kidney into the venous system may distort calyces and obscure details.  Risk of infection is higher than that with other types of urography.  Acute ureteral edema and secondary stricture formation are rare complications.

Adverse effects include UTIs and urosepsis.  Angiography Conventional catheter angiography has been largely replaced by noninvasive vascular imaging (eg, magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning).  Remaining indications include renal vein renin imaging and, among patients with renal artery stenosis, angioplasty and stent placement.  Arteriography is also rarely used for evaluation and treatment of renal hemorrhage and before kidney-sparing surgery.  Digital subtraction angiography is no longer used when rapid-sequence multidimensional CT or helical (spiral) CT is available.  Ultrasonography can provide useful images of many genitourinary structures without exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Images are interpreted as they are acquired, so the technician can focus on concerning areas and obtain additional information if necessary.  Its main disadvantages are the need for a skilled operator and the time required.  A full bladder helps provide better images of certain structures but no other preparation is needed.  Structures that can be imaged and common indications include the following: Kidneys: For hydronephrosis, stones Urinary Calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. \n【9】 Conventional or helical scanners are used for most purposes with or without IV contrast agents Radiographic Contrast Agents and Contrast Reactions Radiopaque contrast agents are often used in radiography and fluoroscopy to help delineate borders between tissues with similar radiodensity. \n【10】 Use of contrast agents with either technique resembles IV urography (IVU) but provides additional detail.  Previously, in trauma patients, there was concern that use of contrast would make it difficult to distinguish abdominal hemorrhage from urinary tract disruption, but with modern imaging techniques and protocols, this distinction can be made.  Helical CT without a contrast agent is the study of choice for imaging of calculi; dual-energy scanners may provide additional information that can help determine stone composition.  The main disadvantage of CT is that it exposes patients to a relatively large dose of ionizing radiation.  CT angiography CT shows a focal area of osteolysis (arrows) involving the right acetabulum that is consistent with particle disease. \n【11】 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Compared with CT, MRI is safer for patients at risk of contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary. \n【12】 Magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated in patients with ferromagnetic metal (ie, containing iron) implants and magnetically activated or electronically controlled devices (eg, cardiac pacemakers).  See also the MRI safety web site.  Also, due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, MRI with gadolinium contrast is contraindicated in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min.  Urologic application of MRI includes the evaluation of renal cysts and small renal masses.  MRI is also helpful in imaging blood vessels , and its use is increasing as MRI becomes more widely available.  Multiparametric MRI is now the imaging study of choice for staging prostate cancer is usually adenocarcinoma.  Symptoms are typically absent until tumor growth causes hematuria and/or obstruction with pain. \n【13】 A multiparametric MRI examination includes paramagnetic contrast and consists of 3 separate imaging techniques (parameters): T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.  A technique known as MRI fusion biopsy is sometimes used during a prostate biopsy of the urinary tract requires a trained specialist (nephrologist, urologist, or interventional radiologist). \n【14】 An MRI of the prostate is obtained prior to ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, during which the MRI image is digitally combined (fused) with the ultrasound image to better identify lesions that need to be biopsied.  Radionuclide Scanning Cortical tracers that bind to proximal tubular cells (eg, technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid [99mTc DMSA]) are used to image the renal parenchyma.  Excretory tracers that are rapidly filtered and excreted into urine (eg, iodine-125 iothalmate, 99mTc diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA], 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine-3 [MAG3]) are used to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and overall renal perfusion.  Radionuclide scanning can be used to evaluate renal function.  It also has the benefit of not requiring IV contrast and may be used safely in patients at risk for contrast nephropathy is worsening of renal function after IV administration of radiocontrast and is usually temporary. \n【15】 Radionuclide scanning also provides more information than does IV urography or cross-sectional imaging about the following: Segmental renal emboli Renal parenchymal scarring due to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and sometimes also into the renal collecting system, depending on severity. \n【16】 Scrotal pain and swelling usually occur unilaterally. \n【17】 No patient preparation is necessary for radionuclide scanning, but patients should be asked about known allergies to the tracer.  Newly available nuclear positron emission tomographic (PET) agents can detect metastatic prostate cancer.  Routine FDG PET scans are not very useful for most cases of prostate cancer but can be useful for other genitourinary tumors such as kidney or testicular cancer.  Newer PET imaging includes targeting PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) on the surface of prostate cancer cells.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:35:06"}

Bacteremia may result from ordinary activities (such as vigorous toothbrushing), dental or medical procedures, or from infections ,such as pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.  Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【1】 Having an artificial joint or heart valve or having heart valve abnormalities increases the risk that bacteremia will persist or cause problems.  Bacteremia usually causes no symptoms, but sometimes bacteria accumulate in certain tissues or organs and cause serious infections.  People at high risk of complications from bacteremia are given antibiotics before certain dental and medical procedures. \n【2】 Usually, bacteremia, particularly if it occurs during ordinary activities, does not cause infections because bacteria typically are present only in small numbers and are rapidly removed from the bloodstream by the immune system.  However, if bacteria are present long enough and in large enough numbers, particularly in people who have a weakened immune system, bacteremia can lead to other infections and sometimes trigger a serious bodywide response called sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body. \n【3】 Bacteria that are not removed by the immune system may accumulate in various places throughout the body, causing infections there, as in the following: Tissues that cover the brain (meningitis ) The sac around the heart  The cells lining the heart valves (endocarditis ) Bones  Joints  In bacteremia, bacteria tend to lodge and collect on certain body structures, such as abnormal heart valves.  Bacteria are particularly likely to collect on any artificial material present in the body, such as intravenous catheters and artificial (prosthetic) joints and heart valves.  These collections (colonies) of bacteria may remain attached to the sites and continuously or periodically release bacteria into the bloodstream.  Causes of Bacteremia may occur during Certain ordinary activities Dental or medical procedures Certain bacterial infections Injection of recreational drugs Ordinary activities sometimes cause bacteremia in healthy people.  For example, vigorous toothbrushing can cause bacteremia because bacteria living on the gums around the teeth are forced into the bloodstream.  Bacteria may also enter the bloodstream from the intestine during digestion.  Bacteremia that occurs during ordinary activities rarely leads to infections.  Dental or medical procedures can lead to bacteremia.  During dental procedures (as during tooth cleaning by a dental hygienist), bacteria living on the gums may become dislodged and enter the bloodstream.  Bacteremia may also occur when catheters are inserted into the bladder or tubes are inserted into the digestive tract or urinary tract.  Bacteria may be present in the area where the catheter or tube has been inserted (such as the bladder or intestine).  So even though sterile techniques are used, these procedures may move bacteria into the bloodstream.  Surgical treatment of infected wounds, abscesses (collections of pus), and pressure sores can dislodge bacteria from the infected site, causing bacteremia.  In some bacterial infections, such as pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them. \n【4】 Many common childhood bacterial infections cause bacteremia.  Injecting recreational drugs can cause bacteremia because the needles used are usually contaminated with bacteria, and people may not properly cleanse their skin.  Symptoms of Bacteremia Usually, bacteremia that results from ordinary events, such as dental procedures, is temporary and causes no symptoms.  Bacteremia that results from other conditions may cause fever.  If people with bacteremia have fever, a rapid heart rate, shaking chills, low blood pressure, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), rapid breathing, and/or become confused, they probably have sepsis or septic shock Sepsis and Septic Shock Sepsis is a serious bodywide response to bacteremia or another infection plus malfunction or failure of an essential system in the body. \n【5】 Diagnosis of Bacteremia Culture of a blood sample If bacteremia, sepsis, or septic shock is suspected, doctors usually take a sample of blood so they can try to grow  the bacteria in the laboratory and identify it.  If needed, doctors may try to culture bacteria from other samples (such as urine or sputum).  Prevention of Bacteremia People who are at high risk of complications due to bacteremia (such as those who have an artificial heart valve or joint or certain heart valve abnormalities) are often given antibiotics before procedures that can cause bacteremia: Dental procedures Surgical treatment of infected wounds Antibiotics help prevent bacteremia and thus infections and sepsis from developing.

Usually, bacteria are the cause of cystitis.  A frequent need to urinate and pain or burning while urinating are the most common symptoms.  Doctors can often base the diagnosis on the symptoms, but they usually examine a urine specimen.  Drugs are needed to treat the infection and often the symptoms. \n【1】 Causes of Bladder Infection in women Cystitis is common among women, particularly during the reproductive years.  Some women have recurring episodes of cystitis.  There are a number of reasons why women are susceptible, including the short length of the urethra and the closeness of the urethra to the vagina and anus, where bacteria are commonly found.  Sexual intercourse can contribute, too, because the motion can cause a tendency for bacteria to reach the urethra, from which they ascend to the bladder.  Pregnant women are especially likely to develop cystitis because the pregnancy itself can interfere with emptying of the bladder.  Use of a diaphragm Barrier contraceptives physically block the sperm’s access to a woman’s uterus. \n【2】 Having sex with a man who uses a condom coated with spermicide also increases the risk.  The decrease in estrogen production that occurs after menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【3】 In addition, a drooping (prolapsed) uterus or bladder may cause poor emptying of the bladder and predispose to cystitis. \n【4】 Rarely, cystitis recurs because of an abnormal connection between the bladder and the vagina (vesicovaginal fistula).  Cystitis is less common among men.  In men, a common cause is bacterial infection of the prostate Prostatitis is pain and swelling, inflammation, or both of the prostate gland.  The cause is sometimes a bacterial infection. \n【5】 Urethritis is infection of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the body. \n【6】 Usually antibiotics must be taken for weeks at a time.  Consequently, if drug therapy is stopped prematurely, bacteria that remain in the prostate tend to reinfect the bladder.  Causes of bladder infection in both sexes If the flow of urine becomes partly blocked (obstructed) because of a stone in the bladder or urethra, Stones in the Urinary Tract Stones (calculi) are hard masses that form in the urinary tract and may cause pain, bleeding, or an infection or block of the flow of urine. \n【7】 The prostate gland enlarges as men age. \n【8】 Bacteria that are left in the bladder after urinating can multiply rapidly.  People with long-standing or repeated obstruction of urine flow may develop a bladder outpouching (diverticulum).  This pocket retains urine after urinating, further increasing the risk of infection.  Cystitis can also be caused by a catheter or any instrument inserted into the urinary tract that introduces bacteria into the bladder.  Sometimes the bladder can become inflamed without an infection being present, a disorder called interstitial cystitis.  Interstitial Cystitis is noninfectious bladder inflammation. \n【9】 These symptoms usually develop over several hours or a day.  The urgent need to urinate may cause an uncontrollable loss of urine , especially in older people.  Fever is rarely present.  Pain is usually felt above the pubic bone and often in the lower back as well.  Frequent urination during the night (nocturia) may be another symptom.  The urine may be cloudy in severe infection.  Uncommonly, when infection results from an abnormal connection between the bladder and the intestine or the vagina (fistula), air can be passed in the urine (pneumaturia).  Sometimes cystitis causes no symptoms, particularly in older people, and is discovered when urine tests are done for other reasons.  Among older people, cystitis may also cause no symptoms related to urinating and may cause symptoms such as fever or confusion.  A person whose bladder is malfunctioning because of nerve damage  or a person who has a catheter may have cystitis with no symptoms until a kidney infection Pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of one or both kidneys. \n【10】 Diagnosis of Bladder Infection Urinalysis Urine culture Doctors can usually diagnose cystitis based on its typical symptoms.  A midstream (clean-catch) urine specimen Obtaining a Clean-Catch Urine Sample is collected so that the urine is not contaminated with bacteria from the vagina or the tip of the penis.  A strip of test paper is sometimes dipped into the urine to do two quick and simple tests for substances that are normally not found in the urine.  The testing strip can detect nitrites that are released by bacteria.  The testing strip can also detect leukocyte esterase (an enzyme found in certain white blood cells), which may indicate that the body is trying to clear the urine of bacteria.  In adult women, these may be the only tests necessary.  In addition, the urine specimen can be examined under a microscope to see the number of red and white blood cells and whether it contains bacteria.  Sometimes, urine cultures, in which bacteria from a urine sample are grown in a laboratory, are done to identify the numbers and type of bacteria.  If the person has an infection, one type of bacteria is usually present in large numbers.  In men, a midstream urine specimen is usually sufficient for a urine culture.  In women, a specimen is more likely to be contaminated with bacteria from the vagina or vulva.  When the urine contains only small numbers of bacteria, or several different types of bacteria simultaneously, the urine has likely been contaminated during the collection process.  To ensure that the urine is not contaminated, doctors sometimes must obtain a specimen directly from the bladder with a catheter.  Finding the cause of cystitis It is important for doctors to find the cause of cystitis in several different groups.  The cause should be found in Children Men of any age People who have fevers for at least three days or evidence of kidney damage Some women with frequently recurring infections (three or more per year), especially when accompanied by symptoms of urinary obstruction Urinary Tract obstruction is a blockage that inhibits the flow of urine through its normal path (the urinary tract), including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. \n【11】 Doctors may do an imaging study, usually Ultrasonography Computed tomography (CT) Sometimes, instead of ultrasonography or CT, doctors do an intravenous urogram Intravenous urography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder. \n【12】 Imaging Tests of the Urinary Tract There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder. \n【13】 Voiding cystourethrography, Cystography and cystourethrography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder. \n【14】 Retrograde urethrography, Retrograde urethrography There are a variety of tests that can be used in the evaluation of a suspected kidney or urinary tract disorder. \n【15】 Looking directly into the bladder with a flexible viewing tube (cystoscopy) may help diagnose the problem when cystitis does not resolve with treatment.  Doctors also try to find a cause in men who have cystitis.  Prostatitis, Prostatitis is pain and swelling, inflammation, or both of the prostate gland. \n【16】 In women who have recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), doctors do a pelvic examination to detect manageable conditions like vaginal atrophy Symptoms Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【17】 Men with recurrent UTI should be evaluated for prostatitis is pain and swelling, inflammation, or both of the prostate gland. \n【18】 People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence. \n【19】 Prevention of Bladder Infection If women tend to develop bladder infections after sexual intercourse, they may be advised to take an antibiotic dose immediately after intercourse.  Spermicides and diaphragm use should be avoided, and women should urinate as soon as possible after sexual intercourse.  People who have frequent bladder infections may continually take low doses of antibiotics.  Women who take antibiotics regularly to prevent bladder infections may need to discuss contraceptive options with their doctor.  Postmenopausal women with frequent bladder infections and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause may benefit from estrogen creams applied to the vulva or estrogen suppositories inserted into the vagina.  Drinking plenty of fluids may help prevent cystitis.  The flushing action of the urine washes many bacteria out of the bladder.  The body's natural defenses eliminate the remainder of the bacteria.  It is commonly believed that wiping from front to back, and avoiding the use of tight, nonporous underwear helps women prevent bladder infections.  ere is no convincing evidence that cranberry juice helps prevent infections.  Treatment of Bladder Infection Antibiotics Analgesics as needed Sometimes surgery Cystitis is usually treated with antibiotics.  Before prescribing antibiotics, the doctor determines whether the person has a condition that would make cystitis more severe, such as diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【20】 Such conditions may require more potent antibiotics taken for a longer period of time, particularly because the infection is likely to return as soon as the person stops taking antibiotics.  People with such conditions may also have infections caused by fungi or unusual bacteria and may thus require something other than the most commonly used antibiotics.  For women, taking an antibiotic by mouth for 3 days is usually effective if the infection has not led to any complications, although some doctors prefer to give a single dose.  For more stubborn infections, an antibiotic is usually taken for 7 to 10 days.  For men, cystitis usually is caused by prostatitis is pain and swelling, inflammation, or both of the prostate gland. \n【21】 A variety of drugs can relieve symptoms, especially the frequent, insistent urge to urinate and painful urination.  Phenazopyridine may help reduce the pain by soothing the inflamed tissues and can be taken for a couple of days, until antibiotics control the infection.  Surgery may be necessary to relieve any physical obstruction to the flow of urine or to correct a structural abnormality that makes infection more likely, such as a drooping uterus or bladder.  Until surgery can occur, draining urine from an obstructed area through a catheter helps control the infection.  Usually, an antibiotic is given before surgery to reduce the risk of the infection spreading throughout the body.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:21:36"}

The cause is not known.  It frequently occurs with underlying cancer, especially hematologic cancers.  Diagnosis is usually with skin biopsy.  Treatment is systemic corticosteroids or, alternatively, colchicine or potassium iodide.  Etiology Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis may occur with various disorders. \n【1】 The dermatosis often precedes the cancer diagnosis.  Classical acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis affects mostly women ages 30 to 50, with a female:male ratio of 3:1.  In contrast, men who develop the condition tend to be older (60 to 90).  In children under age 3, the ratio is male:female 2:1.  The cause of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is unknown; however, type 1 helper T-cell cytokines, including interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, are predominant and may play a role in lesion formation.  Symptoms and Signs Patients are febrile, with an elevated neutrophil count, and have painful, tender, and edematous red to violet plaques or papules, most often on the face, neck, and upper extremities, especially the dorsum of hands.  Oral lesions can also occur.  The lesions often develop in crops and may appear annular.  Each crop is usually preceded by fever and persists for days to weeks.  Rarely, bullous and pustular lesions are present as well.  Less common variants include a bullous form that can ulcerate and resemble pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, neutrophilic, progressive skin necrosis of unknown etiology often associated with systemic illness and sometimes skin injury.  Diagnosis is clinical. \n【2】 When on the lower extremities, this form can resemble erythema nodosum is a specific form of panniculitis characterized by tender, red or violet, palpable, subcutaneous nodules on the shins and occasionally other locations. \n【3】 Extracutaneous manifestations are rare and can involve the eyes , joints (eg, arthralgia, myalgia, arthritis), and internal organs (eg, neutrophilic alveolitis; sterile osteomyelitis; psychiatric or neurologic changes; transient kidney, liver, and pancreatic insufficiency).  Diagnosis Clinical evaluation Skin biopsy Diagnosis of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is suggested by the appearance of the lesions and is supported by the presence of associated conditions or drugs.  Differential diagnosis can include erythema multiforme is an inflammatory reaction, characterized by target or iris skin lesions.  Oral mucosa may be involved. \n【4】 If the diagnosis is unclear, skin biopsy Diagnostic tests are indicated when the cause of a skin lesion or disease is not obvious from history and physical examination alone. \n【5】 The histopathologic pattern is that of edema in the upper dermis with a dense infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis.  Vasculitis may be present but is secondary.  A complete blood count (CBC) is also done.  If the CBC is abnormal, bone marrow biopsy should be considered to diagnose occult cancer.  Treatment Systemic corticosteroids Treatment of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis involves systemic corticosteroids, chiefly prednisone 0. 5 to 1. 5 mg/kg orally once a day tapered over 3 weeks.  Colchicine 0. 5 mg orally 3 times a day or potassium iodide 300 mg orally 3 times a day are alternative treatments.  Antipyretics are also recommended.  In difficult cases, dapsone 100 to 200 mg orally once a day, indomethacin 150 mg orally once a day for 1 week and 100 mg orally once a day for 2 additional weeks, clofazimine (eg, 200 mg orally once a day for 4 weeks then 100 mg/day for 4 weeks), or cyclosporine (eg, 2 to 4 mg/kg orally 2 times a day) can be given.  Other treatments used for refractory disease include infliximab, etanercept, thalidomide, minocycline, and mycophenolate mofetil.  For localized involvement, intralesional corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone acetonide) may help.  Key Points Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis can occur in patients who have certain disorders (classical form) or take certain drugs (drug-induced form), but about 25% of patients have an underlying cancer (cancer-associated form), usually a hematologic cancer.

Sets of 4 enzymes (an acyl dehydrogenase, a hydratase, a hydroxyacyl dehydrogenase, and a lyase) specific for different chain lengths (very long chain, long chain, medium chain, and short chain) are required to catabolize fatty acids completely.  Inheritance for all fatty acid oxidation defects is autosomal recessive Genetic disorders determined by a single gene (Mendelian disorders) are easiest to analyze and the most well understood. \n【2】 Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) This deficiency is the most common defect in the beta-oxidation cycle.  Clinical manifestations typically begin after 2 to 3 months of age and usually follow fasting (as little as 12 hours).  Patients have vomiting and lethargy that may progress rapidly to seizures, coma, and sometimes death (which can also appear as sudden infant death syndrome).  During attacks, patients have hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and unexpectedly low urinary and serum ketones.  Metabolic acidosis is often present but may be a late manifestation.  Diagnosis of MCADD is by detecting medium-chain fatty acid conjugates of carnitine in plasma or glycine in urine or by detecting enzyme deficiency in cultured fibroblasts; however, DNA testing can confirm most cases.  MCADD is now included in routine neonatal screening Tests for Newborns Screening recommendations for newborns vary by clinical context and state requirements. \n【3】 Treatment of acute attacks is with 10% dextrose IV at 1. 5 times the fluid maintenance rate ; some clinicians also advocate carnitine supplementation during acute episodes.  Prevention is a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet and avoidance of prolonged fasting.  Cornstarch therapy is often used to provide a margin of safety during overnight fasting.  Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD) This deficiency is the 2nd most common fatty acid oxidation defect.  It shares many features of MCADD, but patients may also have cardiomyopathy; rhabdomyolysis, massive creatine kinase elevations, and myoglobinuria with muscle exertion; peripheral neuropathy; and abnormal liver function.  Mothers with an LCHADD fetus often have HELLP syndrome Diagnosis Preeclampsia is new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation.  Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. \n【4】 Diagnosis of LCHADD is based on the presence of excess long-chain hydroxy acids on organic acid analysis and on the presence of their carnitine conjugates in an acylcarnitine profile or glycine conjugates in an acylglycine profile.  LCHADD can be confirmed by enzyme study in skin fibroblasts or by genetic testing. \n【5】 Treatment during acute exacerbations includes hydration, high-dose glucose, bed rest, urine alkalinization, and carnitine supplementation.  Long-term treatment includes a high-carbohydrate diet, medium-chain triglyceride supplementation, and avoidance of fasting and strenuous exercise.  Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) This deficiency is similar to LCHADD but is commonly associated with significant cardiomyopathy.  Glutaric acidemia type II A defect in the transfer of electrons from the coenzyme of fatty acyl dehydrogenases to the electronic transport chain affects reactions involving fatty acids of all chain lengths (multiple acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency); oxidation of several amino acids is also affected.  Clinical manifestations thus include fasting hypoglycemia, severe metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia.  Diagnosis of glutaric acidemia type II is by increased ethylmalonic, glutaric, 2- and 3-hydroxyglutaric, and other dicarboxylic acids in organic acid analysis, and glutaryl and isovaleryl and other acylcarnitines in tandem mass spectrometry studies.  DNA analysis can be confirmatory.  Treatment of glutaric acidemia type II is similar to that for MCADD, except that riboflavin may be effective in some patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 17:49:22"}

This condition can result in discomfort, interfere with speech and swallowing, make wearing dentures difficult, cause halitosis is a frequent or persistent unpleasant breath odor. \n【1】 Long-standing xerostomia can result in severe tooth decay Caries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities.  The symptoms—tender, painful teeth—appear late. \n【2】 Xerostomia is a common complaint among older adults, affecting about 20% of them.   Pathophysiology of Xerostomia Stimulation of the oral mucosa signals the salivatory nuclei in the medulla, triggering an efferent response.  The efferent nerve impulses release acetylcholine at salivary gland nerve terminals, activating muscarinic receptors (M3), which increase saliva production and flow.  Medullary signals responsible for salivation may also be modulated by cortical inputs from other stimuli (eg, taste, smell, anxiety).  Etiology of Xerostomia is usually caused by the following: Drugs Radiation to the head and neck (for cancer treatment) Systemic disorders are less commonly the cause, but xerostomia is common in Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【3】 Drugs are the most common cause ; about 400 prescription drugs and many over-the-counter (OTC) drugs cause decreased salivation.  The most common include the following: Anticholinergics Antiparkinsonian drugs Some drug categories (eg, analgesics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian drugs, diuretics, hypoglycemic drugs, psychoactive drugs) pose special risks for older adults. \n【4】 They are invariably painful. \n【5】 The damage is exacerbated by the bruxing Bruxism is clenching or grinding of teeth.  Bruxism can occur during sleep (sleep bruxism) and while awake (awake bruxism). \n【6】 This combination causes very rapid destruction of teeth.  Tobacco use is a major individual and public health problem.  Dependence develops rapidly. \n【7】 Radiation Incidental radiation to the salivary glands during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer often causes severe xerostomia (5200 cGy causes severe, permanent dryness, but even low doses can cause temporary drying).  Evaluation of Xerostomia History of present illness should include acuity of onset, temporal patterns (eg, constant vs intermittent, presence only on awakening), provoking factors, including situational or psychogenic factors (eg, whether xerostomia occurs only during periods of psychologic stress or certain activities), assessment of fluid status (eg, fluid intake habits, recurrent vomiting or diarrhea), and sleeping habits.  A history of use of recreational drugs should be taken.  Review of systems should seek symptoms of causative disorders, including dry eyes, dry skin, rashes, and joint pain . \n【8】 Drug profiles should be reviewed for potential offending drugs Physical examination is focused on the oral cavity, specifically any apparent dryness (eg, whether the mucosa is dry, sticky, or moist; whether saliva is foamy, thick, stringy, or normal in appearance), the presence of any lesions caused by Candida albicans, and the condition of the teeth.  The presence and severity of xerostomia can be assessed in several ways.  For example, a tongue blade can be held against the buccal mucosa for 10 seconds.  If the tongue blade falls off immediately when released, salivary flow is considered normal.  The more difficulty encountered removing the tongue blade, the more severe the xerostomia.  In women, the lipstick sign, where lipstick adheres to the front teeth, may be a useful indicator of xerostomia.  If there appears to be dryness, the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands should be palpated while observing the ductal openings for saliva flow.  The openings are at the base of the tongue anteriorly for the submandibular and sublingual glands and on the middle of the inside of the cheek for the parotid glands.  Drying the duct openings with a gauze square before palpation aids observation.  If a graduated container is available, the patient can expectorate once to empty the mouth and then expectorate all saliva into the container.  Normal production is 0. 3 to 0. 4 mL/min.  Significant xerostomia is 0.  Dental caries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities. \n【9】 A common manifestation of C.  albicans infection is areas of erythema and atrophy (eg, loss of papillae on the dorsum of the tongue).  Less common is the better-known white, cheesy curd that bleeds when wiped off.  Red flags The following findings are of particular concern: Extensive tooth decay Concomitant dry eyes, dry skin, rash, or joint pain Risk factors for HIV Interpretation of findings Xerostomia is diagnosed by symptoms, appearance, and absence of salivary flow when massaging the salivary glands.  No further assessment is required when xerostomia occurs after initiation of a new drug and stops after cessation of that drug or when symptoms appear within several weeks of irradiation of the head and neck.  Xerostomia that occurs with abrupt onset after head and neck trauma may be caused by nerve damage.  Concomitant presence of dry eyes, dry skin, rash, or joint pain, particularly in a female patient, suggests a diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome is a relatively common chronic, autoimmune, systemic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. \n【10】 Xerostomia that occurs only during nighttime or that is noted only on awakening may be indicative of excessive mouth breathing in a dry environment.  Testing Sialometry Salivary gland biopsy For patients in whom the presence of xerostomia is unclear, sialometry can be conducted by placing collection devices over the major duct orifices and then stimulating salivary production with citric acid or by chewing paraffin. 4 to 1. 5 mL/min/gland.  Flow monitoring can also help determine response to therapy.  The cause of xerostomia is often apparent, but if the etiology is unclear and systemic disease is considered possible, further assessment should be pursued with biopsy of a minor salivary gland  Tuberculosis is a chronic, progressive mycobacterial infection, often with an asymptomatic latent period following initial infection.  Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. \n【11】 The lower lip is a convenient site for biopsy.  Treatment of Xerostomia Cause treated and causative drugs stopped when possible Cholinergic drugs Saliva substitutes Regular oral hygiene and dental care to prevent tooth decay When possible, the cause of xerostomia should be addressed and treated.  For patients with drug-related xerostomia whose therapy cannot be changed to another drug, drug schedules should be modified to achieve maximum drug effect during the day because nighttime xerostomia is more likely to cause caries.  Custom-fitted acrylic night guards carrying fluoride gel may also help limit caries in these patients.  For all drugs, easy-to-take formulations, such as liquids, should be considered, and sublingual dosage forms should be avoided.  The mouth and throat should be lubricated with water before swallowing capsules and tablets or before using sublingual nitroglycerin.  Patients should avoid decongestants and antihistamines. \n【12】 Patients using oral appliance therapy may benefit from a room humidifier.  Symptom control Symptomatic treatment consists of measures that do the following: Increase existing saliva Replace lost secretions Control caries Drugs that augment saliva production include cevimeline and pilocarpine, both cholinergic agonists.  Cevimeline (30 mg orally 3 times a day) has less M2 (cardiac) receptor activity than pilocarpine and a longer half-life.  The main adverse effect is nausea.  Pilocarpine (5 mg orally 3 times a day) may be given after ophthalmologic and cardiorespiratory contraindications are excluded; adverse effects include sweating, flushing, and polyuria.  Sipping sugarless fluids frequently, chewing xylitol-containing gum, and using an over-the-counter saliva substitute containing carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or glycerin may help.  Petroleum jelly can be applied to the lips and under dentures to relieve drying, cracking, soreness, and mucosal trauma.  A cold-air humidifier may aid mouth breathers, who typically have their worst symptoms at night.  Meticulous oral hygiene is essential.  Patients should brush and floss regularly (including just before bedtime) and use fluoride rinses or gels daily; using newer toothpastes with added calcium and phosphates also may help avoid rampant caries.  An increased frequency of preventive dental visits with plaque removal is advised.  The most effective way to prevent caries is to sleep with individually fitted carriers containing 1. 1% sodium fluoride or 0. 4% stannous fluoride.  In addition, a dentist can apply a 5% sodium fluoride varnish 2 to 4 times a year.  Patients should avoid sugary or acidic foods and beverages and any irritating foods that are dry, spicy, astringent, or excessively hot or cold.  It is particularly important to avoid ingesting sugar near bedtime.  Geriatrics Essentials Although xerostomia becomes more common among older patients, this is probably due to the many drugs typically used by those patients rather than aging itself.  Key Points Drugs are the most common cause, but systemic diseases (most commonly Sjögren syndrome or HIV) and radiation therapy also can cause xerostomia.  Symptomatic treatment includes increasing existing saliva flow with stimulants or drugs, and artificial saliva replacement; xylitol-containing gum and sugarless candy may be useful.  Patients with xerostomia are at high risk of tooth decay; meticulous oral hygiene, additional preventive measures in home care, and professionally applied fluorides are essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:00:26"}

It sometimes causes typical symptoms of viral hepatitis, including anorexia, malaise, and jaundice but may be asymptomatic.  Fulminant hepatitis and death rarely occur.  Chronic hepatitis develops in about 75% and can lead to cirrhosis and rarely hepatocellular carcinoma.  Diagnosis is by serologic testing.  Treatment is with antiviral drugs.  No vaccine is available.   In the US, 4136 cases of acute hepatitis C infection were reported in 2019.  However, because many cases are not recognized or not reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the actual number of new infections was 57,500 in 2019 .  The number of acute hepatitis C cases has been rising in the United States since 2013.  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus that causes acute viral hepatitis Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. \n【1】 Six major HCV subtypes exist with varying amino acid sequences (genotypes); these subtypes vary geographically and in virulence and response to therapy.  HCV can also alter its amino acid pattern over time in an infected person, producing quasispecies.  HCV infection sometimes occurs simultaneously with specific systemic disorders, including the following: Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia Conditions that cause an abnormal protein content in the blood, typically in the form of immunoglobulins, can affect vascular fragility and lead to purpura.   is a comparatively common hepatic porphyria affecting mainly the skin.  Liver disease is also common. \n【2】 They mostly affect children. \n【3】 Up to 20% of patients with alcoholic liver disease Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol consumption is high in most Western countries. \n【4】 The reasons for this high association are unclear because concomitant alcohol and drug use accounts for only a portion of cases.  In these patients, HCV and alcohol act synergistically to worsen liver inflammation and fibrosis.  Transmission of hepatitis C Infection is most commonly transmitted through blood, primarily when parenteral drug users share needles, but also through sharing vessels for intranasal drug use, or tattoos or body piercing with nonsterile equipment.  Sexual transmission and vertical transmission of hepatitis C from mother to infant are relatively rare.  Transmission of hepatitis C through blood transfusion has become very rare since the advent of screening tests for donated blood.  Some sporadic cases occur in patients without apparent risk factors.  HCV prevalence varies with geography and other risk factors. \n【5】Symptoms and Signs of Acute Hepatitis C may be asymptomatic during the acute infection.  Its severity often fluctuates, sometimes with recrudescent hepatitis and roller-coaster aminotransferase levels for many years or even decades. \n【6】 HCV has the highest rate of chronicity (about 75%).  The resultant chronic hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis C is a common cause of chronic hepatitis.  It is often asymptomatic until manifestations of chronic liver disease occur. \n【7】 Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in patients with cirrhosis and is common in areas where infection with hepatitis B and C viruses is prevalent. \n【8】 Diagnosis of Acute Hepatitis C Serologic testing HCV RNA measurement In the initial diagnosis of acute hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that have diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. \n【9】 When cases are unclear or when suspicion for hepatitis C is high, HCV RNA is measured.  Anti-HCV usually appears within 2 weeks of acute infection but is sometimes delayed; however, HCV RNA is positive sooner.   Other tests Liver tests are needed if not previously done; they include serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase.  Other tests should be done to evaluate liver function and disease severity; they include serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR).  Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Antiviral therapy There are a number of highly effective direct-acting antiviral drugs Overview of HCV treatment (DAAs) for hepatitis C that may decrease the likelihood of developing chronic infection.  DAAs also help prevent transmission to others.  Current recommendations are to start treatment after the initial diagnosis of acute HCV, without waiting for spontaneous resolution.  Alcohol and hepatotoxic drugs (eg, acetaminophen) should be avoided because it can increase liver damage.  Restrictions on diet or activity, including commonly prescribed bed rest, have no scientific basis.  Viral hepatitis should be reported to the local or state health department. \n【10】Prevention of Acute Hepatitis C Patients should be advised to avoid high-risk behavior (eg, sharing needles to inject drugs, getting tattoos and body piercings).  Blood and other body fluids (eg, saliva, semen) are considered infectious.  Risk of infection after a single needlestick exposure is about 1. 8%.  Barrier protection is recommended, but isolation of patients is of no value in preventing acute hepatitis C.  Risk of transmission from HCV-infected medical personnel appears to be low, and there are no CDC recommendations to restrict health care workers with hepatitis C infection from working.  Posttransfusion infection is minimized by avoiding unnecessary transfusions and screening all donors for hepatitis B and C.  Screening has decreased the incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which are now extremely rare in the US.  No product exists for immunoprophylaxis of HCV.  The propensity of HCV for changing its genome hampers vaccine development.  Preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis with antiviral therapy is not recommended.  Key Points Hepatitis C is usually transmitted by parenteral contact with contaminated blood; transmission from mucosal contact with other body fluids and perinatal transmission from infected mothers are rare.  About 75% of patients with acute hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis C, which leads to cirrhosis in 20 to 30%; some patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma.  Diagnose by testing for antibody to HCV and HCV RNA.  Treat with antiviral drugs after initial diagnosis of hepatitis C, without waiting for spontaneous resolution.

What is high blood pressure during pregnancy? A woman's blood pressure is normally lower during pregnancy.  Blood pressure that's only a little high can be a sign of problems for you and your baby.  There are 3 types of high blood pressure during pregnancy: Chronic high blood pressure: you already had high blood pressure before you got pregnant Gestational high blood pressure: high blood pressure that starts after week 20 of your pregnancy and usually goes away a few weeks after your baby is born Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is a certain type of high blood pressure that happens during pregnancy.  The placenta (afterbirth) is the organ in your uterus (womb) that feeds your unborn baby (fetus). \n【1】 High blood pressure usually doesn't cause symptoms.  You can't tell whether your blood pressure is high based on how you feel.  However, if you have preeclampsia, you can have: Headaches Swelling in your hands and feet How can untreated high blood pressure affect me and my baby? High blood pressure during pregnancy can cause serious problems for you and your baby.

Part of your brain stops getting blood. \n【2】 They’re about the size of your fist and are in the back of your abdomen, near your spine. \n【3】 Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. \n【4】 In eclampsia you have seizures (when your body moves and jerks out of your control) and sometimes blood and liver problems.  These problems can be life-threatening to you and your baby.  How can doctors tell if I have high blood pressure during pregnancy? Doctors will take your blood pressure (using a blood pressure cuff) at every doctor visit.  You have high blood pressure if your blood pressure is at or above 140/90.  In addition, doctors will test your urine for protein to see if you have preeclampsia.  How do doctors treat high blood pressure during pregnancy? Doctors will: Give you blood pressure medicine Teach you to check your blood pressure at home Do tests to see how well your kidneys and liver are working Do ultrasounds to see how your baby is growing Deliver your baby early if you have severe preeclampsia If you have high to very high blood pressure, doctors will have you rest in bed and may deliver your baby a little early (at 37 to 39 weeks).  If you have very high blood pressure (180/110 or higher), your doctor may put you in the hospital for treatment during the last months of your pregnancy.

Some authorities also consider a relative anemia to exist when a hemoglobin or hematocrit above that cutoff point is insufficient to meet tissue oxygen demand. \n【1】 Prenatal and perinatal changes in erythropoiesis are discussed in Perinatal Physiology The transition from life in utero to life outside the womb involves multiple changes in physiology and function. \n【2】Both hemoglobin and hematocrit change rapidly as a neonate matures, so lower limits of normal also change .  Variables such as gestational age and growth parameters help identify the risk of neonatal pathology.  Gestational age is the primary determinant of organ maturity. \n【3】 Etiology of Perinatal Anemia Causes of anemia in neonates include Physiologic processes Blood loss Decreased red blood cell (RBC) production Increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) Physiologic anemia is the most common cause of anemia in the neonatal period.  Normal physiologic processes often cause normocytic-normochromic anemia at an expected time after birth in term and preterm infants.  Physiologic anemias do not generally require extensive evaluation or treatment.  In term infants, the increase in oxygenation that occurs with normal breathing after birth causes an abrupt rise in tissue oxygen level, resulting in negative feedback on erythropoietin production and erythropoiesis.  This reduction in erythropoiesis, as well as the shorter life span of neonatal RBCs (90 days vs 120 days in adults), causes hemoglobin (Hb) concentration to fall over the first 2 to 3 months of life (typical Hb nadir 9 to 11 g/dL [90 to 110 g/L]).  This is called the physiologic nadir.  Hb remains stable over the next several weeks and then slowly rises in the 4th to 6th month secondary to renewed erythropoietin stimulation.  Physiologic anemia is more pronounced in preterm infants An infant born before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm.  Prematurity is defined by the gestational age at which infants are born. \n【4】 This condition is also referred to as anemia of prematurity.  A mechanism similar to the one that causes anemia in term infants causes anemia in preterm infants during the first 4 to 12 weeks.  Lower erythropoietin production, shorter RBC life span (35 to 50 days), rapid growth, and more frequent phlebotomy contribute to a faster and lower Hb nadir (8 to 10 g/dL [80 to 100 g/L]) in preterm infants.  Anemia of prematurity most commonly affects infants < 32 weeks gestation.  Almost all acutely ill and extremely preterm infants Preterm, Very Preterm, and Extremely Preterm Infants An infant born before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm. \n【5】 Blood loss Anemia may develop because of prenatal, perinatal (at delivery), or postpartum hemorrhage.  In neonates, absolute blood volume is low (eg, preterm, 90 to 105 mL/kg; term, 78 to 86 mL/kg); therefore, acute loss of as little as 15 to 20 mL of blood may result in anemia.  An infant with chronic blood loss can compensate physiologically and is typically more clinically stable than an infant with acute blood loss.  Prenatal hemorrhage may be caused by Fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage Twin-to-twin transfusion Cord malformations Placental abnormalities Diagnostic procedures Fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage usually occurs spontaneously or may result from maternal trauma, amniocentesis, external cephalic version, or placental tumor.  It affects about 50% of pregnancies, although in most cases the volume of blood lost is extremely small (about 2 mL); “massive” blood loss, defined as > 30 mL, occurs in 3/1000 pregnancies.  Twin-to-twin transfusion is the unequal sharing of blood supply between twins that affects 13 to 33% of monozygotic, monochorionic twin pregnancies. \n【6】 Cord malformations include velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, vasa previa In vasa previa, membranes that contain fetal blood vessels connecting the umbilical cord and placenta overlie or are within 2 cm of the internal cervical os. \n【7】 The 2 important placental abnormalities causing hemorrhage are placenta previa is implantation of the placenta over or near the internal os of the cervix. \n【8】 It can be an obstetric emergency. \n【9】 Diagnostic procedures causing hemorrhage include amniocentesis All procedures used to diagnose genetic disorders, except ultrasonography, are invasive and involve slight fetal risk. \n【10】 Perinatal hemorrhage may be caused by Precipitous delivery (ie, rapid and spontaneous delivery, which causes hemorrhage due to umbilical cord tearing) Obstetric accidents (eg, incision of the placenta during cesarean delivery, birth trauma) Coagulopathies Cephalhematomas Cephalhematoma The forces of labor and delivery occasionally cause physical injury to the infant. \n【11】 Neonates with intracranial hemorrhage The forces of labor and delivery occasionally cause physical injury to the infant. \n【12】 Far less often, rupture of the liver, spleen, or adrenal gland during delivery may lead to internal bleeding.  Intraventricular hemorrhage and/or intraparenchymal hemorrhage The forces of labor and delivery occasionally cause physical injury to the infant. \n【13】 Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn  is hemorrhage within a few days of a normal delivery caused by transient physiologic deficiency in vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X).  These factors are poorly transferred across the placenta, and, because vitamin K is synthesized by intestinal bacteria, very little is produced in the initially sterile intestine of the newborn.  Vitamin K–deficient bleeding has three forms: Early (first 24 hours) Classic (first week of life) Late (2 to 12 weeks of age) The early form is caused by maternal use of a drug that inhibits vitamin K (eg, certain antiseizure drugs; isoniazid; rifampin; warfarin; prolonged maternal use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which suppresses bowel bacterial colonization).  The classic form occurs in neonates who do not receive vitamin K supplementation after birth.  The late form occurs in exclusively breastfed neonates who do not receive vitamin K supplementation after birth.  Giving vitamin K 0. 5 to 1 mg IM after birth rapidly activates clotting factors and prevents hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.  Other possible causes of hemorrhage in the first few days of life are other coagulopathies Overview of Coagulation Disorders Abnormal bleeding can result from disorders of the coagulation system, of platelets, or of blood vessels.  Disorders of coagulation can be acquired or hereditary. \n【14】 Decreased red blood cell (RBC) production Defects in RBC production may be Congenital Acquired Congenital defects are extremely rare, but the most common are Diamond-Blackfan anemia Fanconi anemia Diamond-Blackfan anemia is characterized by lack of RBC precursors in bone marrow, macrocytic RBCs, lack of reticulocytes in peripheral blood, and lack of involvement of other blood cell lineages.  It is often (though not always) part of a syndrome of congenital anomalies including microcephaly is a head circumference < 2 standard deviations below the mean for age. \n【15】 Up to 25% of affected infants are anemic at birth, and low birth weight occurs in about 10%.  It is thought to be a ribosomopathy caused by defective stem cell differentiation.  Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of bone marrow progenitor cells that causes a bone marrow failure syndrome with macrocytosis and reticulocytopenia with progressive failure of all hematopoietic cell lines.  It is usually diagnosed after the neonatal period.  The cause is a genetic defect that prevents cells from repairing damaged DNA or removing toxic free radicals that damage cells.  Other congenital anemias include Pearson syndrome, a rare, multisystem disease involving mitochondrial defects that cause refractory sideroblastic anemia, pancytopenia, and variable hepatic, renal, and pancreatic insufficiency or failure; and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, in which chronic anemia (typically macrocytic) results from ineffective or abnormal RBC production, and hemolysis caused by RBC abnormalities.  Acquired defects are those that occur after birth.  The most common causes are Infections Nutritional deficiencies Infections ,eg, malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. \n【16】 Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death. \n【17】 Nutritional deficiencies of iron Deficiency Iron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body.  Heme iron is contained mainly in animal products. \n【18】 Copper deficiency may be acquired or inherited. \n【19】 It may result from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or use of various drugs.  Deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia , vitamin E Deficiency Dietary vitamin E deficiency is common in countries with high rates of food insecurity; deficiency among adults in other countries is uncommon and usually due to fat malabsorption. \n【20】 The incidence of iron deficiency, the most common nutritional deficiency, is higher in less developed countries where it results from dietary insufficiency and exclusive and prolonged breastfeeding.  Iron deficiency is common among neonates whose mothers have an iron deficit and among preterm infants who have not been transfused and whose formula is not supplemented with iron; preterm infants deplete iron stores by 10 to 14 weeks if not supplemented.  Hemolysis Overview of Hemolytic Anemia At the end of their normal life span (about 120 days), red blood cells (RBCs) are removed from the circulation. \n【21】 Normally, bilirubin bound to serum albumin stays in the intravascular space. \n【22】 Immune-mediated hemolysis may occur when fetal RBCs with surface antigens (most commonly Rh and ABO blood antigens but also Kell, Duffy, and other minor group antigens) that differ from maternal RBC antigens enter the maternal circulation and stimulate production of IgG antibody directed against fetal RBCs. \n【23】 Less often, fetal-maternal transfusion early in a pregnancy can stimulate an IgG response that affects that pregnancy.  Intrauterine hemolysis may be severe enough to cause hydrops or fetal death.  Postpartum, there may be significant anemia and hyperbilirubinemia with ongoing hemolysis secondary to persistent maternal IgG (half-life about 28 days). \n【24】 Pearls & Pitfalls Rarely, fetal-maternal transfusion early in a pregnancy can stimulate an IgG response that causes hemolysis during that pregnancy.  ABO incompatibility may cause hemolysis by a similar mechanism.  Mothers are sensitized by antigens present in their food or intestinal flora that are homologous to A and B antigens (thus, a prior pregnancy is not necessary for sensitization).  These exogenous antigens trigger a maternal IgM response depending on the mother's blood type.  The response is anti-A if the mother is type B, anti-B if the mother is type A, or both if the mother is type O.  These IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta.  However, when incompatible fetal blood gets into the maternal circulation, an anamnestic IgG response occurs, and these anti-A or anti-B IgG antibodies are capable of crossing the placenta in large amounts and causing hemolysis in the fetus.  ABO incompatibility usually is less severe than Rh incompatibility because the initial IgM antibodies clear at least some of the fetal blood cells from the maternal circulation before IgG antibody production can occur, and there is less ABO antigen on the fetal RBC membrane than Rh antigen.  Unlike Rh-mediated hemolysis, the direct antiglobulin test Direct Antiglobulin (Direct Coombs) Test (DAT [Coombs test]) may be negative in newborns with hemolysis.  RBC membrane disorders alter RBC shape and deformability and cause increased fragility, resulting in premature destruction and/or removal of RBCs from the circulation.  The most common disorders are hereditary spherocytosis and Hereditary Elliptocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis are congenital red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders that can cause a mild hemolytic anemia. \n【25】 Enzyme deficiencies of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase are the most common enzyme disorders causing hemolysis. \n【26】 It has many subtypes, some mild, some severe.  The most common variant is the A- type, which is moderate in severity.  G6PD deficiency is thought to help protect against malaria and has an estimated allele frequency of 8% in malarious regions.  In the US, some states screen newborns for G6PD deficiency (by DNA testing or by measuring enzyme activity).  Pyruvate kinase deficiency Glycolytic Pathway Defects are autosomal recessive red blood cell metabolic disorders that cause hemolytic anemia. \n【27】 Pyruvate kinase deficiency is rare and occurs in about 1 of 20,000 White people; screening for this disorder is not routinely done in the US.  Hemoglobinopathies Overview of Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders affecting the structure or production of the hemoglobin molecule. \n【28】 At birth, 55 to 90% of the neonate’s hemoglobin (Hb) is fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), which is composed of 2 alpha and 2 gamma globin chains (alpha2gamma2).  After birth, gamma-chain production decreases (to < 2% by 2 to 4 years of age) and beta-chain production increases until adult hemoglobin (Hb A, alpha2beta2) becomes predominant.  Alpha- thalassemia Thalassemias are a group of inherited microcytic, hemolytic anemias characterized by defective hemoglobin synthesis. \n【29】 Beta-thalassemia is an inherited decrease in beta-chain production.  Because beta globin is naturally low at birth, beta-thalassemia and structural abnormalities of the beta globin chain ,eg, Hb S , sickle cell disease (a hemoglobinopathy) causes a chronic hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in people with African ancestry. \n【30】 Intrauterine infections by certain bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa (most notably malaria) also may trigger hemolytic anemia.  In malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. \n【31】 Immune-mediated destruction of parasitized RBCs and excess removal of nonparasitized cells occur.  Associated bone marrow dyserythropoiesis results in inadequate compensatory erythropoiesis.  Intravascular hemolysis, extravascular phagocytosis, and dyserythropoiesis can lead to anemia.  Symptoms and Signs of Perinatal Anemia are similar regardless of the cause but vary with severity and rate of onset of the anemia.  Neonates are generally pale and, if anemia is severe, have tachypnea, tachycardia, and sometimes a flow murmur; hypotension is present with acute blood loss.  Jaundice may be present with hemolysis.  Evaluation of Perinatal Anemia History should focus on maternal factors (eg, bleeding diatheses, hereditary red blood cell [RBC] disorders, nutritional deficiencies, drugs), family history of hereditary disorders that may cause neonatal anemia (eg, alpha-thalassemia, enzyme deficiencies, RBC membrane disorders, RBC aplasias), and obstetric factors (eg, infections, vaginal bleeding, obstetric interventions, mode of delivery, blood loss, treatment and appearance of the cord, placental pathology, fetal distress, number of fetuses).  Nonspecific maternal factors may provide additional clues.  History of anemia in the parents should be sought.  Splenectomy would indicate a possible history of hemolysis, RBC membrane disorder, or autoimmune anemia; cholecystectomy might indicate a history of hemolysis-induced gallstones.  Important neonatal factors include gestational age and growth parameters help identify the risk of neonatal pathology. \n【32】 Physical examination Tachycardia and hypotension suggest acute, significant blood loss.  Jaundice suggests hemolysis, either systemic (caused by Rh or ABO incompatibility or G6PD deficiency) or localized (caused by breakdown of sequestered blood in cephalhematomas).  Hepatosplenomegaly suggests hemolysis, congenital infection, or heart failure.  Hematomas, ecchymoses, or petechiae suggest bleeding diathesis.  Congenital anomalies may suggest a bone marrow failure syndrome.  Testing Anemia may be suspected prenatally if ultrasonography shows increased middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity or hydrops fetalis, which, by definition, is abnormal, excessive fluid in ≥ 2 body compartments (eg, pleura, peritoneum, pericardium); cardiac, hepatic, and splenic enlargement may be present.  After birth, if anemia is suspected, a complete blood count is done; if hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, initial testing consists of Reticulocyte count Peripheral smear examination If anemia is acute, urgent intervention may be required.  If the reticulocyte count is low (it is normally elevated when hemoglobin and hematocrit are low), anemia may be caused by acquired or congenital bone marrow dysfunction, and the infant should be evaluated for causes of bone marrow suppression with Titers or polymerase chain reaction studies for congenital infection (rubella, syphilis, HIV, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, human herpesvirus 6) Folate and vitamin B12 levels Iron and copper levels If these studies do not identify a cause of anemia, a bone marrow biopsy, genetic testing for congenital disorders of RBC production, or both may be necessary.  If the reticulocyte count is elevated or normal (reflecting an appropriate bone marrow response), anemia may be caused by blood loss or hemolysis.  If there is no apparent blood loss or if signs of hemolysis are noted on the peripheral smear or the serum bilirubin level is elevated (which may occur with hemolysis), a direct antiglobulin test Direct Antiglobulin (Direct Coombs) Test (DAT [Coombs test]) should be done.  If the direct antiglobulin test is positive, anemia is likely secondary to Rh, ABO, or other blood group incompatibility.  The DAT is always positive with Rh incompatibility but is sometimes negative with ABO incompatibility because there is less ABO antigen on the RBC membrane than Rh antigen.  Infants may have active hemolysis caused by ABO incompatibility and have a negative DAT; however, in such infants, the peripheral blood smear should reveal microspherocytes, and the indirect antiglobulin (indirect Coombs) test is usually positive because it identifies plasma ABO antibodies, which, in the presence of adult RBCs (adult RBCs have well discriminated ABO antigens), give a positive test result.  If the direct antiglobulin test is negative, the RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) may prove helpful, although because fetal RBCs are normally larger than adult RBCs, it can be challenging to interpret MCV in the neonate.  However, a significantly low MCV suggests alpha-thalassemia or, less commonly, iron deficiency due to chronic intrauterine blood loss; these may be distinguished by red cell distribution width (RDW), which is often normal with thalassemia but elevated with iron deficiency.  With a normal or high MCV, the peripheral blood smear may show abnormal RBC morphology compatible with a membrane disorder, microangiopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, vitamin E deficiency, or hemoglobinopathy.  Infants with hereditary spherocytosis often have an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).  If the smear is normal, blood loss, enzyme deficiency, or infection should be considered and an appropriate assessment, including testing for fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage, should ensue.  Fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage can be diagnosed by testing for fetal RBCs in maternal blood.  The Kleihauer-Betke acid elution technique is the most frequently used test, but other tests include fluorescent antibody techniques and differential or mixed agglutination testing.  In the Kleihauer-Betke technique, citric acid-phosphate buffer of pH 3. 5 elutes hemoglobin from adult but not fetal RBCs; thus, fetal RBCs stain with eosin and are visible on microscopy, whereas adult RBCs appear as red cell ghosts.  The Kleihauer-Betke technique is not useful when the mother has a hemoglobinopathy.  Treatment of Perinatal Anemia Need for treatment of perinatal anemia varies with degree of anemia and associated medical conditions.  Mild anemia in otherwise healthy term and preterm infants generally does not require specific treatment; treatment is directed at the underlying diagnosis.  Some patients require transfusion or exchange transfusion of packed RBCs.  Transfusion is indicated to treat severe anemia.  Infants should be considered for transfusion if symptomatic due to anemia or if a decrease in tissue oxygen delivery is suspected.  The decision to transfuse should be based on symptoms, patient age, and degree of illness.  Hematocrit alone should not be the deciding factor regarding transfusion because some infants may be asymptomatic with lower levels and others may be symptomatic with higher levels.  Guidelines for when to transfuse vary, but one accepted set is described in table Transfusion Thresholds for Infants < 4 Months Transfusion Guidelines for Infants < 4 Months .   Within the first 4 months, before the first transfusion, if not already done, maternal and fetal blood should be tested for both ABO and Rh types determination and to detect the presence of atypical RBC antibodies.  Antibody screening should be done on the maternal sample when available, and a DAT should be done on the infant’s RBCs.  RBCs for neonatal transfusion must be ABO- and D-compatible with both maternal and neonatal groups and must be indirect antiglobulin test crossmatch–compatible with clinically significant RBC antibodies present in maternal or neonatal plasma.  Units that are ABO compatible with both mother and neonate must be used even if the pretransfusion DAT is negative.  Typically, group O D-negative RBCs are used for most neonatal top-up and exchange transfusions.  If group-specific RBCs are used, which is most common for elective large-volume transfusions, they must be ABO- and D-compatible with both maternal and neonatal groups.  Group-identical units should be used when possible for elective large-volume transfusions in infants to minimize the use of group O D-negative RBCs .  Neonates produce RBC antibodies only rarely, so in cases where the need for transfusion persists, repeat antibody screening is usually not necessary until 4 months of age.  Packed RBCs used for transfusion should be filtered (leukocyte depleted), irradiated, and given in aliquots of 10 to 20 mL/kg derived from a single donation; sequential transfusions from the same unit of blood minimize recipient exposure and transfusion complications.  Blood from cytomegalovirus-negative donors should be considered for extremely preterm infants.  Exchange transfusion Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes caused by hyperbilirubinemia (elevated serum bilirubin concentration). \n【33】 This procedure decreases plasma antibody titers and bilirubin levels and minimizes fluid overload.  An exchange transfusion of a single blood volume (80 to 100 mL/kg, depending on gestational age) removes about 75% of neonatal RBCs, and a double-volume exchange (160 to 200 mL/kg) removes up to 85 to 90% of RBCs and up to 50% of circulating bilirubin .  Serious adverse effects (eg, thrombocytopenia; necrotizing enterocolitis; hypoglycemia; hypocalcemia; shock, pulmonary edema, or both [caused by shifts in fluid balance]) are common, so the procedure should be done by experienced staff.  Guidelines for when to begin exchange transfusion differ and are not evidence based.  Other treatments Recombinant human erythropoietin is not routinely recommended, in part because it has not been shown to reduce transfusion requirements in the first 2 weeks of life.  Iron therapy is given to infants who have blood loss (eg, due to hemorrhagic diathesis, gastrointestinal bleeding, frequent phlebotomy).  Oral iron supplements are preferred.  Parenteral iron may rarely cause anaphylaxis.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends giving breastfed infants a daily liquid iron supplement (1 mg/kg of elemental iron) beginning at 4 months of age until iron-containing solid foods are introduced at about 6 months of age .  Treatment of more unusual causes of anemia is disorder specific (eg, corticosteroids in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, vitamin B12 for B12 deficiency). \n【34】 Key Points Anemia is a reduction in red cell mass or hemoglobin, and in neonates is usually defined as hemoglobin or hematocrit > 2 standard deviations below the mean for age.  Causes of anemia in newborns include physiologic processes, blood loss, decreased red blood cell (RBC) production, and increased RBC destruction.  Physiologic anemia is the most common cause of anemia in the neonatal period and does not generally require extensive evaluation or treatment.  Neonates with anemia are generally pale and, if anemia is severe, have tachypnea, tachycardia, and sometimes a flow murmur.  Need for treatment varies with degree of anemia and associated medical conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:08:07"}

Gram-positive bacteria stain blue when this stain is applied to them. \n【1】 These bacteria commonly cause pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis, and middle ear infection.  Pneumococcal bacteria are dispersed in the air when infected people cough or sneeze.  Pneumococcal infections usually cause fever and a general feeling of illness, with other symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.  Diagnosis may be based on symptoms or identification of the bacteria in samples of infected material.  Young children are routinely vaccinated against these infections, and vaccination is also recommended for all people 65 years of age and older and all people at high risk.  Penicillin or another antibiotic is usually effective treatment.  They are among the earliest known life forms on earth. \n【2】 There are more than 90 types of pneumococci.  However, most serious infections are caused by only a few types.  Pneumococci commonly reside in the upper respiratory tract of healthy people, their natural host, particularly during the winter and early spring.  The bacteria spread to other people when they do the following: Inhale infected droplets dispersed by sneezing or coughing Come in close contact with an infected person Spread is more likely among certain populations of people, such as military personnel and homeless people.  Spread is also more likely to occur among self-contained groups of people, such as people who live, stay, or work in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, hospital wards, prisons, military bases, universities or schools, shelters for the homeless, or day care centers.  Risk factors Certain conditions increase the risk of developing and the severity of pneumococcal infections: Chronic illnesses ,such as heart and lung disorders, diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【3】 Characteristic manifestations include Jaundice (a yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes) Cholestasis  Alcohol use disorder Alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning). \n【4】 The spleen filters the blood, removing and destroying bacteria and other infectious organisms in the bloodstream. \n【5】 Smoking increases the risk of heart attack, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other disorders. \n【6】 Also, older people, even if healthy, tend to have more severe symptoms and complications when they get a pneumococcal infection.  Symptoms and Diagnosis Symptoms of pneumococcal infections vary depending on the site of the infection.  Most pneumococcal infections occur in the Lungs  Middle ear ,otitis media (Acute) Acute otitis media is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear.  Acute otitis media often occurs in people with a cold or allergies.  The infected ear is painful. \n【7】 Infections may occur in the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord ,meningitis Acute Bacterial meningitis is rapidly developing inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges  or, less often, in heart valves , bones, joints, or the abdominal cavity.  Pneumococcal pneumonia Often, symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia Overview of Pneumonia is an infection of the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) and the tissues around them.  Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. \n【8】 People have fever, chills, a general feeling of illness (malaise), shortness of breath, and a cough.  The cough brings up sputum that is rust-colored.  Commonly, sharp, stabbing chest pains occur on one side.  Deep breathing and coughing make the pains worse.  In about 40% of people, fluid accumulates between the layers of tissue that cover the lungs .  Pleural effusion may contribute to chest pain and make breathing difficult.  Chest x-rays are taken to look for signs of pneumonia.  Doctors take a sample of sputum and examine it under a microscope.  A sample of sputum, pus, or blood may be sent to a laboratory to grow (culture) bacteria.  Pneumococcal bacteria are easily identified.  They are also tested to see which antibiotics are effective ,a process called susceptibility testing a Microorganism's Susceptibility and Sensitivity to Antimicrobial Drugs Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. \n【9】 They have a stiff neck that makes lowering the chin to the chest painful and difficult, but this problem is not always obvious early in the disease.  Unlike older children and adults, most infants with meningitis Newborns and children under 12 months of age Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection of the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord ( meninges). \n【10】 They may only be reluctant to eat and be irritable or sluggish.  Pneumococcal meningitis may lead to complications, such as Hearing loss (in up to 50% of people) Seizures Learning disabilities Mental dysfunction The diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis requires a spinal tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination. \n【11】 The sample is checked for signs of infection, such as white blood cells and bacteria.  Pneumococcal otitis media (Acute) Acute otitis media is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear. \n【12】 These infections can cause Mild hearing loss Worldwide, about half a billion people (almost 8% of the world's population) have hearing loss. \n【13】 Eardrum perforations are caused by middle ear infections and injuries. \n【14】 Pneumococcal otitis media commonly recurs.  The diagnosis of pneumococcal otitis media is usually based on symptoms and results of a physical examination.  Cultures and other diagnostic tests are usually not done.  Pneumococcal sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses, most commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection or by an allergy. \n【15】 The infection causes sinus pain and pus discharged from the nose.  The infection may become chronic.  The infection may extend into the skull and cause complications such as the following: Blood clot of certain major veins in the brain, epidural, or subdural abscesses Abscess of the Brain A brain abscess is a pocket of pus in the brain. \n【16】 A computed tomography (CT) scan is done when people have symptoms of complications or when people have chronic sinusitis.  Pneumococcal bacteremia is the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. \n【17】 It may be the primary infection, or it may accompany any of the other pneumococcal infections.  When bacteremia occurs, it may lead to other infections, such as in the joints , the lining of the heart , or the tissues covering the spinal cord and brain (meningitis).  If bacteremia is suspected, doctors usually take a sample of blood so they can try to grow (culture) the bacteria in the laboratory and identify it.  Despite antibiotic treatment, pneumococcal bacteremia often causes death, especially in older people, people who have disorders that weaken their immune system, or people who have no spleen.  Prevention of Pneumococcal Infections can be prevented with vaccines and, for certain people, antibiotics. \n【18】 Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are available: A conjugate vaccine  that protects against 13 types of pneumococci A polysaccharide vaccine  that protects against 23 types of pneumococci The vaccine schedules vary depending on the person's age and medical conditions. \n【19】 In such cases, antibiotics may be continued throughout childhood and into adulthood.  Treatment of Pneumococcal Infections Antibiotics Penicillin (or the related drugs, ampicillin and amoxicillin) is used for most pneumococcal infections.  It is usually taken by mouth but, if the infection is severe, may be given intravenously.  Pneumococci that are resistant to penicillin are becoming more common.  Thus, other antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin), vancomycin, lefamulin, or omadacycline, are often used.  Vancomycin is not always effective against meningitis caused by pneumococci.  Thus, people with meningitis are usually given ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, rifampin, or both, as well as vancomycin.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:51:24"}

Additional Considerations Stop the supraperiosteal infiltration procedure and find a different method of anesthesia if the patient is uncooperative.  Relevant Anatomy Supraperiosteal infiltration anesthetizes individual dental nerves.  Injectable anesthetic is placed adjacent to the lateral (buccal) alveolar bone supporting the tooth, at the level of the root tip.  The anesthetic diffuses across the alveolar bone to reach the dental nerves of individual teeth.  Positioning Position the patient inclined, with the patient's head at the level of your elbows and the occiput supported.  For the lower jaw, use a semi-recumbent sitting position, making the lower occlusal plane roughly parallel to the floor when the mouth is open.  For the upper jaw, use a more supine position, making the upper occlusal plane roughly 60 to 90 degrees to the floor.  Turn the head and extend the neck such that the injection site (upper or lower mucobuccal fold) will be accessible.  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Wear nonsterile gloves and mask and safety glasses, or a face shield.  Instruct the patient to partially close the mouth and relax the jaw, lip, and cheek muscles.  Using your thumb and index finger, grasp the cheek lateral to the tooth, and retract it away from the tooth, to delineate the mucobuccal fold.  Use gauze to thoroughly dry the mucobuccal fold.  Use suction as needed to keep the area dry.  Apply topical anesthetic with cotton-tipped applicators and wait 2 to 3 minutes for the anesthesia to occur.  Inject the local anesthetic Again retract the lip laterally, to delineate the mucobuccal fold.  Keep the mucosa taut.  Hold the anesthetic syringe such that the needle bevel faces the tooth.  Insert the needle into the depth of the mucobuccal fold and advance parallel to the tooth until it contacts bone, aiming for the apex (1 to 1. 5 cm to contact the adult maxilla).  Aspirate, to exclude intravascular placement.  If aspiration reveals an intravascular placement, withdraw the needle 2 to 3 mm, then re-aspirate prior to injection.  Slowly inject about 1 to 2 mL of anesthetic.  During the injection, use a finger to apply external pressure to the cheek near the site of anesthetic deposition, to prevent local tissue ballooning.  If anesthesia is not satisfactory after 10 minutes, inject a small amount on the palatal/lingual side.  This is commonly required for a tooth extraction.  Aftercare Have the patient rest, with mouth relaxed, while awaiting onset of anesthesia (5 to 10 minutes).  Warnings and Common Errors To minimize the risk of needle breakage, do not bend the needle prior to insertion, do not insert the needle to its full depth (ie, to the hub), and instruct the patient to remain still, with the mouth wide open, and resist grabbing your hand.  Tricks and Tips Distraction techniques (eg, talking to the patient or having the patient hold someone else's hand) may help to reduce patient anxiety.  Inject the local anesthetic solution slowly (30 to 60 seconds) to reduce the pain of injection.  Upper molars with thick overlying bone are sometimes not adequately anesthetized with supraperiosteal infiltration alone.  If so, do a posterior superior alveolar nerve block.  Using a 25- or 27-gauge long (3-cm) needle, enter the mucobuccal fold over the second molar.  Aim posteriorly, superiorly, and medially, toward the posterior wall of the maxillary tuberosity at the level of the root apices.  Aspirate, and then inject 1 to 2 mL of anesthetic solution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 00:51:12"}

They’re about the size of your fist and are in the back of your abdomen, near your spine.  Kidneys balance your body’s water and mineral levels and filter waste out of your blood.  What is acute kidney failure? An acute problem is one that has just started and probably won't last too long.  So, acute kidney failure is when one or both of your kidneys suddenly stop working for a few days or weeks.  If your kidneys stop working for a long time, you have chronic kidney disease Your kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs that produce urine. \n【1】 Doctors now use the term \"acute kidney injury\" to refer to acute kidney failure.  But kidney failure is still the term most people know.  Damage to one kidney doesn't cause major problems as long as your other kidney works—both of your kidneys need to stop working for you to have serious problems You may have swelling of your feet, ankles, or face, feel sick and tired, itch all over your body, have difficulty breathing, or urinate (pee) less than usual Acute kidney failure can lead to serious problems, such as heart failure Your heart pumps blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to the rest of your body.  Heart failure is when your heart doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. \n【2】 Acute kidney failure can be caused by: Not enough blood getting to your kidneys Something that blocks urine from draining out of your kidneys Certain kidney diseases Certain drugs or poisons Your kidneys need a lot of blood.  Your kidneys may not get enough blood if you have a lot of bleeding, have gotten very dehydrated, or your heart isn't pumping enough blood.  If a cancer or a kidney stone blocks the flow of urine, pressure builds up in the kidney.  If the pressure stays high for a long time, your kidneys will be damaged.  Many drugs and other substances can damage your kidneys, for example: Some antibiotics Contrast agents used for certain x-rays Contrast agents are liquids given by vein that make blood vessels and organs easier to see on x-rays.  Doctors often can’t find a cause for a person's acute kidney failure.  What are the symptoms of acute kidney failure? Your symptoms depend on: How badly your kidney is injured What caused your acute kidney failure How quickly your kidney problems are getting worse First, you may have symptoms that include: Weight gain Swelling in your feet and ankles Puffiness in your face and hands Urinating less or not at all—most healthy adults urinate between 3 cups and 2 quarts of urine per day Later symptoms: Feeling sick to your stomach, tired, and less hungry Trouble focusing Itchiness or rashes You also may have symptoms of the problem that caused your kidney failure.  How can doctors tell if I have acute kidney failure? Your doctor will do: Blood tests to measure whether waste products are building up in your blood Urine tests Imaging tests, such as ultrasound Ultrasonography is a safe imaging test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the insides of your body.  Ultrasonography doesn't use radiation (x-rays). \n【3】 A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your body. \n【4】 Doctors treat the problem that is causing your acute kidney failure.  Your doctor may also: Put you on a special diet that limits how much fluid, salt, phosphorus, and potassium you take in Have you weigh yourself each day to tell whether you're retaining fluid Give you medicine to balance the potassium or phosphorus levels in your blood Put you on dialysis is an artificial process for removing waste products and excess fluids from the body, a process that is needed when the kidneys are not functioning properly. \n【5】 You may need surgery, for example, if your kidneys and urine flow are blocked.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:57:27"}

Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or x-rays, are often done in a doctor’s office.  Some doctors' offices offer treatments, such as physical therapy.  Hospitals Hospital Care provide the most comprehensive medical care.  For older people in particular, staying in a hospital increases the risk of problems Due to Hospitalization Just being in the hospital can cause certain problems, particularly infections (called hospital-acquired infections). \n【2】 Because of these risks, older people should be hospitalized only if they are very ill.  Older people may enter the hospital through the emergency department or be scheduled for admission by a doctor.  A doctor (who may be the person's primary care doctor, a specialist, or a staff doctor at the hospital) is in charge of the person’s care in the hospital.  Sometimes several other doctors are involved.  Nurses, who are available 24 hours a day, provide much of the care.  A nurse is always available, but doctors may come and go at more irregular times.  Many other people may help provide care in a hospital. \n【3】 The health care practitioners involved determine whether and what type of continuing care is needed.  This care may be provided in a rehabilitation facility Rehabilitation facilities Health care for older people may be provided in a variety of settings.  Most older people receive medical care in their primary care doctor's office. \n【4】 Observation care is care within a hospital for people who are not well enough to go home but are not ill enough to meet the requirements for actual hospital admission.  With observation care, practitioners can do tests and give treatments for a day or two before deciding whether people need to be admitted.  Such people are observed briefly in an emergency department, a special observation unit, or a regular hospital room, even though they are not actually admitted to the hospital.  The difference between admission and observation is important because Medicare considers observation care an outpatient service.  Thus, Medicare does not cover rehabilitation services after observation care.  Surgical centers are places where same-day surgery or other procedures may be done.  Such procedures include those that typically require anesthesia, that are too complicated to be done in a doctor’s office, but that do not require an overnight stay in a hospital.  Common examples are endoscopy, colonoscopy, and removal of cataracts.  Surgical centers may be located in a hospital or be a separate, free-standing facility.  Many communities without hospitals have surgical centers.  Then, people can have procedures in their own community without needing to travel to a more distant hospital.  Rehabilitation facilities After discharge from the hospital, people with a severe disability may need to continue their recovery in a rehabilitation facility Rehabilitation .  A rehabilitation facility may be located in a hospital or a nursing home or be a separate facility.  These facilities provide skilled nursing care and physical, occupational, and speech therapies.  Usually, people need to have been admitted to a hospital for 3 days to be eligible for Medicare to pay for the rehabilitation facility.  A waiver of the 3-day hospital stay requirement is available in some cases, including with some Medicare Advantage plans.  When people are admitted to a rehabilitation facility, an interdisciplinary team tries to anticipate how long their stay will be.  For older people, the stay may range from a few days to a few months.  Goals for progress are set, and progress is evaluated every day.  Thus, the types and amount of therapy can be adjusted as needed.  Some older people may be able to stay at home and get rehabilitation therapy as an outpatient at a rehabilitation facility.  Home health care People who are frail or who have recently been discharged from a hospital or rehabilitation facility often need care in their home.  This care is often provided by family members and/or friends.  But when such help is not available or when older people need more help than family members and friends can provide, older people may be eligible to receive home health care services from a home health care agency Care of Older People in the Home Older people may need care in their home when they are frail or weak, particularly after they have been discharged from the hospital or a rehabilitation facility. \n【5】 These agencies send registered nurses, therapists, home health aides, and/or social workers depending on the person's needs and insurance coverage.  Currently, the number of practitioners who will visit people in their home is increasing.  Care is provided by teams consisting of doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and social workers.  A visit in the home can be very helpful because it is more convenient for older people, and it enables practitioners to see how people are doing in their usual living environment.  End-of-life  care may also be provided in the home.  Community services In the United States, one source of support services and health care in the community is a senior center.  These centers provide social, recreational, and educational activities, and some serve meals—an important service for people who cannot prepare their own. \n【6】 Day care centers charge for services.  However, they can provide a break for caregivers during the day so that caregivers can, for example, keep their job.  Some day care centers also provide some health care.  For example, these centers may have a nurse and/or nursing assistants on duty.  The nurse can check blood pressure, make sure people are taking their medications as instructed, and provide health information.  Nursing assistants can help make sure that older people's toileting needs are taken care of and that they are fed as needed during the day.  When there are medical concerns, the nurse may contact the person's primary care practitioner or family members.  Some day care centers provide day care for people with mild to moderate dementia, and some provide physical and occupational therapy.  Other services available in the community include meal delivery programs (such as Meals on Wheels), transportation services, help with daily activities, support groups, and respite care.  Some religious communities provide many of these services.  These services are usually inexpensive, and some are free.  People can obtain information about community services, including senior centers, from the hospital discharge planning or case management department, home health care agencies, local health departments, and religious communities.  Senior centers can also be found by using the internet.  me senior day care centers have a nurse on duty to provide some health care, such as checking blood pressure.  Post-acute and long-term care Post-acute care is care immediately after hospital discharge for people who need more care than they can get at home but do not clearly need long-term care.  Post-acute care facilities provide a variety of health services including skilled nursing care and physical and occupational rehabilitation to help people regain their strength and function.  Most people ultimately return to their home.  However, some do not recover all of their function and may require long-term care.  The prospect of needing long-term care services concerns many older people.  The likelihood of needing long-term care increases greatly as people age because older people are more likely to develop chronic disorders and to have problems functioning.  How long care is needed varies from weeks to years to indefinitely.  Long-term care is focused on helping people maintain function.  It helps them do the activities necessary to care for themselves and to live as independently as possible.  These activities include basic daily activities (such as eating, dressing, bathing, grooming, and walking) and other activities (such as shopping, balancing a checkbook, doing laundry, and housecleaning).  Long-term care includes help with health care such as taking vital signs, monitoring weight, and giving medicine.  Most long-term care facilities also provide social and recreational activities.   Many people have their first experience with post-acute and long-term care after a hospital stay.  During an illness or after an injury, many older people lose some or all of the ability to care for themselves.  Thus, although they may be well enough to leave the hospital, they may need to go to a post-acute and long-term care facility for rehabilitation and recovery.  This move can be physically and psychologically demanding.  People have to adjust to many new faces and to new routines for sleeping, bathing, dressing, eating, and other daily activities.  The move happens quickly, with little time to adjust.  Most people associate long-term care with a change in residence: To the home of a family member To a retirement community Retirement Communities are designed for people who can live independently but who need or want some help, mainly with caring for a home. \n【7】 They are for people who need some help, particularly with personal care. \n【8】 People live in institutions for a variety of social and economic reasons.  The most common reasons are physical problems and/or problems with mental function (cognition) plus lack of adequate social support.  What type of arrangement is possible depends partly on a person's needs (medical, functional, social, and emotional), preferences, and financial and social resources such as long-term care insurance, availability of state waiver programs, and family members’ willingness and ability to help.  One person may be able to live at home with the help of a spouse.  Another person with similar problems but without family support may need to go to a nursing home.  Learning about the many types of long-term care facilities can help people choose the right time and place for long-term care.  Each type of long-term care facility provides different services and levels of health care.  After the type of arrangement is determined, a particular facility must be carefully chosen.  Even within each type, facilities differ considerably in environment, services (including health care), activities, living arrangements, and rules.  Sometimes the difference is simply a matter of what people can afford, but even within a price range, quality varies.  Delaying the Need for a Long-Term Care Facility The idea of going to a long-term care facility, particularly a nursing home, does not appeal to most people.  The following problems are common reasons for entering a long-term care facility.  However, sometimes problems can be solved, and the need for a long-term care facility can be delayed or avoided.  Urinary incontinence in Adults Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine. \n【9】 However, urinary incontinence may be caused by a disorder that can be treated.  Treating the disorder may cure the incontinence.  People with urinary incontinence, their family members, or their caregivers should talk with a doctor to find out whether treatment is possible.  Problems with doing daily activities: Certain devices can help people function better.  A physical or occupational therapist or a home health nurse can observe people in their home and can sometimes help them choose and learn how to use appropriate devices that will enable them to continue to function safely at home.  Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn. \n【10】 However, family members can learn ways of dealing with the older person's frustrating or disruptive behavior.  For example, to minimize complications from wandering, family members can place an identification bracelet on the person or purchase or rent a monitoring device.  Learning more about how to care for people with dementia may delay the need for a long-term care facility.  Caregiver burnout Avoiding Caregiver Burnout : Strongly motivated family members can usually provide elaborate and detailed care.  However, providing such care can wear them out physically and emotionally.  Talking with health care practitioners can help.  They can provide information about caregiving support groups and about groups that provide temporary (respite) care.  Financial issues: People can buy long-term care insurance that covers care in the home.  This care typically involves helping people with personal care, such as bathing, grooming, and eating.  Such insurance may enable people to postpone going to a long-term care facility.  Hospice care When people have a progressive, incurable disorder and death is expected in the near future, hospice care Hospice is a concept and a program of care that is specifically designed to minimize suffering for dying people and their family members. \n【11】 Hospice care may be provided in a Person's home Nursing home Hospice facility The hospice care team usually involves a primary care practitioner, nurse, social worker, and others who are trained to care for dying people.  Pharmacists, counselors, physical therapists, ethicists, and trained volunteers may also be involved.  Hospice personnel are needed to make sure that all of the person's physical and psychologic needs are met as well as the needs of the family and caregivers.  Most people who receive hospice care do not have to go to a hospital before they die.  Thus, they can die in a more comfortable, intimate environment, often with loved ones around them.  Hospice care also involves helping family members recognize the physical signs that death is near, understand what to do when the person dies, and help them cope with the loss.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 22:29:12"}

Ultrasound guidance can facilitate peripheral vein catheterization, especially of deep, nonpalpable veins.  This topic will focus on the use of ultrasonography to guide IV placement.  The actual procedure for starting an IV is the same as when ultrasonography is not used and is described in detail in How To Do Peripheral Vein Cannulation.  How To Do Peripheral Vein Cannulation In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【1】 Indications Difficulty in identifying suitable peripheral veins for cannulation in patients who do not otherwise require a central venous catheter Contraindications Absolute contraindications None Relative contraindications Untrained or inexperienced ultrasound operator There are some relative contraindications to using certain sites Contraindications In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【2】 Complications None There are some complications of IV placement Complications In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【3】 Equipment In addition to standard equipment needed to start an IV Equipment In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【4】 The short-axis (transverse, cross-sectional) view usually is preferred because it is easy to obtain and is the best view for identifying veins and arteries and their orientation to each other.  However, the transverse view shows the needle only in cross-section (hyperechoic [white] dot), and the needle tip can be distinguished only by the appearance and disappearance of the white dot as the imaging plane traverses past needle tip.  The long-axis (longitudinal, in-plane) ultrasound view is technically more difficult to obtain (must keep probe, vein, and needle in one plane), but the entire needle (including the tip) is imaged continuously, which ensures accurate intraluminal placement.  Increasing narrowness of peripheral veins increases the difficulty of obtaining the longitudinal view.  Relevant Anatomy Peripheral veins may be superficial or deep.  Typically, ultrasonographic guidance is needed when superficial veins are not visible or palpable.  Typical targets for ultrasound-guided IV placement include Deep forearm veins The brachial vein (there are typically 2 brachial veins that lie on either side of the brachial artery in the medial upper arm) Positioning Rest the body part being cannulated on a comfortable surface, and adjust the position to optimally expose the site (eg, to cannulate a brachial vein or the basilic vein, abduct and externally rotate the arm to expose the medial upper arm).  Step-by-Step Description of Procedure The procedure for preparing the site and inserting and securing the IV catheter Step-by-Step Description of Procedure In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【5】 Prepare the ultrasonography device and identify a candidate vein Check that the ultrasound machine is configured and functioning correctly: Set the machine to 2-D mode or B mode and\n【6】 Set maximum depth at the surface of a bone, so as to view the entire field.  Slowly slide the probe from proximal to distal along the veins, and adjust/rotate the probe so that the vein is under the center of the probe.  Adjust maximum depth to roughly twice the distance from the surface to the candidate vein.  After identifying a suitable cannulation site, remove the tourniquet.  Generally, veins are larger, thin-walled, and ovoid (rather than thick-walled and round) and are more easily compressed (ie, by pressing with the probe) than arteries.  Press lightly to avoid distorting or hiding the venous lumen.  Venous thrombosis disqualifies the vein for cannulation; it may appear as an echogenicity (gray irregularity) in the lumen but often is diagnosed because the thrombosed vein is incompressible.  Insert the peripheral venous catheter using ultrasound guidance Prepare your IV equipment and the insertion site Step-by-Step Description of Procedure In peripheral vein cannulation, a plastic catheter (cannula) is inserted into a peripheral vein, typically using a catheter-over-needle device. \n【7】 Reapply the tourniquet proximal to the anticipated needle-insertion point.  Two layers of gel are used.  Apply one layer to the probe tip, and cover it with a sterile transparent dressing—tightly applied to eliminate air bubbles underneath.  Then apply sterile lubricant to the covered tip.  Begin with the transverse (short-axis) view: Place the probe tip on the skin, transverse to the vein.  Select a segment of the vein as the target entry site and center this image on the ultrasound screen, which centers the vein under the probe.  Move the probe to a preliminary position just distal to the target vein entrance site.  Insert the angiocatheter, with the needle bevel facing up, into the skin.  Very slightly tilt the probe away from you, thereby fanning the imaging plane toward the angiocatheter to identify its tip.  Once the tip is identified, move the probe proximally a couple of millimeters (closer to the intended target entrance site on the vein).  Keep the probe still and advance the angiocatheter while watching the screen until the bright white dot representing the tip of angiocatheter again appears.  Repeat the process to advance the angiocatheter.  You may prefer to maintain the transverse (cross-section) view throughout the cannulation.  Slightly tilt the probe fore-and-aft as you advance the angiocatheter to continually reidentify the needle tip (disappearing/reappearing white dot) as it approaches the vein.  Or, you may prefer to switch to the longitudinal (long-axis) view to see the angiocatheter lengthwise as it approaches and enters the vein.  Turn the probe 90 degrees and move the probe slightly laterally as needed to maintain full longitudinal (in-plane) images of both the angiocatheter and the vein.  As the angiocatheter meets the vein, you should see the needle first indent the superficial wall and then pop through the wall to enter the lumen.  A simultaneous flash of dark red blood in the barrel of the syringe confirms intraluminal placement.  Follow standard procedures for advancing the catheter, ensuring intravascular placement, wiping away ultrasound gel before securing the catheter, and beginning any infusion.  Aftercare Replace or remove catheters within 72 hours of placement.  Tips and Tricks Copious gel or lubricant is not necessary and can obscure the probe center marker.  Gel from single-use packets is preferred over bottled ultrasound gel.  Warnings and Common Errors Always maintain ultrasound visualization of the needle tip during insertion.  A needle can appear to be within the lumen of the vein without actually puncturing the vein.  Continue to advance the catheter within the vein under ultrasound guidance until a pop is felt or a flash of blood is seen in the catheter chamber.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#5#5#Set the machine to 2-D mode or B mode and  后面缺少内容\n ", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:02:34"}

People have over 20,000 different genes. \n【1】 The most common tumors are made out of blood vessels (angiomas) and form in the brain and back of the eyes (retina).  Other types of tumors form in the adrenal glands, kidney, liver, and pancreas.  The tumors may or may not be cancerous.  Symptoms depend on the location of the tumors and typically appear between ages 10 and 30 Genetic testing is done on your child and also on all members of the immediate family Treatment is surgery to remove tumors when possible Your child will need frequent imaging studies to identify tumors because early treatment is most effective People with von Hippel-Lindau disease are at risk of kidney cancer as they get older.  What causes von Hippel-Lindau disease? Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a genetic disorder What is a genetic disorder? Your genes are the chemical codes that control everything about how your body works, how it's made, and what it looks like. \n【2】 Sometimes, the baby inherited the abnormal gene from a parent.  Other times, the baby is the first person in the family to have the abnormal gene.  What are the symptoms of von Hippel-Lindau disease? Symptoms usually begin to show between the ages of 10 and 30 years.  Symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumors.  Your child may: Have headaches Feel dizzy and weak Have high blood pressure Have difficulty hearing Have vision loss, if a tumor in the back of the eye enlarges What are the tests for von Hippel-Lindau disease? If doctors suspect your child has von Hippel-Lindau disease, they do: Eye exams CT scans Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles.  A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your body. \n【3】 A computer records changes in the magnetic field around your body. \n【4】 They also do genetic tests to check for the abnormal gene.  Family members also need to be examined and have tests to see if they have the disorder too.  Because tumors can appear later on, people are checked regularly for tumors.  How do doctors treat von Hippel-Lindau disease? Tumors are removed with surgery Sometimes tumors are treated with radiation Therapy is a cancer treatment that uses beams of radiation to destroy cancer cells and shrink cancer tumors. \n【5】 There's no cure, but treatment can help your child avoid blindness or brain damage.

It occurs because the ovaries no longer release eggs (ovulation) regularly and stop producing the usual premenopausal levels of reproductive hormones.  Some women have no symptoms except absence of menstrual periods, but others have infertility or the same symptoms as those of natural menopause (such as hot flashes or night sweats).  Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis, and other tests are done to identify the cause.  Various measures, including estrogen (typically taken until about age 51, when menopause occurs on average), can relieve or reduce symptoms.  To become pregnant, women with premature menopause may be given fertility treatments (such as using eggs from another woman implanted in their uterus).  Hormonally, premature menopause resembles natural menopause Perimenopause symptoms Menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility. \n【1】 The ovaries produce very little or no estrogen.  Ovulation completely or almost completely stops.  However, sometimes the ovaries start functioning again for a short time and can release an egg, making pregnancy possible.  The ovaries still contain thousands of eggs.  Premature menopause does not imply that a woman is aging prematurely.  It means only that her ovaries are no longer functioning normally.  Causes of Premature Menopause has many causes: Genetic abnormalities: Chromosomes, including the sex chromosomes, may be abnormal.  Sex chromosome abnormalities include Turner syndrome is a sex chromosome abnormality in which girls are born with one of their two X chromosomes partially or completely missing. \n【2】 Autoimmune disorder Autoimmune Disorders An autoimmune disorder is a malfunction of the body's immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues.  What triggers an autoimmune disorder is not known. \n【3】 Metabolic disorders such as enzyme deficiencies Viral infections: Mumps is a contagious viral infection that causes painful enlargement of the salivary glands.  The infection may also affect the testes, brain, and pancreas, especially in adults. \n【4】 Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer Surgical removal of the ovaries: Surgery to remove both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy) ends menstrual periods and causes menopause.  Surgical removal of the uterus: Surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) ends menstrual periods but does not cause most of the other symptoms of menopause as long as the ovaries are functioning.  Toxins: Tobacco is an example.  If the cause is a disorder that confers a Y chromosome, the risk of cancer of the ovaries is increased.  Symptoms of Premature Menopause Some women may have no symptoms, except that menstrual periods become lighter or irregular, or stop .  Other women have infertility Overview of Infertility is usually defined as the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 1 year of regular sexual intercourse without birth control. \n【5】 Women may have symptoms of the disorder that caused premature menopause.  For example, if Turner syndrome is a sex chromosome abnormality in which girls are born with one of their two X chromosomes partially or completely missing. \n【6】 If premature menopause is caused by an autoimmune process, women may also have other autoimmune disorders.  such as thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis is chronic, autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid gland. \n【7】 Patches of whitened skin are present on various parts of the body. \n【8】 Addison disease can be life threatening.  The lack of estrogen may lead to decreased bone density  and thinning and drying of the lining of the vagina (vaginal atrophy).  The risk of other conditions ,such as depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder. \n【9】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. \n【10】 Diagnosis of Premature Menopause A pregnancy test Measurement of hormone levels Additional tests to identify the cause Sometimes genetic testing and chromosome analysis Doctors suspect premature menopause when a woman younger than 40 has menopausal symptoms, or few or no periods, or cannot become pregnant.  A pregnancy test is done to make sure that pregnancy is not the reason for periods stopping.  Then, levels of estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone (which stimulates the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone) are measured.  These measurements may need to be repeated weekly for several weeks to confirm the diagnosis of premature menopause.  Additional tests may be done to help doctors identify the cause of premature menopause or associated disorders and thus evaluate a woman’s health risks and recommend treatment.  For example, if doctors suspect a woman also has thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis is chronic, autoimmune inflammation of the thyroid gland. \n【11】 Genetic counseling and testing are done if women have cognitive disability, tremor, or loss of balance (ataxia) or have a close relative with premature menopause or if they are younger than 35.  A blood test for antimüllerian hormone (which is produced in the ovaries) can be done to evaluate how well the ovaries are functioning and to estimate the chances that a woman will be able to become pregnant after treatment with fertility medications.  Bone density may be measured to check for osteoporosis. \n【12】 Then, doctors decide whether to continue the treatments based on a woman's individual circumstances.  Estrogen therapy helps relieve symptoms and helps prevent other effects of menopause (such as vaginal dryness, and mood swings).  It also helps maintain bone density (to prevent osteoporosis).  Because taking estrogen alone increases the risk of cancer of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer), most women should also take a progestin or progesterone with the estrogen to help protect against this cancer.  Women who have had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) do not need to take a progestin or progesterone.  If a woman with premature menopause wishes to become pregnant, doctors may recommend in vitro (test tube) fertilization Assisted Reproductive Technologies involve working with sperm and eggs or embryos in a laboratory (in vitro) with the goal of producing a pregnancy. \n【13】 These eggs are implanted in the uterus after they have been fertilized in the laboratory.  This technique gives women with premature menopause about a 50% chance (sometimes even higher) of becoming pregnant.  Otherwise the chance of becoming pregnant is about 5 to 10%.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:13:37"}

Causes include chronic disorders (eg, cancer, arthritis, diabetes), injuries (eg, herniated disk, torn ligament), and many primary pain disorders (eg, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, chronic headache).  Various drugs and psychologic treatments are used.   Unresolved, long-lasting disorders (eg, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, herniated disk) that produce ongoing nociceptive stimuli may account completely for chronic pain.  Alternatively, injury, even mild injury, may lead to long-lasting changes (sensitization) in the nervous system—from peripheral receptors to the cerebral cortex—that may produce persistent pain in the absence of ongoing nociceptive stimuli.  With sensitization, discomfort that is due to a nearly resolved disorder and might otherwise be perceived as mild or trivial is instead perceived as significant pain.  In some cases (eg, chronic back pain after injury), the original precipitant of pain is obvious; in others , the precipitant is remote or occult.  Psychologic factors may amplify persistent pain.  Thus, chronic pain may appear out of proportion to identifiable physical processes.  Chronic pain commonly leads to or exacerbates psychologic problems (eg, depression, anxiety).  Distinguishing psychologic cause from effect is often difficult, but if pain, depression, and anxiety co-exist, they typically intensify the overall pain experience.  Various factors in the patient’s environment (eg, family members, friends) may reinforce behaviors that perpetuate chronic pain. \n【1】 Prevalence is 2 to 3%.  It is more common among women; however, with the newer diagnostic criteria, which de-emphasizes the need for a set number of local tender points, more men are now being diagnosed with fibromyalgia than in the past and the gender gap has decreased.  The pathophysiology is unknown, but a central sensitization syndrome with impairment of pain regulation may be involved, and the nociceptive pathways and processing centers are primed and over-reactive to stimuli.  The diagnosis is clinical, and there are no confirmatory diagnostic tests.  However, several organizations have developed specific diagnostic criteria . \n【2】 2.

Arthritis Care & Research 73 : 617–625, 2021.  Symptoms and Signs of Chronic Pain often leads to vegetative signs (eg, lassitude, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite, loss of taste for food, weight loss, diminished libido, constipation), which develop gradually.  Constant, unremitting pain may lead to depression and anxiety and interfere with almost all activities.  Patients may become inactive, withdraw socially, and become preoccupied with physical health.  Psychologic and social impairment may be severe, causing virtual lack of function.  Diagnosis of Chronic Pain Evaluation for physical cause initially and if symptoms change The etiology of chronic pain should be evaluated appropriately and characterized to, if possible, arrive at a diagnosis.  However, once a full evaluation is done, repeating tests in the absence of new findings is not useful.  The best approach is often to stop testing and focus on relieving pain and restoring function.  The effect of pain on the patient’s life should be evaluated; evaluation by an occupational therapist may be necessary.  Formal psychiatric evaluation should be considered if a coexisting psychiatric disorder ,eg, major depression (unipolar disorder) Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. \n【3】 Fear is an emotional, physical, and behavioral response to an immediately recognizable external threat  is suspected as cause or effect.  Pain relief and functional improvement are unlikely if concomitant psychiatric disorders are not managed.  Treatment of Chronic Pain Often multimodal therapy (eg, analgesics, physical methods, psychologic treatments) Specific causes of chronic pain should be treated.  Early, aggressive treatment of acute pain is always preferable and may limit or prevent sensitization and remodeling and thus prevent progression to chronic pain.  However, once chronic pain is established and persists, multimodal treatment strategies are needed.  Drugs or physical methods may be used; psychologic and behavioral therapies are usually helpful.  If patients have marked functional impairment or do not respond to a reasonable attempt at management by their physician, they may benefit from the multidisciplinary approach available at a pain clinic.  Goals shift from totally eliminating pain to limiting its effects and optimizing function and quality of life.  Drugs Analgesics include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  Opioid analgesics Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the main drugs used to treat pain. \n【4】 Adjuvant analgesics are most commonly used for neuropathic pain.  Opioid analgesics are useful in managing chronic pain due to cancer or other terminal disorders.  There is insufficient evidence to support opioid therapy for long-term management of chronic pain due to nonterminal disorders; nondrug and nonopioid drug treatments are generally preferred.  However, for persistent, moderate-to-severe pain that impairs function, opioids may be considered, usually as adjunctive therapy, when potential benefits are expected to exceed risks.  Opioids should not be used to manage fibromyalgia.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain.  Factors to consider before prescribing opioids include the following: What conventional treatment practice is Whether other treatments are reasonable Whether the patient has an unusually high risk of adverse effects from an opioid Whether the patient is at risk of misuse, diversion, or abuse  If opioids are prescribed for chronic pain, physicians should take several steps: Provide education and counseling: Patients should be counseled about the risks of combining opioids with alcohol and anxiolytics and of self-adjusting dosing.  Patients should be taught about the need for safe, secure storage and ways to correctly dispose of unused drugs.  They should be instructed not to share opioids and to contact their physician if they experience sedation.  Assess risk factors for misuse, diversion, and abuse: Risk factors include prior or current alcohol or drug abuse; family history of alcohol or drug abuse; and a prior or current major psychiatric disorder.  Presence of risk factors does not always contraindicate opioid use.  However, if patients have risk factors, they should be referred to a pain management specialist, or the physician should take special precautions to deter misuse, diversion, and abuse; these measures can include prescribing only small amounts (requiring frequent visits for refills), not refilling prescriptions allegedly lost, and using urine drug screening before first prescribing opioids and periodically (eg, at least yearly) thereafter to confirm that the prescribed opioid is being taken and not diverted to others.  Check data in monitoring programs for controlled substance use: The patient's history of controlled substance use can be reviewed through state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs).  Current recommendations are to screen with the PDMP when prescribing opioids initially and when refilling each prescription or at least every 3 months.  Have the patient sign an opioid contract and give informed consent: An opioid contract includes safety precautions for prescribing opioids, the patient's responsibilities to ensure safe use, and measures to prevent aberrant use (ie, opioid tapering).  Informed consent is obtained, when possible, to help clarify the goals, expectations, and risks of treatment, as well as the possible use of nonopioid treatment alternatives.  Current guidelines emphasize that when starting opioids for chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of long-acting opioids .  Also, using the lowest effective dose (even for immediate-release opioids) is preferred over transitioning to a long-acting opioid Previously, long-acting opioids were preferred to immediate-release opioids for the treatment of chronic pain; however, doses of long-acting opioids are often higher, and they may have more adverse effects and greater potential for misuse.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain  recommend the following: Limiting total daily oral morphine milligram equivalents (OMME Equianalgesic Doses of Opioid Analgesics*,† ) to < 50 when possible Considering the individual harm/benefit ratio at doses > 50 OMME daily When possible, avoiding doses > 90 OMME daily Weighing the needs for analgesia and functional improvement against the risks of higher-dose therapy before justifying daily doses > 90 OMME Tapering and then stopping opioid therapy if the goals for pain relief and functional improvement are not met or if maintaining them requires dose escalation Buprenorphine or methadone should be prescribed only by clinicians trained in the unique qualities and risks of these drugs.  Follow-up includes regularly reassessing the extent of pain reduction, functional improvement, and adverse effects and checking for signs suggesting misuse, diversion, or abuse.  For example, patients should be reassessed within 4 weeks of starting opioids, when the dose is increased, and at least every 3 months.  Potential benefits and risks of opioid dose should be reassessed if the opioid dose exceeds 50 mg OMME/day.  Doses exceeding 90 mg OMME/day should be avoided when possible.  Naloxone should be considered if patients are at risk of overdose but still require opioid therapy: Clinicians should discuss the risks of overdose and respiratory depression with the patient and family members.  Risk factors for overdose include comorbidities, unavoidable concomitant drug usage (eg, benzodiazepines), prior history of overdose or substance use disorder, and use of high-dose opioids (≥ 50 OMME).  The patient and family members should be taught how to administer naloxone.  Opioids have different potencies based on their ability to bind to opioid receptors and the efficiency of oral absorption of the opioid versus direct injection into the vasculature.  Understanding the interrelationship of these potencies is essential if patients need to be transitioned from one opioid to another or from an oral to an IV form.  For example, 30 mg of oral morphine is equivalent to 10 mg of IV morphine (a 3:1 oral-to-IV ratio) 20 mg of oral oxycodone 7. 5 mg of oral hydromorphone To allow comparison of opioid use and risk, clinicians should consider the overall dosage of different forms as a uniform variable.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) structured its guidelines for opioid use and risk around the daily oral morphine milligram equivalents (OMME) taken by a patient.  For example, a patient taking 10 mg of oral oxycodone 4 times a day is taking 40 mg of oral oxycodone a day.  Based on the equianalgesic dosage conversion in the table below (20 mg oral oxycodone equals 30 mg of oral morphine), 40 mg of oral oxycodone is equivalent to 60 mg of oral morphine a day (60 mg OMME).  A patient taking 4 mg of oral hydromorphone 4 times a day (16 mg a day) is taking an OMME of 64 mg (from the table below); 7. 5 mg of oral hydromorphone equals 30 mg of oral morphine (simplified to 1 mg of oral hydromorphone equals 4 mg of oral morphine).   As pain lessens, patients usually need help reducing use of opioids.  If depression coexists with pain, antidepressants should be used.  Physical methods Many patients with chronic pain benefit from physical therapy (PT) Physical therapy aims to improve joint and muscle function (eg, range of motion, strength) and thus improve the patient’s ability to stand, balance, walk, and climb stairs. \n【5】 Spray-and-stretch techniques can relieve myofascial trigger points.  Some patients require an orthosis.  Spinal cord stimulation may be appropriate.  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation Electrical stimulation Treatment of pain and inflammation aims to facilitate movement and improve coordination of muscles and joints. \n【6】 Techniques include acupuncture, a therapy within traditional Chinese medicine, is one of the most widely accepted components of integrative therapies in the western world. \n【7】 Psychologic and behavioral therapies Behavioral therapy can improve patient function, even without reducing pain.  Patients should keep a diary of daily activities to pinpoint areas amenable to change.  The physician should make specific recommendations for gradually increasing physical activity and social engagement.  Activities should be prescribed in gradually increasing units of time; pain should not, if at all possible, be allowed to abort the commitment to greater function.  When activities are increased in this way, reports of pain often decrease.  Various cognitive-behavioral techniques of pain control ,eg, relaxation training Relaxation Techniques, a type of mind-body medicine, are practices specifically designed to relieve tension and strain. \n【8】 Patients may be taught to use distraction by guided imagery, a type of mind-body medicine, involves using mental images, self-directed or guided, to help patients relax (eg, before a procedure) and to promote wellness and healing .  Other cognitive-behavioral techniques (eg, self-hypnosis) may require training by specialists.  Behavior of family members or fellow workers that reinforces pain behavior (eg, constant inquiries about the patient’s health or insistence that the patient do no chores) should be discouraged.  The physician should avoid reinforcing pain behavior, discourage maladaptive behaviors, applaud progress, and provide pain treatment while emphasizing return of function.  Pain rehabilitation programs are multidisciplinary programs for patients with chronic pain.  These programs include education, cognitive-behavioral therapy, physical therapy, drug regimen simplification, and sometimes detoxification and tapering of analgesics.  They focus on Restoring function Improving quality of life Helping patients control their own life\n【9】Key Points Nociceptive stimuli, sensitization of the nervous system, and psychologic factors can contribute to chronic pain.  Distinguishing between the psychologic causes and effects of chronic pain may be difficult.  Seek a physical cause even if psychologic factors are prominent, and always evaluate the effect of pain on the patient's life.  Treat poorly controlled pain with multimodal therapy (eg, appropriate physical, psychologic, behavioral, and interventional treatments; drugs).  More Information CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain: Goals of the guideline are to explain the benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, to make the treatment of chronic pain safer and more effective, and to reduce risks of long-term opioid treatment.  Recommendations include preferentially using nonopioid therapy for managing chronic pain, using opioids only when benefits are expected to outweigh risks, establishing treatment goals with patients before starting opioids, and prescribing the lowest effective dosage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#2#2#2.

Most dramatically increased are: C-reactive protein (CRP) Serum amyloid A Other acute phase reactants include: Mannose-binding lectin Serum amyloid P component Alpha-1 acid glycoprotein Fibrinogen C-reactive protein,mannose-binding lectin, and serum amyloid P component activate complement and act as opsonins.  Serum amyloid A and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein are transport proteins, and fibrinogen is a coagulation factor.  Elevated C-reactive protein levels are a nonspecific indicator of infection or inflammation.  Increased fibrinogen levels are the main reason the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated in acute inflammation.  Many acute phase reactants are made in the liver.  Collectively, they may help limit tissue injury, enhance host resistance to infection, and promote tissue repair and resolution of inflammation.  Antibodies act as the antigen receptor on the surface of B cells The immune system consists of cellular components and molecular components that work together to destroy antigens. \n【2】 Antibodies recognize specific configurations (epitopes, or antigenic determinants) on the surfaces of antigens (eg, proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids).  Antibodies and antigens fit tightly together because their shape and other surface properties (eg, charge) are complementary.  The same antibody molecule can cross-react with related antigens if their epitopes are similar enough to those of the original antigen.  Antibody structure Antibodies consist of 4 polypeptide chains (2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains) joined by disulfide bonds to produce a Y configuration The heavy and light chains are divided into a variable (V) region and a constant (C) region.  B-cell receptor The B-cell receptor consists of an Ig molecule anchored to the cell’s surface.  CH = heavy chain constant region; CL = light chain constant region; Fab = antigen-binding fragment; Fc = crystallizable fragment; Ig = immunoglobulin; L-kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) = 2 types of light chains; VH = heavy chain variable region; VL = light chain variable region.  V regions are located at the amino-terminal ends of the Y arms; they are called variable because the amino acids they contain are different in different antibodies.  Within the V regions, hypervariable regions determine the specificity of the immunoglobulin (Ig).  They also function as antigens (idiotypic determinants) to which certain natural (anti-idiotype) antibodies can bind; this binding may help regulate B-cell responses.  The C region of the heavy chains contains a relatively constant sequence of amino acids (isotype) that is distinctive for each Ig class.  A B cell can change the isotype it produces and thus switch the class of Ig it produces.  Because the Ig retains the variable part of the heavy chain V region and the entire light chain, it retains its antigenic specificity.  The amino-terminal (variable) end of the antibody binds to antigen to form an antibody-antigen complex.  The antigen-binding (Fab) portion of Ig consists of a light chain and part of a heavy chain and contains the V region of the Ig molecule (ie, the combining sites).  The crystallizable fragment (Fc) contains most of the C region of the heavy chains; Fc is responsible for complement activation and binds to Fc receptors on cells.  Antibody classes Antibodies are divided into 5 classes: IgM IgG IgA IgD IgE The classes are defined by their type of heavy chain: mu (μ) for IgM, gamma (γ) for IgG, alpha (α) for IgA, epsilon (ε) for IgE, and delta (δ) for IgD.  There are also 2 types of light chains: kappa (κ) and lambda (λ).  Each of the 5 Ig classes can bear either kappa or lambda light chains.  IgM is the first antibody formed after exposure to new antigen.  It has 5 Y-shaped molecules (10 heavy chains and 10 light chains), linked by a single joining (J) chain.  IgM circulates primarily in the intravascular space; it complexes with and agglutinates antigens and can activate complement, thereby facilitating phagocytosis.  Isohemagglutinins are predominantly IgM.  Monomeric IgM acts as a surface antigen receptor on B cells. \n【3】 IgG is the most prevalent Ig isotype in serum and is present in intravascular and extravascular spaces.  It coats antigen to activate complement and facilitate phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages.  IgG is the primary circulating Ig produced after reexposure to antigen (secondary immune response) and is the predominant isotype contained in commercial gamma-globulin products.  IgG protects against bacteria, viruses, and toxins; it is the only Ig isotype that crosses the placenta.  Therefore, this class of antibody is important for protecting neonates, but pathogenic IgG antibodies (eg, anti-Rh0[D] antibodies, stimulatory anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor autoantibodies), if present in the mother, can potentially cause significant disease in the fetus.  There are 4 subclasses of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.  They are numbered in descending order of serum concentration.  IgG subclasses differ functionally mainly in their ability to activate complement; IgG1 and IgG3 are most efficient, IgG2 is less efficient, and IgG4 is inefficient.  IgG1 and IgG3 are efficient mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; IgG4 and IgG2 are less so.  IgA occurs at mucosal surfaces, in serum, and in secretions (saliva; tears; respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tract secretions; colostrum), where it provides an early antibacterial and antiviral defense.  J chain links IgA into a dimer to form secretory IgA.  Secretory IgA is synthesized by plasma cells in the subepithelial regions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.  Selective IgA deficiency is an IgA level < 7 mg/dL (< 70 mg/L, < 0. 4375 micromol/liter) with normal IgG and IgM levels.  It is the most common primary immunodeficiency. \n【4】 IgD is coexpressed with IgM on the surface of naive B cells.  Whether these 2 classes function differently on the surface of the B cell and, if so, how differently is unclear.  They may simply be an example of molecular degeneracy.  Serum IgD levels are very low, and any unique function of circulating IgD is unknown.  IgE is present in low levels in serum and in respiratory and gastrointestinal mucous secretions.  IgE binds with high affinity to receptors present in high levels on mast cells and basophils and to a lesser extent on several other hematopoietic cells, including dendritic cells.  If antigen bridges 2 IgE molecules bound to the mast cell or basophil surface, the cells degranulate, releasing chemical mediators that cause an inflammatory response. \n【5】 Cytokines are polypeptides secreted by immune and other cells when the cell interacts with a specific antigen, with pathogen-associated molecules such as endotoxin, or with other cytokines.  Main categories include Chemokines Hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors Interleukins (IL) Interferons (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma) Transforming growth factors (TGFs) Tumor necrosis factors (TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-alpha, lymphotoxin-beta) Although lymphocyte interaction with a specific antigen triggers cytokine secretion, cytokines themselves are not antigen-specific; thus, they bridge innate and acquired immunity and generally influence the magnitude of inflammatory or immune responses.  They act sequentially, synergistically, or antagonistically.  They may act in an autocrine or paracrine manner.  Cytokines deliver their signals via cell surface receptors.  For example, the IL-2 receptor consists of 3 chains: alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ).  The receptor’s affinity for IL-2 is High if all 3 chains are expressed Intermediate if only the beta and gamma chains are expressed Low if only the alpha chain is expressed Mutations or deletion of the gamma chain is the basis for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) Severe combined immunodeficiency is characterized by low to absent T cells and a low, high, or normal number of B cells and natural killer cells. \n【6】 Chemokines induce chemotaxis and migration of leukocytes.  There are 4 subsets (C, CC, CXC, CX3C), defined by the number and spacing of their amino terminal cysteine residues.  Chemokine receptors (CCR5 on memory T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells; CXCR4 on resting T cells) act as co-receptors for entry of HIV into cells.

The layers of cells lining the alveoli and the surrounding capillaries are each only one cell thick and are in very close contact with each other.  This barrier between air and blood averages about 1 micron (1/10,000 of a centimeter, or 0. 000039 inch) in thickness.  Oxygen passes quickly through this air-blood barrier into the blood in the capillaries.  Similarly, carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli and is then exhaled.  Oxygenated blood travels from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and into the left side of the heart, which pumps the blood to the rest of the body The heart pumps the blood to the lungs so it can pick up oxygen and then pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. \n【2】 Oxygen-deficient, carbon dioxide-rich blood returns to the right side of the heart through two large veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava.  Then the blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide.  To support the absorption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide, about 5 to 8 liters (about 1. 3 to 2. 1 gallons) of air per minute are brought in and out of the lungs, and about three tenths of a liter (about three tenths of a quart) of oxygen is transferred from the alveoli to the blood each minute, even when the person is at rest.  At the same time, a similar volume of carbon dioxide moves from the blood to the alveoli and is exhaled.  During exercise, it is possible to breathe in and out more than 100 liters (about 26 gallons) of air per minute and extract 3 liters (a little less than 1 gallon) of oxygen from this air per minute.  The rate at which oxygen is used by the body is one measure of the rate of energy expended by the body.  Breathing in and out is accomplished by respiratory muscles Control of Breathing is usually automatic, controlled subconsciously by the respiratory center at the base of the brain.  Breathing continues during sleep and usually even when a person is unconscious. \n【3】 Gas Exchange Between Alveolar Spaces and Capillaries The function of the respiratory system is to move two gases: oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Gas exchange takes place in the millions of alveoli in the lungs and the capillaries that envelop them.  As shown below, inhaled oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood in the capillaries, and carbon dioxide moves from the blood in the capillaries to the air in the alveoli.  Three processes are essential for the transfer of oxygen from the outside air to the blood flowing through the lungs: ventilation, diffusion, and perfusion.  Ventilation is the process by which air moves in and out of the lungs.  Diffusion is the spontaneous movement of gases, without the use of any energy or effort by the body, between the alveoli and the capillaries in the lungs.  Perfusion is the process by which the cardiovascular system pumps blood throughout the lungs.  The body's circulation is an essential link between the atmosphere, which contains oxygen, and the cells of the body, which consume oxygen.  For example, the delivery of oxygen to the muscle cells throughout the body depends not only on the lungs but also on the ability of the blood to carry oxygen and on the ability of the circulation to transport blood to muscle.  In addition, a small fraction of the blood pumped from the heart Function of the Heart and blood vessels constitute the cardiovascular (circulatory) system.

The following types of hypersensitivity reactions Classification of Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic (including atopic) and other hypersensitivity disorders are inappropriate or exaggerated immune reactions to foreign antigens. \n【1】 Type III: The mechanism of injury involves deposition of antibody-antigen complexes.  Type IV: Injury is T-cell–mediated.   Specific autoimmune disorders in THE MANUAL include the following: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoantibodies that react with red blood cells at temperatures ≥ 37° C (warm antibody hemolytic anemia) or < 37° C (cold agglutinin disease). \n【2】 Mucous membrane involvement is rare. \n【3】 Findings include painless thyroid enlargement and symptoms of hypothyroidism. \n【4】 Rheumatoid arthritis causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. \n【5】 Etiology of Autoimmune Disorders Mechanisms Several mechanisms may account for the body’s attack on itself: Autoantigens may become immunogenic if they are altered in some way.  Antibodies to a foreign antigen may cross-react with an unaltered autoantigen (eg, antibodies to streptococcal M protein may cross-react with human heart muscle).  Autoantigens normally sequestered from the immune system can become exposed and cause an autoimmune reaction (eg, systemic release of melanin-containing uveal cells after eye trauma triggers sympathetic ophthalmia).  Autoantigens may be altered chemically, physically, or biologically: Chemical: Certain chemicals can bind with body proteins, making them immunogenic, as occurs in some cases of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoantibodies that react with red blood cells at temperatures ≥ 37° C (warm antibody hemolytic anemia) or < 37° C (cold agglutinin disease). \n【6】 Physical: For example, ultraviolet light induces keratinocyte apoptosis and subsequent altered immunogenicity of autoantigens, resulting in photosensitivity, as can occur in cutaneous lupus erythematosus Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women. \n【7】 Biologic: For example, in animal models, persistent infection with an RNA virus that combines with host tissues alters autoantigens biologically, resulting in an autoimmune disorder resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women. \n【8】 Genetic factors Relatives of patients with autoimmune disorders often also have autoantibodies.  The specificity of autoantibodies in patients and in their relatives is frequently, but not always, similar.  If one twin has an autoimmune disorder, the other twin is more likely to have it if they are identical rather than fraternal twins.  Most autoimmune disorders have a polygenic etiology, and allelic variants within the HLA-gene locus nearly always contribute.  Defense mechanisms Normally, potentially pathologic autoimmune reactions are avoided because of the immunologic tolerance mechanisms of clonal deletion and clonal anergy.  Any autoreactive lymphocytes not controlled by these mechanisms are usually restrained by Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.  A regulatory T-cell defect may interfere with any of these protective mechanisms, resulting in autoimmunity.  Anti-idiotype antibodies (antibodies to the antigen-combining site of other antibodies) may interfere with regulation of antibody activity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 01:12:26"}

It is typically precipitated by exertion or psychologic stress and relieved by rest or sublingual nitroglycerin.  Diagnosis is by symptoms, electrocardiography, and myocardial imaging.  Treatment may include antiplatelet drugs, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.   Etiology of Angina Pectoris occurs when Cardiac workload and resultant myocardial oxygen demand exceed the ability of coronary arteries to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood Such imbalance between supply and demand can occur when the arteries are narrowed.  Narrowing usually results from Coronary artery atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries. \n【1】 Symptoms include angina at rest and rarely with exertion. \n【2】 Because myocardial oxygen demand is determined mainly by heart rate, systolic wall tension, and contractility, narrowing of a coronary artery typically results in angina that occurs during exertion and is relieved by rest.  In addition to exertion, cardiac workload can be increased by disorders such as hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both.  Hypertension with no known cause  is narrowing of the aortic valve, obstructing blood flow from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta during systole. \n【3】 A decreased oxygen supply, as in severe anemia or hypoxia, can precipitate or aggravate angina.  Pathophysiology of Angina Pectoris Angina may be Stable Unstable In stable angina, the relationship between workload or demand and ischemia is usually relatively predictable.  Unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction.  Symptoms include chest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. \n【4】 Atherosclerotic arterial narrowing is not entirely fixed; it varies with the normal fluctuations in arterial tone that occur in all people.  Thus, more people have angina in the morning, when arterial tone is relatively high.  Also, abnormal endothelial function may contribute to variations in arterial tone; eg, in endothelium damaged by atheromas, stress of a catecholamine surge causes vasoconstriction rather than dilation (normal response).  As the myocardium becomes ischemic, coronary sinus blood pH falls, cellular potassium is lost, lactate accumulates, ECG abnormalities appear, and ventricular function (both systolic and diastolic) deteriorates.  Left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure usually increases during angina, sometimes inducing pulmonary congestion and dyspnea.  The exact mechanism by which ischemia causes discomfort is unclear but may involve nerve stimulation by hypoxic metabolites.  Symptoms and Signs of Angina Pectoris Angina may be a vague, barely troublesome ache or may rapidly become a severe, intense precordial crushing sensation.  It is rarely described as \"pain. \" Discomfort is most commonly felt beneath the sternum, although location varies.  Discomfort may radiate to the left shoulder and down the inside of the left arm, even to the fingers; straight through to the back; into the throat, jaws, and teeth; and, occasionally, down the inside of the right arm.  It may also be felt in the upper abdomen.  The discomfort of angina is never above the ears or below the umbilicus.  Women are more likely to have atypical symptoms such as burning or tenderness in the back, shoulders, arms, or jaw.  Atypical angina (eg, with bloating, gas, abdominal distress) may occur in some patients.  These patients often ascribe symptoms to indigestion; belching may even relieve the symptoms.  Other patients have dyspnea due to the sharp, reversible increase in LV filling pressure that often accompanies ischemia.  Frequently, the patient’s description is imprecise, and whether the problem is angina, dyspnea, or both may be difficult to determine.  Because ischemic symptoms require a minute or more to resolve, brief, fleeting sensations rarely represent angina.  Between and even during attacks of angina, physical findings may be normal.  However, during the attack, heart rate may increase modestly, blood pressure (BP) is often elevated, heart sounds become more distant, and the apical impulse is more diffuse.  The 2nd heart sound (S2) may become paradoxical because LV ejection is more prolonged during an ischemic attack.  A 4th heart sound (S4) is common, and a 3rd heart sound (S3) may develop.  A mid or late systolic apical murmur, shrill or blowing—but not especially loud—may occur if ischemia causes localized papillary muscle dysfunction, causing mitral regurgitation.  Angina pectoris is typically triggered by exertion or strong emotion, usually persists no more than a few minutes, and subsides with rest.  Response to exertion is usually predictable, but in some patients, exercise that is tolerated one day may precipitate angina the next because of variations in arterial tone.  Symptoms are exaggerated when exertion follows a meal or occurs in cold weather; walking into the wind or first contact with cold air after leaving a warm room may precipitate an attack.  Symptom severity is often classified by the degree of exertion resulting in angina  Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification System for Angina Pectoris Class Activities Triggering Chest Pain 1 Strenuous, rapid, or prolonged exertion Not usual physical activities (eg, walking, climbing stairs) 2 Walking rapidly Walking uphill Climbing stairs rapidly Walking or climbing stairs after meals Cold Wind Emotional stress 3 Walking, even 1 or 2 blocks at usual pace and on level ground Climbing stairs, even 1 flight 4 Any physical activity Sometimes occurring at rest \n【5】Attacks may vary from several a day to symptom-free intervals of weeks, months, or years.  Attacks may increase in frequency (called crescendo angina), leading to an MI or death.  Conversely, attacks may gradually decrease or disappear if adequate collateral coronary circulation develops, the ischemic area infarcts, or heart failure or intermittent claudication supervenes and limits activity.  Nocturnal angina may occur if a dream causes striking changes in respiration, pulse rate, and BP.  Nocturnal angina may also be a sign of recurrent LV failure, an equivalent of nocturnal dyspnea.  The recumbent position increases venous return, stretching the myocardium and increasing wall stress, which increases oxygen demand.  Angina decubitus is angina that occurs spontaneously during rest.  It is usually accompanied by a modestly increased heart rate and a sometimes markedly higher BP, which increase oxygen demand.  These increases may be the cause of rest angina or the result of ischemia induced by plaque rupture and thrombus formation.  If angina is not relieved, unmet myocardial oxygen demand increases further, making MI more likely.  Unstable angina Because angina characteristics are usually predictable for a given patient, any changes (ie, rest angina, new-onset angina, increasing angina) should be considered serious, especially when the angina is severe (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 3 or 4).  Such changes are termed unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction. \n【6】 Silent ischemia Patients with coronary artery disease  may have ischemia without symptoms.  Silent ischemia sometimes manifests as transient asymptomatic ST-T abnormalities seen during stress testing or 24-hour Holter monitoring.  Radionuclide studies can sometimes document asymptomatic myocardial ischemia during physical or mental stress.  Silent ischemia and angina pectoris may coexist, occurring at different times.  Prognosis depends on severity of the coronary artery disease.  Diagnosis of Angina Pectoris Typical symptoms Electrocardiography (ECG) Stress testing with ECG or imaging (using echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, positron emission tomography [PET], or MRI) CT angiography or CT fractional flow reserve (CT FFR) Coronary angiography for significant symptoms, positive stress test, or significant lesions noted on CT FFR.  Diagnosis of angina is suspected if chest discomfort is typical and is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest.  Presence in the history of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease Risk Factors Coronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. \n【7】 Patients whose chest discomfort lasts > 20 minutes or occurs during rest or who have syncope or heart failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. \n【8】 Chest discomfort Chest Pain is a very common complaint. \n【9】 Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders  Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a billowing of mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium during systole.  The most common cause is idiopathic myxomatous degeneration. \n【10】 Symptoms include palpitations and sometimes weakness, effort intolerance, dyspnea, and presyncope.  even when coronary blood flow is not compromised.  ECG is always done.  More specific tests include stress testing with ECG or with myocardial imaging (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, PET, MRI) and coronary angiography.  Noninvasive tests are considered first. \n【11】 Because angina resolves quickly with rest, ECG rarely can be done during an attack except during stress testing.  If done during an angina attack, ECG is likely to show reversible ischemic changes: T wave discordant to the QRS vector ST-segment depression (typically) ST-segment elevation Decreased R-wave height Intraventricular or bundle branch conduction disturbances Arrhythmia (usually ventricular extrasystoles) Between angina attacks, the ECG (and usually LV function) at rest is normal in about 30% of patients with a typical history of angina pectoris, even those with extensive 3-vessel disease.  In the remaining 70%, the ECG shows evidence of previous infarction, hypertrophy, or nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave (ST-T) abnormalities.  An abnormal resting ECG alone does not establish or refute the diagnosis. \n【12】 Exercise stress testing with ECG is done if a patient has a normal resting ECG and can exercise.  In men with chest discomfort suggesting angina, stress ECG testing has a specificity of 70%; sensitivity is 90%.  Sensitivity is similar in women, but specificity is lower, particularly in women < 55 (< 70%).  However, women are more likely than men to have an abnormal resting ECG when CAD is present (32% vs 23%).  Although sensitivity is reasonably high, exercise ECG can miss severe CAD (even left main or 3-vessel disease).  In patients with atypical symptoms, a negative stress ECG usually rules out angina pectoris and CAD; a positive result may or may not represent coronary ischemia and indicates need for further testing.  Stress testing with myocardial imaging is done when the resting ECG is abnormal because false-positive ST-segment shifts are common on the stress ECG.  Exercise or pharmacologic stress (eg, with dobutamine or dipyridamole infusion) may be used.  Imaging options include stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or PET, and stress MRI.  The choice of imaging technique depends on institutional availability and expertise.  Imaging tests can help assess LV function and response to stress; identify areas of ischemia, infarction, and viable tissue; and determine the site and extent of myocardium at risk.  Stress echocardiography can also detect ischemia-induced mitral regurgitation.  Angiography Coronary angiography Cardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiac chambers, the pulmonary artery, and coronary arteries and veins. \n【13】 It is indicated primarily to locate and assess severity of coronary artery lesions when revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is being considered.  Angiography may also be indicated when knowledge of coronary anatomy is necessary to advise about work or lifestyle needs (eg, discontinuing job or sports activities).  Although angiographic findings do not directly show hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions, obstruction is assumed to be physiologically significant when the luminal diameter is reduced > 70%.  Angina does not usually develop when the diameter reduction is < 70% unless spasm or thrombosis is present.  Intravascular ultrasonography provides images of coronary artery structure.  An ultrasound probe on the tip of a catheter is inserted in the coronary arteries during angiography.  This test can provide more information about coronary anatomy than other tests; it is indicated when the nature of lesions is unclear or when apparent disease severity does not match symptom severity.  Used with angioplasty, it can help ensure optimal placement of stents.  Guidewires with pressure or flow sensors can be used to estimate blood flow across stenoses.  Blood flow is expressed as fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is the ratio of maximal flow through the stenotic area to normal maximal flow.  These flow measurements are most useful when evaluating the need for angioplasty or CABG in patients with lesions of questionable severity (40 to 70% stenosis).  An FFR of 1. 0 is considered normal, while an FFR < 0. 75 to 0. 8 is associated with myocardial ischemia.  Lesions with an FFR > 0. 8 are less likely to benefit from stent placement.  Imaging studies done at rest can evaluate the coronary arteries.  Electron beam CT can detect the amount of calcium present in coronary artery plaque.  The calcium score is roughly proportional to the risk of subsequent coronary events.  However, because calcium may be present in the absence of significant stenosis, the score does not correlate well with the need for angioplasty or CABG.  Thus, the American Heart Association recommends that screening with electron beam CT should be done only for select groups of patients and is most valuable when combined with historical and clinical data to estimate risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction .  These groups may include asymptomatic patients with an intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimate (10 to 20%) and symptomatic patients with equivocal stress test results.  Electron beam CT is particularly useful in ruling out significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department with atypical symptoms, normal troponin levels, and a low probability of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.  These patients may have noninvasive testing as outpatients.  Multidetector row CT (MDRCT) coronary angiography can accurately identify coronary stenosis and has a number of advantages.  The test is noninvasive, can exclude coronary stenosis with high accuracy, can establish stent or bypass graft patency, can show cardiac and coronary venous anatomy, and can assess calcified and noncalcified plaque burden.  Estimation of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) across significant lesions and estimation of lesion-specific ischemia are also possible .  However, radiation exposure is significant, and the test is not suitable for patients with a heart rate of > 65 beats/minute, those with irregular heart beats, and pregnant women.  Patients must also be able to hold their breath for 15 to 20 seconds, 3 to 4 times during the study.  Evolving indications for MDRCT coronary angiography include Asymptomatic high-risk patients or patients with atypical or typical angina who have inconclusive exercise stress test results, cannot undergo exercise stress testing, or need to undergo major noncardiac surgery Patients in whom invasive coronary angiography was unable to locate a major coronary artery or graft Cardiac MRI is invaluable in evaluating many cardiac and great vessel abnormalities.  It may be used to evaluate CAD by several techniques, which enable direct visualization of coronary stenosis, assessment of flow in the coronary arteries, evaluation of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, evaluation of wall motion abnormalities during stress, and assessment of infarcted myocardium vs viable myocardium.  Indications for cardiac MRI include evaluation of cardiac structure and function and assessment of myocardial viability.  Cardiac MRI, specifically stress perfusion MRI and quantitative myocardial blood flow analysis, may also be indicated for diagnosis and risk assessment in patients with either known or suspected CAD. \n【14】 Prognosis for Angina Pectoris The main adverse outcomes of angina pectoris are unstable angina results from acute obstruction of a coronary artery without myocardial infarction. \n【15】 Annual mortality rate is about 1. 4% in patients with angina, no history of MI, a normal resting ECG, and normal BP.  However, women with CAD tend to have a worse prognosis.  Mortality rate is about 7. 5% when systolic hypertension is present, 8. 4% when the ECG is abnormal, and 12% when both are present.  Type 2 diabetes about doubles the mortality rate for each scenario.  Prognosis worsens with increasing age, increasingly severe anginal symptoms, presence of anatomic lesions, and poor ventricular function.  Lesions in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anterior descending artery indicate particularly high risk.  Although prognosis correlates with number and severity of coronary arteries affected, prognosis is surprisingly good for patients with stable angina, even those with 3-vessel disease, if ventricular function is normal.  Treatment of Angina Pectoris Modification of risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, lipids) Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and sometimes clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) Beta-blockers Nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers for symptom control Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins Revascularization if symptoms persist despite medical therapy Reversible risk factors are modified Treatment Atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries. \n【16】 Smokers should stop smoking; 2 or more years after stopping smoking, risk of MI is reduced to that of people who never smoked.  Hypertension (BP > 130/80 for patients with CAD) is treated diligently because even mild hypertension increases cardiac workload.  Weight loss alone often reduces the severity of angina.  Sometimes treatment of mild LV failure markedly lessens angina.  Paradoxically, digitalis occasionally intensifies angina, presumably because increased myocardial contractility increases oxygen demand, arterial tone is increased, or both. \n【17】 An exercise program emphasizing walking often improves the sense of well-being, reduces risk of acute ischemic events, and improves exercise tolerance.  Drugs for angina The main goals of angina treatment are to Relieve acute symptoms Prevent or reduce ischemia Prevent future ischemic events To relieve symptoms during an acute attack, sublingual nitroglycerin is the most effective drug.  Nitroglycerin is a potent smooth-muscle relaxant and vasodilator.  Its main sites of action are in the peripheral vascular tree, especially in the venous or capacitance system, and in coronary blood vessels.  Even severely atherosclerotic vessels may dilate in areas without atheroma.  Nitroglycerin lowers systolic BP and dilates systemic veins, thus reducing myocardial wall tension, a major determinant of myocardial oxygen need.  Sublingual nitroglycerin is given for an acute attack or for prevention before exertion.  Dramatic relief usually occurs within 1. 5 to 3 minutes, is complete by about 5 minutes, and lasts up to 30 minutes.  The dose may be repeated every 4 to 5 minutes up to 3 times if relief is incomplete.  Patients should always carry nitroglycerin tablets or aerosol spray to use promptly at the onset of an angina attack.  Patients should store tablets in a tightly sealed, light-resistant glass container, so that potency is not lost.  Because the drug deteriorates quickly, small amounts should be obtained frequently.  To prevent ischemia, several classes of drugs are used: Antiplatelet drugs: All patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease or at high risk of developing CAD Beta-blockers: Most patients, unless contraindicated or not tolerated Long-acting nitrates: If needed Calcium channel blockers: If needed Antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation.  Aspirin binds irreversibly to platelets and inhibits cyclooxygenase and platelet aggregation.  Other antiplatelet drugs (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) block adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation.  These drugs can reduce risk of ischemic events (MI, sudden death), but the drugs are most effective when given with aspirin.  Patients unable to tolerate one should receive the other drug alone.  Beta-blockers limit symptoms and prevent infarction and sudden death better than other drugs.  Beta-blockers block sympathetic stimulation of the heart and reduce systolic BP, heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output, thus decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and increasing exercise tolerance.  Beta-blockers also increase the threshold for ventricular fibrillation.  Most patients tolerate these drugs well.  Many beta-blockers are available and effective.  Dose is titrated upward as needed until limited by bradycardia or adverse effects.  Patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers are given a calcium channel blocker with negative chronotropic effects (eg, diltiazem, verapamil).  Those at risk of beta-blocker intolerance (eg, those with asthma) may be tried on a cardioselective beta-blocker (eg, bisoprolol) perhaps with pulmonary function testing before and after drug administration to detect drug-induced bronchospasm.  Long-acting nitrates (oral or transdermal) are used if symptoms persist after the beta-blocker dose is maximized.  If angina occurs at predictable times, a nitrate is given to cover those times.  Oral nitrates include isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrate (the active metabolite of the dinitrate).  They are effective within 1 to 2 hours; their effect lasts 4 to 6 hours.  Sustained-release formulations of isosorbide mononitrate appear to be effective throughout the day.  For transdermal use, cutaneous nitroglycerin patches have largely replaced nitroglycerin ointments primarily because ointments are inconvenient and messy.  Patches slowly release the drug for a prolonged effect; exercise capacity improves 4 hours after patch application and wanes in 18 to 24 hours.  Nitrate tolerance may occur, especially when plasma concentrations are kept constant.  Because risk of myocardial infarction is highest in early morning, an afternoon or early evening respite period from nitrates is reasonable unless a patient commonly has angina at that time.  For nitroglycerin, an 8- to 10-hour respite period seems sufficient.  Isosorbide may require a 12-hour respite period.  If given once a day, sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate does not appear to elicit tolerance.  Calcium channel blockers may be used if symptoms persist despite use of nitrates or if nitrates are not tolerated.  Calcium channel blockers are particularly useful if hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. \n【18】 Different types of calcium channel blockers have different effects.  Dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine) have no chronotropic effects and vary substantially in their negative inotropic effects.  Shorter-acting dihydropyridines may cause reflex tachycardia and are associated with increased mortality in patients with CAD; they should not be used alone to treat stable angina.  Longer-acting formulations of dihydropyridines have fewer tachycardic effects; they are most commonly used with a beta-blocker.  Among longer-acting dihydropyridines, amlodipine has the weakest negative inotropic effects; it may be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  Diltiazem and verapamil, other types of calcium channel blockers, have negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.  They can be used alone in patients with beta-blocker intolerance or asthma and normal left ventricular systolic function but may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  Ranolazine is a sodium channel blocker that can be used to treat chronic angina.  Because ranolazine may also prolong QTc, it is usually reserved for patients in whom symptoms persist despite optimal treatment with other antianginal drugs.  Dizziness, headache, constipation, and nausea are the most common adverse effects.  Ivabradine is a sinus node inhibitor that inhibits inward sodium/potassium current in a certain gated channel (funny or \"f\" channel) in sinus node cells, thus slowing heart rate without decreasing contractility. \n【19】 The choice between PCI and CABG depends on extent and location of anatomic lesions, the experience of the surgeon and medical center, and, to some extent, patient preference .  PCI is usually preferred for 1- or 2-vessel disease with suitable anatomic lesions and is increasingly being used for 3-vessel disease.  Lesions that are long or near bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI.  However, as stent technology improves, PCI is being used for more complicated cases.  CABG is very effective in selected patients with angina.  CABG is superior to PCI in patients with diabetes and in patients with multivessel disease amenable to grafting.  The ideal candidate has severe angina pectoris and localized disease, or diabetes mellitus.  About 85% of patients have complete or dramatic symptom relief.  Exercise stress testing shows positive correlation between graft patency and improved exercise tolerance, but exercise tolerance sometimes remains improved despite graft closure.  CABG improves survival for patients with left main disease, those with 3-vessel disease and poor left ventricular function, and some patients with 2-vessel disease.  However, for patients with mild or moderate angina (CCS class 1 or 2) or 3-vessel disease and good ventricular function, CABG appears to only marginally improve survival.  PCI is increasingly being used for unprotected left main stenosis (ie, no left anterior descending or circumflex graft present), with outcomes at one year that are similar to CABG.  Several studies show better long term outcomes following CABG than with PCI for patients with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending disease.  For patients with 1-vessel disease, outcomes with drug therapy, PCI, and CABG are similar; exceptions are left main disease and proximal left anterior descending disease, for which revascularization appears advantageous. \n【20】 Key Points Angina pectoris occurs when cardiac workload exceeds the ability of coronary arteries to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood.  Symptoms of stable angina pectoris range from a vague, barely troublesome ache to a severe, intense precordial crushing sensation; they are typically precipitated by exertion, last no more than a few minutes, and subside with rest.  Do stress testing with ECG for patients with normal resting ECG or with myocardial imaging (eg, echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, PET, MRI) for patients with abnormal resting ECG.  Do coronary angiography when revascularization (percutaneous intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) is being considered.  Give nitroglycerin for immediate relief of angina.  Maintain patients on an antiplatelet drug, a beta-blocker, and a statin, and add a calcium channel blocker for further symptom prevention if needed.  Consider revascularization if significant angina persists despite drug therapy or if lesions noted during angiography indicate high risk of mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "语义不完整#4#4# 4 Any physical activity Sometimes occurring at rest\n  后面缺少内容", "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 23:41:10"}

Early symptoms are related to hyperglycemia and include polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and weight loss.  Diagnosis is by measuring plasma glucose levels.  Treatment depends on type but includes drugs that reduce blood glucose levels, diet, and exercise. \n【1】 The types of diabetes mellitus (diabetes) in children are similar to those in adults, but psychosocial problems are different and can complicate treatment.  Type 1 diabetes is the most common type in children, accounting for two thirds of new cases in children of all ethnic groups.  It is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases, occurring in 1 in 350 children by age 18; the incidence has recently been increasing, particularly in children < 5 years.  Although type 1 can occur at any age, it typically manifests between age 4 years and 6 years or between 10 years and 14 years.  Type 2 diabetes, once rare in children, has been increasing in frequency in parallel with the increase in childhood obesity .  It typically manifests after puberty, with the highest rate between age 15 years and 19 years .  Monogenic forms of diabetes, previously termed maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY), are not considered type 1 or type 2 (although they are sometimes mistaken for them) and are uncommon (1 to 4% of cases).  Prediabetes is impaired glucose regulation resulting in intermediate glucose levels that are too high to be normal but do not meet criteria for diabetes.  In obese adolescents, prediabetes may be transient (with reversion to normal in 2 years in 60%) or progress to diabetes, especially in adolescents who persistently gain weight.  Prediabetes is associated with the metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. \n【2】 Etiology of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents Most patients are categorized as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and this distinction is used to guide treatment.  Classification is based on clinical history (age, family history, body habitus), presentation, and laboratory studies, including antibodies.  However, this classification system does not fully capture the clinical heterogeneity of patients, and some patients cannot clearly be classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at diagnosis.  In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, genetic and environmental factors can result in the progressive loss of beta-cell function that results in hyperglycemia.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces little to no insulin because of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, possibly triggered by an environmental exposure in genetically susceptible people.  Close relatives are at increased risk of diabetes (about 15 times the risk of the general population), with overall incidence 4 to 8% (30 to 50% in monozygotic twins). \n【3】 Inherited susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is determined by multiple genes (> 60 risk loci have been identified).  Susceptibility genes are more common among some populations and explain the higher prevalence of type 1 diabetes in certain ethnic groups (eg, Scandinavians, Sardinians).  In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but there are varying degrees of insulin resistance, and insulin secretion is inadequate to meet the increased demand caused by insulin resistance (ie, there is relative insulin deficiency).  Onset often coincides with the peak of physiologic pubertal insulin resistance, which may lead to symptoms of hyperglycemia in previously compensated adolescents.  The cause is not autoimmune destruction of beta-cells but rather a complex interaction between many genes and environmental factors, which differ among different populations and patients.  Although type 2 diabetes is different than type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes in children is also different than type 2 diabetes in adults.  In children, decline in beta-cell function and development of diabetes-related complications are accelerated.  Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include Obesity Native American, Black, Hispanic, Asian American, and Pacific Islander heritage Family history (60 to 90% have a 1st- or 2nd-degree relative with type 2 diabetes) Monogenic forms of diabetes are caused by genetic defects that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, so patients typically have one or more affected family members.  Unlike type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there is no autoimmune destruction of beta-cells or insulin resistance.  Onset is usually before age 25 years.  Pathophysiology of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents In type 1 diabetes, lack of insulin causes hyperglycemia and impaired glucose utilization in skeletal muscle.  Muscle and fat are then broken down to provide energy.  Fat breakdown produces ketones, which cause acidemia and sometimes a significant, life-threatening acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. \n【4】 In type 2 diabetes, there is usually enough insulin function to prevent DKA at diagnosis, but children can sometimes present with DKA (up to 25%) or, less commonly, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a metabolic complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by severe hyperglycemia, extreme dehydration, hyperosmolar plasma, and altered consciousness. \n【5】 HHS most often occurs during a period of stress or infection, with nonadherence to treatment regimens, or when glucose metabolism is further impaired by drugs (eg, corticosteroids).  Other metabolic derangements associated with insulin resistance can be present at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and include Dyslipidemia  Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic blood pressure (≥ 130 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. \n【6】 In monogenic forms of diabetes, the underlying defect depends on the type.  The most common types are caused by defects in transcription factors that regulate pancreatic beta-cell function (eg, hepatic nuclear factor 4-alpha [HNF-4-α], hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha [HNF-1-α]).  In these types, insulin secretion is impaired but not absent, there is no insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia worsens with age.  Another type of monogenic diabetes is caused by a defect in the glucose sensor, glucokinase.  With glucokinase defects, insulin secretion is normal but glucose levels are regulated at a higher set point, causing fasting hyperglycemia that worsens minimally with age.  Pearls & Pitfalls Despite the common misconception, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in children with type 2 diabetes.  Symptoms and Signs of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents In type 1 diabetes, initial manifestations vary from asymptomatic hyperglycemia to life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. \n【7】 However, most commonly, children have symptomatic hyperglycemia without acidosis, with several days to weeks of urinary frequency, polydipsia, and polyuria.  Polyuria may manifest as nocturia, bed-wetting, or daytime incontinence; in children who are not toilet-trained, parents may note an increased frequency of wet or heavy diapers.  About half of children have weight loss as a result of increased catabolism and also have impaired growth.  Fatigue, weakness, candidal rashes, blurry vision (due to the hyperosmolar state of the lens and vitreous humor), and/or nausea and vomiting (due to ketonemia) may also be present initially.  In type 2 diabetes, the manifestation varies widely.  Children are often asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and their condition may be detected only on routine testing.  However, some children have a severe manifestation of symptomatic hyperglycemia, HHS, or, despite the common misconception, DKA.  Complications of diabetes in children Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. \n【8】 Other risk factors for DKA include prior episodes of DKA, difficult social circumstances, depression or other psychiatric disturbances, intercurrent illness, and use of an insulin pump (because of a kinked or dislodged catheter, poor insulin absorption due to infusion site inflammation, or pump malfunction).  Clinicians can help minimize the effects of risk factors by providing education, counseling, and support.  Mental health issues are very common among children with diabetes and their families. \n【9】 Psychologic problems can also result in poor glycemic control by affecting children's ability to adhere to their dietary and/or drug regimens.  Social workers and mental health professionals (as part of a multidisciplinary team) can help identify and alleviate psychosocial causes of poor glycemic control.  Vascular complications rarely are clinically evident in childhood.  However, early pathologic changes and functional abnormalities may be present a few years after disease onset in type 1 diabetes; prolonged poor glycemic control is the greatest long-term risk factor for the development of vascular complications. \n【10】 Microvascular complications are more common among children with type 2 diabetes than type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes may be present at diagnosis or earlier in the disease course.  Although neuropathy is more common among children who have had diabetes for a long duration (≥ 5 years) and poor control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] > 10%), it can happen in young children who have had diabetes for a short duration and good control.  Macrovascular complications include coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries, most commonly by atheromas. \n【11】 Diagnosis of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents Fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7. 0 mmol/L) Random glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL ( ≥ 11. 1 mmol/L) Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6. 5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) Sometimes oral glucose tolerance testing  2018 guidelines for diabetes in children and adolescents. ) Diagnosis of diabetes in children Diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes is similar to that in adults, typically using fasting or random plasma glucose levels and/or HbA1c levels, and depends on the presence or absence of symptoms Diabetes may be diagnosed with the presence of classic symptoms of diabetes and blood glucose measurements.  Measurements are random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11. 1 mmol/L) or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7. 0 mmol/L); fasting is defined as no caloric intake for 8 hours.  An oral glucose tolerance test is not required and should not be done if diabetes can be diagnosed by other criteria.  When needed, the test should be done using 1. 75 g/kg (maximum 75 g) glucose dissolved in water.  The test may be helpful in children without symptoms or with mild or atypical symptoms and may be helpful in suspected cases of type 2 or monogenic diabetes.  The HbA1c criterion is typically more useful for diagnosing type 2 diabetes, and hyperglycemia should be confirmed.  Although the HbA1c screening test is commonly used for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in children, the results of the test should be used with caution.  Data promoting HbA1c as a screening test are derived from adults, and several studies have questioned its validity because of its poor sensitivity for identifying children with dysglycemia (prediabetes or diabetes mellitus).  In children with hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease), alternative measurements (eg, fructosamine) should be considered.   Initial evaluation and testing For patients suspected of having diabetes but who do not appear ill, initial testing should include a basic metabolic panel, including electrolytes and glucose, and urinalysis.  For ill patients, testing also includes a venous or arterial blood gas, liver tests, and calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and hematocrit levels.  Diagnosis of diabetes type Additional tests should be done to confirm the type of diabetes, including C-peptide and insulin (if not yet treated with insulin) levels HbA1c levels (if not already done) Tests for autoantibodies against pancreatic islet cell proteins Autoantibodies include glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin, insulinoma-associated protein, and zinc transporter ZnT8.  More than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have ≥ 1 of these autoantibodies, whereas the absence of antibodies strongly suggests type 2 diabetes.  However, about 10 to 20% of children with the type 2 diabetes phenotype have autoantibodies and are reclassified as type 1 diabetes, because such children are more likely to require insulin therapy and are at greater risk of developing other autoimmune disorders.  Monogenic diabetes is important to recognize because treatment differs from type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  The diagnosis should be considered in children with a strong family history of diabetes but who lack typical features of type 2 diabetes; that is, they have only mild fasting (100 to 150 mg/dL [5. 55 to 8. 32 mmol/L]) or postprandial hyperglycemia, are young and not obese, and have no autoantibodies or signs of insulin resistance (eg, acanthosis nigricans).  Genetic testing is available to confirm monogenic diabetes.  This testing is important because some types of monogenic diabetes can progress with age. \n【12】 Testing for thyroid disease and celiac disease should occur every 1 to 2 years thereafter.  Other autoimmune disorders, such as primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), rheumatologic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis), other gastrointestinal disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis), and skin disease (eg, vitiligo), may also occur in children with type 1 diabetes but do not require routine screening.  Patients with type 2 diabetes should have liver tests, fasting lipid profile, and urine microalbumin:creatinine ratio done at the time of diagnosis because such children (unlike those with type 1 diabetes, in whom complications develop over many years) often have comorbidities, such as fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, at diagnosis.  Children with clinical findings suggestive of complications should also be tested: Obesity: Test for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes. \n【13】 This test should first be done at age 10 years or at onset of puberty, if puberty occurred at a younger age, and should be repeated every 3 years.  Children at risk include those who are overweight (body mass index > 85th percentile for age and sex, or weight for height > 85th percentile) and who have any 2 of the following: Family history of type 2 diabetes in 1st- or 2nd-degree relative Native American, Black, Hispanic, Asian American, and Pacific Islander heritage Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance ,eg, acanthosis nigricans Endocrinopathies The skin frequently serves as a marker for underlying internal disease.  The type of lesion typically relates to a specific disease or type of disease. diastolic blood pressure (≥ 80 mm Hg), or both. \n【14】 Intensive education and treatment in childhood and adolescence may help achieve treatment goals, which are to normalize blood glucose levels while minimizing the number of hypoglycemic episodes and to prevent or delay the onset and progression of complications.  Poor glycemic control and increased hospitalization rates are associated with certain socioeconomic factors.  In spite of advances in diabetes technology that have improved quality of care and glycemic control, not all patients have benefited, and low-income and non-Hispanic Black children remain at higher risk of complications and adverse outcomes because of poor glycemic control.  Social determinants of health (eg, socioeconomic status, neighborhood and physical environment, food environment, health care, social context) may impact the ability to maintain optimal glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes.  Lifestyle modifications that benefit all patients include Eating regularly and in consistent amounts Limiting intake of refined carbohydrates and saturated fats Increasing physical activity In general, the term diet should be avoided in favor of meal plan or healthy food choices.  The main focus is on encouraging heart-healthy diets low in cholesterol and saturated fats.  In type 1 diabetes, the popularity of basal–bolus regimens and the use of carbohydrate counting (parents estimate the amount of carbohydrate in an upcoming meal and use that amount to calculate the preprandial insulin dose) has changed meal plan strategies.  In this flexible approach, food intake is not rigidly specified.  Instead, meal plans are based on the child's usual eating patterns rather than on a theoretically optimal diet to which the child is unlikely to adhere, and insulin dose is matched to actual carbohydrate intake.  The insulin:carbohydrate ratio is individualized but varies with age, activity level, pubertal status, and length of time from initial diagnosis.  Technologic advances have allowed for greater precision and customization of insulin doses.  A good rule of thumb for age is Birth to 5 years: 1 unit insulin per 30 g carbohydrate 6 to 12 years: 1 unit insulin per 15 g carbohydrate Adolescence: 1 unit insulin per 5 to 10 g carbohydrate In type 2 diabetes, patients should be encouraged to lose weight and thus increase insulin sensitivity.  A good rule of thumb to determine the amount of calories needed by a child age 3 to 13 years is 1000 calories + (100 × child's age in years).  Simple steps to improve the diet and manage caloric intake include Eliminating sugar-containing drinks and foods made of refined, simple sugars (eg, processed candies and high fructose corn syrups) Discouraging skipping meals Avoiding grazing on food throughout the day Controlling portion size Limiting high-fat, high-calorie foods in the home Increasing fiber intake by eating more fruits and vegetables Glucose and HbA1c target levels Plasma glucose targets are established to balance the need to normalize glucose levels with the risk of hypoglycemia.  Patients beyond the honeymoon phase (ie, patients who no longer have residual beta-cell function) should try to have ≥ 50% of blood glucose levels in the normal range (70 to 180 mg/dL [3. 9 to 10 mmol/L]) and < 10% below range.  Treatment goals should be individualized based on patient age, diabetes duration, access to diabetes technology (eg, insulin pumps, continuous monitoring systems), comorbid conditions, and psychosocial circumstances.  The risk of hypoglycemia in children who have hypoglycemia unawareness or lack the maturity to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia can limit aggressive attempts to achieve treatment goals.  A less stringent HbA1c target level (< 7. 5% [< 58 mmol/mol]) should be considered for such patients, whereas a more stringent target level (< 6. 5% [< 48 mmol/mol]) should be reserved for select patients in whom it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia and without negative impacts on well-being.  HbA1c target levels for type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents have been lowered over time in an effort to reduce complications—lower HbA1c levels during adolescence and young adulthood are associated with a lower risk of vascular complications.  An HbA1c target level of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for most children, but many children and adolescents do not meet this target.  An increased frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (up to 6 to 10 times per day) or use of a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system can improve HbA1c levels because patients are better able to adjust insulin for meals, have an improved ability to correct hyperglycemic values, and are potentially able to detect hypoglycemia earlier, which prevents overcorrection (ie, excessive carbohydrate intake as treatment for hypoglycemia, resulting in hyperglycemia).  When used properly, intermittently scanned CGM in conjunction with insulin therapy can be used to replace self-monitoring of blood glucose.  HbA1c levels correlate well to the percentage of time that blood glucose levels remain in the normal range, termed the percentage time-in-range.  Time-in-range is commonly used as a therapeutic goal to assess the efficacy of the insulin regimen in combination with HbA1c level.  A 10% change in time-in-range corresponds to about a 0. 8 percentage point change in HbA1c.  For example, a time-in-range of 80% corresponds to an HbA1c level of 5. 9% (41 mmol/mol), 70% corresponds to 6. 7% (50 mmol/mol), 60% corresponds to 7. 5% (58 mmol/mol), and 40% time-in-range corresponds to an HbA1c level of 9% (75 mmol/mol) .  In addition to time-in-range, CGM provides information related to average sensor glucose, time-above-range (> 180 mg/dL [> 10 mmol/L]) and time-below-range (< 70 mg/dL [< 3. 9 mmol/L]), glycemic variability, glucose management indicator, and information related to adherence (eg, active CGM time, days worn).  CGM metrics derived from use over the most recent 14 days are recommended to be used in conjunction with HbA1c level.  CGM data can be reported in a standardized format.  The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) is a standardized report of the mean glucose, time-in-range, and time-below-range.  When using the AGP to monitor glycemia, a goal of time-in-range of > 70% with a time-below-range of < 4% may be used as a glycemic control goal along with the goal of an HbA1c target of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol).  Another report is the glucose management indicator, which provides an estimated HbA1c from mean CGM glucose levels, preferably from ≥ 14 days of data.  HbA1c target levels for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents are similar to targets in type 1 diabetes, ie < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol).  Similar to type 1 diabetes, target fasting glucose levels in type 2 diabetes should be < 130 mg/dL (7. 2 mmol/L).  Children who fail to meet HbA1c and/or fasting glucose targets are candidates for intensified therapy (eg, with insulin, liraglutide).  More stringent targets for HbA1c (< 6. 5% [< 48 mmol/mol]) and fasting blood glucose (< 110 mg/dL [6. 1 mmol/L]) may be considered in patients with shorter duration of diabetes and in those treated with lifestyle interventions or metformin alone who achieve significant weight reduction.   Type 1 diabetes insulin regimens Insulin is the cornerstone of management of type 1 diabetes.  Available insulin formulations are similar to those used in adults Insulin should be given before a meal, except in young children whose consumption at any given meal is difficult to predict.  Dosing requirements vary by age, activity level, pubertal status, and length of time from initial diagnosis.  Within a few weeks of initial diagnosis, many patients have a temporary decrease in their insulin requirements because of residual beta-cell function (honeymoon phase).  This honeymoon phase can last from a few months up to 2 years, after which insulin requirements typically range from 0. 7 to 1 unit/kg/day.  During puberty, patients require higher doses (up to 1. 5 units/kg/day) to counteract insulin resistance caused by increased pubertal hormone levels.  Types of insulin regimens include Multiple daily injections (MDI) regimen using basal-bolus regimen Insulin pump therapy Fixed forms of MDI regimen or premixed insulin regimen (less common) Most people with type 1 diabetes should be treated with MDI regimens (3 to 4 injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or insulin pump therapy as part of intensive insulin regimens with the goal of improving metabolic control.  A basal-bolus regimen is typically the preferred MDI regimen.  In this regimen, children are given a daily baseline dose of insulin that is then supplemented by doses of short-acting insulin before each meal based on anticipated carbohydrate intake and on measured glucose levels.  The basal dose can be given as a once-a-day injection (sometimes every 12 hours for younger children) of a long-acting insulin (glargine,detemir, or degludec), with supplemental boluses given as separate injections of rapid-acting insulin (usually aspart or lispro).  Glargine, degludec, or detemir injections are typically given at dinner or bedtime and must not be mixed with short-acting insulin.  In insulin pump therapy, the basal insulin is delivered at a fixed or variable rate by a continuous subcutaneous infusion of rapid-acting insulin (CSII) through a catheter placed under the skin.  Mealtime and correction boluses also are delivered via the insulin pump.  The basal dose helps keep blood glucose levels in range between meals and at night.  Using an insulin pump to deliver the basal dose allows for maximal flexibility; the pump can be programmed to give different rates at different times throughout the day and night.  Insulin pump therapy is increasingly being used in children because of the potential benefits of glycemic control, safety, and patient satisfaction compared to MDI regimens.  This therapy is typically preferred for younger children (toddlers, preschoolers) and overall offers an added degree of control to many children.  Others find wearing the pump inconvenient or develop sores or infections at the catheter site.  Children must rotate their injection and pump sites to avoid developing lipohypertrophy.  Lipohypertrophy is an accumulation of lumps of fatty tissue under the skin.  The lumps occur at insulin injection sites that have been overused and can cause variation in blood glucose levels because they can prevent insulin from being absorbed consistently.  More fixed forms of MDI regimens are less commonly used.  They can be considered if a basal-bolus regimen is not an option (eg, because the family needs a simpler regimen, the child or parents have a needle phobia, lunchtime injections cannot be given at school or daycare).  In this regimen, children usually receive neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin before eating breakfast and dinner and at bedtime and receive rapid-acting insulin before eating breakfast and dinner.  Because NPH and rapid-acting insulin can be mixed, this regimen provides fewer injections than the basal-bolus regimen.  However, this regimen provides less flexibility, requires a set daily schedule for meals and snack times, and has been largely supplanted by the analog insulins glargine and detemir because of the lower risk of hypoglycemia.  Premixed insulin regimens use preparations of 70/30 (70% insulin aspart protamine/30% regular insulin) or 75/25 (75% insulin lispro protamine/25% insulin lispro).  Premixed regimens are not a good choice but are simpler and may improve adherence because they require fewer injections.  Children are given set doses twice daily, with two thirds of the total daily dose given at breakfast and one third at dinner.  However, premixed regimens provide much less flexibility with respect to timing and amount of meals and are less precise than other regimens because of the fixed ratios.  Clinicians should use the most intensive management program children and their family can adhere to in order to maximize glycemic control and thus reduce the risk of long-term vascular complications.  Type 1 diabetes management of complications Hypoglycemia, or low plasma glucose level can result in sympathetic nervous system stimulation, and central nervous system dysfunction. \n【15】 Most children have several mild hypoglycemic events per week and self-treat with 15 g of fast-acting carbohydrates (eg, 4 oz of juice, glucose tablets, hard candies, graham crackers, or glucose gel).  Severe hypoglycemia, defined as an episode requiring the assistance of another person to give carbohydrates or glucagon, occurs in about 30% of children each year, and most will have had such an episode by age 18.  Oral carbohydrates may be tried, but glucagon 1 mg IM is usually used if neuroglycopenic symptoms (eg, behavioral changes, confusion, difficulty thinking) prevent eating or drinking.  If untreated, severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures or even coma or death.  Real-time continuous glucose monitoring devices can help children with hypoglycemia unawareness because they sound an alarm when glucose is below a specified range or when glucose declines at a rapid rate .  Ketonuria/ketonemia is most often caused by intercurrent illness but also can result from not taking enough insulin or from missing doses and can be a warning of impending DKA.  Because early detection of ketones is crucial to prevent progression to DKA and minimize need for emergency department or hospital admission, children and families should be taught to check for ketones in the urine or capillary blood using ketone test strips.  Blood ketone testing may be preferred in younger children, those with recurrent DKA, and insulin pump users or if a urine sample is difficult to obtain.  Ketone testing should be done whenever the child become ill (regardless of the blood sugar level) or when the blood sugar is high (typically > 240 mg/dL [13. 3 mmol/L]).  The presence of moderate or large urine ketone levels or blood ketone levels > 1. 5 mmol/L can suggest DKA, especially if children also have abdominal pain, vomiting, drowsiness, or rapid breathing.  Small urine ketone levels or blood ketone levels 0. 6 to 1. 5 mmol/L also must be addressed.  When ketones are present, children are given additional short-acting insulin, typically 10 to 20% of the total daily dose, every 2 to 3 hours until ketones are cleared.  Also, additional fluid should be given to prevent dehydration.  This program of measuring ketones and giving additional fluid and insulin during illness and/or hyperglycemia is called sick-day management.  Parents should be instructed to call their health care provider or go to the emergency department if ketones increase or do not clear after 4 to 6 hours, or if the clinical status worsens (eg, respiratory distress, continued vomiting, change in mental status).  Type 2 diabetes treatment As in type 1 diabetes, lifestyle modifications, with improved nutrition and increased physical activity, are important.  Insulin is started in children who present with more severe diabetes (HbA1c > 9% [> 75 mmol/mol] or with DKA); glargine, detemir, or premixed insulin can be used.  If acidosis is not present, metformin is usually started at the same time.  Insulin requirements may decline rapidly during the initial weeks of treatment as endogenous insulin secretion increases; insulin often can be stopped several weeks after regaining acceptable metabolic control.  Metformin is an insulin sensitizer and is the only oral antihyperglycemic drug approved for patients < 18 years of age.  Other oral drugs used in adults Oral Antihyperglycemic Drugs General treatment of diabetes mellitus for all patients involves lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. \n【16】 Metformin should be started at a low dose and taken with food to prevent nausea and abdominal pain.  A typical starting dose is 500 mg orally once a day for 1 week, which is increased weekly by 500 mg for 3 to 6 weeks until reaching the maximal target dose of 1000 mg 2 times a day.  The goal of treatment is an HbA1c level of at least < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol), preferably < 6. 5% (< 48 mmol/mol).  If this cannot be achieved with metformin alone, basal insulin or liraglutide should be started.  Unfortunately, about half of adolescents with type 2 diabetes ultimately fail metformin monotherapy and require insulin.  If patients fail to meet targets using dual therapy with metformin and basal insulin, rapid-acting prandial insulin may also be added.  Liraglutide and extended-release exenatide are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists approved for use in children > 10 years of age with type 2 diabetes and can help reduce HbA1c levels.  These injectable noninsulin antihyperglycemic drugs enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and slow gastric emptying.  Liraglutide is started at 0. 6 mg subcutaneously once a day and may be increased weekly by 0. 6 mg until control is adequate up to 1. 8 mg once a day.  Extended-release exenatide dose is 2 mg subcutaneously once/week, which may improve patient adherence.  Both drugs promote weight loss, likely through the effect of delayed gastric emptying and appetite reduction.  The most common adverse effects of GLP-1 agonists are gastrointestinal, especially nausea and vomiting.  Liraglutide and exenatide can be used if metformin is not tolerated or added on if HbA1c target levels are not achieved with metformin alone within 3 months.  Liraglutide and exenatide can be used in place of or in combination with insulin as part of intensive treatment of type 2 diabetes.  Monogenic diabetes treatment Management of monogenic diabetes is individualized and depends on subtype.  The glucokinase subtype generally does not require treatment because children are not at risk of long-term complications.  Most patients with hepatic nuclear factor 4-alpha and hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha types are sensitive to sulfonylureas, but some ultimately require insulin.  Other oral hypoglycemics such as metformin are typically not effective.  Monitoring glucose and HbA1c levels Routine monitoring involves Multiple daily glucose checks by fingerstick or continuous glucose monitoring HbA1c measurements every 3 months In type 1 diabetes, blood glucose levels should be monitored 6 to 10 times per day by using a glucose meter or a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system to optimize control.  Traditionally, glucose levels should be measured using a fingerstick sample before all meals and before a bedtime snack.  Levels also should be checked during the night (around 2 to 3 AM) if nocturnal hypoglycemia is a concern (eg, because of hypoglycemia or vigorous exercise during the day, or when an insulin dose is increased).  Because exercise can lower glucose levels for up to 24 hours, levels should be checked more frequently on days when children exercise or are more active.  To prevent hypoglycemia, children may increase carbohydrate intake or lower insulin dosing when they anticipate increased activity.  Sick-day management should be used with hyperglycemia or illness.  Parents should keep detailed daily records of all factors that can affect glycemic control, including blood glucose levels; timing and amount of insulin doses, carbohydrate intake, and physical activity; and any other relevant factors (eg, illness, late snack, missed insulin dose).  Patients with type 2 diabetes usually self-monitor blood glucose levels less frequently than patients with type 1 diabetes, but frequency varies depending on the type of drug therapy used.  Children and adolescents taking multiple daily insulin injections, those who are ill, and those with suboptimal control should monitor glucose levels at least 3 times a day.  Those who are on stable regimens of metformin and only long-acting insulin, who are meeting their targets without hypoglycemia, can monitor less frequently, typically twice a day (fasting and 2 hours postprandial).  Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes on insulin regimens with multiple daily injections sometimes use continuous glucose monitoring systems.  In type 2 diabetes, blood glucose levels should be measured regularly but typically less often than in type 1 diabetes.  The frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose should be individualized based on the patient's fasting and postprandial glucose levels, the degree of glycemic control deemed achievable, and the available resources.  The frequency of monitoring should increase if glycemic control targets are not being met, during illness, or when symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia are felt.  Once targets are achieved, home testing is limited to a few fasting and postprandial blood glucose measurements per week.  HbA1c levels should be measured every 3 months in type 1 diabetes and in type 2 diabetes if insulin is being used or metabolic control is suboptimal.  Otherwise, in type 2 diabetes, levels can be measured twice a year, although every 3 months is optimal.  Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are a common method (> 60% of children use one) of monitoring blood glucose levels and can replace routine self-monitoring of blood glucose for some patients.  They are a more sophisticated and effective approach to monitoring that uses a subcutaneous sensor to measure interstitial fluid glucose levels every 1 to 5 minutes and then translate the measurements into blood glucose values, thus more closely detecting glucose fluctuations that can then be acted upon in real time.  CGM systems transmit results wirelessly to a monitoring and display device that may be built into an insulin pump or may be a stand-alone device.  By identifying times of consistent hyperglycemia and times of increased risk of hypoglycemia, CGM systems can help patients with type 1 diabetes more safely reach glycemic goals.  Two types of CGM systems are currently available: real-time CGM and intermittently scanned CGM.  Real-time CGM can be used in children ≥ 2 years of age.  The system automatically transmits a continuous stream of glucose data to the user in real time, provides alerts and active alarms, and also transmits glucose data to a receiver, smartwatch, or smartphone.  Real-time CGM should be used as close to daily as possible for maximal benefit.  Intermittently scanned CGM can be used in children ≥ 4 years of age.  It provides the same type of glucose data as real-time CGM but requires the user to purposely scan the sensor to obtain information and does not have alerts and alarms.  Intermittently scanned CGM should be used frequently, a minimum of once every 8 hours.  Children using CGM devices need to be able to measure blood glucose by fingerstick to calibrate their monitor and/or to verify readings if they are discordant from symptoms.  Compared to intermittent monitoring, CGM systems can help lower HbA1c levels, increase the percentage of time-in-range, and lower the risk of hypoglycemia.  Although CGM devices can be used with any regimen, they are typically worn by insulin pump users.  When used in conjunction with an insulin pump, the combination is known as sensor-augmented pump therapy.  This therapy requires manual adjustment of insulin doses based on CGM results.  Other CGM systems are integrated with a pump and can also suspend the basal rate for up to 2 hours when glucose levels drop below a set threshold.  This integration can reduce the number of hypoglycemic events, even when compared to sensor-augmented pump therapy.  Closed-loop insulin pumps can be used in children ≥ 2 years of age.  These hybrid closed-loop systems automate blood glucose management through sophisticated computer algorithms that are on a smartphone or similar device and link a CGM sensor to an insulin pump to determine blood glucose levels and control insulin delivery.  Delivery is controlled by suspending, increasing, or decreasing basal insulin in response to CGM values.  Current hybrid closed-loop systems are not truly automated because they require users to administer a bolus for meals and snacks.  These systems help more tightly control insulin dosing and limit hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes.  A fully automated closed-loop system, sometimes known as a bihormonal (insulin and glucagon) artificial pancreas, continues to be evaluated and is not commercially available.  Screening for complications of diabetes Patients are screened regularly for complications depending on the type of diabetes If complications are detected, subsequent testing is done more frequently.   Complications detected on examination or screening are treated first with lifestyle interventions: increased exercise, dietary changes (particularly limiting saturated fat intake), and cessation of smoking (if applicable). \n【17】 For children with dyslipidemia, if low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remains > 160 mg/dL (4. 14 mmol/L) or > 130 mg/dL (3. 37 mmol/L) and one or more cardiovascular risk factors remain despite lifestyle interventions, statins should be considered in children > 10 years, although long-term safety is not established. \n【18】 Key Points Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune attack on pancreatic beta-cells, causing complete lack of insulin; it accounts for two thirds of new cases in children and can occur at any age.  Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency due to a complex interaction among many genetic and environmental factors (particularly obesity); it is increasing in frequency in children and occurs after puberty.  Most children have symptomatic hyperglycemia without acidosis, with several days to weeks of urinary frequency, polydipsia, and polyuria; children with type 1 diabetes and rarely type 2 diabetes may present with diabetic ketoacidosis.  Screen asymptomatic, at-risk children for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.  All children with type 1 diabetes require insulin treatment; intensive glycemic control helps prevent long-term complications but increases risk of hypoglycemic episodes.  Advances in diabetes technology, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems, are aimed at improving glycemic control while reducing hypoglycemic episodes.  Children with type 2 diabetes are initially treated with metformin and/or insulin; although most children requiring insulin at diagnosis can be successfully transitioned to metformin monotherapy, about half eventually require insulin treatment.  Liraglutide can be used in combination with metformin to improve glycemic control.  Mental health issues are common among children with diabetes and can be associated with poor glycemic control.  Insulin doses are adjusted based on frequent glucose monitoring and anticipated carbohydrate intake and activity levels.

Nevertheless, the procedure remains developmental, although steady improvements appear to be occurring.

The drainage may be watery, bloody, or thick and whitish, like pus (purulent).  Depending on the cause of the discharge, people may also have ear pain Earache usually occurs in only one ear.  Some people also have ear discharge or, rarely, hearing loss. \n【1】 Symptoms range from sudden and severe to slowly developing and mild.  Causes of Ear Discharge may originate from the ear canal, the middle ear, or, rarely, from inside the skull.  Overall, the most common causes of ear discharge are Acute (sudden and severe) middle ear infection  with perforation  of the eardrum Chronic otitis media (Chronic Suppurative) Chronic suppurative otitis media is a long-standing, persistently draining perforation of the eardrum (tympanic membrane). \n【2】 The hole in the eardrum almost always heals, but sometimes a small perforation remains.  A perforation may also result from injury or surgery to the eardrum.  When a perforation is present, people are at risk of chronic middle ear infections, which can cause ear discharge.  Serious, but rare, causes of ear discharge include Cancer of the ear canal Cancerous ear tumors of the ear may be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). \n【3】 Skull fractures can occur with or without brain damage. \n【4】 If a skull fracture (from a severe head injury) involves that part of the skull, blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid may leak from the ear.  Necrotizing, or malignant, external otitis is a particularly severe form of external ear infection that typically occurs only in people with diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high. \n【5】 Some people with chronic otitis media develop a noncancerous (benign) growth of skin cells in the middle ear (cholesteatoma Otitis Media (Chronic Suppurative) ) that can cause discharge.  Although a cholesteatoma is noncancerous, it can cause significant damage to the ear and nearby structures.  In severe cases, a cholesteatoma may lead to deafness, facial weakness or paralysis, and complications with the brain such as an abscess and other infections.  Evaluation of Ear Discharge The following information can help people with ear discharge decide when a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.  Warning signs In people with ear discharge, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern: Recent major head injury Any neurologic symptoms (such as vertigo or difficulty seeing, speaking, swallowing, and/or talking) Hearing loss in the affected ear Fever Redness and/or swelling of the ear or area around the ear Diabetes or a compromised immune system When to see a doctor People with warning signs should see a doctor right away.  People without warning signs should see a doctor as soon as possible and avoid getting water in the ear until it can be evaluated.  What the doctor does In people with ear discharge, doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the ear discharge and the tests that may need to be done During the medical history, doctors ask about the following: Activities that can affect the ear canal or eardrum (for example, swimming; insertion of objects, including cotton swabs; and use of ear drops) Whether people have had repeated ear infections Any severe head injury During the physical examination, doctors focus on examining the ears, nose, throat, and neurologic system.  By examining the ear canal with a light, doctors can usually diagnose perforated eardrum Perforation A perforation is a hole in the eardrum.  Eardrum perforations are caused by middle ear infections and injuries. \n【6】 Ear canal infection is caused by bacteria or, less commonly, fungi. \n【7】 Other findings suggest the diagnosis.   Testing Many causes of ear discharge are clear after the doctor's examination.  Possible tests include Audiogram CT scan or MRI If the cause is not clear, doctors usually do a formal hearing test (audiogram Testing ) and computed tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person. \n【8】 If abnormal tissue is present in the ear canal, a tissue sample (biopsy) may be taken.  Sometimes culture swabs are taken of the drainage to identify infection.  Treatment of Ear Discharge Treatment for ear discharge is directed at the cause.  Some infections are treated with antibiotics given by mouth.  Sometimes a piece of gauze (called a wick) is placed to allow antibiotics to get into a very swollen ear canal .  People who have a large perforation of the eardrum are advised to keep water out of the ear.  People can keep water out of the ear while showering or washing their hair by coating a cotton ball with petroleum jelly and placing it at the opening of the ear canal.  Doctors can also make plugs out of silicone and place them in the canal.  Such plugs are carefully sized and shaped so that they do not get lodged deep in the ear canal and cannot be removed.  People who have a small perforation, such as that caused by a ventilation tube, should ask a doctor whether they need to keep water out of the ear.  A cholesteatoma is treated surgically.  Key Points Acute discharge in people without longstanding ear problems or a weakened immune system is usually not dangerous and is typically due to an external ear infection or a perforated eardrum resulting from a middle ear infection.  People who have chronic ear symptoms or any symptoms besides ear discharge (particularly any neurologic symptoms) should be evaluated by a specialist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-15 18:29:35"}

They include A node that is about 2 centimeters (almost an inch) or more in diameter A node that is draining pus A node that feels hard Risk factors for HIV infection (such as having been stuck with a needle used by another person or having engaged in high-risk sexual activities) or tuberculosis (such as living or working with a person who has tuberculosis or having recently moved from an area where tuberculosis is prevalent) Fever or unexplained weight loss When to see a doctor If a lymph node is very painful or draining pus or other material, people should see a doctor right away.  Other people should call their doctor.  The doctor will decide how quickly they need to be seen based on the presence of warning signs and other symptoms.  For people who have no warning signs and otherwise feel well, a delay of a week or so is not harmful.  What the doctor does The doctor first asks questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.  Doctors then do a physical examination.  What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the swollen lymph nodes and the tests that may need to be done Doctors ask Where the swollen nodes are located How long nodes have been swollen Whether the person has pain Whether the person has recently had an injury (particularly cat scratches and rat bites) Whether the person has an infection or symptoms of an infection (for example, a runny nose, cough, fever, sore throat, unexplained weight loss, or tooth or gum pain) Doctors then do a physical examination.  Doctors check for fever and examine areas where lymph nodes are found.  Doctors check the person for any signs of infection or lumps elsewhere in the body.  People who have swollen lymph nodes throughout the body usually have a disorder that affects the entire body.  However, people who have swollen lymph nodes in only one area may have a disorder that affects only that area (for example, an infection) or more widespread disease.  Sometimes, the history and physical examination findings suggest the cause, as for example when the person has an upper respiratory infection or a dental infection.  In other cases, findings do not point to a single cause.  People with warning signs are more likely to have a serious disorder, but people with lymph node swelling and no other symptoms may also have a serious disorder.  Nodes that are hard, very enlarged, and do not move when pushed may indicate cancer.  Tenderness, redness, and warmth in a single enlarged lymph node may indicate an infection of the node.   Testing If doctors suspect a specific disorder (for example, mononucleosis in a young person with fever, sore throat and an enlarged spleen), initial testing is directed at that condition If history and physical examination do not show a likely cause, further testing depends on the nodes involved and the other findings present.  People with warning signs and those with widespread lymph node swelling should have a complete blood count and chest x-ray.  Doctors may also test for tuberculosis, HIV infection, and mononucleosis.  Sometimes blood tests are needed to detect toxoplasmosis and syphilis.  In people with joint pain or stiffness or a rash, blood tests are done for systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus).  If doctors suspect cancer or lymphoma, the person has a lymph node biopsy.  Biopsy may also be needed when widespread lymph node swelling does not resolve within 3 to 4 weeks.  Treatment of Swollen Lymph Nodes Treatment is directed at the cause.  For example, if a bacterial infection of the lymph node is suspected, a trial of antibiotics is given to see if the swelling resolves.  Key Points In most cases, the cause is an obvious nearby skin or tissue infection or a harmless viral infection that goes away on its own.  Testing is usually needed when there are warning signs, when other symptoms or risk factors suggest certain specific disorders, or when widespread lymph node swelling has no apparent cause.  When lymph node swelling does not resolve within 3 or 4 weeks, a biopsy may be needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "MSD", "batch_name": "20240321", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-04-14 22:08:40", "update_time": "2024-04-14 22:47:23"}

There are many different types of arthritis.  What is psoriatic arthritis? Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis.  Psoriasis typically causes red bumps or patches covered with silvery, shiny scales.  Psoriasis is a chronic (long-lasting) skin disease that causes raised, red patches on your skin. \n【1】 Psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint, but it usually develops in the spine, hands, and feet Doctors look at your symptoms to tell if you have psoriatic arthritis Medicines can sometimes help What causes psoriatic arthritis? Psoriatic arthritis happens when your body's immune system Overview of the Immune System is your body's defense system.  It helps protect you from illness and infection. \n【2】 Doctors don’t know exactly why this happens.  You're more likely to get psoriatic arthritis if someone in your family has it.  What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis? You may have one or more of the following: Joints at the tips of your fingers and toes become inflamed (swollen, red, and warm) Pain in the back of the ankle  or sole of the foot  Back pain in your hips and knees Joints that are inflamed for a long time may become deformed Psoriasis typically causes red bumps or patches covered with silvery, shiny scales. \n【3】 The rash may appear before or after you have joint pain.  You may not notice the rash if it's hidden in your scalp, navel, or creases of your skin.  The skin and joint symptoms sometimes appear and disappear together, but often either the skin or the joint symptoms are worse than the other.  How can doctors tell if I have psoriatic arthritis? Doctors can tell if you have psoriatic arthritis based on your symptoms and family history and by doing an exam.  They will also do tests: X-rays Plain X-Rays A plain x-ray is an imaging test that takes a picture of the inside of your body.  It uses a low dose of x-ray radiation.  X-rays show body parts according to how dense (solid) they are. \n【4】 Doctors will prescribe medicines to control the rash and lessen the swelling in your joints.

The pelvic cavity also contains the intestines, bladder, and lower ureters.  A pelvic mass may originate from any of these structures.  A pelvic mass may be detected during routine gynecologic examination or an imaging test.  A pelvic mass may be noncancerous or cancerous Introduction to Gynecologic Tumors Gynecologic cancers often involve the uterus, ovaries, cervix, vulva, vagina, fallopian tubes, or the peritoneum. \n【1】 Etiology of Pelvic Mass Pelvic masses may originate from the upper female reproductive tract (cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries) or from other pelvic structures (intestines, bladder, ureters).  Type of mass in the female reproductive tract tends to vary by age group: In infants, in utero maternal hormones may stimulate development of follicular ovarian cysts in a fetus or during the first few months of life.  This effect is rare.  In children, prepubertalmasses are uncommon.  Ovarian masses may be follicular ovarian cysts or, rarely, benign or malignant tumors.  In women of reproductive age, the most common cause of symmetric uterine enlargement is pregnancy.  Another common uterine mass is a uterine fibroid Uterine Fibroids are benign uterine tumors of smooth muscle origin. \n【2】 Adnexal masses are often related to the menstrual cycle; they include follicular ovarian cysts Functional ovarian cysts Benign ovarian masses include functional cysts (eg, corpus luteum cysts) and neoplasms (eg, benign teratomas).  Most are asymptomatic; some cause pelvic pain. \n【3】 These cysts often resolve spontaneously within a few months. \n【4】 Symptoms depend on location of the implants. \n【5】 In postmenopausal women, a new or growing pelvic mass is more likely to be cancerous.  Many benign ovarian or uterine masses (eg, endometriomas, adenomas, fibroids) depend on ovarian hormone secretion and thus do not develop or enlarge after menopause.  Metastatic cancer of the breast, colon, or stomach may first manifest as an adnexal mass.  Evaluation of Pelvic Mass History General medical and complete obstetric and gynecologic histories are obtained. \n【6】 If malignancy is suspected, evaluation for groin or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is indicated.  A complete gynecologic examination is done.  Distinguishing uterine from adnexal masses may be difficult.  If ectopic pregnancy is suspected, excess pressure during examination is avoided to prevent rupture.  Advanced endometriosis can manifest as nonmobile cul-de-sac masses.  Cervical motion tenderness occurs in pelvic infection (and appendicitis).  Nonmobile masses may be inflammatory (eg, due to endometrioma, hydrosalpinx, or tubo-ovarian abscess) or malignant.  Hydrosalpinges are usually fluctuant, tender, nonmobile, and sometimes bilateral.  In early pregnancy or in young girls, pelvic organ masses may be palpable in the abdomen because the space in the pelvis is too small to contain a large mass.  Testing If women of reproductive age have a pelvic mass, a pregnancy test should be done regardless of menstrual or sexual history. \n【7】 If a suspected mass is not detected during examination or the cause cannot be determined, an imaging test is done.  Usually, pelvic ultrasonography is done first.  In women of reproductive age, simple, thin-walled cystic adnexal masses that are 3 to 10 cm (usually follicular cysts) do not require further investigation unless they persist for> 3 menstrual cycles or are accompanied by moderate to severe pain .  The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group developed the Simple Rules to preoperatively assess risk of cancer in women who have ovarian or other adnexal tumors that are thought to require surgery.  Classification is based on the presence or absence of 10 ultrasound features and has a higher sensitivity and specificity than other classification scores.  In 2016, the IOTA Simple Rules were updated to include a risk calculation tool (SRrisk), which can be used on mobile devices .  If ultrasonography does not clearly delineate size, location, and consistency of the mass, another imaging test may do so.  MRI is typically used for further evaluation of the mass; CT is useful for evaluating suspected metastases.  Radiographic characteristics that suggest cancer include a solid component (particularly those with a blood supply), thick septations, surface excrescences, ascites, and additional intraabdominal masses.  Suspected adnexal masses are evaluated with surgical exploration because biopsy may spread malignant cells.  Tumor markers may help in the diagnosis of specific tumors Tumor Immunodiagnosis Tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can help diagnose various tumors and sometimes determine the response to therapy or recurrence. \n【8】 Suspected uterine masses may be evaluated with endometrial biopsy and/or surgical exploration. \n【9】 Key Points Type of mass in the female reproductive tract tends to vary by age group.

The main symptoms are watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping and nausea.  People can become infected with Cystoisospora by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite.  Cystoisosporiasis symptoms are more severe and prolonged in people with a weakened immune system Overview of Immunodeficiency Disorders involve malfunction of the immune system, resulting in infections that develop and recur more frequently, are more severe, and last longer than usual. \n【1】 Symptoms vary but include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, and weight loss.  Doctors usually diagnose the infection by identifying Cystoisospora in a sample of stool.  Cystoisosporiasis can be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). \n【2】 Cystoisosporiasis is most common in tropical and subtropical climates.  When encountered in the United States, it is usually in immigrants or travelers with exposure in endemic areas.  Symptoms of Cystoisosporiasis The primary symptom of cystoisosporiasis is sudden, nonbloody, watery diarrhea.  Other symptoms include fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, fatigue, and weight loss.  Symptoms in people with a normal immune system usually last weeks, then subside.  In people with a weakened immune system Overview of Immunodeficiency Disorders involve malfunction of the immune system, resulting in infections that develop and recur more frequently, are more severe, and last longer than usual. \n【3】 Diagnosis of Cystoisosporiasis Stool tests To diagnose cystoisosporiasis, a stool sample is examined under a microscope for Cystoisospora eggs.  Specialized techniques can be used to increase the chances of identifying the eggs.  When stool analysis does not identify a cause for persistent diarrhea, doctors may use a flexible viewing tube  to examine the upper part of digestive tract.  Doctors may use this procedure to obtain a sample of tissue to be examined and analyzed (biopsied).  Cystoisospora, if present, can be seen in a biopsy sample from the intestine.  Prevention of Cystoisosporiasis When traveling to tropical and subtropical areas where the infection is common, people should avoid eating uncooked foods, including salads and vegetables, and should avoid consuming potentially contaminated water and ice.  Hand washing with soap and water is important.  Drinking water that has been boiled is safe.  Filtering water through a 0. 1 or 0. 4 micron filter can remove cysts of Cystoisospora and other parasites, as well as bacteria that cause diseases.

For cystoisosporiasis, people who are allergic to (or intolerant of) TMP/SMX can be treated with pyrimethamine.  Leucovorin is given concurrently to prevent anemia and low white blood count, which are side effects of pyrimethamine.

Insulin resistance and obesity are often present.  Diagnosis is by clinical criteria, hormone measurement, and imaging to exclude a virilizing tumor.  Treatment is symptomatic.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs in 5 to 10% of women .  In the US, it is the most common cause of infertility.  PCOS is usually defined as a clinical syndrome, not by the presence of ovarian cysts.  But typically, ovaries contain many 2- to 6-mm follicular cysts and sometimes larger cysts containing atretic cells.  Ovaries may be enlarged with smooth, thickened capsules or may be normal in size.  This syndrome involves anovulation or ovulatory dysfunction and androgen excess of unclear etiology.  However, some evidence suggests that patients have a functional abnormality of cytochrome P450c17 affecting 17-hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in androgen production); as a result, androgen production increases.  Pathogenesis appears to involve environmental and hereditary factors. \n【1】 Complications Polycystic ovary syndrome has several significant potential complications.  Infertility is related to ovulatory dysfunction is abnormal, irregular (with ≤ 9 menses/year), or absent ovulation.  Menses are often irregular or absent. \n【2】 Estrogen levels are elevated, increasing risk of endometrial hyperplasia and, potentially, endometrial cancer is usually endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Typically, it manifests as postmenopausal uterine bleeding.  Diagnosis is by biopsy.  Staging is surgical. \n【3】 Androgen levels are often elevated, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome is characterized by a large waist circumference (due to excess abdominal fat), hypertension, abnormal fasting plasma glucose or insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. \n【4】 Hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance may be present and may contribute to increased ovarian production of androgens.  Over the long term, androgen excess increases the risk of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  Risk of androgen excess and its complications may be just as high in women who are not overweight as in those who are.  Calcification of coronary arteries and thickening of the carotid intima media is more common among women with PCOS, suggesting possible subclinical atherosclerosis is characterized by patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) that encroach on the lumen of medium-sized and large arteries. \n【5】 Symptoms and Signs of PCOS Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome typically begin during puberty and worsen with time.  Ovulatory dysfunction is usually present at puberty, resulting in primary amenorrhea; thus, polycystic ovary syndrome is unlikely if regular menses occurred for a time after menarche.  Premature adrenarche is common, caused by excess dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and often characterized by early growth of axillary hair, body odor, and microcomedonal acne.  Typical symptoms include irregular menses, usually oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) can be primary or secondary. \n【6】 However, in up to half of women with PCOS, weight is normal, and some women are underweight.  Body hair may grow in a male pattern (eg, on the upper lip, chin, back, thumbs, and toes; around the nipples; and along the linea alba of the lower abdomen).  Some women have acne, and some have signs of virilization, such as temporal hair thinning.  Other symptoms may include weight gain (sometimes seemingly hard to control), fatigue, low energy, sleep-related problems (including sleep apnea), mood swings, depression, anxiety, and headaches.  In some women, fertility is impaired.  Symptoms vary from woman to woman.  Areas of thickened, darkened skin (acanthosis nigricans) may appear in the axillae, on the nape of the neck, in skinfolds, and on knuckles and/or elbows; the cause is high insulin levels due to insulin resistance.  If women with PCOS become pregnant and if obesity is present, risk of pregnancy complications is increased.  These complications include gestational diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy , preterm delivery Preterm Labor (contractions resulting in cervical change) that begins before 37 weeks gestation is considered preterm. \n【7】 Eclampsia is unexplained generalized seizures in patients with preeclampsia. \n【8】 Diagnosis of PCOS Clinical criteria Pelvic ultrasonography Tests to exclude other endocrinologic disorders, such as measurement of serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels PCOS is suspected if women have at least two typical symptoms (eg, irregular menses, hirsutism).  The diagnosis requires at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: Ovulatory dysfunction causing menstrual irregularity Clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism > 10 follicles per ovary (detected by pelvic ultrasonography), usually occurring in the periphery and resembling a string of pearls Testing includes pregnancy testing and measurement of FSH, prolactin, and TSH to exclude other possible causes of symptoms.  Transvaginal ultrasonography is done to detect polycystic ovaries and exclude other possible causes of symptoms.  However, transvaginal ultrasonography is not done in adolescent girls The diagnosis is not based on measurement of serum androgens.  For patients who meet diagnostic criteria, other causes of hirsutism or virilization (eg, androgen-secreting tumors) should be excluded by measuring serum androgens including Total testosterone Early-morning serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is measured to exclude adrenal virilism is a syndrome in which excessive adrenal androgens cause virilization. \n【9】 Normal to mildly increased testosterone and normal to mildly decreased FSH levels suggest PCOS.  Also, serum cortisol is measured to exclude Cushing syndrome is a constellation of clinical abnormalities caused by chronic high blood levels of cortisol or related corticosteroids. \n【10】 Pearls & Pitfalls Polycystic ovary syndrome is unlikely if regular menses occurred for a time after menarche.  In adolescents with symptoms of PCOS, measure testosterone levels.  Diagnosing PCOS in adolescent girls Diagnosing PCOS in adolescents is complicated because physiologic changes during puberty (eg, hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity) are similar to features of PCOS.  Thus, separate criteria for diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents  have been suggested: however, no consensus has been reached.  These criteria require that both of the following conditions be present: Abnormal uterine bleeding pattern (abnormal for age or gynecologic age or symptoms that persist for 1 to 2 years) Evidence of hyperandrogenism (based on persistently elevated testosterone levels above adult norms [the best evidence], moderate-to-severe hirsutism, or moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris as an indication to test for hyperandrogenemia) Often, a 17-hydroxyprogesterone test is also done to screen adolescents for nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia Overview of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders, each characterized by inadequate synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both. \n【11】 Pelvic ultrasonography is usually indicated only if serum androgen levels or degree of virilization suggests an ovarian tumor.  Transvaginal ultrasonography is usually not used to diagnose PCOS in adolescent girls because it detects polycystic morphology in < 40% of girls and, used alone, does not predict the presence or development of PCOS. \n【12】 Treatment of PCOS Usually estrogen/progestin contraceptives or progestins Sometimes metformin or other insulin sensitizers Management of hirsutism and, in adult women, long-term risks of hormonal abnormalities Infertility treatments in women who desire pregnancy Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome aims to Manage hormonal and metabolic abnormalities and thus reduce risks of estrogen excess (eg, endometrial hyperplasia) and androgen excess (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders) Relieve symptoms Treat infertility Hormonal medications are used to cause regular shedding of the endometrium and reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.  Women are usually given an intermittent progestin (eg, medroxyprogesterone 5 to 10 mg orally once a day for 10 to 14 days every 1 to 2 months) or combination oral contraceptives to.  These treatments also reduce circulating androgens and usually help make menstrual cycles more regular.  Hormonal contraceptives are first-line therapy for menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism, and acne in women who have PCOS and who do not desire pregnancy.  Lifestyle changes and pharmacologic approaches are used to manage insulin insensitivity.  If obesity is present, weight loss and regular exercise are encouraged.  These measures may help induce ovulation, make menstrual cycles more regular, increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism.  Weight loss may also help improve fertility.  Bariatric surgery may be an option for some women with PCOS .  However, weight loss is unlikely to benefit normal-weight women with PCOS.  Metformin 500 to 1000 mg twice a day is used to help increase insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, irregular menses, and diabetes or insulin resistance if lifestyle modifications are ineffective or if they cannot take or cannot tolerate hormonal contraceptives.  Metformin can also reduce free testosterone levels.  When metformin is used, serum glucose should be measured, and kidney and liver function tests should be done periodically.  Because metformin may induce ovulation, contraception is needed if pregnancy is not desired.  Metformin helps correct metabolic and glycemic abnormalities and makes menstrual cycles more regular, but it has little or no beneficial effect on hirsutism, acne, or infertility.  Insulin sensitizers (eg, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or thiazolidinediones) combined with metformin are being studied .  Other studies are evaluating the role of microbiota treatments for PCOS .  Many patients with PCOS have infertility, and those who desire pregnancy should be referred to infertility specialists.  Infertility treatments Treatment Ovulatory dysfunction is abnormal, irregular (with ≤ 9 menses/year), or absent ovulation. \n【13】 Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility.  Weight loss may also be helpful.  Hormone therapy that may have contraceptive effects is avoided.  The aromatase inhibitor letrozole can also be used to stimulate ovulation.  Other fertility medications may also be tried.  They include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to stimulate the ovaries, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist to stimulate the release of FSH, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger ovulation.  If clomiphene and other medications are unsuccessful or if there are other indications for laparoscopy, laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be considered; however possible long-term complications of drilling (eg, adhesions, ovarian insufficiency) must be considered.  Ovarian drilling involves using electrocautery or a laser to drill holes in small areas of the ovaries that produce androgens.  Ovarian wedge resection is not recommended.  Because women with PCOS-associated obesity have a higher risk of pregnancy complications (including gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia), preconception assessment of body mass index, blood pressure, and oral glucose tolerance is recommended.  For hirsutism Treatment Hirsutism is the excessive growth of thick or dark hair in women in locations that are more typical of male hair growth patterns  can be used .  Eflornithine cream 13. 9% twice a day may help remove unwanted facial hair.  In adult women who do not desire pregnancy, hormone therapy that decreases androgen levels or spironolactone can be tried.  Spironolactone 50 to 100 mg twice a day is effective, but because this medication may have teratogenic effects, effective contraception is needed.  Cyproterone, an antiandrogen (not available in the US), reduces the amount of unwanted body hair in 50 to 75% of affected women.
