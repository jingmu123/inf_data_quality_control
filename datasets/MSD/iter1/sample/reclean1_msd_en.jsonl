hyperparathyroidism based on elevated PTH levels in people with hypercalcemia.\n【19】 If the doctor finds elevated levels of PTH, further tests are needed, including Measurement of calcium levels Measurement of phosphorus levels Imaging studies (to evaluate bone density and determine the presence of kidney stones) Doctors sometimes use various imaging studies, such as high-resolution computed

removal of the affected parathyroid gland.\n【21】 For people with only mildly elevated calcium levels who do not have symptoms or complications, doctors may instead monitor them regularly (called active surveillance).\n【22】 Occasionally, doctors prescribe medications such as cinacalcet or etelcalcetide to decrease secretion of PTH.\n【23】 Parathyroid Cancer Parathyroid cancers are rare.\n【24】

patients ≤ 50 can be observed or have CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast if an imaging study is desired.\n【49】 Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and laparoscopy are rarely helpful in the absence of specific indications.\n【50】 Between the initial evaluation and the follow-up visit, the patient (or family, if the patient is a child) should record any pain, including its nature, intensity, duration, and precipitating factors.\n【51】 Diet, defecation pattern, and any remedies tried (and the results obtained) should also be recorded.\n【52】 This record may reveal inappropriate behavior patterns and exaggerated responses to pain or otherwise suggest a diagnosis.\n【53】 Treatment Physiologic conditions are treated.\n【54】 If the diagnosis of functional CAP is made, frequent examinations and tests should be avoided because they may focus on or magnify the physical complaints or imply that the physician lacks confidence in the diagnosis.\n【55】 There are no modalities to cure functional CAP; however, many helpful measures are available.\n【56】 These measures rest on a foundation of a trusting, empathic relationship between the physician, patient, and family.\n【57】 Patients should be reassured that they are not in danger; specific concerns should be sought and addressed.\n【58】 The physician should explain the laboratory findings and the nature of the problem and describe how the pain is generated and how the patient perceives it (ie, there may be a tendency to feel pain at times of stress).\n【59】 It is important to avoid perpetuating the negative psychosocial consequences of chronic pain (eg, prolonged absences from school or work, withdrawal from social activities) and to promote independence, social participation, and self-reliance.\n【60】 These strategies help the patient control or tolerate the symptoms while participating fully in everyday activities.\n【61】 Drugs such as antispasmotics and tricyclic antidepressants can be effective.\n【62】 Opioids should be avoided because of the concern about potential dependency and possibility of narcotic bowel syndrome.\n【63】 Dietary modification and consumption of high-fiber foods or fiber supplements may help some patients.\n【64】 Evidence supporting the use of probiotics for centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome is currently limited.\n【65】 Regular follow-up visits should be scheduled weekly, monthly, or bimonthly, depending on the patient’s needs, and should continue until well after the problem has resolved.\n【66】 Psychiatric referral may be required if symptoms persist, especially if the patient is depressed or there are significant psychologic stressors at home.\n【67】 Key Points Most cases represent a functional process.\n【68】 Red flag findings indicate a physiologic cause and need for further assessment.\n【69】 Testing is guided by clinical features.\n【70】 Repeated testing after physiologic causes are ruled out is usually counterproductive.\n【71】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7607, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-02-29 19:23:31", "update_time": "2024-02-29 23:45:27"}

prescription drugs, people interested in taking this herbal supplement need to discuss possible drug interactions with their doctor.\n【17】 Most antidepressants must be taken regularly for at least several weeks before they begin to work.\n【18】 Most people need to take antidepressants for 6 to 12 months to prevent relapses.\n【19】 People over 50 may have to take them for up to 2 years.\n【20】 Side effects vary with each type of antidepressant.\n【21】 Sometimes when treatment with one drug does not relieve depression, a different type (class) or a combination of antidepressant drugs is prescribed.\n【22】 Risk of suicide Antidepressants and the risk of suicide is death caused by an intentional act of self-harm that is designed to be lethal.\n【23】 Suicidal behavior includes completed suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidal ideation.\n【24】 after starting an antidepressant has been in the news.\n【25】 A few people do become more agitated, depressed, and anxious shortly after an antidepressant is started or after the dose is increased.\n【26】 Some people, especially younger children and adolescents, become increasingly suicidal if these symptoms are not detected and rapidly treated.\n【27】 This finding was first reported with SSRIs, but the risk probably does not differ among classes of antidepressants.\n【28】 The person's doctor should be notified if symptoms worsen after antidepressants are started or the dose is increased (or for any reason).\n【29】 Because having suicidal thoughts is also a symptom of depression, doctors may have difficulty determining what role antidepressants play in suicidal thoughts and behavior.\n【30】 Some studies cast doubt on the connection.\n【31】 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now the most commonly used class of antidepressants.\n【32】 SSRIs are effective in treating depression as well as other mental health disorders that often coexist with depression.\n【33】 Although SSRIs can cause nausea, diarrhea, tremor, weight loss, and headache, these side effects are usually mild or go away with continued use.\n【34】 Most people tolerate the side effects of SSRIs better than the side effects of heterocyclic antidepressants Heterocyclic (including tricyclic) antidepressants Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes.\n【35】 SSRIs are less likely to adversely affect the heart than heterocyclic antidepressants.\n【36】 However, a few people may seem more agitated, depressed, and anxious the first week after they start SSRIs or the dose is increased.\n【37】 These people, especially younger children and adolescents, may become increasingly suicidal if these symptoms are not detected and rapidly treated.\n【38】 People taking SSRIs and their loved ones should be warned of this possibility and instructed to call their doctor if symptoms worsen with treatment.\n【39】 However, because people with untreated depression also sometimes complete suicide, people and their doctors must balance this risk against the risk of drug treatment.\n【40】 Also, with long-term use, SSRIs may have additional side effects, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction (in one third of people).\n【41】 Some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, cause loss of appetite.\n【42】 During the first few weeks after SSRIs are started, people may feel drowsy during the day, but this effect is temporary.\n【43】 Abruptly stopping some of the SSRIs may result in a discontinuation syndrome that includes dizziness, anxiety, irritability, fatigue, nausea, chills, and muscle aches.\n【44】 Newer antidepressants Newer antidepressants are as effective and safe as SSRIs and have similar side effects.\n【45】 These drugs include Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (such as bupropion) Serotonin modulators (such as mirtazapine and trazodone) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (such as venlafaxine and duloxetine) As may occur with SSRIs, the risk of suicide may be temporarily increased when these drugs are first started, and abruptly stopping serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors may result in a discontinuation syndrome.\n【46】 They often cause drowsiness and lead to weight gain.\n【47】 They can also cause an increase in heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure when a person stands (called orthostatic hypotension Dizziness or Light-Headedness When Standing Up In some people, particularly older people, blood pressure drops excessively when they sit or stand up (a condition called orthostatic or postural hypotension).\n【48】 Other side effects, called anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? , include blurred vision, dry mouth, confusion, constipation, and difficulty starting to urinate.\n【49】 Anticholinergic effects are often more severe in older people.\n【50】 Abruptly stopping heterocyclic antidepressants, as with SSRIs, may result in a discontinuation syndrome.\n【51】 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are very effective but are rarely prescribed except when other antidepressants have not worked.\n【52】 People who use MAOIs must adhere to a number of dietary restrictions and take special precautions to avoid a serious reaction involving a sudden, severe rise in blood pressure with a severe, throbbing headache (hypertensive crisis).\n【53】 This crisis can cause a stroke.\n【54】 Precautions include Not eating foods or beverages that contain tyramine, such as beer on tap, red wines (including sherry), liqueurs, overripe foods, salami, aged cheeses, fava or broad beans, yeast extracts (marmite), canned figs, raisins, yogurt, cheese, sour cream, pickled herring, caviar, liver, extensively tenderized meats, and soy sauce Not taking pseudoephedrine, contained in many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies Not taking dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), reserpine (an antihypertensive drug), or meperidine (an analgesic) Carrying an antidote, such as chlorpromazine tablets, at all times and, if a severe, throbbing headache occurs, taking the antidote at once and going to the nearest emergency room People who take MAOIs should also avoid taking other types of antidepressants, including heterocyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, bupropion, serotonin modulators, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.\n【55】 Taking an MAOI with another antidepressant can cause a dangerously high body temperature, breakdown of muscle, kidney failure, and seizures.\n【56】 can be fatal.\n【57】 Abruptly stopping MAOIs, as with SSRIs, may result in a discontinuation syndrome.\n【58】 Table Melatonergic antidepressant Agomelatine is a melatonergic antidepressant that stimulates melatonin receptors and is used to treat major depressive episodes.\n【59】 It has several benefits: It causes fewer side effects than most antidepressants.\n【60】 It does not cause daytime sleepiness, insomnia, or weight gain.\n【61】 It is not addictive and does not cause withdrawal symptoms.\n【62】 Agomelatine may cause headache, nausea, and diarrhea.\n【63】 It may also increase liver enzyme levels, so doctors measure these levels before treatment is started and every 6 weeks thereafter.\n【64】 People with liver problems should not take agomelatine.\n【65】 Ketamine-like drugs Ketamine is an anesthetic drug.\n【66】 However, researchers have learned that brain mechanisms affected by ketamine play a role in depression and that, when given at sub-anesthetic doses, can produce rapid though usually transient improvements in depressive symptoms.\n【67】 Recently, esketamine, a form of ketamine, was given Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to traditional treatments.\n【68】 It is given as a nasal spray.\n【69】 It is used in lower doses than those given for anesthesia.\n【70】 Most people who are given ketamine or esketamine have a decrease in depression symptoms within 3 to 4 hours.\n【71】 This is a very rapid response compared to that of most antidepressant drugs, which can take several weeks to be effective.\n【72】 In most cases, the effect of ketamine or esketamine begins to decline over one to two weeks.\n【73】 Repeating the dose every week or so often helps but it can stop working after a few months, although a few people can maintain their improvement on one treatment a month.\n【74】 feeling a distortion of time and space, and having illusions.\n【75】 These drugs are usually given in a doctor’s office or a hospital clinic so that doctors can watch the person for side effects for a few hours and because ketamine is a drug that is sometimes used recreationally.\n【76】 .", "tokens":

which nutrients from food are not absorbed properly in the small intestine.\n【16】 Type 2: Type 2 is also called Schmidt syndrome.\n【17】 In this type, which develops in adults (particularly women), the adrenal and thyroid glands are underactive, although the thyroid gland sometimes becomes overactive.\n【18】 People with type 2 polyglandular deficiency may also develop diabetes Mellitus (DM) Diabetes

enteropathic arthritis) but can occur in rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.\n【13】 (usually with cervical spinal pain).\n【14】 New-onset oligoarthritis plus spinal pain is particularly likely to be a seronegative spondyloarthropathy if the patient has a family history of the same disorder.\n【15】 Eye redness and pain and low back pain suggest ankylosing spondylitis.\n【16】 Prior plaque psoriasis in a patient with new onset of oligoarthritis strongly suggests psoriatic arthritis.\n【17】 It can also help distinguish between an inflammatory and a noninflammatory process.\n【18】 Synovial fluid examination includes white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, Gram stain and cultures, and microscopic examination for crystals using polarized light.\n【19】 Finding crystals in synovial fluid confirms crystal-induced arthritis but does not rule out coexisting infection.\n【20】 A noninflammatory synovial fluid (eg, WBC count of < 1000/mcL [< 1 × 109/L]) is more suggestive of osteoarthritis or trauma.\n【21】 Hemorrhagic fluid is consistent with hemarthrosis.\n【22】 Synovial fluid WBC counts can be very high (eg, > 50,000/mcL [> 50 × 109/L]) in both infectious and crystal-induced arthritis.\n【23】 Synovial fluid WBC counts in systemic inflammatory disorders causing polyarthritis are most often between about 1,000 and 50,000/mcL (1 and 50 × 109/L).\n【24】 If the specific diagnosis cannot be established based on the history and examination, additional tests may be needed.\n【25】 ESR and C-reactive protein can be done to help determine whether the arthritis is inflammatory.\n【26】 Elevated ESR and C-reactive protein levels suggest inflammation but are nonspecific, particularly in older adults.\n【27】 Findings are more specific if values are high during inflammatory flare-ups and normal between flare-ups.\n【28】 Once a diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory disorder is clinically suspected, supportive serologic testing for antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may assist in making the diagnosis.\n【29】 Specific tests should only be ordered to provide support for a specific diagnosis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA-associated vasculitis, or rheumatoid arthritis.\n【30】 If arthritis is chronic, x-rays and/or ultrasonography are typically done to look for signs of joint damage.\n【31】 Joint ultrasonography has many advantages over x-rays, including allowing for better identification of fluid around the joints, visualization of tendons and other periarticular structures during the physical exam, and guidance for arthrocentesis and joint injections.\n【32】 Systemic inflammatory diseases may require either immunosuppression or antibiotics as determined by the diagnosis.\n【33】 Joint inflammation is usually treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs).\n【34】 Pain without inflammation is usually more safely treated with acetaminophen.\n【35】 Joint immobilization with a splint or sling can sometimes relieve pain.\n【36】 Heat or cold therapy may be analgesic in inflammatory joint diseases.\n【37】 Because chronic polyarthritis can lead to inactivity and secondary muscle atrophy, continued physical activity should be encouraged.\n【38】 Geriatrics Essentials: Joint Pain osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic arthropathy characterized by disruption and potential loss of joint cartilage along with other joint changes, including bone hypertrophy (osteophyte formation).\n【39】 is by far the most common cause of arthritis in older people.\n【40】 Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the joints.\n【41】 most commonly begins between ages 30 and 40, but in up to one third of patients, it develops after the age of 60.\n【42】 Because cancers can cause paraneoplastic polyarthritis, cancer should be considered in older adults in whom new-onset rheumatoid arthritis is suspected, particularly if the onset is acute, if the lower extremities are predominantly affected, or if there is bone tenderness.\n【43】 Polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyalgia Rheumatica Polymyalgia rheumatica is a syndrome closely associated with giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).\n【44】 It affects adults > 55.\n【45】 should also be considered in patients > 50 who have hip and shoulder girdle stiffness and pain, even if patients have arthritis of peripheral joints (most often the hands).\n【46】 Gout is a disorder caused by hyperuricemia (serum urate > 6.\n【47】 8 mg/dL [> 0.\n【48】 in older women has predilection for the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the hands.\n【49】 Key Points The differential diagnosis of polyarticular joint pain can be narrowed by considering which and how many joints are affected, whether inflammation is present, whether joint distribution is symmetric, and whether any extra-articular symptoms or signs are present.\n【50】 Chronic polyarthritis is most often caused by juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and chronic polyarthralgia is most often caused by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in adults.\n【51】 Acute polyarticular arthritis is most often due to infection, gout, or a flare of a systemic inflammatory disease.\n【52】 Arthrocentesis is mandatory in most cases of a new effusion to rule out infection, diagnose crystal-induced arthropathy, and help distinguish between an inflammatory and noninflammatory process.\n【53】 .", "tokens": "",

behavior.\n【1】 Each person also varies from day to day, depending on the circumstances.\n【2】 Sudden changes in personality and behavior can be roughly categorized as involving one of the following types of symptoms: Confusion or delirium Delusions Disorganized speech or behavior Hallucinations Mood extremes (such as depression or mania) These categories are not disorders.\n【3】 They are just one way doctors organize different types of abnormal thought, speech, and behavior.\n【4】 These changes in personality and behavior can be caused by physical or mental health problems.\n【5】 People may have more than one type of change.\n【6】 For example, people with confusion due to a drug interaction sometimes have hallucinations, and people with mood extremes may have delusions.\n【7】 Confusion and delirium Confusion and Delirium is a sudden, fluctuating, and usually reversible disturbance of mental function.\n【8】 refer to a disturbance of consciousness.\n【9】 That is, people are less aware of their environment and, depending on the cause, may be excessively agitated and belligerent or drowsy and sluggish.\n【10】 Some people alternate between being less alert and being overly alert.\n【11】 Their thinking appears cloudy and slow or inappropriate.\n【12】 They have trouble focusing on simple questions and are slow to respond.\n【13】 Speech may be slurred.\n【14】 Often, people do not know what day it is, and they may not be able to say where they are.\n【15】 Some cannot give their name.\n【16】 Delirium often results from a serious, newly developed physical problem or a reaction to a drug, especially in older people.\n【17】 People who have delirium need immediate medical attention.\n【18】 If the cause of delirium is identified and corrected quickly, delirium often resolves.\n【19】 Delusions are fixed false beliefs that people hold despite evidence to the contrary.\n【20】 Some delusions are based on a misinterpretation of actual perceptions and experiences.\n【21】 For example, people may feel persecuted, thinking that a person behind them on the street is following them or that an ordinary accident is purposeful sabotage.\n【22】 Other people think that song lyrics or newspaper articles contain messages that refer specifically to them (called a delusion of reference).\n【23】 Some beliefs seem more plausible and can be difficult to identify as delusions because they could occur or have occurred in real life.\n【24】 For example, people occasionally are followed by government investigators or have their work sabotaged by coworkers.\n【25】 In such cases, a belief can be identified as a delusion by how strongly people hold the belief despite evidence to the contrary.\n【26】 Other delusions are easier to identify.\n【27】 For example, in religious or grandiose delusions, people may believe they are Jesus or the president of the country.\n【28】 Some delusions are quite bizarre.\n【29】 For example, people may think that their organs have all been replaced by machine parts or that their head contains a radio that receives messages from the government.\n【30】 Disorganized speech Disorganized speech refers to speech that does not contain the expected logical connections between thoughts or between questions and answers.\n【31】 For example, people may jump from one topic to another without ever finishing a thought.\n【32】 The topics may be slightly related or entirely unrelated.\n【33】 In other cases, people respond to simple questions with long, rambling answers, full of irrelevant detail.\n【34】 Answers may be illogical or completely incoherent.\n【35】 This type of speech differs from the difficulty expressing or understanding language (aphasia is partial or complete loss of the ability to express or understand spoken or written language.\n【36】 It results from damage to the areas of the brain that control language.\n【37】 or forming words (dysarthria is loss of the ability to articulate words normally.\n【38】 that is caused by a brain disorder such as stroke.\n【39】 Occasionally misspeaking or intentionally being evasive, rude, or humorous is not considered disorganized speech.\n【40】 Disorganized behavior Disorganized behavior refers to doing quite unusual things (such as undressing or masturbating in public or shouting and swearing for no apparent reason).\n【41】 People with disorganized behavior typically have trouble doing normal daily activities (such as maintaining good personal hygiene or obtaining food).\n【42】 Hallucinations Hallucination refers to hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, or feeling things that are not actually there.\n【43】 That is, people perceive things, seemingly through their senses, that are not caused by an outside stimulus.\n【44】 Any sense can be involved.\n【45】 The most common hallucinations involve hearing things (auditory hallucinations), usually voices.\n【46】 The voices often make derogatory comments about the person or command the person to do something.\n【47】 Not all hallucinations are caused by a mental disorder.\n【48】 Psychedelic drugs Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that cause profound distortions in people's perceptions.\n【49】 such as LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin, are referred to as hallucinogens because they can cause visual hallucinations.\n【50】 Some types of hallucinations are more likely to be caused by a neurologic disorder Introduction to Symptoms of Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerve Disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves are called neurologic disorders.\n【51】 For example, before a seizure occurs, people may smell something when there is no smell (an olfactory hallucination).\n【52】 Mood extremes Mood extremes include outbursts of rage, periods of extreme elation (mania In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n【53】 or depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder.\n【54】 and, conversely, constant expression of little or no emotion (appearing unresponsive or apathetic).\n【55】 Causes Although people sometimes assume that changes in personality, thinking, or behavior are all due to a mental disorder, there are many possible causes.\n【56】 All causes ultimately involve the brain, but dividing them into four categories can be helpful: Mental disorders Drugs (including drug intoxication, withdrawal, and side effects) Disorders that affect mainly the brain Bodywide (systemic) disorders that also affect the brain Mental disorders Mental disorders include Anxiety disorders Overview of Anxiety Disorders Anxiety is a feeling of nervousness, worry, or unease that is a normal human experience.\n【57】 Bipolar disorder Bipolar Disorder In bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), episodes of depression alternate with episodes of mania or a less severe form of mania called hypomania.\n【58】 depression A short discussion of prolonged grief disorder.\n【59】 Dissociative disorders Overview of Dissociative Disorders Occasionally everyone has minor problems integrating their memories, perceptions, identity, and consciousness.\n【60】 (when people feel detached from themselves or from the world around them) Obsessive compulsive disorders Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions, compulsions, or both.\n【61】 Obsessions are recurring, persistent, unwanted, anxiety-provoking, intrusive ideas, images, or urges.\n【62】 (when mental factors are expressed as physical symptoms) Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders Overview of Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders Trauma- and stress-related disorders result from exposure to a traumatic or stressful event.\n【63】 Specific disorders include acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.\n【64】 Drugs may affect personality or behavior when they cause Intoxication: Particularly alcohol Use Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning).\n【65】 (when consumed in large amounts), amphetamines are stimulant drugs that are used to treat certain medical conditions but are also subject to abuse.\n【66】 cocaine is an addictive stimulant drug made from leaves of the coca plant.\n【67】 Cocaine is a strong stimulant that increases alertness, causes euphoria, and makes people feel powerful.\n【68】 Hallucinogens are a class of drugs that cause profound distortions in people's perceptions.\n【69】 (such as LSD), and phencyclidine Ketamine and Phencyclidine (PCP) Ketamine and phencyclidine are chemically similar drugs used for anesthesia but are sometimes used recreationally.\n【70】 Ketamine is available in powder and liquid form.\n【71】 (PCP) Withdrawal: Alcohol Withdrawal symptoms Alcohol (ethanol) is a depressant (it slows down brain and nervous system functioning).\n【72】 barbiturates Withdrawal symptoms , benzodiazepines Withdrawal symptoms Antianxiety and sedative medications are prescription drugs used to relieve anxiety and/or help with sleep, but their use can result in dependency and a substance use disorder.\n【73】 and opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse.\n【74】 Side effects Drug Effectiveness and Safety The main goals of drug development are demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of the drug.\n【75】 Because all drugs can harm as well as help, safety is relative.\n【76】 Drugs intended to affect brain function (including antiseizure drugs Antiseizure drugs In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.\n【77】 antidepressants Drug Treatment for Depression Agomelatine, a new type of antidepressant, is a possible treatment for major depressive episodes.\n【78】 sedatives Misuse of Antianxiety Medications and Sedatives Antianxiety and sedative medications are prescription drugs used to relieve anxiety and/or help with sleep, but their use can result in dependency and a substance use disorder.\n【79】 and stimulants), drugs with anticholinergic effects Anticholinergic: What Does It Mean? (such as antihistamines), opioid pain relievers Opioid Pain Relievers Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.\n【80】 Doctors choose a pain reliever based on the type and duration of pain and on the drug's likely benefits and risks.\n【81】 Rarely, certain antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure cause changes in personality and behavior.\n【82】 Disorders that mainly affect the brain These disorders can affect personality, mood, and behavior.\n【83】 Brain infections, such as meningitis Introduction to Meningitis is inflammation of the layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges) and of the fluid-filled space between the meninges (subarachnoid space).\n【84】 encephalitis is inflammation of the brain that occurs when a virus directly infects the brain or when a virus, vaccine, or something else triggers inflammation.\n【85】 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that involves the brain (called HIV-associated encephalopathy HIV-Associated Dementia HIV-associated dementia is progressive deterioration in mental function due to infection of the brain with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n【86】 Brain tumors Overview of Brain Tumors A brain tumor can be a noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant) growth in the brain.\n【87】 Head injuries, such as a concussion A concussion is an alteration in mental function or level of awareness caused by a head injury.\n【88】 and postconcussion syndrome Concussion Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) In multiple sclerosis, patches of myelin (the substance that covers most nerve fibers) and underlying nerve fibers in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord are damaged or destroyed.\n【89】 Parkinson disease Parkinson Disease (PD) Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive degenerative disorder of specific areas of the brain.\n【90】 Seizure disorders Seizure Disorders In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.\n【91】 Bodywide disorders that also affect the brain Bodywide disorders that also affect the brain include Kidney failure Overview of Kidney Failure This chapter includes a new section on COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI).\n【92】 Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.\n【93】 Liver failure Liver Failure Liver failure is severe deterioration in liver function.\n【94】 Liver failure is caused by a disorder or substance that damages the liver.\n【95】 Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood.\n【96】 Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes.\n【97】 Systemic lupus erythematosus Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory connective tissue disorder that can involve joints, kidneys, skin, mucous membranes, and blood vessel walls.\n【98】 (lupus) Thyroid disorders, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism is underactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones and a slowing of vital body functions.\n【99】 or an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions.\n【100】 Less commonly, Lyme disease Lyme Disease Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted infection caused by Borrelia species, primarily by Borrelia burgdorferi and sometimes by Borrelia mayonii in the United States.\n【101】 sarcoidosis is a disease in which abnormal collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) form in many organs of the body.\n【102】 syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.\n【103】 It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health.\n【104】 or a vitamin deficiency causes personality and behavior changes.\n【105】 Evaluation During the initial evaluation, doctors try to determine whether symptoms are due to a mental or physical disorder.\n【106】 The following information can help people decide when a doctor’s evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.\n【107】 Warning signs In people with changes in personality or behavior, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.\n【108】 These warning signs include Symptoms that appear suddenly Attempts to harm themselves or others or threats to do so Confusion or delirium Fever Severe headache Symptoms that suggest malfunction of the brain, such as difficulty walking, balancing, or speaking or vision problems A recent head injury (within several weeks) When to see a doctor People who have warning signs should be seen by a health care practitioner as soon as possible.\n【109】 Law enforcement may need to be called if people are violent.\n【110】 What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.\n【111】 Doctors then do a physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【112】 with a mental status examination Mental Status When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【113】 (which evaluates the ability to pay attention, memory, mood, and ability to think abstractly, follow commands, and use language, among other things).\n【114】 Many mental disorders begin in a person's teens or 20s.\n【115】 If a mental disorder begins during middle age or later, especially if there is no obvious trigger (such as loss of a loved one), the cause is more likely to be a physical disorder.\n【116】 A physical disorder is also more likely to be the cause when mental symptoms change significantly during middle age or later in people with a chronic mental disorder.\n【117】 If changes began recently and suddenly in people of any age, doctors ask about conditions that can trigger such changes.\n【118】 For example, they ask whether people have just started or stopped taking a prescription or recreational drug.\n【119】 Doctors ask about other symptoms that may suggest a cause, such as Palpitations: Possibly an overactive thyroid gland or use or withdrawal of a drug Tremors: Parkinson disease or withdrawal of a drug Difficulty walking or speaking: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, stroke, or intoxication from an opioid or a sedative Headache: Brain infection, brain tumor, or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage) Numbness or tingling: A stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a vitamin deficiency People are also asked whether they have previously been diagnosed and treated for a mental or seizure disorder.\n【120】 If they have been treated, doctors ask whether they have stopped taking their drugs or decreased the dose.\n【121】 However, because people with mental disorders may also develop physical disorders, doctors do not automatically assume that any new abnormal behavior is caused by the mental disorder.\n【122】 Doctors ask about physical disorders people have (such as diabetes) and about their lifestyle (such as their marital status, job situation, educational background, use of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, and living arrangements).\n【123】 Doctors also ask whether family members have had any physical disorders that can cause mental symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis).\n【124】 During the physical examination, doctors look for signs of physical disorders that can cause changes in mental status, particularly the following: Fever and/or a rapid heart rate (suggesting an infection, alcohol withdrawal, or use of amphetamines or cocaine in high doses) Confusion or delirium (suggesting drug intoxication or withdrawal) Abnormalities during the neurologic examination, such as difficulty forming words or understanding language (possibly suggesting a brain disorder) Confusion and delirium are more likely to result from a physical disorder.\n【125】 People with mental disorders are rarely confused or delirious.\n【126】 However, many physical disorders that cause changes in behavior do not cause confusion or delirium, but they often cause other symptoms that may appear to be a mental disorder.\n【127】 Doctors bend the person's neck forward.\n【128】 If doing so is difficult or painful, meningitis may be the cause.\n【129】 Doctors check the legs and abdomen for swelling, which may result from kidney or liver failure.\n【130】 If the skin or whites of the eyes look yellow, the cause may be liver failure.\n【131】 Doctors may examine the interior of the eyes with a handheld device that looks like a small flashlight (called an ophthalmoscope Ophthalmoscopy A person who has eye symptoms should be checked by a doctor.\n【132】 If doctors see swelling in part of the optic nerve (papilledema is a condition in which increased pressure in or around the brain causes the part of the optic nerve inside the eye to swell.\n【133】 pressure within the skull may be increased, and tumors or bleeding in the brain may be the cause of the mental symptoms.\n【134】 Table Testing Typically, tests include the following: Measurement of the oxygen level in the blood using a sensor clipped to the person's fingertip (called pulse oximetry) Blood tests to measure sugar (glucose) levels Blood tests to measure levels of alcohol and levels of any antiseizure drugs Antiseizure drugs In seizure disorders, the brain's electrical activity is periodically disturbed, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.\n【135】 the person is taking Urine tests to check for drugs A complete blood count (CBC) Sometimes blood tests to measure electrolyte levels and to evaluate kidney function For most people known to have a mental disorder, no further testing is needed if their only symptoms are worsening of their typical symptoms, if they are awake and alert, and if results of these tests and their physical examination are normal.\n【136】 For most other people, blood tests to check for HIV infection are usually done.\n【137】 (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.\n【138】 (MRI) of the brain: If symptoms of mental dysfunction have just appeared or if people have delirium, a headache, a recent head injury, or any abnormality detected during the neurologic examination A spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【139】 Whatever the cause, people who are a danger to themselves or others typically need to be hospitalized and treated whether they are willing or not.\n【140】 Many states require that such decisions be made by someone appointed to make health care decisions for the mentally ill person (called a surrogate decision maker Default Surrogate Decision Making If a person is unable to make decisions about personal health care, some other person or people must provide direction in decision making.\n【141】 If the person has not appointed a decision maker, doctors may contact the next of kin, or a court may appoint an emergency guardian.\n【142】 People who are not dangerous to themselves or others can refuse evaluation and treatment, despite the difficulties their refusal may create for themselves and their family.\n【143】 Key Points Not all changes in personality and behavior are due to mental disorders.\n【144】 Other causes include drugs (including withdrawal and side effects), disorders that mainly affect the brain, and bodywide disorders that affect the brain.\n【145】 Doctors are particularly concerned about people with symptoms that suggest brain malfunction, such confusion or delirium, fever, headache, people with a recent head injury and people who want to harm themselves or others.\n【146】 Typically, doctors do blood tests to measure the levels of oxygen, sugar (glucose), and certain drugs (such as antiseizure drugs) the person is taking, and they may do other tests based on the symptoms and results of the examination.\n【147】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4747, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",

Methods used to diagnose specific parasitic diseases are summarized in the table Collecting and Handling Specimens for Microscopic Diagnosis of Parasitic Infections Collecting and Handling Specimens for Microscopic Diagnosis of Parasitic Infections .\n【1】 Table Parasitic infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clinical syndromes in residents of or travelers to areas where sanitation and hygiene are poor or where vector-borne diseases are endemic.\n【2】 For example, fever in a traveler returning from an endemic area suggests the possibility of malaria.\n【3】 Experience indicates that people who have immigrated from endemic areas to developed countries and who return home to visit friends and relatives are at particular risk.\n【4】 They frequently do not seek or cannot afford pretravel vaccines, medications, and advice on disease prevention and are more likely to enter high-risk settings than tourists who stay at resort facilities.\n【5】 Although less frequent, the possibility of locally acquired parasitic infection must also be considered in residents of developed countries who present with suggestive clinical syndromes, even if they have not traveled; some parasites are endemic in developed countries and others (mainly those transmissible by the fecal-oral route) may be acquired from infected travelers.\n【6】 Historical information, physical findings, and laboratory data may also suggest specific parasitic infections.\n【7】 For example, eosinophilia is common when helminths migrate through tissue and suggests a parasitic infection in an immigrant or returning traveler.\n【8】 The diagnosis of parasitic infections was once based on the identification of ova, larvae, or adult parasites in stool, blood, tissue or other samples or the presence of antibodies in serum, but diagnosis is being increasingly based on identification of parasite antigens or molecular tests for parasite DNA.\n【9】 Physicians with expertise in parasitic infections and tropical medicine are available for consultation at many major medical centers, travel clinics, and public health facilities.\n【10】 For detailed descriptions of diagnostic methods, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Identification of Parasites of Public Health Concern.\n【11】 Gastrointestinal tract parasites Various stages of protozoa and helminths that infect the gastrointestinal tract are typically shed in the stool.\n【12】 Routine detection requires examination of stool specimens, preferably 3 collected on different days, because shedding can vary.\n【13】 Sensitivity of stool examination for ova and parasites is low enough that when clinical suspicion is strong, empirical treatment should be considered.\n【14】 Sensitive and specific assays are now available to detect antigens of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica in stool.\n【15】 Although expensive, molecular tests also are available for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, E.\n【16】 histolytica, and Cyclospora.\n【17】 If not examined immediately, stools should be refrigerated, but not frozen.\n【18】 Portions of fresh stools should also be emulsified in fixative to preserve gastrointestinal protozoa.\n【19】 Concentration techniques can be used to improve sensitivity.\n【20】 Anal cellophane tape or swabs may collect pinworm or tapeworm eggs.\n【21】 If strongyloidiasis is infection with Strongyloides stercoralis.\n【22】 is suspected, one or more specialized stool tests should be done if larvae are not seen on direct examination of fresh stool.\n【23】 Antibiotics, x-ray contrast material, purgatives, and antacids can hinder detection of ova and parasites for several weeks.\n【24】 Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be considered when routine stool examinations are negative and amebiasis is infection with Entamoeba histolytica.\n【25】 It is acquired by fecal-oral transmission.\n【26】 is suspected in patients with persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.\n【27】 Sigmoidoscopic specimens should be collected with a curet or spoon (cotton swabs are not suitable) and processed immediately for microscopy.\n【28】 Duodenal aspirates or small-bowel biopsy specimens may be necessary for diagnosis of such infections as cryptosporidiosis is infection with the protozoan Cryptosporidium.\n【29】 The primary symptom is watery diarrhea, often with other signs of gastrointestinal distress.\n【30】 and Microsporidiosis is infection with microsporidia.\n【31】 Advice for treating parasitic infections also is available from experts at major medical and public health centers and travel clinics, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) web site, in textbooks of infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and in summary form from The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics.\n【32】 Some drugs that are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for parasitic infections can be obtained from the CDC Drug Service.\n【33】 Prevention of Parasitic Infections Despite substantial investment and research, no vaccines are yet available for prevention of human parasitic infections.\n【34】 Prevention is based on avoidance strategies.\n【35】 Transmission of most intestinal parasites can be prevented by Sanitary disposal of feces Handwashing Adequate cooking of food Provision of purified water For the international traveler, the best advice is “cook it, boil it, peel it, or forget it.\n【36】 ” When followed, these measures reduce but do not eliminate the risk of intestinal parasitic infections as well as the risk of bacterial and

AFP can occasionally increase to 500 ng/mL in acute (fulminant) liver failure Acute Liver Failure Acute liver failure is caused most often by drugs and hepatitis viruses.\n【37】 Cardinal manifestations are jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.\n【38】 Diagnosis is clinical.\n【39】 High AFP levels can occur in a few other disorders (eg, embryonic teratocarcinomas, hepatoblastomas in children, some hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal tract cancers, some cholangiocarcinomas), but these circumstances are not common and usually can be differentiated based on clinical and histopathologic grounds.\n【40】 Sensitivity, specificity, and peak levels of AFP in patients with HCC vary by population, reflecting differences in factors such as hepatitis prevalence and ethnicity.\n【41】 In areas with a relatively low prevalence of hepatitis (eg, North America, western Europe), AFP cutoff values of 20 ng/mL (20 mcg/L) have a sensitivity of 39 to 64% and a specificity of 76 to 91%.\n【42】 However, not all HCCs produce AFP.\n【43】 Thus, AFP is not an ideal screening test but does have a role in detecting HCC and may be used to monitor response to treatment.\n【44】 Levels exceeding normal (> 20 ng/mL [20 mcg/L]), especially when increasing, strongly suggest HCC.\n【45】 In cirrhotic patients with a mass and a high value (eg, > 200 ng/mL [200 mcg/L]), the predictive value is high.\n【46】 The combined use of AFP and ultrasonography typically provides adequate screening.\n【47】 Tests for hepatic fibrosis Certain blood test panels aim to assess the degree of hepatic fibrosis Hepatic Fibrosis Hepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing in which excessive connective tissue builds up in the liver.\n【48】 The extracellular matrix is overproduced, degraded deficiently, or both.\n【49】 For example, FibroTestTM (known as FibroSure® in the US) incorporates multiple parameters.\n【50】 Another such test, the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI), uses these 2 routine laboratory tests.\n【51】 These blood test panels are often used in combination with ultrasound elastography Ultrasonography or vibration-controlled transient elastography to assess hepatic fibrosis, particularly in patients with chronic hepatitis C Hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis C is a common cause of chronic hepatitis.\n【52】 It is often asymptomatic until manifestations of chronic liver disease occur.\n【53】 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Fatty liver is excessive accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes.\n【54】 (NAFLD).\n【55】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8880, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#54#54#nafild无法翻译", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-02-29 19:23:30", "update_time": "2024-03-01 01:52:48"}

in international settings.\n【1】 Certain infections are common when traveling to certain areas, and many people are most concerned about infection when considering a trip overseas.\n【2】 However, motor vehicle crashes and heart disease are the most common causes of death among international travelers.\n【3】 Heart disease is the most common cause of death among nontravelers as well, suggesting that attention to health before leaving home is the best way to prevent illness while away.\n【4】 Injuries and Death While Traveling Injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of death among younger and middle-aged travelers.\n【5】 Another common cause of death while traveling is drowning.\n【6】 Common-sense measures can be taken to prevent many such injuries.\n【7】 For example, people uncomfortable with unfamiliar traffic patterns (such as driving on the left side of the road in England versus the right side in the United States) can take public transportation or hire drivers familiar with local roads and traffic laws.\n【8】 Travelers should avoid overcrowded taxis, ferries, or other transports and avoid nighttime driving and swimming in poorly lit areas.\n【9】 People should wear seat belts even as passengers and should use a helmet when bicycling.\n【10】 Travelers should avoid motorcycles and mopeds and avoid riding on bus roofs or in open truck beds.\n【11】 Also, alcohol should never be consumed before driving or swimming, even where laws do not formally prohibit such actions or where laws that do exist are not enforced.\n【12】 People should also avoid beaches with turbulent waves, particularly when lifeguards are not present.\n【13】 Many cities are unsafe after dark, and some are unsafe even during the day.\n【14】 A traveler should avoid walking alone on poorly lit or deserted streets in such cities, especially in countries where the traveler is obviously a stranger.\n【15】 Fair-skinned travelers are more vulnerable to sunburn at tropical latitudes and at high altitude.\n【16】 Use of high-SPF (sun protection factor of 30 or higher) sunscreen is advisable.\n【17】 When both sunscreen and insect repellent are used, sunscreen should be applied first, then, after at least fifteen minutes, insect repellent.\n【18】  The most common cause of death among younger and middle-aged travelers is injury.\n【19】 Traveler’s Diarrhea Traveler’s diarrhea Traveler’s Diarrhea Traveler’s diarrhea is an infection characterized by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting that commonly occur in travelers to areas of the world with poor water purification.\n【20】 (turista) is the most common health problem among international travelers.\n【21】 It is caused by bacteria or viruses that have contaminated food or water.\n【22】 The risk of traveler’s diarrhea may be reduced by the following measures: Drinking and brushing teeth with bottled, filtered, boiled, UV-treated, or chlorinated water Avoiding ice Eating freshly prepared foods only if they have been heated to steaming temperatures Eating only fruits and vegetables that people peel or shell themselves Avoiding food from street vendors Washing hands frequently Avoiding all foods likely to have been exposed to flies Taking certain antibiotics can also prevent traveler’s diarrhea.\n【23】 However, such use has a risk of side effects and may increase the chances that bacteria will develop resistance to antibiotics.\n【24】 Thus, doctors recommend preventive antibiotics only for people who have an immune deficiency disorder.\n【25】 In most cases, traveler’s diarrhea subsides by itself in about 3 to 5 days and requires only the steady intake of fluids to prevent dehydration.\n【26】 Ordinary clear liquids (without caffeine or alcohol) are adequate for most people.\n【27】 Young children and older people may benefit from powdered rehydration mixes or an oral rehydration solution.\n【28】 People who have moderate to severe symptoms (symptoms severe enough to disrupt activities) should consider taking an antibiotic, especially if they have vomiting, fever, abdominal cramps, or blood in the stool.\n【29】 Azithromycin is appropriate for most countries and is recommended for children and pregnant women.\n【30】 People should contact their doctor for an antibiotic prescription before travel.\n【31】 If people are 6 years of age or older and have no bloody stools, fever, or abdominal pain, they can also be treated with the antidiarrheal drug loperamide (which is available without a prescription).\n【32】 For older adults and young children, powdered rehydration mixes are available for travel.\n【33】 If these mixes are unavailable, rehydration solutions can be made by adding 6 teaspoons of sugar and 1 half teaspoon of salt to 1 liter of water.\n【34】 However, solutions should be prepared carefully because young children can become seriously ill or die if they drink much of a solution that has been incorrectly mixed (for example, if a rehydration mix has not been fully diluted).\n【35】 Malaria in Travelers malaria is infection of red blood cells with one of five species of Plasmodium, a protozoan.\n【36】 is common throughout the tropics.\n【37】 Malaria is prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and taking an antimalarial drug.\n【38】 Mosquito bites are prevented by the following measures: Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers (especially at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active) Sleeping under a mosquito net Applying the insecticide permethrin to clothing or purchasing clothing that has been impregnated with permethrin Using insect repellants that contain diethyltoluamide (DEET) or picaridin Insect repellants can also help prevent other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes fever, generalized body aches, and, if severe, external and internal bleeding (called dengue hemorrhagic fever).\n【39】 and yellow fever Yellow Fever Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that occurs mainly in the tropics.\n【40】 Yellow fever occurs only in the tropical areas of Central Africa, southern Panama, and South America.\n【41】 Antimalarial drugs Even when people take measures to avoid mosquito bites, it is still necessary to take a drug to prevent malaria Drugs to prevent malaria is infection of red blood cells with one of five species of Plasmodium, a protozoan.\n【42】 (such as mefloquine, chloroquine, doxycycline, or atovaquone/proguanil) when traveling to many parts of the world.\n【43】 Information about specific areas is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: Malaria and Travelers).\n【44】 Pregnant women should consider delaying travel to areas where malaria is common because malaria is more likely to be serious and life threatening among pregnant women than among women who are not pregnant, even when preventive drugs are used.\n【45】 Pregnant women who cannot postpone travel must weigh the risks of taking protective drugs, the effects of which on pregnancy are not well known, against the risks of traveling without protection.\n【46】 Although the new RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine is recommended for children living in regions with moderate to high Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission, this vaccine is not recommended for travelers to those regions.\n【47】 Sexually Transmitted Infections Sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.\n【48】 syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum.\n【49】 It can occur in three stages of symptoms, separated by periods of apparent good health.\n【50】 and hepatitis B Overview of Acute Viral Hepatitis Acute viral hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, generally meaning inflammation caused by infection with one of the five hepatitis viruses.\n【51】 are more common in low- and middle-income countries.\n【52】 Because HIV and hepatitis B also are transmitted through blood and needles, an international traveler should not accept a blood transfusion without assurance that the blood has been tested for infection.\n【53】 Also, injections should be accepted only through one-time-only disposable needles.\n【54】 COVID-19 COVID-19 COVID-19 COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness that can be severe and is caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2.\n【55】 Symptoms of COVID-19 vary significantly.\n【56】 is an acute respiratory illness that can be severe and is caused by the coronavirus named SARS-CoV2.\n【57】 The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated limitation of travel to and from various countries.\n【58】 Entry requirements (for example, testing, vaccination, quarantine) change frequently, and travelers should check the websites of their nation's health agency (for example, in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as well as those of the destination countries for current recommendations.\n【59】 dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes fever, generalized body aches, and, if severe, external and internal bleeding (called dengue hemorrhagic fever).\n【60】 is a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes fever, generalized body aches, and, if severe, external and internal bleeding (called dengue hemorrhagic fever).\n【61】 Dengue is common in the tropics and subtropics worldwide.\n【62】 It is most common in Southeast Asia but has become more common in Central and South America and other countries.\n【63】 It has occurred in the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico and the U.\n【64】 S.\n【65】 Virgin Islands), in Oceania, and in the Indian subcontinent.\n【66】 A vaccine is available in Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, and some other countries (not in the United States), but use is restricted to people who have previously had dengue.\n【67】 Mosquito bite prevention is important for people traveling to areas where dengue is common.\n【68】 and chikungunya Arboviruses Arbovirus, arenavirus, and filovirus are viruses that are spread from animals to people and, with some viruses, from people to people.\n【69】 The animal involved depends on the type of virus.\n【70】 (flu) is a viral infection of the lungs and airways with one of the influenza viruses.\n【71】 It is common in international travelers.\n【72】 An annual influenza vaccines Influenza Vaccine The influenza virus vaccine helps protect against influenza.\n【73】 Two types of influenza virus, type A and type B, regularly cause seasonal epidemics of influenza in the United States.\n【74】 is the best way to prevent influenza.\n【75】 Schistosomiasis is infection caused by certain flatworms (flukes), called schistosomes.\n【76】 is a common and potentially serious infection caused by a parasite that lives in freshwater in Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and eastern South America.\n【77】 The risk of schistosomiasis can be reduced by avoiding freshwater activities in areas where schistosomiasis is common.\n【78】 Asymptomatic travelers with freshwater exposure in regions where schistosomiasis is common should be screened for the parasite after returning from such regions.\n【79】 Lice and Scabies Lice Infestation Lice infestation is a parasitic skin infestation caused by tiny wingless insects.\n【80】 Lice spread most frequently through close person-to-person contact.\n【81】 and scabies Infestation Scabies is a parasitic skin infestation caused by mites.\n【82】 Scabies usually spreads from person to person through physical contact.\n【83】 are common in crowded accommodations, underdeveloped areas, and places where hygiene measures are poor.\n【84】 They can be treated with permethrin, malathion, or lindane lotions.\n【85】 However, these lotions should not be used preventively.\n【86】 infection causes few or only mild symptoms in adults.\n【87】 However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects in the baby.\n【88】 Zika virus infection is spread by mosquitoes and also by sexual contact and transfusion of blood from an infected person.\n【89】 The disease has spread widely through South and Central America, the Caribbean, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Pacific Islands.\n【90】 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that all of the cases of Zika virus infection in the United States were in travelers returning from affected areas.\n【91】 There were no reports of Zika virus infection spread by local mosquitoes or through sexual contact.\n【92】 Please note that THE MANUAL is not responsible for the

not understand what activities and behaviors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and having sex without using a condom) can put their pregnancy at risk.\n【26】 Many adolescents smoke.\n【27】 Using condoms can help prevent sexually transmitted infections.\n【28】 Women aged 35 and older are at increased risk of having the following: A preexisting disorder that increases risk during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy is classified as one of the following: Chronic hypertension: Blood pressure was high before the pregnancy.\n【29】 Problems related to the pregnancy, such as Preeclampsia and Eclampsia Preeclampsia is new high blood pressure or worsening of existing high blood pressure that is accompanied by excess protein in the urine and that develops after the 20th week of pregnancy.\n【30】 (diabetes that develops during pregnancy), chromosomal abnormalities Overview of Chromosome and Gene Disorders Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain a person's genes.\n【31】 in the fetus, and stillbirth is death of a fetus after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n【32】 Stillbirth may result from a problem in the woman, placenta, or fetus.\n【33】 Complications during labor, such as difficult labor or a placenta that detaches too soon (placental abruption Placental Abruption Placental abruption is the premature detachment of the placenta from the wall of the uterus, usually after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n【34】 or is mislocated (placenta previa Placenta Previa Placenta previa is attachment (implantation) of the placenta over the opening of the cervix, in the lower rather than the upper part of the uterus.\n【35】 Children of women aged 35 or older are more likely to have birth defects, such as heart defects Overview of Heart Defects About one in 100 babies is born with a heart defect.\n【36】 Some are severe, but many are not.\n【37】 a narrowed esophagus (esophageal atresia Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula Esophageal atresia is a birth defect in which the esophagus narrows or comes to an end.\n【38】 a defect of the urethra called hypospadias Birth defects

or more of the skull's sutures close too early.\n【40】 As women age, genetic evaluation Genetic Screening Before Pregnancy Genetic screening is used to determine whether a couple is at increased risk of having a baby with a hereditary genetic disorder.\n【41】 for chromosomal abnormalities becomes more important.\n【42】 In older pregnant women, ultrasonography may be done to help determine whether the fetus has birth defects, Weight Women who are very thin—with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 19.\n【43】 or weigh less than 100 pounds before becoming pregnant are more likely to have Small, underweight babies Overweight women (with a BMI of 25 to 29.\n【44】 9 before pregnancy) and obese women (with a BMI of more than 30) are more likely to have the following problems: Very large babies (large-for-gestational age Large-for-Gestational-Age (LGA) Newborns A newborn who weighs more than 90% of newborns of the same gestational age at birth (above the 90th percentile) is considered large

healthy environment for the fetus because the pregnancy has lasted too long.\n【55】 Need for a cesarean delivery Cesarean Delivery Cesarean delivery is surgical delivery of a baby by incision through a woman’s abdomen and uterus.\n【56】 In the United States, up to 30% of deliveries are cesarean.\n【57】 Doctors encourage overweight and obese women to exercise at least 3 times a week for a total of 150 minutes a week.\n【58】 These women should talk to their doctor about what exercises are appropriate for them.\n【59】 Changes to a healthier diet may be recommended.\n【60】 Height Women shorter than 5 feet are more likely to have a small pelvis, which may make movement of the fetus through the pelvis and vagina (birth canal) difficult during labor.\n【61】 For example, the fetus's shoulder is more likely to lodge against the pubic bone.\n【62】 This complication is called shoulder dystocia Shoulder Dystocia Position refers to whether the fetus is facing rearward (toward the woman’s back—that is, face down when the woman lies on her back) or forward (face up).\n【63】 Also, short women are more likely to have preterm labor Preterm Labor that occurs before 37 weeks of pregnancy is considered preterm.\n【64】 Babies born prematurely can have serious health problems.\n【65】 The diagnosis of preterm labor is usually obvious.\n【66】 and a baby who is born underweight (small-for-gestational age

in both men and women at any age, but it is more common among women and older people, affecting about 30% of older women and 15% of older men.\n【2】 Although incontinence is more common among older people, it is not a normal part of aging.\n【3】 Incontinence may be sudden and temporary, as when a person is taking a drug that has a diuretic effect, or it may be long lasting (chronic).\n【4】 Urinary incontinence in children Urinary Incontinence in Children Urinary incontinence is defined as the involuntary release of urine occurring two or more times per month after toilet training.\n【5】 is discussed separately.\n【6】 Types of Incontinence There are several types of incontinence: Urge incontinence is uncontrolled urine leakage (of moderate to large volume) that occurs immediately after an urgent, irrepressible need to urinate.\n【7】 Getting up to urinate during the night (nocturia) and nocturnal incontinence are common.\n【8】 Stress incontinence is urine leakage due to abrupt increases in intra-abdominal pressure (for example, those that occur with coughing, sneezing, laughing, bending, or lifting).\n【9】 Leakage volume is usually low to moderate.\n【10】 Overflow incontinence is dribbling of urine from an overly full bladder.\n【11】 Volume is usually small, but leaks may be constant, resulting in large total losses.\n【12】 Functional incontinence is loss of urine because of a problem with thinking or a physical impairment unrelated to the control of urination.\n【13】 For example, a person with dementia due to Alzheimer disease may not recognize the need to urinate or not know where the toilet is.\n【14】 People who are bedridden may be unable to walk to the toilet or reach a bedpan.\n【15】 Often, however, a person has more than one type of incontinence.\n【16】 People are then described as having mixed incontinence.\n【17】 Causes of Urinary Incontinence Several mechanisms can lead to urinary incontinence.\n【18】 Often, more than one mechanism is present: Weakness of the urinary sphincter or pelvic muscles (called bladder outlet incompetence) Something blocking the exit path of urine from the bladder (called bladder outlet obstruction) Spasm or overactivity of the bladder wall muscles (sometimes called overactive bladder) Weakness or underactivity of the bladder wall muscles Poor coordination of the bladder wall muscles with the urinary sphincter An increase in the volume of urine Functional problems Weakness or underactivity of the bladder wall muscles, bladder outlet obstruction, or particularly both can lead to inability to urinate (urinary retention Urinary Retention Urinary retention is inability to urinate or incomplete emptying of the bladder.\n【19】 People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence.\n【20】 Urinary retention can paradoxically lead to overflow incontinence because of leaking from an overly full bladder.\n【21】 An increase in the volume of urine (for example, caused by diabetes, use of diuretics, or excessive intake of alcohol or caffeinated drinks) can increase the amount of urine lost to incontinence, trigger an episode of incontinence, or even cause temporary incontinence to develop.\n【22】 However, it should not cause chronic incontinence.\n【23】 Functional problems commonly increase the volume of urine lost among people who are incontinent.\n【24】 However, functional problems are rarely the only cause of permanent incontinence.\n【25】 Overall, the most common causes of incontinence are Overactive bladder in children and young adults Urinary Incontinence

kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.\n【27】 and Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn.\n【28】 in older people Table  People often live with incontinence because they mistakenly believe it is a normal part of aging.\n【29】 Evaluation of Urinary Incontinence Urinary incontinence usually does not indicate a disorder that is life threatening; nevertheless, incontinence may cause embarrassment or lead people to restrict their activities unnecessarily, contributing to a decline in quality of life.\n【30】 Also, rarely, sudden incontinence can be a symptom of a spinal cord disorder.\n【31】 The following information can help people decide when a doctor's evaluation is needed and help them know what to expect during the evaluation.\n【32】 Warning signs In people with urinary incontinence, certain symptoms and characteristics are cause for concern.\n【33】 They include Symptoms of spinal cord damage (for example, weakness in the legs or loss of sensation in the legs or around the genitals or anus) When to see a doctor People with warning signs should go to an emergency department at once.\n【34】 People without warning signs should call their doctor.\n【35】 The doctor will decide how quickly they need to be seen based on their other symptoms and other known conditions.\n【36】 In general, if incontinence is the only symptom, a delay of a week or so is not harmful.\n【37】 Most people are embarrassed to mention incontinence to their doctors.\n【38】 Some people believe that incontinence is a normal part of aging.\n【39】 However, incontinence, even incontinence that has been present for some time or that occurs in an older person, may be helped by treatment.\n【40】 If symptoms of urinary incontinence are bothersome, interfere with activities of daily living, or cause people to curtail their social activities, people should see a doctor.\n【41】 What the doctor does Doctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history.\n【42】 Doctors then do a physical examination.\n【43】 What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the incontinence and the tests that may need to be done.\n【44】 Doctors ask questions about the circumstances of urine loss, including amount, time of day, and any precipitating factors (such as coughing, sneezing, or straining).\n【45】 People are asked whether they can sense the need to urinate and, if so, whether the sensation is normal or comes with sudden urgency.\n【46】 Doctors may also ask the person to estimate the amount of urine leakage.\n【47】 Doctors will also ask whether the person has any additional problems with urination, such as pain or burning during urination, a frequent need to urinate, difficulty starting urination, or a weak urine stream.\n【48】 Sometimes doctors may ask people to keep a record of their urination habits over a day or two.\n【49】 This record is called a voiding diary.\n【50】 Each time the person urinates, the volume and time are recorded.\n【51】 After an episode of incontinence, the person also records any related activities, especially eating, drinking, drug use, or sleep.\n【52】 Doctors ask about whether the person has other disorders that are known to cause incontinence, such as Dementia is a slow, progressive decline in mental function including memory, thinking, judgment, and the ability to learn.\n【53】 urinary tract stones in the Urinary Tract Stones (calculi) are hard masses that form in the urinary tract and may cause pain, bleeding, or an infection or block of the flow of urine.\n【54】 spinal cord Overview of Spinal Cord Disorders Spinal cord disorders can cause permanent severe problems, such as paralysis or impaired bladder and bowel control ( urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence).\n【55】 or other neurologic disorders, and prostate disorders Benign Prostate Disorders .\n【56】 Doctors need to know what drugs a person is taking because some drugs cause or contribute to incontinence.\n【57】 Women are asked about number and types of deliveries and any complications.\n【58】 All are asked about previous pelvic and abdominal surgery, particularly prostate surgery in men.\n【59】 The physical examination can help doctors narrow possible causes.\n【60】 Doctors test strength, sensation and reflexes in the legs, and sensation around the genitals and anus to detect nerve and muscle problems that may make it difficult for the person to remain continent.\n【61】 In women, doctors do a pelvic examination to detect abnormalities that could cause incontinence, such as vaginal atrophy Symptoms after menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【62】 In men and women, doctors do a rectal examination to look for signs of constipation or damage to the nerves supplying the rectum.\n【63】 In men, the rectal examination allows doctors to check the prostate because an enlarged prostate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland that can make urination difficult.\n【64】 The prostate gland enlarges as men age.\n【65】 or occasionally prostate cancer Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer begins in a small area of the prostate gland, an organ found only in males.\n【66】 The risk of prostate cancer increases as men age.\n【67】 can contribute to incontinence.\n【68】 The person may be asked to cough with a full bladder to detect whether stress incontinence Stress incontinence Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine.\n【69】 is present.\n【70】 Women may be asked to repeat this procedure during a pelvic examination, to see whether supporting some pelvic structures (with the doctor's fingers) eliminates the leak of urine.\n【71】 Testing Often findings during the physical examination can help doctors determine the cause or identify factors that contribute to incontinence.\n【72】 However, some tests are often needed so doctors can make a firm diagnosis.\n【73】 Routinely obtained tests include Urinalysis and urine culture Urinalysis and Urine Culture Urinalysis, the testing of urine, may be necessary in the evaluation of kidney and urinary tract disorders and can also help evaluate bodywide disorders such as diabetes or liver problems.\n【74】 Blood tests of kidney function Kidney Function Tests Doctors can assess kidney function by doing tests on blood and urine samples.\n【75】 Creatinine, a waste product, is increased in the blood when kidney function is decreased by a large amount.\n【76】 and sometimes others Postvoid residual volume (a catheter or ultrasonography probe is used to determine how much urine is left in the bladder after a person urinates) Sometimes urodynamic testing Urodynamic Tests Common.\n【77】 MultimediaPopup.\n【78】 LabTest Common.\n【79】 MultimediaPopup.\n【80】 LabTest Common.\n【81】 MultimediaPopup.\n【82】 LabTest Urodynamic testing includes cystometry, urinary flow rate testing, and cystometrography and is done when clinical evaluation and the above tests do not reveal the cause of incontinence.\n【83】 Cystometry is done to confirm urge incontinence and to determine whether the cause is overactive bladder.\n【84】 A bladder catheter is placed through the urethra.\n【85】 A doctor measures how much water can be injected into the bladder until the person develops a sense of urgency or bladder contractions.\n【86】 Peak urinary flow rate is measured in men to determine whether incontinence is caused by bladder outlet obstruction (usually caused by prostate disease Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous (benign) enlargement of the prostate gland that can make urination difficult.\n【87】 The prostate gland enlarges as men age.\n【88】 Men urinate into a special device (uroflowmeter) that measures the speed of urine flow and how much urine is released.\n【89】 Cystometrography is done if all other evaluation fails to reveal the cause of incontinence.\n【90】 Cystometrography is a test that measures bladder pressures when the bladder is filled with various volumes of water.\n【91】 Cystometrography is often done with electromyography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【92】 In certain centers with specialized equipment, bladder contraction strength can also be measured at the same time as sphincter and other bladder pressures.\n【93】 Although urodynamic testing is important, results do not always predict response to drug treatment or assess the relative importance of multiple causes.\n【94】 Treatment of Urinary Incontinence Treatment of specific causes Sometimes drugs to treat certain types of incontinence General measures to reduce inconvenience of incontinence The specific cause of incontinence can often be treated.\n【95】 There are also general measures that doctors may suggest to all people to reduce the inconvenience of incontinence.\n【96】 When a drug is causing a problem, doctors may be able to switch the person to a different drug or change the dosing schedule to provide relief (for example, a diuretic dose may be timed so that a bathroom is near when the drug takes effect).\n【97】 However, people should talk with their doctor before they stop taking a drug or change the amount or dosing schedule.\n【98】 Drugs are often useful for some types of incontinence but should supplement rather than replace general measures.\n【99】 Drugs include those that relax the bladder wall muscle and those that increase sphincter tone.\n【100】 Drugs that relax the urinary sphincter may be used to treat outlet obstruction in men with urge or overflow incontinence.\n【101】 General measures Regardless of the type and cause of incontinence, some general measures are usually helpful.\n【102】 Modifying fluid intake Bladder training Pelvic muscle exercises Fluid intake can be limited at certain times (for example, before going out or 3 to 4 hours before bedtime).\n【103】 Doctors may suggest that people avoid fluids that irritate the bladder (such as caffeine-containing fluids).\n【104】 However, people should drink 48 to 64 oz (1500 to 2000 mL) of fluid a day because concentrated urine irritates the bladder.\n【105】 Bladder training is a technique that involves having the person follow a fixed schedule for urination while awake.\n【106】 The doctor works with the person to establish a schedule of urinating every 2 to 3 hours and suppressing the urge to urinate at other times (for example, by relaxing and breathing deeply).\n【107】 As the person becomes better able to suppress the urge to urinate, the interval is gradually lengthened.\n【108】 A similar technique, called prompted voiding, can be used by people who care for a person with dementia or other cognitive problems.\n【109】 In this, the person is asked whether they need to urinate and whether they are wet or dry at specific intervals.\n【110】 are often effective, especially for stress incontinence.\n【111】 People must be certain to exercise the correct muscles, the muscles around the urethra and rectum that stop the flow of urine.\n【112】 The muscles are tightly squeezed for 1 to 2 seconds and then relaxed for about 10 seconds.\n【113】 The exercises are repeated about 10 times three times each day.\n【114】 People are gradually able to increase the time the muscles are tightly squeezed until the contraction is held for about 10 seconds each time.\n【115】 Because it can be difficult to learn to control the correct muscles, doctors may need to provide instruction or recommend the use of biofeedback or electrical stimulation (an electronic version of pelvic floor exercises in which an electric current is used to stimulate the correct muscles).\n【116】 Table Urge incontinence The goal is to relax the bladder wall muscles.\n【117】 Bladder training, Kegel exercises, and relaxation techniques are tried first.\n【118】 Biofeedback also can be tried.\n【119】 With the urge to urinate, the person can try relaxing, standing in place or sitting down, or tightening the pelvic muscles.\n【120】 The most commonly used drugs are oxybutynin and tolterodine.\n【121】 Oxybutynin is available as a skin patch or skin gel as well as a pill.\n【122】 Newer drugs include mirabegron, fesoterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, and trospium.\n【123】 If other treatments are ineffective for urge incontinence, further treatments can be tried, such as gentle electrical stimulation of the sacral nerves by a device similar to a pacemaker, instillation of chemicals into the bladder (when the cause is a spinal cord or brain disorder), or, rarely, surgery.\n【124】 Stress incontinence Treatment usually begins with bladder training and Kegel exercises.\n【125】 Avoiding physical stresses that cause loss of urine (for example, heavy lifting) and losing weight may help control incontinence.\n【126】 Pseudoephedrine may be useful in women with bladder outlet incompetence.\n【127】 Imipramine may be used for mixed stress and urge incontinence Urge incontinence Urinary incontinence is involuntary loss of urine.\n【128】 or for either separately.\n【129】 Duloxetine is also used for stress incontinence.\n【130】 If stress incontinence is caused by atrophic urethritis or vaginitis, estrogen cream is often effective.\n【131】 For people with stress incontinence, urinating frequently to avoid a full bladder is often helpful.\n【132】 For stress incontinence that is not relieved with drugs and behavioral measures, surgery or devices such as pessaries may be helpful.\n【133】 The vaginal sling procedure creates a hammock of support to help prevent the urethra from opening during coughing, sneezing, or laughing.\n【134】 Most commonly, a sling is created from synthetic mesh.\n【135】 Mesh implants are effective, but a few people with mesh implants have serious complications.\n【136】 Alternatively, doctors can create a sling using tissue from the abdominal wall or leg.\n【137】 In men with stress incontinence, a mesh sling or an artificial urinary sphincter implant may be placed around the urethra to prevent leakage of urine.\n【138】 Overflow incontinence Treatment depends on whether the cause is bladder outlet obstruction, weak bladder wall muscles, or both.\n【139】 For overflow incontinence caused by bladder outlet obstruction, specific treatments may help relieve obstruction (for example, surgery or drugs for prostate disease, surgery for cystocele, and dilation or stenting for urethral narrowing).\n【140】 For overflow incontinence caused by weak bladder wall muscles, treatments can include reducing the amount of urine in the bladder by intermittent insertion of a bladder catheter or, rarely, insertion of a catheter that remains in the bladder.\n【141】 The goal is to reduce the bladder's size, allowing its walls to regain some capacity to prevent it from overflowing.\n【142】 Other measures can help empty the bladder after urinating.\n【143】 These can include trying to urinate again after urination has ended (called double voiding), bearing down at the end of urination, and/or pressing over the lower abdomen at the end of urination.\n【144】 Occasionally, electrical stimulation can be used to help empty the bladder more completely.\n【145】 Essentials for Older People: Urinary Incontinence Although incontinence is more common among older people, it is not a normal part of aging.\n【146】 With aging, bladder capacity decreases, ability to delay urination declines, involuntary bladder contractions occur more often, and bladder contractions weaken.\n【147】 Thus, urination becomes more difficult to postpone and tends to be incomplete.\n【148】 The muscles, ligaments, and connective tissue of the pelvis weaken, contributing to incontinence.\n【149】 In postmenopausal women, decreased estrogen levels lead to atrophic urethritis and atrophic vaginitis and to decreasing the strength of the urethral sphincter.\n【150】 In men, prostate size increases, partially obstructing the urethra and leading to incomplete bladder emptying and strain on the bladder muscle.\n【151】 These changes occur in many normal, continent older people and may facilitate incontinence but do not cause it.\n【152】 Incontinence greatly reduces quality of life, causing embarrassment, isolation, and depression.\n【153】 Incontinence is often a reason older people require care in a long-term care facility.\n【154】 Urine irritates the skin, contributing to the formation of pressure sores Pressure Sores Pressure sores are areas of skin damage resulting from a lack of blood flow due to prolonged pressure.\n【155】 in people who are bedbound or chairbound.\n【156】 Older people with urge incontinence are at increased risk of falls and fractures as they rush to the toilet.\n【157】 Key Points Incontinence is common and can greatly reduce a person's quality of life, so people should be evaluated by a doctor.\n【158】 Although incontinence is more common among older people, it is not a normal consequence of aging.\n【159】 Some causes are reversible, even if long-standing.\n【160】 .", "tokens": "",

pledgets * There are several types of tamponade material/devices: Compressed polyvinyl acetate nasal tampon (sometimes with an internal airway tube), ideally with removal strings that can be secured to the patient's cheek to prevent aspiration and aid removal High-volume, low-pressure inflatable ballon tampon with an air passage and a carboxymethylcellulose (platelet aggregating) covering 1.\n【17】 25 cm (½-inch) petrolatum gauze strip, 180 cm (72\") long Nasal tampons are highly compressed for ease of insertion; they expand and become soft when hydrated.\n【18】 Tampons are much easier to insert and more comfortable than packing gauze and are preferred when available.\n【19】 Insertion of a petrolatum gauze strip is uncomfortable and often requires some analgesia and/or mild sedation (however, not enough to risk airway compromise).\n【20】 Thus, this procedure should be done only when other methods fail or are not available.\n【21】 Additional Considerations Ask about use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs.\n【22】 Check complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) if there are symptoms or signs of a bleeding disorder or the patient has severe or recurrent epistaxis.\n【23】 Relevant Anatomy Kiesselbach's plexus is a vascular watershed area on the anterior nasal septum that is the most common site of anterior epistaxis.\n【24】 Positioning The patient should sit upright in the sniffing position with the head extended, preferably in a specialized ENT chair.\n【25】 The patient's occiput should be supported to prevent sudden backward movement.\n【26】 The patient's nose should be level with the physician's eyes.\n【27】 The patient should hold the emesis basin to collect any continued bleeding or emesis of swallowed blood.\n【28】 Step-by-Step Description of Procedure Initial steps: Have the patient gently blow the nose to remove clots, or suction the nasal passageway carefully.\n【29】 Insert a nasal speculum with your index finger resting against the patient's nose or cheek and the handle parallel to the floor (so the blades open vertically).\n【30】 Slowly open the speculum and examine the nose using a bright headlamp or head mirror, which leaves one hand free to manipulate suction or an instrument.\n【31】 Use a Frazier-tip suction catheter to remove any blood and clots obscuring the view.\n【32】 Look for blood flowing from the anterior septum in the area of Kiesselbach's plexus, and look for blood flowing from the back of the nose.\n【33】 Apply a topical vasoconstrictor/anesthetic mixture: Place about 3 mL of 4% cocaine solution or 4% lidocaine with oxymetazoline in a small medicine cup and soak 2 or 3 cotton pledgets with the solution and insert them into the nose, stacked vertically (or spray in a topical vasoconstrictor such as oxymetazoline and place pledgets containing only topical anesthetic).\n【34】 Leave the topical drugs in place for 10 to 15 minutes to stop or reduce the bleeding, provide anesthesia, and reduce mucosal swelling.\n【35】 To insert a compressed (expandable) nasal tampon: Coat the tampon with a topical antibiotic ointment, such as bacitracin or mupirocin.\n【36】 Trim the length and width of the tampon to fit the nose.\n【37】 A typical 8-cm commercial nasal tampon can fit into an adult nasal cavity without modification.\n【38】 Insert the tampon perpendicular to the face and advance it parallel to the floor of the nasal cavity in a single, smooth movement to limit discomfort.\n【39】 After the tampon has been properly inserted, expand the tampon by injecting 5 to 10 mL of saline or local anesthetic onto the tampon using an 18- to 22-gauge angiocatheter.\n【40】 Tie the drawstring (if present) around a piece of gauze to prevent displacement posteriorly, or tape the string to the cheek.\n【41】 If necessary, insert a second tampon to fill the nasal cavity.\n【42】 Be sure that the tips of both tampons are at the level of the nares or protrude slightly.\n【43】 Observe the patient for 10 minutes after tampon insertion to ascertain control of bleeding.\n【44】 To insert an inflatable tampon: Soak the device in sterile water for up to 30 seconds (do not soak in saline).\n【45】 Insert the device perpendicular to the face and advance it parallel to the floor of the nasal cavity until the plastic ring is within the nasal cavity.\n【46】 Inflate the device with air using a 20-mL syringe until the pilot cuff becomes rounded and firm.\n【47】 Do not inflate with water or saline and do not apply lubricants or antibiotic ointments to the device.\n【48】 Secure the inflation port to the patient's face using tape or a transparent dressing.\n【49】 To insert petrolatum gauze packing: For patients who appear unlikely to tolerate the procedure, consider giving a low dose of IV analgesic (eg, 0.\n【50】 5 to 1.\n【51】 0 mcg/kg fentanyl to a maximum dose of 100 mcg and potentially lower in those older than 65 years of age).\n【52】 Grasp the petrolatum gauze with bayonet forceps about 10 cm from the end (this determines how deeply the gauze will be placed).\n【53】 Advance the strip of petrolatum gauze posteriorly into the nasal cavity parallel to the nasal floor until the end of the gauze strip is just outside the opening of the naris.\n【54】 Grasp another 8 to 10 cm of strip gauze and place this on top of the prior layer in an accordion fashion, being sure that it is inserted parallel to the nasal floor and extends the full length of the nasal cavity.\n【55】 Be sure to grasp a long enough piece each time to allow insertion to the back of the nose in a single motion.\n【56】 Place each layer slightly anterior to the previous layer to prevent the packing from slipping posteriorly.\n【57】 Press down on the packing with the bayonet forceps to pack it tighter after placement of every several layers.\n【58】 Continue to add layers of strip gauze until the nasal cavity is packed.\n【59】 The full length of strip gauze—typically, 72 inches (180 cm)—may be required.\n【60】 How To Treat Nosebleeds (Epistaxis) VIDEO Aftercare Advise patient not to take aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 4 days after treatment of epistaxis.\n【61】 Anterior packs are usually left in place for 3 to 5 days.\n【62】 Nasal tampons should be moistened 3 times a day with water or saline.\n【63】 Consider treating with a course of antibiotics because of the small risk of sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses due to viral, bacterial, or fungal infections or allergic reactions.\n【64】 and rare toxic shock syndrome Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) Toxic shock syndrome is caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal exotoxins.\n【65】 Warnings and Common Errors Do not open the nasal speculum laterally or use in an unsupported manner.\n【66】 (Brace a finger of the hand holding the speculum on the patient's cheek or nose.\n【67】 ) Insert the tampon straight back, parallel to the floor of the nasal cavity, not angled upward parallel to the contour of the nose.\n【68】 Avoid bunching gauze in the anterior nasal passage; if nearly the full 180 cm (72 inches) of prepackaged gauze could not be inserted, it was probably not inserted deeply enough.\n【69】 When using inflatable tamponade devices, avoid excessive inflation (particularly of bilateral devices) because this can cause pressure necrosis of the septum.\n【70】 When removing an inflatable tamponade device, be sure to deflate it completely before removal.\n【71】 Tips and Tricks Elevating the patient's chair to eye height is easier on the practitioner's back than bending down.\n【72】 If necessary, packing the contralateral nasal cavity can improve tamponade and prevent septal deviation.\n【73】 Compressed nasal tampons can be wrapped in a layer of oxidized regenerated cellulose material prior to insertion to facilitate hemostasis.\n【74】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9448, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh",

findings are more likely in one condition or another: Pharyngeal abscess: Muffled, “hot potato” voice (speaking as if a hot object is being held in the mouth); visible focal swelling in the posterior pharyngeal area (often with deviation of the uvula) Tonsillopharyngitis: Often accompanied by URI symptoms (eg, runny nose, cough) Although tonsillopharyngitis is easily recognized clinically, its cause is not.\n【56】 Manifestations of viral and GABHS Streptococcal Infections Streptococci are gram-positive aerobic organisms that cause many disorders, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, wound and

of GABHS as a cause include Tonsillar exudate Tender lymphadenopathy Fever (including history) Absence of cough Adults with ≤ 1 criterion reasonably may be presumed to have viral illness.\n【59】 If ≥ 2 criteria are present, the likelihood of GABHS is high enough to warrant testing but probably not high enough to warrant antibiotics, but this decision needs to be patient-specific (ie, threshold for testing and treatment may be lower in those at risk because of diabetes or immunocompromise).\n【60】 In children, testing usually is done.\n【61】 Although this approach is reasonable, not all experts agree on when to test for GABHS and when antibiotic treatment is indicated.\n【62】 Regarding rarer causes of tonsillopharyngitis, infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.\n【63】 should be considered when there is posterior cervical or generalized adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and fatigue and malaise for > 1 week.\n【64】 Patients with no URI symptoms but recent oral-genital contact may have pharyngeal gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n【65】 (rare in the US).\n【66】 infection should be considered in patients with risk factors.\n【67】 Testing If supraglottitis/epiglottitis is considered possible after evaluation, testing is required.\n【68】 Patients who do not appear seriously ill and have no respiratory symptoms may have plain lateral neck x-rays to look for an edematous epiglottis.\n【69】 However, a child who appears seriously ill or has stridor or any other respiratory symptoms should not be transported to the x-ray suite.\n【70】 Such patients (and those with positive or equivocal x-ray findings) usually should have flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy.\n【71】 (CAUTION: Examination of the pharynx and larynx may precipitate complete respiratory obstruction in children, and the pharynx and larynx should not be directly examined except in the operating room, where the most advanced airway intervention is available.\n【72】 ) Pearls & Pitfalls If epiglottitis is considered, directly examine a child's pharynx only in the operating room to minimize the risk of complete airway obstruction.\n【73】 Many abscesses are managed clinically, but if location and extent are unclear, immediate CT of the neck should be done.\n【74】 In tonsillopharyngitis, throat culture is the only reliable way to differentiate viral infection from GABHS.\n【75】 To balance timeliness of diagnosis, cost, and accuracy, one strategy in children is to do a rapid strep screen in the office, treat if positive, and send a formal culture if negative.\n【76】 In adults, because other bacterial pathogens may be involved, throat culture for all bacterial pathogens is appropriate for those meeting clinical criteria described previously.\n【77】 Testing for mononucleosis, gonorrhea, or HIV is done only when clinically suspected.\n【78】 Treatment of Sore Throat Specific conditions are treated.\n【79】 Patients with severe symptoms of tonsillopharyngitis may be started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate) pending culture results.\n【80】 Symptomatic treatments such as warm saltwater gargles and topical anesthetics (eg, benzocaine, lidocaine, dyclonine) may help temporarily relieve pain in tonsillopharyngitis.\n【81】 Patients in severe pain (even from tonsillopharyngitis) may require short-term use of opioids.\n【82】 Corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone, 10 mg IM) are occasionally used, for example, for tonsillopharyngitis that appears to pose a risk of airway obstruction (eg, due to mononucleosis) or very severe tonsillopharyngitis symptoms.\n【83】 Key Points Most sore throats are caused by viral tonsillopharyngitis.\n【84】 It is difficult to clinically distinguish viral from bacterial causes of tonsillopharyngitis.\n【85】 Abscess and epiglottitis are rare but serious causes.\n【86】 Severe sore throat in a patient with a normal-appearing pharynx should raise suspicion of epiglottitis.\n【87】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9028, "dataset":

women of childbearing age Selected imaging tests based on suspected diagnosis Standard tests (eg, complete blood count, chemistries, urinalysis) are often done but are of little value due to poor specificity; patients with significant disease may have normal results.\n【72】 Abnormal results do not provide a specific diagnosis (the urinalysis in particular may show pyuria or hematuria in a wide variety of conditions), and they can also occur in the absence of significant disease.\n【73】 An exception is serum lipase, which strongly suggests a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.\n【74】 A bedside urine pregnancy test should be done for all women of childbearing age because a negative result effectively excludes ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n【75】 An abdominal series, consisting of flat and upright abdominal x-rays and upright chest x-rays (left lateral recumbent abdomen and anteroposterior chest x-ray for patients unable to stand), should be done when perforation or obstruction is suspected.\n【76】 However, these plain x-rays are seldom diagnostic for other conditions and do not need to be otherwise automatically done.\n【77】 Ultrasound should be done for suspected biliary tract disease or ectopic pregnancy (transvaginal probe) and for suspected appendicitis in children.\n【78】 Ultrasound can also detect abdominal aortic aneurysm but cannot reliably identify rupture.\n【79】 Noncontrast helical CT is the modality of choice for suspected renal stones.\n【80】 CT with oral and IV contrast is diagnostic in about 95% of patients with significant abdominal pain and has markedly lowered the negative laparotomy rate.\n【81】 However, advanced imaging must not be allowed to delay surgery in patients with definitive symptoms and signs.\n【82】 Treatment of Acute Abdominal Pain Some clinicians feel that providing pain relief before a diagnosis is made interferes with their ability to evaluate.\n【83】 However, moderate doses of IV analgesics (eg, fentanyl 50 to 100 mcg, morphine 4 to 6 mg) do not mask peritoneal signs and, by diminishing anxiety and discomfort, often make examination easier.\n【84】 Key Points Look for life-threatening causes first.\n【85】 Rule out pregnancy in women of childbearing age.\n【86】 Seek signs of peritonitis, shock, and obstruction.\n【87】 Blood tests are of minimal value.\n【88】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 8159, "dataset":

Magnetic imaging and usually a spinal tap Generally, the diagnosis of dementia in people with HIV infection is similar to that of other dementias.\n【38】 Doctors must determine whether a person has dementia and, if so, whether the dementia is HIV-associated dementia.\n【39】 Diagnosis of dementia Doctors base a diagnosis of dementia on the following: Symptoms, which are identified by asking the person and family members or other caregivers questions Results of a physical examination, including a neurologic examination Neurologic Examination When a neurologic disorder is suspected, doctors usually evaluate all of the body systems during the physical examination, but they focus on the nervous system.\n【40】 Results of a mental status test Mental Status When a neurologic disorder is

parasite Toxoplasma gondii.\n【50】 or lymphoma Overview of Lymphoma Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, which reside in the lymphatic system and in blood-forming organs.\n【51】 Lymphomas are cancers of a specific type of white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\n【52】 When mental function changes suddenly, the cause must be identified quickly because early treatment can prolong life.\n【53】 Untreated, HIV-associated dementia may cause death within 6 months.\n【54】 Unless results of CT or MRI suggest that pressure within the skull is increased, doctors usually do a spinal tap Spinal Tap Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【55】 Findings can support but not confirm the diagnosis of HIV-associated dementia.\n【56】 If people have HIV infection or if HIV-associated dementia is suspected, doctors also do blood tests to measure the following: The number of white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes (the CD4 count CD4 count Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.\n【57】 The amount of HIV (viral load Viral load Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a viral infection that progressively destroys certain white blood cells and is treated with antiretroviral medications.\n【58】 These tests help determine how severe the HIV infection is.\n【59】 Having with a very low CD4 count and a very high viral load increases the risk of developing brain infections, lymphoma, and HIV-associated dementia.\n【60】 Treatment of HIV-Associated Dementia Antiretroviral therapy Without treatment, HIV-associated dementia can be fatal.\n【61】 (ART), mental function sometimes dramatically improves.\n【62】 ART consists of combinations of the medications used to treat HIV infection.\n【63】 However, because the infection is not cured, dementia may recur.\n【64】 Treatment also includes general measures to provide support, as for other dementias.\n【65】 Safety and supportive measures Creating a safe and supportive environment Creating a Beneficial Environment for People With Dementia can be very helpful.\n【66】 Generally, the environment should be bright, cheerful, safe, stable, and designed to help with orientation.\n【67】 Some stimulation, such as a radio or television, is helpful, but excessive stimulation should be avoided.\n【68】 Structure and routine help people with HIV-associated dementia stay oriented and give them a sense of security and stability.\n【69】 Any change in surroundings, routines, or caregivers should be explained to people clearly and simply.\n【70】 Following a daily routine for tasks such as bathing, eating, and sleeping helps people with HIV-associated dementia remember.\n【71】 Following a regular routine at bedtime may help them sleep better.\n【72】 Activities scheduled on a regular basis can help people feel independent and needed by focusing their attention on pleasurable or useful tasks.\n【73】 Such activities should include physical and mental activities.\n【74】 Activities should be broken down in small parts or simplified as the dementia worsens.\n【75】 Care for caregivers Caring for people with dementia is stressful and demanding, and caregivers may become depressed and exhausted, often neglecting their own mental and physical health.\n【76】 Counseling and support groups can also help.\n【77】 Caring for self: Caregivers need to remember to take care of themselves.\n【78】 They should not given up their friends, hobbies, and activities.\n【79】 End-of-life issues Before people with HIV-associated dementia become too incapacitated, decisions should be made about medical care, and financial and legal arrangements should be made.\n【80】 These arrangements are called advance directives Advance Directives Health care advance directives are legal documents that communicate a person’s wishes about health care decisions in the event the person becomes incapable of making health care decisions.\n【81】 People should appoint a person who is legally authorized to make treatment decisions on their behalf (a health care proxy).\n【82】 with this person and their doctor.\n【83】 Such issues are best discussed with all concerned long before decisions are necessary.\n【84】 As HIV-associated dementia worsens, treatment tends to be directed at maintaining the person’s comfort rather than at attempting to prolong life.\n【85】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4493, "dataset":

phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid (one that cannot be made in the body but must be consumed in food).\n【16】 Excess phenylalanine is normally converted to tyrosine, another amino acid, and eliminated from the body.\n【17】 There are different types of inherited disorders Inheritance of Single-Gene Disorders Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body.\n【18】 In PKU, both parents of the affected child carry a copy of the abnormal gene.\n【19】 Because usually two copies of the abnormal gene are necessary for the disorder to occur, usually neither parent has the disorder.\n【20】 Symptoms of PKU Newborns with PKU rarely have symptoms right away, although sometimes they are sleepy or eat poorly.\n【21】 Symptoms develop slowly over several months as phenylalanine builds up in the blood.\n【22】 If not treated, affected infants progressively develop intellectual disability

members Aggressive or self-injurious behavior Hyperactivity Sometimes psychiatric symptoms Untreated children with phenylketonuria often give off a mousy or musty body odor in their urine and sweat.\n【24】 This odor is the result of phenylacetic acid, which is a by-product of phenylalanine.\n【25】 Diagnosis of PKU Newborn screening test Prenatal screening tests Phenylketonuria is usually diagnosed with a routine newborn screening test Newborn Screening Tests Many serious disorders that are not apparent at birth can nonetheless be detected by various screening tests.\n【26】 PKU occurs

determine whether a couple is at increased risk of having a baby with a hereditary genetic disorder.\n【32】 are people who have an abnormal gene for a disorder but who do not have symptoms or visible evidence of the disorder.\n【33】 Prognosis for PKU Children who are treated in the first few days of life do not develop the severe symptoms of phenylketonuria.\n【34】 A phenylalanine-restricted diet, if started early and maintained well, allows for mostly normal development.\n【35】 However, even with very good control of the diet, affected children still may develop mild mental health problems and may have difficulties in school.\n【36】 Dietary restrictions started after 2 to 3 years of age may control extreme hyperactivity and seizures and raise the child’s eventual intelligence quotient (IQ) but do not reverse intellectual disability.\n【37】 Recent evidence suggests that some intellectually disabled adults with PKU (born before newborn screening tests were available) may function better when they follow the PKU diet.\n【38】 A phenylalanine-restricted diet should continue for life, or intelligence may decrease and neurologic and mental problems may ensue.\n【39】 Children who are born to mothers who have poorly controlled PKU (that is, they have high phenylalanine levels) during pregnancy are at high risk of developing an abnormally small head (microcephaly is an abnormally small head.\n【40】 Often the head is small because the brain is small and abnormally developed.\n【41】 and developmental problems.\n【42】 This condition is called maternal PKU.\n【43】 Prevention and Treatment of PKU Phenylalanine-restricted diet To prevent intellectual disability, people must restrict phenylalanine intake (but not eliminate it altogether because people need some phenylalanine to live) beginning in the first few weeks of life.\n【44】 Because all natural sources of protein contain too much phenylalanine for children with PKU, affected children cannot have meat, milk, or other common foods that contain protein.\n【45】 Instead, they must eat a variety of products that are specially manufactured to be phenylalanine-free.\n【46】 Low-protein natural foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and restricted amounts of certain grain cereals, can be eaten.\n【47】 Special nutritional products, including infant formula without phenylalanine, are also available.\n【48】 Examples of these special products include PKU Anamix®, XPhe Maxamaid®, and XPhe Maxamum®; Phenex®-1 and Phenex®-2; Phenyl-Free® 1 and Phenyl-Free® 2; pku 1, pku 2, and pku 3; PhenylAde® (varieties); PKU Lophlex® LQ; and Phlexy-10®.\n【49】 Women who have PKU and who are planning on becoming pregnant should follow the recommended diet and keep their PKU under control.\n【50】 Doctors may give supplements of the amino acid tyrosine and a drug called sapropterin.\n【51】 This drug helps increase a person's tolerance of phenylalanine.\n【52】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 5443, "dataset":

pneumonia.\n【31】 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affects mostly people over the age of 50, usually former smokers.\n【32】 and the chest wall is abnormally stiff in disorders such as curvature of the spine (scoliosis is abnormal curvature of the spine.\n【33】 Scoliosis can be present at birth or can develop during adolescence.\n【34】 Various neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that impairs communication between nerves and muscles, resulting in episodes of muscle weakness.\n【35】 and Guillain-Barré syndrome Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) Guillain-Barré syndrome is a form of polyneuropathy causing muscle weakness, which usually worsens over a few days to weeks, then slowly improves or returns to normal on its own.\n【36】 can cause weakness of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, decreasing the volume of air in the lungs.\n【37】 Increased stiffness of the lungs causes lower lung volume measurements.\n【38】 In disorders such as COPD, decreased elasticity of the lungs makes it difficult to breathe out.\n【39】 More air is trapped in the lungs, causing higher than expected lung volume measurements.\n【40】 Lung volume measurements made using spirometry are only estimates.\n【41】 More accurate measurements can be made using Body plethysmography Gas dilution In body plethysmography, a person sits inside an airtight plastic box.\n【42】 Because the box is airtight, the volume of air the person breathes in and the change in air pressure during breathing can be measured.\n【43】 A computer calculates lung volumes based on these measurements.\n【44】 Using gas dilution, a person breathes in a known amount of a gas, usually helium.\n【45】 A computer calculates lung volume based on how much gas the person exhales.\n【46】 Flow rate testing Most spirometers can continuously display lung volumes and flow rates during a forced breathing maneuver.\n【47】 These flow rates can be particularly helpful in detecting abnormalities that partially block the voice box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea).\n【48】 Muscle strength assessment The strength of the respiratory muscles can be measured by having the person forcibly inhale and exhale against a pressure gauge.\n【49】 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Other Motor Neuron Diseases (MNDs) Motor neuron diseases are characterized by progressive deterioration of the nerve cells that initiate muscle movement.\n【50】 (ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease), weaken respiratory muscles and make breathing more difficult.\n【51】 Muscle strength can also be assessed by having the person do spirometry while sitting up and while lying down.\n【52】 Diffusing capacity measurement A diffusing capacity test can estimate how efficiently oxygen is transferred from the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) to the bloodstream.\n【53】 Because the diffusing capacity of oxygen is difficult to measure directly, a person inhales a small amount of carbon monoxide, holds the breath for 10 seconds, and then exhales into a carbon monoxide detector.\n【54】 If the test shows that carbon monoxide is not well absorbed, oxygen will not be exchanged normally between the lungs and the bloodstream either.\n【55】 The diffusing capacity is characteristically abnormal in people with pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.\n【56】 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affects mostly people over the age of 50, usually former smokers.\n【57】 in those with disorders affecting the blood vessels of the lungs, and in some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is persistent narrowing (blocking, or obstruction) of the airways occurring with emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, or both disorders.\n【58】 Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) MVV measures a person's maximum overall ability to breathe.\n【59】 This test is done in the sitting position.\n【60】 A person is instructed to breathe as rapidly and deeply as possible through a spirometer for a predetermined period of time, usually 15 to 30 seconds.\n【61】 The volume of air moved over that period of time is measured.\n【62】 MVV will be decreased in diseases that affect airflow or weaken respiratory muscles.\n【63】 Because this test is dependent upon the ability of a person to cooperate, it is not used as often as other lung function tests.\n【64】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id":

perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment.\n【1】 Personality disorders vary significantly in their manifestations, but all are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n【2】 Many gradually become less severe with age, but certain traits may persist to some degree after the acute symptoms that prompted the diagnosis of a disorder abate.\n【3】 Diagnosis is clinical.\n【4】 Treatment is with psychosocial therapies and sometimes drug therapy.\n【5】 Personality traits represent patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that are relatively stable over time.\n【6】 Personality disorders exist when these traits become so pronounced, rigid, and maladaptive that they impair work and/or interpersonal functioning.\n【7】 These social maladaptations can cause significant distress in people with personality disorders and in those around them.\n【8】 For people with personality disorders (unlike many others who seek counseling), the distress caused by the consequences of their socially maladaptive behaviors is usually the reason they seek treatment, rather than any discomfort with their own thoughts and feelings.\n【9】 Thus, clinicians must initially help patients see that their personality traits are the root of the problem.\n【10】 Personality disorders usually start to become evident during late adolescence or early adulthood, although sometimes signs are apparent earlier (during childhood).\n【11】 Traits and symptoms vary considerably in how long they persist; many resolve with time.\n【12】 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) lists 10 types of personality disorders Types of Personality Disorders Personality disorders in general are pervasive, enduring patterns of thinking, perceiving, reacting, and relating that cause significant distress or functional impairment.\n【13】 although most patients who meet criteria for one type also meet criteria for one or more others.\n【14】 Some types (eg, antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for consequences and for the rights of others.\n【15】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【16】 ) are less likely to do so.\n【17】 About 10% of the general population and up to half of psychiatric patients in hospital units and clinics have a personality disorder.\n【18】 Overall, there are no clear distinctions in terms of sex, socioeconomic class, and race.\n【19】 However, in antisocial personality disorder, men outnumber women 6:1.\n【20】 In borderline personality disorder, women outnumber men 3:1 (but only in clinical settings, not in the general population).\n【21】 For most personality disorders, levels of heritability are about 50%, which is similar to or higher than that of many other major psychiatric disorders.\n【22】 This degree of heritability argues against the common assumption that personality disorders are character flaws primarily shaped by an adverse environment.\n【23】 The direct health care costs and indirect costs of lost productivity associated with personality disorders, particularly borderline and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, are significantly greater than similar costs associated with major depressive disorder Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and often by decreased interest or pleasure in activities.\n【24】 or generalized anxiety disorder Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about a number of activities or events that is present more days than not for ≥ 6 months.\n【25】 Types of Personality Disorders DSM-5 groups the 10 types of personality disorders into 3 clusters (A, B, and C), based on similar characteristics.\n【26】 However, the clinical usefulness of these clusters has not been established.\n【27】 Cluster A is characterized by appearing odd or eccentric.\n【28】 It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD) Paranoid personality disorders is characterized by a pervasive pattern of unwarranted distrust and suspicion of others that involves interpreting their motives as malicious.\n【29】 : Eccentric ideas and behavior Overview of Cluster A Personality Disorders VIDEO Cluster B is characterized by appearing dramatic, emotional, or erratic.\n【30】 It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for consequences and for the rights of others.\n【31】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【32】 : Inner emptiness, unstable relationships, and emotional dysregulation Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking.\n【33】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【34】 : Attention seeking and excessive emotionality Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for adulation, and lack of empathy.\n【35】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【36】 : Self-grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy Overview of Cluster B Personality Disorders VIDEO Cluster C is characterized by appearing anxious or fearful.\n【37】 It includes the following personality disorders with their distinguishing features: Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation.\n【38】 : Avoidance of interpersonal contact due to rejection sensitivity Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD) Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive, excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissiveness and clinging behaviors.\n【39】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【40】 : Perfectionism, rigidity, and obstinacy Overview of Cluster C Personality Disorders VIDEO Symptoms and Signs of Personality Disorders According to DSM-5, personality disorders are primarily problems with Self-identity Interpersonal functioning Self-identity problems may manifest as an unstable self-image (eg, people fluctuate between seeing themselves as kind or cruel) or as inconsistencies in values, goals, and appearance (eg, people are deeply religious while in church but profane and disrespectful elsewhere).\n【41】 Interpersonal functioning problems typically manifest as failing to develop or sustain close relationships and/or being insensitive to others (eg, unable to empathize).\n【42】 People with personality disorders often seem inconsistent, confusing, and frustrating to people around them (including clinicians).\n【43】 These people may have difficulty knowing the boundaries between themselves and others.\n【44】 Their self-esteem may be inappropriately high or low.\n【45】 They may have inconsistent, detached, overemotional, abusive, or irresponsible styles of parenting, which can lead to physical and mental problems in their spouse and/or children.\n【46】 People with personality disorders may not recognize that they have problems.\n【47】 Diagnosis of Personality Disorders Clinical criteria (DSM-5) Personality disorders are underdiagnosed.\n【48】 When people with personality disorders seek treatment, their chief complaints are often of depression or anxiety rather than of the manifestations of their personality disorder.\n【49】 Once clinicians suspect a personality disorder, they evaluate cognitive, affective, interpersonal, and behavioral tendencies using specific diagnostic criteria.\n【50】 More sophisticated and empirically rigorous diagnostic tools are available for more specialized and academic clinicians.\n【51】 Diagnosis of a personality disorder requires the following: A persistent, inflexible, pervasive pattern of maladaptive traits involving ≥ 2 of the following: cognition (ways or perceiving and interpreting self, others, and events), affectivity, interpersonal functioning, and impulse control Significant distress or impaired functioning resulting from the maladaptive pattern Relative stability and early onset (traced back to at least adolescence or early adulthood) of the pattern Also, other possible causes of the symptoms (eg, other mental health disorders, substance use Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use.\n【52】 head trauma Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently impairs brain function.\n【53】 ) must be excluded.\n【54】 For a personality disorder to be diagnosed in patients < 18 years, the pattern must have been present for ≥ 1 year, except for antisocial personality disorders, which cannot be diagnosed in patients < 18 years.\n【55】 Because many patients with a personality disorder lack insight into their condition, clinicians may need to obtain history from clinicians who have treated these patients previously, other practitioners, family members, friends, or others who have contact with them.\n【56】 Treatment of Personality Disorders Psychotherapy The gold standard of treatment for personality disorders is psychotherapy.\n【57】 Both individual and group psychotherapy are effective for many of these disorders if the patient is seeking treatment and is motivated to change.\n【58】 Typically, personality disorders are not very responsive to drugs, although some drugs can effectively target specific symptoms (eg, depression, anxiety).\n【59】 Disorders that often coexist with personality disorders (eg, depressive disorders Overview of Mood Disorders Mood disorders are emotional disturbances consisting of prolonged periods of excessive sadness, excessive joyousness, or both.\n【60】 substance-related Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders involve a pathologic pattern of behaviors in which patients continue to use a substance despite experiencing significant problems related to its use.\n【61】 ) can make treatment challenging, lengthening time to remission, increasing risk of relapse, and decreasing response to otherwise effective treatment.\n【62】 For treatment recommendations for each disorder, see table Treatment of Personality Disorders Treatment of Personality Disorders .\n【63】 Table General principles of treatment In general, treatment of personality disorders aims to Reduce subjective distress Enable patients to understand that their problems are internal to themselves Decrease significantly maladaptive and socially undesirable behaviors Modify problematic personality traits Reducing subjective distress (eg, anxiety, depression) is the first goal.\n【64】 These symptoms often respond to increased psychosocial support, which often includes moving the patient out of highly stressful situations or relationships.\n【65】 Drug therapy may also help relieve stress.\n【66】 Reduced stress makes treating the underlying personality disorder easier.\n【67】 An effort to enable patients to see that their problems are internal should be made early.\n【68】 Patients need to understand that their problems with work or relationships are caused by their problematic ways of relating to the world (eg, to tasks, to authority, or in intimate relationships).\n【69】 Achieving such understanding requires a substantial amount of time, patience, and commitment on the part of a clinician.\n【70】 Clinicians also need a basic understanding of the patient’s areas of emotional sensitivity and usual ways of coping.\n【71】 Family members and friends can help identify problems of which patients and clinicians would otherwise be unaware.\n【72】 Maladaptive and undesirable behaviors (eg, recklessness, social isolation, lack of assertiveness, temper outbursts) should be dealt with quickly to minimize ongoing damage to jobs and relationships.\n【73】 antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for consequences and for the rights of others.\n【74】 Diagnosis is by clinical criteria.\n【75】 Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD) Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by the avoidance of social situations or interactions that involve risk of rejection, criticism, or humiliation.\n【76】 Behavior can typically be improved within months by group therapy and behavior modification; limits on behavior must often be established and enforced.\n【77】 Sometimes patients are treated in a day hospital or residential setting.\n【78】 Self-help groups or family therapy can also help change socially undesirable behaviors.\n【79】 Because family members and friends can act in ways that either reinforce or diminish the patient’s problematic behavior or thoughts, their involvement is helpful; with coaching, they can be allies in treatment.\n【80】 Modifying problematic personality traits (eg, dependency, distrust, arrogance, manipulativeness) takes a long time—typically > 1 year.\n【81】 The cornerstone for effecting such change is Individual psychotherapy During therapy, clinicians try to identify interpersonal problems as they occur in the patient's life.\n【82】 Clinicians then help patients understand how these problems are related to their personality traits and provide skills training to develop new, better ways of interacting.\n【83】 Typically, clinicians must repeatedly point out the undesirable behaviors and their consequences before patients become aware of them.\n【84】 This strategy can help patients change their maladaptive behaviors and mistaken beliefs.\n【85】 Although clinicians should act with sensitivity, they should be aware that kindness and sensible advice by themselves do not change personality disorders.\n【86】 Key Points Personality disorders involve rigid, maladaptive personality traits that are marked enough to cause significant distress or to impair work and/or interpersonal functioning.\n【87】 Treatments become effective only after patients see that their problems are within themselves, not just externally caused.\n【88】 Psychosocial therapies are the main treatment.\n【89】 Drugs help control specific symptoms only in selected cases—eg, to control significant anxiety, angry outbursts, and depression.\n【90】 Personality disorders are often resistant to change, but many gradually become less severe over time.\n【91】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9070, "dataset":

uterus that does not follow the normal pattern for menstrual cycles.\n【1】 That is, it occurs too frequently or irregularly or lasts longer or is heavier than normal menstrual periods.\n【2】 The most common type of abnormal bleeding results from problems that interfere with the release of the egg (ovulation).\n【3】 To diagnose abnormal uterine bleeding, doctors ask women questions about the pattern of bleeding (menstrual history) and do a pelvic examination, ultrasonography, and blood tests.\n【4】 A biopsy of the lining of the uterus may be done.\n【5】 Treatment depends on the cause and may include hormones or other medications, such as a combination birth control pill, or a procedure, such as hysteroscopy and dilation and curettage (D and C) If the biopsy detects abnormal cells, treatment involves high doses of a progestin and sometimes removal of the uterus.\n【6】 ) Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common problem in women of childbearing age.\n【7】 It occurs most commonly at the beginning and end of the reproductive years: 20% of cases occur in adolescent girls, and more than 50% occur in women older than 45.\n【8】 In women of childbearing age, the most common cause of abnormal bleeding is ovulatory dysfunction.\n【9】 That is, the ovaries do not release an egg (ovulate) or do not regularly release an egg.\n【10】 Thus, pregnancy is less likely.\n【11】 However, because the ovaries may occasionally release an egg, these women should use contraception if they do not wish to become pregnant.\n【12】 Often, what causes the ovaries to malfunction is not known.\n【13】 Abnormal uterine bleeding commonly results when the level of estrogen remains high instead of decreasing as it normally does after an egg is released and is not fertilized.\n【14】 The high estrogen level is not balanced by an appropriate level of progesterone.\n【15】 In women with this type of abnormal bleeding, no egg is released, and the lining of the uterus (endometrium) may continue to thicken (instead of breaking down and being shed normally as a menstrual period).\n【16】 This abnormal thickening is called endometrial hyperplasia.\n【17】 Periodically, the thickened lining is shed incompletely and irregularly, causing bleeding.\n【18】 Bleeding is irregular, prolonged, and sometimes heavy and may last many days.\n【19】 This type of abnormal uterine bleeding is called anovulatory uterine bleeding.\n【20】 In other women, an egg is released but progesterone production lasts longer than usual.\n【21】 As a result, the thickened lining of the uterus is shed irregularly.\n【22】 This type of abnormal uterine bleeding pattern is called ovulatory dysfunction.\n【23】 In women with obesity, this type can occur when estrogen levels are high.\n【24】 As a result, intervals with no periods alternate with intervals of prolonged bleeding.\n【25】 If this cycle of abnormal thickening and irregular shedding continues, precancerous cells may develop, increasing the risk of cancer of the uterine lining Cancer of the Uterus The most common type of cancer of the uterus develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) and is called endometrial cancer.\n【26】 Endometrial cancer usually affects women after menopause.\n【27】 (endometrial cancer), even in young women.\n【28】 Abnormal uterine bleeding is often an early sign of perimenopause Menopause (the several years before and the 1 year after the last menstrual period).\n【29】 Causes of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Doctors classify causes of abnormal bleeding as due to an abnormality in a structure (structural) or due to another problem (nonstructural).\n【30】 Structural causes include Polyps Cervical Polyps Cervical polyps are common fingerlike growths of tissue that protrude into the passageway through the cervix.\n【31】 Polyps are almost always benign (noncancerous).\n【32】 Adenomyosis (when endometrial tissue grows into the wall of the uterus) Fibroids A fibroid is a noncancerous tumor composed of muscle and fibrous tissue.\n【33】 It is located in the uterus.\n【34】 Precancerous conditions (hyperplasia—when the uterine lining is thickened but its cells are normal) Cancer Nonstructural causes include Ovulatory dysfunction Blood clotting disorders Overview of Blood Clotting Disorders Blood clotting (coagulation) disorders are dysfunctions in the body's ability to control the formation of blood clots.\n【35】 Use of contraceptives or certain medications Abnormal uterine bleeding due to ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) is the most common cause of nonstructural abnormal bleeding and the most common cause overall.\n【36】 Causes of ovulatory dysfunction include Polycystic ovary syndrome Pituitary disorders Overview of the Pituitary Gland The pituitary is a pea-sized gland that is housed within a bony structure (sella turcica) at the base of the brain.\n【37】 Thyroid disorders Overview of the Thyroid Gland The thyroid is a small gland, measuring about 2 inches (5 centimeters) across, that lies just under the skin below the Adam’s apple in the neck.\n【38】 Premature menopause Premature Menopause Premature menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods before age 40.\n【39】 (primary ovarian insufficiency) Changes that occur around puberty in Girls Puberty is a sequence of events in which physical changes occur, resulting in adult physical characteristics and capacity to reproduce.\n【40】 or during the years before menopause occurs and the 1 year after (perimenopause) Menopause Bodywide disorders, such as liver disease Overview of Liver Disease Liver disease can manifest in many different ways.\n【41】 or kidney disease Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive (months to years) decline in the kidneys’ ability to filter metabolic waste products from the blood.\n【42】 Extreme physical or emotional stress Poor nutrition Sometimes the cause is unknown.\n【43】 Symptoms of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding In women with abnormal uterine bleeding, bleeding may differ from typical menstrual periods in the following ways: Occurs more frequently (fewer than 24 days apart) Varies in how many days it lasts longer than 8 days Occurs between periods (intermenstrual bleeding) Involves more blood loss (loss of more than about 3 ounces of blood or periods that last 8 days or longer) Does not occur regularly Symptoms depend on the cause of bleeding.\n【44】 Bleeding may be abnormal during regular menstrual cycles, or bleeding may occur at unpredictable times.\n【45】 Some women have symptoms associated with menstrual periods, such as breast tenderness, cramping, and bloating, but many do not.\n【46】 If bleeding continues, women may develop iron deficiency Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia, a condition in which the number of red blood cells is low.\n【47】 and sometimes anemia Iron Deficiency Anemia Iron deficiency anemia results from low or depleted stores of iron, which is needed to produce red blood cells.\n【48】 Excessive bleeding is the most common cause.\n【49】 Whether infertility develops depends on the cause of the bleeding.\n【50】 Diagnosis of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Description of the pattern of bleeding (menstrual history) A pregnancy test A complete blood count Measurement of hormone levels Sometimes procedures such as an endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy Abnormal uterine bleeding is suspected when bleeding occurs at irregular times or in excessive amounts.\n【51】 To establish that bleeding is abnormal, doctors ask questions about the pattern of bleeding (menstrual history What the doctor does ).\n【52】 To determine the cause, doctors ask about other symptoms and possible causes (such as use of medications, the presence of other disorders, fibroids, and complications during pregnancies).\n【53】 A physical examination is also done.\n【54】 Tests to check for possible causes of abnormal uterine bleeding Doctors do a pregnancy test, even in adolescent girls and women who are going through menopause.\n【55】 Other tests to check for possible causes of vaginal bleeding may be done based on the findings during the interview and physical examination.\n【56】 For example, doctors usually do a complete blood count to estimate how much blood has been lost and whether anemia Iron Deficiency Anemia Iron deficiency anemia results from low or depleted stores of iron, which is needed to produce red blood cells.\n【57】 Excessive bleeding is the most common cause.\n【58】 (including iron deficiency anemia Iron Deficiency Anemia Iron deficiency anemia results from low or depleted stores of iron, which is needed to produce red blood cells.\n【59】 Excessive bleeding is the most common cause.\n【60】 is present.\n【61】 They also may do blood tests to determine how fast blood clots (to check for clotting disorders).\n【62】 Doctors typically do blood tests to measure hormone levels (to check for polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disorders, pituitary disorders, or other disorders that are common causes of vaginal bleeding).\n【63】 Hormones that may be measured include female hormones such as estrogen or progesterone (which helps control the menstrual cycle), thyroid hormones, and prolactin.\n【64】 Doctors may do a cervical cancer screening test, such as a Papanicolaou (Pap) test and/or human papillomavirus (HPV) test, if women have not been tested recently.\n【65】 Doctors may also do an imaging test or a procedure.\n【66】 For example, they may do a biopsy if results of blood tests or a Pap test are abnormal or do not identify the cause of the bleeding.\n【67】 Imaging tests and procedures Transvaginal ultrasonography (using a small handheld device inserted through the vagina to view the interior of the uterus) is usually used to check for growths in the uterus and to determine whether the uterine lining is thickened.\n【68】 Thickening of the uterine lining may result from noncancerous conditions such as polyps or fibroids or hormonal changes.\n【69】 (The hormonal changes that cause abnormal uterine bleeding can result in such thickening, which may cause precancerous cells to develop and increase the risk of endometrial cancer.\n【70】 ) Transvaginal ultrasonography is done if women have any of the following (which includes most women with abnormal uterine bleeding): Risk factors for endometrial cancer Causes , such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, polycystic ovary syndrome, and excess body hair (hirsutism), regardless of age 45 or older (younger if they have risk factors) Bleeding that continues despite treatment with hormones Pelvic or reproductive organs that cannot be examined adequately during the physical examination Findings suggesting abnormalities in the ovaries or uterus based on the physical examination Transvaginal ultrasonography can detect most polyps, fibroids, abnormalities in the ovaries, and areas of thickening in the lining of the uterus (which may be precancerous).\n【71】 If transvaginal ultrasonography detects areas of thickening, other tests may be done to check for small polyps or other masses.\n【72】 One or both of the following tests may be done: Sonohysterography (ultrasonography after saline is infused into the uterus) Hysteroscopy (insertion of a viewing tube through the vagina to view the uterus) Both tests may be done in the doctor's office.\n【73】 If the doctor's office cannot provide hysteroscopy, the procedure can be done in a hospital as an outpatient procedure.\n【74】 Medications that are not hormones are often used first, especially in women who want to become pregnant or to avoid the side effects of hormone therapy and in women with heavy regular bleeding.\n【75】 is often tried first in women who do not want to become pregnant or who are approaching or just past menopause (this time period is called perimenopause Menopause ).\n【76】 When the uterine lining is thickened but its cells are normal (endometrial hyperplasia), hormones may be used to control bleeding.\n【77】 Often, a birth control pill that contains estrogen and a progestin (a combination oral contraceptive) is used.\n【78】 Besides controlling bleeding, oral contraceptives decrease the cramping that may accompany bleeding.\n【79】 They also decrease the risk of endometrial (and ovarian) cancer.\n【80】 Bleeding usually stops in 12 to 24 hours.\n【81】 Sometimes high doses are needed to control the bleeding.\n【82】 After bleeding stops, low doses of the oral contraceptive may then be prescribed for at least 3 months to prevent the bleeding from recurring.\n【83】 Some women should not take estrogen, including that in combination oral contraceptives.\n【84】 Such women include Women with significant risk factors for a heart or blood vessel disorder or who have had blood clots Women who have had a baby within the last month A progestin or progesterone (which is similar to the hormone the body makes) may be used alone when Women should not take estrogen Hormone Therapy for menopause is the permanent end of menstrual periods and thus of fertility.\n【85】 (that is, when estrogen is contraindicated).\n【86】 Treatment with estrogen is ineffective or not tolerated.\n【87】 Women do not wish to take estrogen.\n【88】 Progestins and progesterone can be given by mouth for 21 days a month.\n【89】 When these hormones are taken this way, they may not prevent pregnancy.\n【90】 Thus, if women do not wish to become pregnant, they must use another method of birth control, such as an intrauterine device (IUD) Intrauterine Devices (IUDs) Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are small, flexible, T-shaped plastic devices that are inserted into the uterus.\n【91】 given by injection every few months.\n【92】 Other medications that are occasionally used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding include danazol Drugs used to treat endometriosis (a synthetic male hormone, or androgen) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists Drugs used to treat endometriosis (synthetic forms of a hormone produced by the body, sometimes used to treat bleeding caused by fibroids).\n【93】 However, these medications have significant side effects that limit their use to a few months.\n【94】 Danazol is not frequently used because it has many side effects.\n【95】 If women are trying to become pregnant and bleeding is not too heavy, they may be given clomiphene (a fertility drug) by mouth instead of hormones.\n【96】 It stimulates ovulation.\n【97】 If women have iron deficiency anemia or symptoms of iron deficiency without anemia, iron supplements are usually given by mouth but sometimes must be given by vein (intravenously).\n【98】 Normal consumption of iron in the diet usually cannot compensate for iron loss due to chronic bleeding, and the body has a very small iron reserve.\n【99】 Consequently, lost iron must be replaced by taking iron supplements.\n【100】 Procedures If the uterine lining (endometrium) remains thickened or the bleeding persists despite treatment with hormones, hysteroscopy is usually done in an operating room to look into the uterus.\n【101】 It is followed by dilation and curettage (D and C).\n【102】 For a D and C, tissue from the uterine lining is removed by scraping.\n【103】 This procedure may reduce bleeding.\n【104】 However, in some women, it causes scarring of the endometrium (Asherman syndrome), Scarring can cause menstrual bleeding to stop (amenorrhea) and make biopsy of the endometrium difficult later.\n【105】 Endometrial ablation does not prevent pregnancy.\n【106】 If bleeding continues after a D and C, a procedure that destroys or removes the lining of the uterus (endometrial ablation) can often help control bleeding.\n【107】 This procedure may use burning, freezing, or other techniques.\n【108】 It may help 60 to 80% of women.\n【109】 If fibroids are the cause, blood flow to the fibroids may be blocked with small, synthetic particles injected through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into these arteries (called artery embolization).\n【110】 Alternatively, fibroids may be removed through a catheter inserted into a small incision just below the navel (laparoscopy), through a catheter inserted into the vagina (hysteroscopy), or through a larger incision into the abdomen.\n【111】 If bleeding continues to be substantial after other treatments have been tried, doctors may recommend removal of the uterus (hysterectomy).\n【112】 Treatment for precancerous cells of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia) If the uterine lining contains abnormal cells and menopause has not occurred, women may be treated with one of the following: A high dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate (a progestin) Norethindrone Micronized progesterone (a natural rather than synthetic progesterone) An intrauterine device (IUD) that releases levonorgestrel (a progestin) A biopsy is done after 3 to 6 months of treatment.\n【113】 If the cells appear normal, women may be given medroxyprogesterone acetate for 14 days each month.\n【114】 If they want to become pregnant, they may be given clomiphene instead.\n【115】 If the biopsy detects abnormal cells, a hysterectomy may be done because the abnormal cells may become cancerous.\n【116】 If women are postmenopausal, hysterectomy is usually done.\n【117】 If women have a condition that makes surgery risky, a progestin is used.\n【118】 Emergency treatment Rarely, very heavy bleeding requires emergency measures.\n【119】 They may include fluids given intravenously and blood transfusions.\n【120】 Occasionally, doctors insert a catheter with a deflated balloon at its tip through the vagina and into the uterus.\n【121】 The balloon is inflated to put pressure on the bleeding vessels and thus stop the bleeding.\n【122】 Very rarely, estrogen is given intravenously.\n【123】 Treatment is limited to 4 doses because this treatment increases the risk of blood clots.\n【124】 Immediately afterward, women are given combination oral contraceptives until bleeding has been controlled for a few months.\n【125】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4089, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info":

may be classified in many different ways: By cause: Whether it occurs normally, is caused by a disorder or drug, or has no identifiable cause By severity: How much of the brain is damaged or how severe the symptoms are By location: Where the brain is damaged By triggers: Whether it is triggered by a stimulus (such as bright light or a sudden noise) or occurs on its own (spontaneously) Classifying the type of myoclonus may help doctors identify the cause and choose appropriate treatments.\n【15】 Causes of Myoclonus may occur normally, often when a person is falling asleep.\n【16】 For example, as people start to doze off, they may jerk suddenly and awaken (as if startled), or muscles in part of the body may twitch.\n【17】 However, in some cases myoclonus may result from a disorder,

these tubes are preferable to smaller ones because they Have lower airflow resistance (reducing the work of breathing) Facilitate suctioning of secretions Allow passage of a bronchoscope May aid in liberation from mechanical ventilation For infants and children ≥ 1 year, uncuffed tube size is calculated by (patient’s age + 16)/4; thus, a 4-year-old should have a (4 + 16)/4 = 5 mm endotracheal tube.\n【16】 The tube size suggested by this formula should be reduced by 0.\n【17】 5 (1 tube size) if a cuffed tube is to be used.\n【18】 Alternative Intubation Devices A number of devices and techniques are increasingly used for intubation after failed laryngoscopy or as a primary means of intubation.\n【19】 Devices include Video laryngoscopes How To Do Orotracheal Intubation Using Video Laryngoscopy Endotracheal (ET) tubes are flexible tubes with a standard flange for attaching an oxygen source at the proximal end and a beveled tip and inflatable balloon cuff at the distal end.\n【20】 (LMAs) with a passage that allows tracheal intubation Other supraglottic airways Fiberoptic scopes and optical stylets Tube introducers Each device has its own subtleties; practitioners who are skilled in standard laryngoscopic intubation techniques should not assume they can use one of these devices (especially after use of muscle relaxants) without becoming thoroughly familiarized with it.\n【21】 Video and mirror laryngoscopes enable practitioners to look around the curvature of the tongue and usually provide excellent laryngeal views.\n【22】 However, the tube requires an exaggerated bend angle to go around the tongue and thus may be more difficult to manipulate and insert.\n【23】 Some laryngeal mask airways have a passage to allow endotracheal intubation.\n【24】 practitioners must understand how to optimally position the mask over the laryngeal inlet; there are sometimes mechanical difficulties passing the endotracheal tube.\n【25】 Flexible fiberoptic scopes and optical stylets are very maneuverable and can be used in patients with abnormal anatomy.\n【26】 However, practice is required to recognize laryngeal landmarks from a fiberoptic perspective.\n【27】 Compared with video and mirror laryngoscopes, fiberoptic scopes are more difficult to master and are more susceptible to problems with blood and secretions; also, they do not separate and divide tissue but instead must be moved through open channels.\n【28】 Tube introducers (commonly called gum elastic bougies) are semirigid stylets that can be used when laryngeal visualization is suboptimal (eg, the epiglottis is visible, but the laryngeal opening is not).\n【29】 In such cases, the introducer is passed along the undersurface of the epiglottis; from this point, it is likely to enter the trachea.\n【30】 Tracheal entry is suggested by the tactile feedback, noted as the tip bounces over the tracheal rings.\n【31】 An endotracheal tube is then advanced over the introducer.\n【32】 During passage over a tube introducer or bronchoscope, the tube tip sometimes catches the right aryepiglottic fold.\n【33】 Rotating the tube 90° counterclockwise often frees the endotracheal tube tip and allows it to pass smoothly.\n【34】 Confirming Tube Placement The stylet is removed and the balloon cuff is inflated with air using a 10-mL syringe; a manometer is used to verify that balloon pressure is < 30 cm water.\n【35】 The size of the endotracheal tube and cuff size affect the volume of air necessary for the correct pressure.\n【36】 After balloon inflation, tube placement should be checked using a variety of methods, including Inspection and auscultation Carbon dioxide detection Esophageal detector devices Sometimes chest x-ray When a tube is correctly placed, manual ventilation should produce symmetric chest rise, good breath sounds over both lungs, and no gurgling over the upper abdomen.\n【37】 Exhaled air should contain carbon dioxide and gastric air should not; detecting carbon dioxide with a colorimetric end-tidal carbon dioxide device or waveform capnography confirms tracheal placement.\n【38】 However, in prolonged cardiac arrest Cardiac Arrest Cardiac arrest is the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity resulting in the absence of circulating blood flow.\n【39】 (ie, with little or no metabolic activity), carbon dioxide may not be detectable even with correct tube placement.\n【40】 In such cases, an esophageal detector device may be used.\n【41】 These devices use an inflatable bulb or a large syringe to apply negative pressure to the endotracheal tube.\n【42】 The flexible esophagus collapses, and little or no air flows into the device; in contrast, the rigid trachea does not collapse, and the resultant airflow confirms tracheal placement.\n【43】 In the absence of cardiac arrest, tube placement is typically also confirmed with a chest x-ray.\n【44】 After correct placement is confirmed, the tube should be secured using a commercially available device or adhesive tape.\n【45】 Endotracheal tubes can be displaced, particularly in chaotic resuscitation situations, so tube position should be rechecked frequently.\n【46】 but both should be considered.\n【47】 Nasotracheal Intubation If patients are spontaneously breathing, nasotracheal intubation can be used in certain emergency situations—eg, when patients have severe oral or cervical disorders (eg, injuries, edema, limitation of motion) that make laryngoscopy difficult.\n【48】 Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midface fractures or known or suspected basal skull fractures.\n【49】 Historically, nasal intubation was also used when muscle relaxants were unavailable or forbidden (eg, prehospital settings, certain emergency departments) and when patients with tachypnea, hyperpnea, and upright positioning (eg, those with heart failure Heart Failure (HF) Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction.\n【50】 ) might literally inhale a tube.\n【51】 [BiPAP]), improved access to and training in pharmacologic adjuncts to intubation, and newer airway devices have markedly decreased the use of nasal intubation.\n【52】 Additional considerations are problems with nasal intubation, including sinusitis (universal after 3 days), and the fact that tubes large enough to permit bronchoscopy (eg, ≥ 8 mm) can rarely be inserted nasotracheally.\n【53】 When nasotracheal intubation is done, a vasoconstrictor (eg, phenylephrine) and topical anesthetic (eg, benzocaine, lidocaine) must be applied to the nasal mucosa and the larynx to prevent bleeding and to blunt protective reflexes.\n【54】 Some patients may also require IV sedatives, opioids, or dissociative drugs.\n【55】 After the nasal mucosa is prepared, a soft nasopharyngeal airway should be inserted to ensure adequate patency of the selected nasal passage and to serve as a conduit for topical drugs to the pharynx and larynx.\n【56】 The nasopharyngeal airway may be placed using a plain or anesthetic (eg, lidocaine) lubricant.\n【57】 The nasopharyngeal airway is removed after the pharyngeal mucosa has been sprayed.\n【58】 The nasotracheal tube is then inserted to about 14 cm depth (just above the laryngeal inlet in most adults);

Fibromuscular Dysplasia Fibromuscular dysplasia includes a heterogenous group of nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial changes, causing some degree of vascular stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.\n【12】 Atherosclerosis is more common among men > 50 and affects mainly the proximal one third of the renal artery.\n【13】 Fibromuscular dysplasia is more common among younger patients (usually women) and usually affects the distal two thirds of the main renal artery and the branches of the renal arteries.\n【14】 Rarer causes include emboli, trauma, inadvertent ligation during

decreasing perfusion on the scintiscan.\n【29】 Narrowing also causes an increase in serum renin, which is measured before and after captopril administration.\n【30】 This test may be less reliable in patients with African ancestry and in those with decreased renal function.\n【31】 Renal angiography is done if MRA indicates a lesion amenable to angioplasty or stenting or if other screening tests are positive.\n【32】 Digital subtraction angiography with selective injection of the renal arteries can also confirm the diagnosis, but angioplasty or stent placement cannot be done in the same procedure.\n【33】 Measurements of renal vein renin activity are sometimes misleading and, unless surgery is being considered, are not necessary.\n【34】 However, in unilateral disease, a renal vein renin

100% oxygen by nonrebreather mask; upright position; furosemide 0.\n【36】 5 to 1.\n【37】 0 mg/kg IV or by continuous infusion 5 to 10 mg/hour; nitroglycerin 0.\n【38】 4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes, followed by an IV drip at 10 to 20 mcg/minute, titrated upward at 10 mcg/minute every 5 minutes as needed to a maximum 300 mcg/minute if systolic blood pressure is > 100 mm Hg.\n【39】 Morphine, 1 to 5 mg IV once or twice, has long been used to reduce severe anxiety and the work of breathing but is decreasingly used (except in palliative care) due to observational studies suggesting a poorer outcome with its use.\n【40】 Noninvasive ventilatory assistance with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is helpful if hypoxia is significant.\n【41】 are required.\n【42】 Specific additional treatment depends on etiology: For acute myocardial infarction or another acute coronary syndrome, thrombolysis or direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement For severe hypertension, an IV vasodilator For supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, direct-current cardioversion For rapid atrial fibrillation, cardioversion is preferred.\n【43】 To slow the ventricular rate, an IV beta-blocker, IV digoxin, or cautious use of an IV calcium channel blocker In patients with acute MI (myocardial infarction), fluid status before onset of pulmonary edema is usually normal, so diuretics are less useful than in patients with acute decompensation of chronic heart failure and may precipitate hypotension.\n【44】 If systolic blood pressure falls < 100 mm Hg or shock develops, IV dobutamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump (counterpulsation) may be required.\n【45】 Some newer drugs, such as IV brain natriuretic peptide (nesiritide), and calcium-sensitizing inotropic drugs (levosimendan, pimobendan), vesnarinone, and ibopamine, may have initial beneficial effects but do not appear to improve outcomes compared to standard therapy, and mortality may be increased.\n【46】 Key Points Acute pulmonary edema can result from acute coronary ischemia, decompensation of underlying heart failure, arrhythmia, an acute valvular disorder, or acute volume overload.\n【47】 Patients have severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, wheezing, and sometimes blood-tinged frothy sputum.\n【48】 Clinical examination and chest x-ray are usually sufficient for diagnosis; ECG, cardiac markers, and sometimes echocardiography are done to identify cause.\n【49】 Treat the cause and give oxygen and IV furosemide and/or nitrates as needed; try noninvasive ventilatory assistance initially but use tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation if necessary.\n【50】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7546, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#5#32# ;)", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-02-29 19:23:30", "update_time": "2024-02-29 23:30:48"}

convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.\n【1】 Conversion to sinus rhythm does not eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation in patients who meet criteria for it.\n【2】 Synchronized cardioversion (100 joules, followed by 200 and 360 joules as needed) converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in 75 to 90% of patients, although recurrence rate is high.\n【3】 Efficacy and maintenance of sinus rhythm after the procedure is improved with use of class Ia, Ic, or III antiarrhythmic medications for Arrhythmias The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.\n【4】 Treatment is directed at causes.\n【5】 24 to 48 hours before the procedure.\n【6】 Cardioversion is more effective in patients with shorter duration of atrial fibrillation, lone atrial fibrillation, or atrial fibrillation with a reversible cause; it is less effective when the left atrium is enlarged (> 5 cm), atrial appendage flow is low, or a significant underlying structural heart disorder is present.\n【7】 These medications should not be used until rate has been controlled by a beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.\n【8】 The converting medications with oral formulations are also used for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (with or without previous cardioversion).\n【9】 Choice depends on patient tolerance.\n【10】 However, for paroxysmal AF that occurs only or almost only at rest or during sleep when vagal tone is high, medications with vagolytic effects (eg, disopyramide) may be particularly effective.\n【11】 Exercise-induced AF may be better prevented with a beta-blocker.\n【12】 For certain patients with recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who also can identify its onset by symptoms, some clinicians provide a single oral loading dose of flecainide (300 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 200 mg) or propafenone (600 mg for patients ≥ 70 kg, otherwise 450 mg) that patients carry and self-administer when palpitations develop (“pill-in-the-pocket” approach).\n【13】 This approach must be limited to patients who have no sinoatrial or AV node dysfunction, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease.\n【14】 Its hazard (estimated at 1%) is the possibility of converting atrial fibrillation to a slowish atrial flutter that conducts 1:1 in the 200 to 240 beat/minute range.\n【15】 This potential complication can be reduced in frequency by coadministration of an AV nodal suppressing drug (eg, a beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist).\n【16】 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone blockers may attenuate the myocardial fibrosis that provides a substrate for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure, but the role of these drugs in routine atrial fibrillation treatment has yet to be defined.\n【17】 Ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation For patients who do not respond to or cannot take rate-controlling medications, ablation for Cardiac Arrhythmia The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.\n【18】 Treatment is directed at causes.\n【19】 of the AV node may be done to cause complete heart block; insertion of a permanent pacemaker Cardiac Pacemakers The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.\n【20】 Treatment is directed at causes.\n【21】 is then necessary.\n【22】 Ablation of only one AV nodal pathway (AV node modification) reduces the number of atrial impulses reaching the ventricles and eliminates the need for a pacemaker, but this approach is considered less effective than complete ablation and is rarely used.\n【23】 Ablation procedures that accomplish electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins from the left atrium can prevent atrial fibrillation without causing AV block.\n【24】 In comparison to other ablation procedures, pulmonary vein isolation has a lower success rate (60 to 80%) and a higher complication rate (1 to 5%).\n【25】 Accordingly, this procedure is often reserved for the best candidates (eg, younger patients who have no significant structural heart disease, patients without other options such as those with medication-resistant AF, or patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure.\n【26】 Randomized clinical trials addressing the need for continued long-term oral anticoagulation after an apparently successful ablation procedure are underway.\n【27】 Prevention of thromboembolism Prevention of thromboembolism is an important goal in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.\n【28】 Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score CHA2DS2-VASc Score and specific cardiac factors to guide thromboembolic therapy.\n【29】 Long-term measures to prevent thromboembolism are taken for certain patients with atrial fibrillation depending on their estimated risk of stroke versus risk of bleeding (eg, as per the and the tool).\n【30】 Conversion of atrial fibrillation with either an antiarrhythmic drug or with DC cardioversion conveys a higher risk for thromboembolic events.\n【31】 When a patient with atrial fibrillation who is not anticoagulated is to undergo cardioversion additional considerations are required.\n【32】 If urgent cardioversion is required because of hemodynamic compromise, cardioversion is done and anticoagulation is started as soon as is practical and continued for at least 4 weeks.\n【33】 If the onset of the current episode of atrial fibrillation is clearly within 48 hours, cardioversion may proceed without prior or subsequent anticoagulation in men with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 and in women with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (class IIb recommendation).\n【34】 If the onset of the current episode of atrial fibrillation is not clearly within 48 hours, the patient should be anticoagulated for 3 weeks before and at least 4 weeks after cardioversion regardless of the patient's predicted risk of a thromboembolic event (class I recommendation).\n【35】 Alternatively, therapeutic anticoagulation is started, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is done, and, if no left atrial or left atrial appendage clot is seen, cardioversion may be done, followed by at least 4 weeks of anticoagulation therapy (class IIa recommendation).\n【36】 Table The guidelines for antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation differ in different regions.\n【37】 The current guidelines in the United States are as follows: Long-term oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, mechanical artificial heart valve, and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of ≥ 2 in men and ≥ 3 in women (class of recommendation I) and may be considered for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of ≥ 1 in men and ≥ 2 in women (class of recommendation IIb).\n【38】 No antithrombotic therapy is recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 0 in men and 1 in women (class of recommendation IIa).\n【39】 Patients with atrial fibrillation and a mechanical heart valve(s) are treated with warfarin.\n【40】 Patients with atrial fibrillation and significant mitral stenosis are treated with warfarin.\n【41】 For patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who are to be treated with an oral anticoagulant, a class I recommendation is given for warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.\n【42】 0 to 3.\n【43】 0, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban.\n【44】 For patients eligible for anticoagulant therapy with either a vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, such as warfarin, or a non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban, the non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants are preferred (class I recommendation).\n【45】 These general guidelines are altered in patients with more than moderate renal impairment.\n【46】 The left atrial appendage may be surgically ligated or closed with a transcatheter device when appropriate antithrombotic therapy is absolutely contraindicated.\n【47】 Table Key Points Atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm that may be episodic or continuous; paroxysms of tachycardia may occur.\n【48】 QRS complexes are typically narrow; a wide complex may occur with intraventricular conduction defects or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\n【49】 Patients should have electrocardiography, echocardiography, and thyroid function testing.\n【50】 Heart rate is controlled typically to < 100 beats/minute at rest; first-line medications include beta-blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem).\n【51】 Restoration of sinus rhythm is not as important as rate control and does not eliminate the need for anticoagulation but may help patients with continuing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise (eg, heart failure); synchronized cardioversion or medication can be used.\n【52】 Anticoagulation is usually necessary before cardioversion.\n【53】 Long-term oral anticoagulation to prevent stroke is required for patients with risk factors for thromboembolism.\n【54】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 7185, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info":

provide an x-ray image of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.\n【30】 It is rarely done today.\n【31】 Usually, CT with the use of a radiopaque contrast agent is done instead.\n【32】 Retrograde urography In retrograde urography, a radiopaque contrast agent is introduced directly into the ureters or the collecting tubules of the kidney through the bladder.\n【33】 or another routine urologic procedure such as ureteroscopy (insertion of a catheter into the ureters) or placement of a stent in the ureter or kidney.\n【34】 The urinary tract can be examined, including the parts of the kidney through which urine drains.\n【35】 Retrograde urography can be done to diagnose scarring, tumors, or abnormal connections between parts of the urinary tract and other structures (fistulas).\n【36】 Retrograde urography can be done if a radiopaque contrast agent cannot be given (for example, if kidney function is poor).\n【37】 Percutaneous antegrade urography In percutaneous antegrade urography, a radiopaque contrast agent is introduced directly into the parts of the kidney through which urine drains through an opening in the back (called a nephrostomy opening).\n【38】 This test may be done if retrograde urography cannot be done (for example, if the instrument's insertion path is blocked) or if a person already has a nephrostomy tube used to treat a disorder such as a tumor or stone that blocks the urinary tract.\n【39】 Cystography and cystourethrography Cystography is any test that provides bladder images after a radiopaque contrast agent is introduced into the bladder (for example, through a cystoscope or a catheter in the urethra).\n【40】 Cystography is used most commonly to detect a hole in the bladder, which may occur after an injury or surgery.\n【41】 In cystourethrography (sometimes called retrograde cystourethrography), a radiopaque contrast agent Radiopaque Contrast Agents During imaging tests, contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail.\n【42】 is injected through the urethra into the bladder.\n【43】 This procedure is used to identify abnormalities in the urethra, such as scarring or tearing as a result of injury.\n【44】 When x-ray films of the bladder and urethra are taken during and immediately after urination, the study is called voiding cystourethrography.\n【45】 This variation of cystourethrography is used to evaluate whether the valves that prevent urine from flowing backward from the bladder into the ureters during urination work properly and to detect abnormalities, such as narrowing, that affect the back part of the urethra (the part nearest the bladder).\n【46】 Retrograde urethrography In retrograde urethrography, a radiopaque contrast agent Radiopaque Contrast Agents During imaging tests, contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail.\n【47】 is introduced directly into the end of the urethra using either a syringe with a special adapter or a urethral catheter placed only a few centimeters into the urethra with the balloon partially inflated so that it fits snugly.\n【48】 The radiopaque contrast agent is injected into the urethra and fills the entire urethra to visualize any injury or strictures Urethral Stricture A urethral stricture is scarring that narrows the urethra.\n【49】 This test is typically used in people who have experienced trauma that may have injured the urethra.\n【50】 Physicians do retrograde urethrography to make sure that placing a urethral catheter into the bladder is safe and will not injure the urethra.\n【51】 Positron emission tomography Newly available nuclear positron emission tomographic (PET) contrast agents can detect prostate cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body.\n【52】 This nuclear contrast agent targets PMSA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) on the surface of prostate cancer cells, which then shows up on a PET scan.\n【53】 In contrast, routine PET scans are not very useful for most cases of prostate cancer but can be useful for other genitourinary tumors such as kidney Cancer Most solid kidney tumors are cancerous, but purely fluid-filled tumors (cysts) generally are not.\n【54】 Almost all kidney cancer is renal cell carcinoma.\n【55】 or testicular cancer.\n【56】 Testicular Cancer Testicular cancer occurs in the testes, the two small organs in males that make sperm.\n【57】 Testicular cancer is most common among young men but usually curable.\n【58】 Radionuclide scanning Radionuclide scanning Radionuclide Scanning In radionuclide scanning, radionuclides are used to produce images.\n【59】 of the kidneys is an imaging technique that relies on the detection of small amounts of radiation by a special gamma camera after the injection of a radioactive chemical.\n【60】 This procedure is most commonly used to assess kidney blood flow and urine production.\n【61】 angiography In angiography, x-rays are used to produce detailed images of blood vessels.\n【62】 (sometimes called conventional angiography to differentiate it from CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography) involves injecting a radiopaque contrast agent Radiopaque Contrast Agents During imaging tests, contrast agents may be used to distinguish one tissue or structure from its surroundings or to provide greater detail.\n【63】 directly into an artery.\n【64】 In people who have urinary tract disorders, this test is used because it can be combined with treatments that repair blood vessels affected by certain disorders, such as severe bleeding or abnormal connections between blood vessels (vascular fistulas).\n【65】 Complications of angiography may include injury to the injected arteries and neighboring organs, bleeding, and reactions to radiopaque contrast agents.\n【66】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4925, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version":

disorder.\n【5】 For example, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a test that measures the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube containing blood.\n【6】 The ESR is usually increased when inflammation is present.\n【7】 However, because inflammation occurs in so many conditions, the ESR alone does not establish a diagnosis.\n【8】 The level of creatine kinase (a normal muscle enzyme that leaks out and is released into the bloodstream when muscle is damaged) may also be tested.\n【9】 Levels of creatine kinase are increased when there is widespread ongoing destruction of muscle.\n【10】 a blood test to identify rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody is helpful in making the diagnosis.\n【11】 In systemic lupus

walls.\n【12】 (SLE or lupus), blood tests to identify autoimmune antibodies (autoantibodies), such as antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), help in making the diagnosis.\n【13】 A blood test can be done to identify people who have a certain gene (HLA-B27).\n【14】 a group of disorders that can cause inflammation of the back and other joints as well as other symptoms, such as eye pain and redness and rashes.\n【15】 Some laboratory tests are also often useful to help monitor the progress of treatment.\n【16】 or polymyalgia rheumatica Polymyalgia Rheumatica Polymyalgia rheumatica involves inflammation of the lining of joints, causing severe pain and stiffness in the muscles of the neck, back, shoulders, and hips.\n【17】 The cause is unknown.\n【18】 A decrease in the ESR suggests that treatment is working to reduce inflammation.\n【19】 Imaging Tests Various types of imaging tests can help doctors diagnose musculoskeletal disorders.\n【20】 X-rays X-rays Plain X-Rays X-rays are high-energy radiation waves that can penetrate most substances (to varying degrees).\n【21】 In very low doses, x-rays are used to produce images that help doctors diagnose disease.\n【22】 are typically done first.\n【23】 They are most valuable for detecting abnormalities in bone and are taken to evaluate painful, deformed, or suspected abnormal areas of bone.\n【24】 Often, x-rays can help to diagnose fractures Overview of Fractures A fracture is a crack or break in a bone.\n【25】 Most fractures result from force applied to a bone.\n【26】 Fractures usually result from injuries or overuse.\n【27】 tumors Overview of Bone Tumors Bone tumors are growths of abnormal cells in bones.\n【28】 Bone tumors may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).\n【29】 injuries, infections Osteomyelitis is a bone infection usually caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi.\n【30】 and deformities (such as developmental dysplasia of the hip Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip Developmental dysplasia of the hip is a birth defect in which the bones in the hip are incorrectly developed.\n【31】 or osteoarthritis Diagnosis Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function.\n【32】 X-rays do not show soft tissues such as muscles, bursae, ligaments, tendons, or nerves.\n【33】 To help determine whether the joint has been damaged by injury, a doctor may use an ordinary (non-stress) x-ray or one taken with the joint under stress caused by certain positions (stress x-ray).\n【34】 X-Ray VIDEO Arthrography is an x-ray procedure in which a radiopaque dye is injected into a joint space to outline the structures, such as ligaments inside the joint.\n【35】 Arthrography can be used to view torn ligaments and fragmented cartilage in the joint.\n【36】 However, magnetic resonance imaging Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) A doctor can often diagnose a musculoskeletal disorder based on the history and the results of a physical examination.\n【37】 (MRI) is now generally used in preference to arthrography.\n【38】 Bone scanning Bone scanning (a type of radionuclide scanning Radionuclide Scanning In radionuclide scanning, radionuclides are used to produce images.\n【39】 is an imaging procedure that is occasionally used to diagnose a fracture, particularly if other tests, such as plain x-rays and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), do not reveal the fracture.\n【40】 Bone scanning involves use of a radioactive substance (technetium-99m–labeled pyrophosphate) that is absorbed by any healing bone.\n【41】 The procedure can also be done when a bone infection or a tumor that has spread from a cancer elsewhere in the body is suspected.\n【42】 Although a bone scan may show a problem in the bone, it may not show whether the problem is a fracture, tumor, or infection.\n【43】 The radioactive substance is given by vein (intravenously) and is detected by a bone-scanning device, which creates an image of the bone that can be viewed on a computer screen.\n【44】 Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.\n【45】 (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.\n【46】 (MRI) give much more detail than conventional x-rays and may be done to determine the extent and exact location of damage.\n【47】 These tests can also be used to detect fractures that are not visible on x-rays.\n【48】 MRI is especially valuable for imaging muscles, ligaments, and tendons.\n【49】 MRI can be used if the cause of pain is thought to be a severe soft-tissue problem (for example, rupture of a major ligament or tendon or damage to important structures inside the knee joint).\n【50】 CT best images bone.\n【51】 However, MRI is better than CT for imaging some bone abnormalities, such as small fractures of the hip and pelvis.\n【52】 The amount of time a person spends undergoing CT is much less than for MRI.\n【53】 MRI is more expensive than CT and, with the exception of when the open-sided units are used, many people feel claustrophobic inside the MRI unit.\n【54】 Computed Tomography (CT) Scan VIDEO Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) The most accurate way to evaluate bone density, which is necessary when screening for or diagnosing osteopenia or osteoporosis Bone density testing Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【55】 is with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).\n【56】 DXA is also used to predict a person's risk of fracture and can be useful for monitoring the response to treatment as well.\n【57】 This test is quick and painless and involves very little radiation.\n【58】 In this test, x-rays are used to examine bone density at the lower spine, hip, wrist, or entire body.\n【59】 Measurements of bone density are very accurate at these sites.\n【60】 When screening people for osteoporosis Bone density testing Osteoporosis is a condition in which a decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making breaks (fractures) likely.\n【61】 doctors prefer taking measurements of the lower spine and hip.\n【62】 To help differentiate osteoporosis (the most common cause of an abnormal DXA scan result) from other bone disorders, doctors may need to consider the person's symptoms, medical conditions, drug use, and certain blood or urine test results as well as the DXA results.\n【63】 Ultrasonography uses high-frequency sound (ultrasound) waves to produce images of internal organs and other tissues.\n【64】 is being used more and more frequently to identify abnormalities and inflammation in and around joints and tears or inflammation of tendons.\n【65】 Ultrasonography is also used as a guide when a needle needs to be put into a joint (for example, to inject drugs or to remove joint fluid).\n【66】 As an alternative to computed tomography Computed Tomography (CT) In computed tomography (CT), which used to be called computed axial tomography (CAT), an x-ray source and x-ray detector rotate around a person.\n【67】 (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a strong magnetic field and very high frequency radio waves are used to produce highly detailed images.\n【68】 (MRI), ultrasonography is less expensive and, unlike CT, involves no exposure to radiation.\n【69】 Other Diagnostic Procedures Other procedures and tests are sometimes needed to help doctors diagnose musculoskeletal disorders.\n【70】 Arthroscopy is a procedure in which a small (diameter of a pencil) fiberoptic scope is inserted into a joint space, allowing the doctor to look inside the joint and to project the image onto a video monitor.\n【71】 The skin incision is very small.\n【72】 This procedure is done in a hospital or surgical center.\n【73】 The person is given local, spinal, or general anesthesia Surgery is the term traditionally used to describe procedures (called surgical procedures) that involve manually cutting or stitching tissue to treat diseases, injuries, or deformities.\n【74】 or a combination.\n【75】 During arthroscopy, doctors can take a piece of tissue (such as joint cartilage or the joint capsule) for analysis (biopsy), and, if necessary, do surgery to correct the condition.\n【76】 Disorders commonly found during arthroscopy include Inflammation of the synovium lining the joint (synovitis) Ligament, tendon, or cartilage tears Loose pieces of bone or cartilage Such conditions affect people with arthritis or previous joint injuries as well as athletes.\n【77】 Most of these conditions can be repaired or removed during arthroscopy.\n【78】 There is a very small risk of joint infection with this procedure.\n【79】 Recovery time after arthroscopic surgery is much faster than after traditional surgery.\n【80】 Most people do not need to stay overnight in the hospital.\n【81】 Joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) Joint aspiration is used to diagnose certain joint problems.\n【82】 For example, it is the most direct and accurate way to determine whether joint pain and swelling is caused by an infection or crystal-related arthritis (such as gout Diagnosis Gout is a disorder in which deposits of uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints because of high blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia).\n【83】 For this procedure, a doctor first injects an anesthetic to numb the area.\n【84】 Then the doctor inserts a larger needle into the joint space (sometimes guided by ultrasonography), draws out (aspirates) joint fluid (synovial fluid), and examines the fluid under a microscope.\n【85】 A doctor removes as much fluid as possible and notes its color and clarity.\n【86】 Other tests, such as white blood cell count and culture, are done on the fluid.\n【87】 The doctor can often make a diagnosis after analyzing the fluid.\n【88】 For example, a sample of fluid may contain bacteria, which confirm a diagnosis of infection.\n【89】 Or, it may contain certain crystals.\n【90】 For example, finding uric acid crystals confirms a diagnosis of gout Diagnosis Gout is a disorder in which deposits of uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints because of high blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia).\n【91】 Usually done in the doctor's office or an emergency department, this procedure is typically quick, easy, and relatively painless.\n【92】 The risk of joint infection is minimal.\n【93】 Nerve and muscle tests Nerve conduction studies Nerve conduction studies Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【94】 Electromyography Diagnostic procedures may be needed to confirm a diagnosis suggested by the medical history and neurologic examination.\n【95】 (such as myositis Autoimmune Myositis Autoimmune myositis causes inflammation and weakness in the muscles (polymyositis) or in the skin and muscles (dermatomyositis).\n【96】 Nervous system Overview of the Nervous System The nervous system has two distinct parts: the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord).\n【97】 spinal cord problem Overview of Spinal Cord Disorders Spinal cord disorders can cause permanent severe problems, such as paralysis or impaired bladder and bowel control ( urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence).\n【98】 or polyneuropathy is the simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body.\n【99】 Neuromuscular junction Overview of Neuromuscular Junction Disorders Nerves connect with muscles at the neuromuscular junction.\n【100】 There, the ends of nerve fibers connect to special sites on the muscle’s membrane called motor end plates.\n【101】 (such as myasthenia gravis Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that impairs communication between nerves and muscles, resulting in episodes of muscle weakness.\n【102】 Nerve conduction studies are particularly useful for the diagnosis of peripheral nerve disorders Overview of the Peripheral Nervous System The peripheral nervous system refers to the parts of the nervous system that are outside the central nervous system, that is, those outside the brain and spinal cord.\n【103】 such as carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful compression (pinching) of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist.\n【104】 and ulnar nerve

disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.\n【1】 in which the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, and more than 90% of them are permanently destroyed Type 2 Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body does not produce enough or respond normally to insulin, causing blood sugar (glucose) levels to be abnormally high.\n【2】 in which the body develops resistance to the effects of insulin In both types, the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood is elevated.\n【3】 People with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes are likely to have complications as a result of the elevated glucose level.\n【4】 However, because type 2 diabetes may be present for some time before it is diagnosed, complications in type 2 diabetes may be more serious or more advanced when they are discovered.\n【5】 People with diabetes mellitus may experience many serious, long-term complications.\n【6】 Some of these complications begin within months of the onset of diabetes, although most tend to develop after a few years.\n【7】 Most of the complications gradually worsen.\n【8】 In people with diabetes, strictly controlling the level of glucose in the blood makes these complications less likely to develop or worsen.\n【9】 Causes of Complications of Diabetes Mellitus Most complications of diabetes are the result of problems with blood vessels.\n【10】 Glucose levels that remain high over a long time cause both the small and large blood vessels to narrow.\n【11】 The narrowing reduces blood flow to many parts of the body, leading to problems.\n【12】 There are several causes of blood vessel narrowing: Complex sugar-based substances build up in the walls of small blood vessels, causing them to thicken and leak.\n【13】 and decreased blood flow in the larger blood vessels.\n【14】 Types of Diabetes Complications Blood vessel complications in diabetes Atherosclerosis leads to heart attacks Acute Coronary Syndromes (Heart Attack; Myocardial Infarction; Unstable Angina) Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden blockage in a coronary artery.\n【15】 Atherosclerosis is between 2 and 4 times more common and tends to occur at a younger age in people with diabetes than in people who do not have diabetes.\n【16】 Over time, narrowing of

levels of glucose in the blood are high, white blood cells cannot effectively fight infections.\n【22】 Any infection that develops tends to be more severe and takes longer to resolve in people with diabetes.\n【23】 Sometimes, an infection is the first sign of diabetes.\n【24】 One such infection is a yeast infection called candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by several species of the yeast Candida, especially Candida albicans.\n【25】 Candida yeast is a normal resident of the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina that usually causes no harm.\n【26】 In people with diabetes, however, Candida can overgrow on mucous membranes and moist areas of the skin causing rashes in those areas.\n【27】 People with diabetes are also particularly likely to have ulcers and infections of the feet and legs because of poor circulation to the skin.\n【28】 Too often, these wounds heal slowly or not at all.\n【29】 When wounds do not heal, they typically become infected and this can result in gangrene Gas Gangrene Gas gangrene is a life-threatening infection of muscle tissue caused mainly by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens and several other species of clostridia.\n【30】 (tissue death) and bone infection (osteomyelitis is a bone infection usually caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi.\n【31】 Amputation of the foot or part of the leg may be needed.\n【32】 Eye problems in diabetes

injectable medications may be used.\n【35】 Therefore, people with diabetes should have yearly eye examinations to check for early signs of damage.\n【36】 Diabetic Retinopathy VIDEO Liver damage in diabetes It is common for people with diabetes to also have fatty liver disease Fatty Liver Fatty liver is an abnormal accumulation of certain fats (triglycerides) inside liver cells.\n【37】 in which abnormal fat deposits collect in the liver.\n【38】 Fatty liver disease can sometimes progress to more serious liver disease including cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.\n【39】 Doctors diagnose liver problems if liver blood tests are abnormal and confirm the diagnosis with a liver biopsy of the Liver Doctors can obtain a sample of liver tissue during exploratory surgery, but more often they obtain a sample by inserting a

failure.\n【45】 Doctors usually check the urine of people with diabetes for abnormally high levels of protein (albumin), which is an early sign of kidney damage.\n【46】 At the earliest sign of kidney complications, people are often given medications that slow the progression of kidney damage, for example, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (medications that increase glucose secretion in the urine), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).\n【47】 Diabetic Nephropathy VIDEO Nerve damage in diabetes Damage to nerves can manifest in several ways.\n【48】 If a single nerve malfunctions, an arm or leg may suddenly become weak.\n【49】 If the nerves to the hands, legs, and feet become damaged (diabetic Polyneuropathy is the simultaneous malfunction of many peripheral nerves throughout the body.\n【50】 sensation may become abnormal, and tingling or burning pain and weakness in the arms and legs may develop.\n【51】 Damage to the nerves of the skin makes repeated injuries more likely because people cannot sense changes in pressure or temperature.\n【52】 Foot problems in diabetes causes many changes in the body.\n【53】 The following changes in the feet are common and difficult to treat: Damage to the nerves (neuropathy) affects sensation to the feet, so that pain is not felt.\n【54】 Irritation and other forms of injury may go unnoticed.\n【55】 An injury may wear through the skin before any pain is felt.\n【56】 Changes in sensation alter the way people with diabetes carry weight on their feet, concentrating weight in certain areas so that calluses form.\n【57】 Calluses (and dry skin) increase the risk of skin breakdown.\n【58】 Diabetes can cause poor circulation in the feet, making ulcers more likely to form when the skin is damaged and making the ulcers slower to heal.\n【59】 Because diabetes can affect the body’s ability to fight infections, a foot ulcer, once it forms, easily becomes infected.\n【60】 Because of neuropathy, people may not feel discomfort due to the infection until it becomes serious and difficult to treat, leading to gangrene Gas Gangrene Gas gangrene is a life-threatening infection of muscle tissue caused mainly by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium perfringens and several other species of clostridia.\n【61】 The feet should be protected from injury, and the skin should be kept moist with a good moisturizer.\n【62】 Shoes should fit properly and not cause areas of irritation.\n【63】 Shoes should have appropriate cushioning to spread out the pressure caused by standing.\n【64】 Going barefoot is ill advised.\n【65】 Regular care from a podiatrist (a doctor specializing in foot care), such as having toenails cut and calluses removed, may also be helpful.\n【66】 Also, sensation and blood flow to the feet should be regularly evaluated by doctors.\n【67】 Table Monitoring and Preventing Diabetes Complications At the time of diagnosis and then at least yearly, people with type 2 diabetes are monitored for the presence of diabetes complications, such as kidney, eye, and nerve damage.\n【68】 In people with type 1 diabetes, doctors begin monitoring for complications 5 years after diagnosis.\n【69】 Typical screening tests include the following: Foot examination to test sensation and look for signs of poor circulation (ulcers, hair loss) Eye examination (done by an eye specialist) Urine and blood tests of kidney function Blood tests for cholesterol levels Sometimes an electrocardiogram Worsening of complications can be prevented or delayed by strict blood glucose control or by early treatment with medication.\n【70】 Risk factors for heart problems, such as increased blood pressure High Blood Pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries.\n【71】 and high cholesterol levels Overview of Cholesterol and Lipid Disorders The body needs fats for growth and energy.\n【72】 It also uses them to synthesize hormones and other substances needed for the body’s activities.\n【73】 are evaluated at each doctor visit and are treated with medication if necessary.\n【74】 Proper care of feet and regular eye examinations can help prevent or delay the onset of complications of diabetes.\n【75】 People with diabetes are vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, hepatitis B, and COVID-19, and doctors usually recommend they receive annual flu vaccination because people with diabetes are at risk of infection.\n【76】 Treatment of high blood pressure High Blood Pressure High blood pressure (hypertension) is persistently high pressure in the arteries.\n【77】 and high cholesterol Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【78】 levels, which can contribute to circulation problems, can help prevent some of the complications of diabetes as well.\n【79】 People with diabetes who are between 40 and 75 years are given a statin Lipid-lowering drugs Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.\n【80】 therapy to lower cholesterol levels and lower cardiovascular risk.\n【81】 People younger than 40 or older than 75 years and with an elevated risk of heart disease also should take a statin.\n【82】 Another common problem in people with diabetes is gum disease (gingivitis is a mild form of periodontal disease characterized by inflammation of the gums (gingivae).\n【83】 and regular visits to the dentist for cleaning and preventive care are important.\n【84】  People who can strictly control their blood glucose levels may be able to minimize or delay diabetes complications.\n【85】 Prevention of hypoglycemia One of the challenges of trying to strictly control the levels of glucose in the blood is that low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia is abnormally low levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood.\n【86】 Hypoglycemia is most often caused by medications taken to control diabetes.\n【87】 may occur with some commonly used antihyperglycemic medications (such as insulin or sulfonylureas).\n【88】 Recognizing the presence of low blood glucose is important because treatment of hypoglycemia is an emergency.\n【89】 Symptoms may include hunger pangs, racing heartbeat, shakiness, sweating, and inability to think clearly.\n【90】 If hypoglycemia is very severe, sugar must get into the body quickly to prevent permanent harm and relieve symptoms.\n【91】 Most of the time, people can eat sugar.\n【92】 Almost any form of sugar will do, although glucose works more quickly than table sugar (typical table sugar is sucrose).\n【93】 Many people with diabetes carry glucose tablets or glucose gel packs.\n【94】 Other options are to drink a glass of milk (which contains lactose, a type of sugar), sugar water, or fruit juice or to eat a piece of cake, some fruit, or another sweet food.\n【95】 In more serious situations, it may be necessary for emergency medical practitioners to inject glucose into a vein.\n【96】 Another treatment for hypoglycemia involves the use of glucagon.\n【97】 Glucagon can be injected into a muscle or inhaled as a nasal powder and causes the liver to release large amounts of glucose within minutes.\n【98】 Small transportable kits containing a syringe or autoinjector pen filled with glucagon are available for people who frequently have episodes of low blood glucose to use in emergency situations when sugar cannot be ingested by mouth.\n【99】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3649, "dataset":

ventricular septum Single ventricle defects Tricuspid atresia Symptoms of these defects vary, depending on the specific defect and its severity, but they may cause a bluish color in the skin (cyanosis) or an abnormal heart rhythm Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart.\n【3】 Doctors often suspect a heart defect when they hear a heart murmur during an examination with a stethoscope, but usually they do echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.\n【4】 It uses no x-rays.\n【5】 (ultrasonography of the heart) to confirm the diagnosis.\n【6】 Surgical repair of the defect is usually needed.\n【7】 Aortopulmonary window Aortopulmonary window is an abnormal opening between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery that takes blood to the lungs.\n【8】 It is very rare.\n【9】 Aortopulmonary window can occur on its own or occur with other heart defects, such as atrial septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【10】 coarctation of the aorta Coarctation of the Aorta Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of part of the aorta, the main blood vessel bringing red oxygenated blood from the heart to the body.\n【11】 or tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot In tetralogy of Fallot, four specific heart defects occur together.\n【12】 This condition includes four heart defects that can lead to oxygen-poor blood going directly to the body.\n【13】 Symptoms are those of left-to-right shunt Shunting of blood flow .\n【14】 (for example, rapid breathing, poor feeding, easy tiring, excessive sweating).\n【15】 During infancy, these symptoms often result in failure to thrive Failure to Thrive in Children Failure to thrive is a delay in weight gain and physical growth that can lead to delays in development and maturation.\n【16】 A large left-to-right shunt also eventually leads to high blood pressure in lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (the pulmonary arteries) is abnormally high.\n【17】 Many disorders can cause pulmonary hypertension.\n【18】 Most infants with an aortopulmonary window have a heart murmur.\n【19】 Doctors make the diagnosis based on what they find on examining the infant and results of imaging tests, usually echocardiography.\n【20】 Surgical repair of aortopulmonary window should be done as soon as possible after diagnosis.\n【21】 Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is relatively rare.\n【22】 In this anomaly, the normal connections of the aorta and the pulmonary artery are reversed, but the lower heart chambers (the ventricles) are also reversed, thus \"correcting\" the circulation so that the oxygen-poor venous blood goes into the lungs and oxygenated blood goes out to the body as it normally should.\n【23】 Most affected infants have other heart abnormalities as well, such as ventricular septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【24】 pulmonic stenosis Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Children Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve), which opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n【25】 and Ebstein

of the heart do not travel down to the lower chambers.\n【29】 Heart blocks is treated with a pacemaker.\n【30】 may be needed.\n【31】 Double outlet right ventricle In double outlet right ventricle, both the aorta and the pulmonary artery are connected to the right ventricle and no artery attaches to the left ventricle.\n【32】 Infants with double outlet right ventricle also have a hole between the ventricles (ventricular septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【33】 Oxygen-rich blood in the left ventricle flows through the ventricular septal defect, allowing the oxygen-rich blood to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right ventricle before getting pumped out of the heart.\n【34】 Therefore, some oxygen-poor blood is circulated to the body.\n【35】 Symptoms vary depending on the associated abnormalities in the heart such as pulmonic valve stenosis Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Children Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve), which opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n【36】 Symptoms include rapid breathing, poor feeding, easy tiring, and/or bluish color of the lips, nail beds, and skin (cyanosis).\n【37】 Surgical repair is needed.\n【38】 Ebstein anomaly Ebstein anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve that causes the valve to leak blood backward into the atrium.\n【39】 Some studies have shown an increased risk of this abnormality in infants whose mothers used the drug lithium during pregnancy.\n【40】 Atrial septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【41】 pulmonic valve stenosis Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Children Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve), which opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n【42】 and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a disorder in which an extra electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles is present at birth.\n【43】 often occur together with this abnormality.\n【44】 Newborns may be bluish in color (indicating the body is not receiving enough oxygen), or symptoms may not develop until adulthood, when an abnormal heart rhythm Overview of Abnormal Heart Rhythms Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are sequences of heartbeats that are irregular, too fast, too slow, or conducted via an abnormal electrical pathway through the heart.\n【45】 occurs.\n【46】 If the abnormal tricuspid valve causes severe symptoms, the valve is surgically repaired.\n【47】 Pulmonary atresia with intact septum In pulmonary atresia, the pulmonic (pulmonary) valve does not form properly and does not open, so blood does not flow into the lungs and pick up oxygen.\n【48】 Therefore, oxygen-poor blood is circulated to the body.\n【49】 Pulmonary atresia frequently occurs together with other heart disorders and with abnormalities of the coronary arteries.\n【50】 The symptoms and surgical treatment options depend on what type of other abnormalities are also present.\n【51】 Single ventricle defects Single ventricle abnormalities include any complex heart defect in which there is only one functional ventricle.\n【52】 Symptoms depend on the exact abnormality and whether pulmonic valve stenosis Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Children Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve), which opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n【53】 is also present.\n【54】 Most infants have a bluish color of the skin (cyanosis).\n【55】 Infants with severe pulmonic stenosis may be very blue and require a surgical procedure fairly quickly.\n【56】 Infants without pulmonic stenosis have excessive blood flow to their lungs and develop symptoms of heart failure.\n【57】 Surgery is also required.\n【58】 Tricuspid atresia Tricuspid atresia is absence of the tricuspid valve accompanied by an underdeveloped right ventricle.\n【59】 Other heart defects are present and may include atrial septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【60】 ventricular septal defect Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defects Atrial and ventricular septal defects are holes in the walls (septa) that separate the heart into the left and right sides.\n【61】 patent ductus arteriosus Patent Ductus Arteriosus In patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta (ductus arteriosus) fails to close as it usually does shortly after birth.\n【62】 pulmonic valve stenosis Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Children Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve (sometimes called the pulmonic valve), which opens to allow blood to flow from the right ventricle to the lungs.\n【63】 and transposition of the great arteries Transposition of the Great Arteries Transposition of the great arteries is a reversal of the normal connections of the aorta and the pulmonary artery with the heart.\n【64】 Infants have a bluish color of the skin (cyanosis).\n【65】 Other symptoms depend on what other abnormalities are also present.\n【66】 Diagnosis is by echocardiography.\n【67】 Treatment is surgical repair.\n【68】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 3705, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0",

Sitting up allows backed-up fluid to drain out of the upper part of the lungs, restoring normal breathing.\n【29】 About 5% of people with aortic regurgitation have chest pain due to an inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle (angina is temporary chest pain or a sensation of pressure that occurs while the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen.\n【30】 especially at night.\n【31】 The pulse, sometimes called a collapsing pulse, is momentarily strong, then disappears quickly because the blood leaks backward through the aortic valve into the heart, causing blood pressure to decrease sharply.\n【32】 Diagnosis of Aortic Regurgitation Physical examination Echocardiography The diagnosis is based on the results of a physical examination (such as the collapsing pulse and characteristic heart murmur) and confirmed by echocardiography and Other Ultrasound Procedures Ultrasonography uses high-frequency (ultrasound) waves bounced off internal structures to produce a moving image.\n【33】 It uses no x-rays.\n【34】 Echocardiography also shows the severity of the regurgitation and whether the heart muscle has been affected.\n【35】 (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Heart With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a powerful magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the heart and chest.\n【36】 (MRI) to detect aortic dissection.\n【37】 Chest x-ray and electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick, simple, painless procedure in which the heart’s electrical impulses are amplified and recorded.\n【38】 (ECG) usually show signs of an enlarged heart.\n【39】 Coronary angiography Coronary angiography Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are minimally invasive methods of studying the heart and the blood vessels that supply the heart (coronary arteries) without doing surgery.\n【40】 is done before surgery because about 20% of people with severe aortic regurgitation also have coronary artery disease Overview of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Coronary artery disease is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is partially or completely blocked.\n【41】 The heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood.\n【42】 First-degree relatives (that is, parents, siblings, or children) of people with a bicuspid valve should also be screened because 20 to 30% will be similarly affected.\n【43】 Aortic Valve Replacement VIDEO Treatment of Aortic Regurgitation Valve repair or replacement Drug treatment is not especially effective in slowing the progression of heart failure and does not eliminate the need for timely valve repair or replacement.\n【44】 Echocardiography is done periodically to determine how rapidly the left ventricle is enlarging, which will help doctors determine when surgery should be done.\n【45】 The damaged valve should be surgically repaired or replaced with an artificial valve before the left ventricle becomes irreversibly damaged.\n【46】 Please note that THE

the liver, generally meaning inflammation caused by infection with one of the five hepatitis viruses.\n【7】 and Hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis C, Chronic hepatitis C is inflammation of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis C virus and that has lasted more than 6 months.\n【8】 In the United States, over 4,100 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported in 2019.\n【9】 However, because many cases are not recognized or not reported, the actual number of new infections was estimated to be over 57,500 in 2019.\n【10】 The number of people with acute hepatitis C in the United States has been increasing since 2013.\n【11】 For unknown reasons, about one of five people with alcoholic liver disease Alcohol-Related Liver Disease Alcohol-related liver disease is liver damage caused by drinking too much alcohol for a long time.\n【12】 has hepatitis C.\n【13】 In these people, alcohol and hepatitis C work together to worsen inflammation and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis of the Liver Cirrhosis is the widespread distortion of the liver's internal structure that occurs when a large amount of normal liver tissue is permanently replaced with nonfunctioning scar tissue.\n【14】 Transmission of hepatitis C Hepatitis C is usually spread through contact with blood of an infected person.\n【15】 Hepatitis C is most commonly transmitted among people who share unsterilized needles to inject illicit drugs.\n【16】 The infection can also be transmitted through unsterilized needles used for tattoos and body piercings.\n【17】 Transmission through blood transfusions or organ transplants is possible but is now rare.\n【18】 Such transmission was common in the United States until 1992, when widespread screening of the blood supply for the hepatitis C virus began.\n【19】 Transmission through sexual contact is uncommon, as is transmission from an infected pregnant woman to her baby.\n【20】 Why someone gets hepatitis C sometimes cannot be determined.\n【21】 Symptoms of Acute Hepatitis C At first, acute hepatitis C is usually mild and often causes no symptoms.\n【22】 Most people with acute hepatitis C are unaware that they are infected.\n【23】 Some people with acute hepatitis C have typical symptoms of viral hepatitis.\n【24】 These symptoms include Loss of appetite A general feeling of illness (malaise) Fever Nausea and vomiting Jaundice in Adults In jaundice, the skin and whites of the eyes look yellow.\n【25】 Jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin (a yellow pigment) in the blood—a condition called hyperbilirubinemia.\n【26】 Hepatitis C becomes chronic in about 75% of people.\n【27】 Chronic infection is usually mild.\n【28】 However, over time, about 20 to 30% of people with chronic hepatitis C Hepatitis C, Chronic hepatitis C is inflammation of the liver that is

antibodies to hepatitis C suggests that people have been infected with hepatitis C at some time in their life but are not necessarily still infected.\n【40】 If antibodies to hepatitis C are found, the hepatitis C RNA test is done to determine whether the infection is current or occurred in the past.\n【41】 Having antibodies to hepatitis C does not protect people from getting hepatitis C.\n【42】 (In contrast, having antibodies to hepatitis A and hepatitis B does protect against future infection with these viruses.\n【43】 ) Prevention of Acute Hepatitis C High-risk behavior, such as sharing needles to inject drugs, should be avoided.\n【44】 In the United States, all blood donors are tested for hepatitis C to prevent the spread of hepatitis C virus through transfusions.\n【45】 Also, even though the chance of getting hepatitis from transfusions is remote, doctors use transfusions only when there is no alternative.\n【46】 These measures have dramatically decreased the risk of getting hepatitis from a blood transfusion.\n【47】 No vaccine for hepatitis C is currently available.\n【48】 Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Antiviral drugs People with acute hepatitis C are treated with the same drugs used to treat chronic hepatitis C Treatment as soon as acute hepatitis C is diagnosed.\n【49】 These drugs may decrease the risk of acute hepatitis C becoming chronic.\n【50】 People with hepatitis C should not drink alcohol because it can damage the liver further.\n【51】 There is no need to avoid certain foods or to limit activity.\n【52】 People should not take drugs that can damage the liver, such as acetaminophen.\n【53】 Most people can safely return to work after jaundice resolves.\n【54】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4352, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name":

The heart is a muscle that pumps blood.\n【1】 Like all muscles, the heart needs a steady supply of blood to work.\n【2】 Blood that pumps through the heart doesn't feed the heart muscle.\n【3】 Instead the heart muscle is fed by its own arteries.\n【4】 These arteries are called coronary arteries.\n【5】 Coronary is a word for heart.\n【6】 Coronary artery disease (heart disease) happens when blood flow through the coronary arteries is partially or totally blocked.\n【7】 Coronary artery disease is the main cause of angina is pain, discomfort, or pressure in your chest that happens when your heart isn't getting enough oxygen.\n【8】 unstable angina Unstable angina is pain, discomfort, or pressure in your chest that happens when your heart isn't getting enough oxygen.\n【9】 and heart attack Heart Attack A heart attack is when blood flow to part of your heart is suddenly blocked and some of your heart muscle dies.\n【10】 Doctors use the term myocardial infarction to refer to a heart attack.\n【11】 ) Unstable angina and heart attack can cause an abnormal heart rhythm or cause your heart to stop.\n【12】 You can die if you aren't treated quickly.\n【13】 Also, a heart attack causes permanent heart damage.\n【14】 Supplying the Heart With Blood Like any other tissue in the body, the muscle of the heart must receive oxygen-rich blood and have waste products removed by the blood.\n【15】 The right coronary artery and the left coronary artery, which branch off the aorta just after it leaves the heart, deliver oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.\n【16】 The right coronary artery branches into the marginal artery and the posterior interventricular artery, located on the back surface of the heart.\n【17】 The left coronary artery (typically called the left main coronary artery) branches into the circumflex and the left anterior descending artery.\n【18】 The cardiac veins collect blood containing waste products from the heart muscle and empty it into a large vein on the back surface of the heart called the coronary sinus, which returns the blood to the right atrium.\n【19】 commonly known as hardening of the arteries.\n【20】 In atherosclerosis, cholesterol and other fatty material slowly build up in your arteries.\n【21】 This build-up is called an atheroma or plaque.\n【22】 The plaque may: Narrow the artery, partly blocking blood flow to your heart Rupture suddenly, causing a blood clot that blocks the artery and causes a heart attack Heart Attack A heart attack is when blood flow to part of your heart is suddenly blocked and some of your heart muscle dies.\n【23】 Doctors use the term myocardial infarction to refer to a heart attack.\n【24】 Fatty Deposits in a Coronary Artery VIDEO Less common causes include a sudden spasm of a coronary artery, usually from using drugs such as cocaine.\n【25】 During a spasm, the artery suddenly squeezes shut.\n【26】 If it stays shut long enough, you can have a heart attack.\n【27】 Usually the spasm stops and the artery opens up again.\n【28】 What are the risk factors for coronary artery disease? Risk factors that you can control or avoid: Smoking cigarettes High levels of bad cholesterol High Cholesterol is a type of fat.\n【29】 Fats are also called lipids.\n【30】 Your body uses cholesterol to build important parts of cells and to make certain digestive juices.\n【31】 Your body needs cholesterol.\n【32】 High blood pressure High Blood Pressure Each heart beat pushes blood through your arteries.\n【33】 Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.\n【34】 Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteries.\n【35】 Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar (glucose) levels are too high.\n【36】 You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working right.\n【37】 Being overweight Not exercising regularly Eating too much saturated fat, such as butter, and not enough fruits and vegetables Risk factors that are important but can't be controlled: Having people in your family who had coronary artery disease before age 55 Being a man Growing older How can doctors tell if I have coronary artery disease? Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and do a physical exam and blood tests.\n【38】 If you have symptoms of a blocked artery, your doctor may do tests: Stress test Stress Testing A stress test lets doctors see how your heart works when it’s under stress, such as when you exercise.\n【39】 —a test to see whether your heart is getting enough blood when it works hard (is under stress), such as when you exercise ECG/EKG Electrocardiography is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity.\n【40】 It's quick, painless, and harmless.\n【41】 The results of that test are shown in an electrocardiogram.\n【42】 —a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity, which can be abnormal in coronary artery disease Cardiac catheterization Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization (also called cardiac cath) is a heart procedure done in a hospital.\n【43】 The doctor puts a thin plastic tube (catheter) through an artery and into your heart.\n【44】 —a test that allows doctors to see if and where your coronary arteries are blocked by putting a long, thin catheter (small flexible tube) into an artery in your arm or leg, up to your heart, and into your coronary arteries CT scan Computed Tomography A CT scan uses a large machine shaped like a large donut to take x-rays from many angles.\n【45】 A computer then takes the x-rays and creates many detailed pictures of the inside of your body.\n【46】 —an imaging test to look for hardening of the coronary arteries Exercise Tolerance (Stress) Testing VIDEO How do doctors treat coronary artery disease?

Change behaviors that may hurt your heart Stop smoking—this is the most important way to prevent or reverse coronary artery disease Eat healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and other high-fiber foods Eat less fat from meats, dairy, and processed foods (such as frozen pizza or microwaveable dinners)—talk to your doctor about how much and which types of fat you should eat Lose weight if you're overweight Stay active by using weights or walking Stop using drugs—this can be hard to stop, so talk to your doctor or a counselor about how to get help Take your medicines correctly Remember to take any medicines prescribed by your doctor, such as for high cholesterol High Cholesterol is a type of fat.\n【50】 Fats are also called lipids.\n【51】 Your body uses cholesterol to build important parts of cells and to make certain digestive juices.\n【52】 Your body needs cholesterol.\n【53】 high blood pressure High Blood Pressure Each heart beat pushes blood through your arteries.\n【54】 Arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body.\n【55】 Blood pressure is the pressure of blood in your arteries.\n【56】 or Diabetes is a disease in which your blood sugar (glucose) levels are too high.\n【57】 You get diabetes if your body's normal way of controlling blood sugar isn't working right.\n【58】 If you're 50 or older, ask your doctor about taking a low dose of aspirin every day to help prevent heart attacks and strokes .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 4296, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-02-29 19:23:29", "update_time": "2024-03-03 18:17:28"}

the period of greatest risk is from a few days before the rash appears to 7 days after onset of the rash.\n【13】 Congenitally infected infants Congenital Rubella Congenital rubella is a viral infection acquired from the mother during pregnancy.\n【14】 Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death.\n【15】 may transmit rubella for many months after birth.\n【16】 Rubella is less contagious than measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children.\n【17】 Immunity appears to be lifelong after natural infection.\n【18】 However, in unvaccinated populations, 10 to 15% of young adults have not had childhood infection and are susceptible.\n【19】 At present, incidence in the US is at a historic low because of routine childhood vaccination; all cases since 2004 have been imported.\n【20】 Symptoms and Signs of Rubella Many cases are mild.\n【21】 After a 14- to 21-day incubation period, a 1- to 5-day prodrome, usually consisting of low-grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenopathy, occurs in adults but may be minimal or absent in children.\n【22】 Tender swelling of the suboccipital, postauricular, and posterior cervical nodes is characteristic.\n【23】 There is pharyngeal injection at the onset.\n【24】 The rash is similar to that of measles but is less extensive and more evanescent; it is often the first sign in children.\n【25】 It begins on the face and neck and quickly spreads to the trunk and extremities.\n【26】 At onset, a blanching, macular erythema may appear, particularly on the face.\n【27】 On the 2nd day, the rash often becomes more scarlatiniform (pinpoint) with a reddish flush.\n【28】 Petechiae form on the soft palate (Forschheimer spots), later coalescing into a red blush.\n【29】 The rash lasts 3 to 5 days.\n【30】 Constitutional symptoms in children are absent or mild and may include malaise and occasional arthralgias.\n【31】 Adults usually have few or no constitutional symptoms but occasionally have fever, malaise, headache, stiff joints, transient arthritis, and mild rhinitis.\n【32】 Fever typically resolves by the 2nd day of the rash.\n【33】 Encephalitis has occurred rarely during large military outbreaks.\n【34】 Complete resolution is typical, but encephalitis is occasionally fatal.\n【35】 Thrombocytopenic purpura and otitis media occur rarely.\n【36】 Diagnosis of Rubella Clinical evaluation Serologic testing Rubella is suspected in patients with characteristic adenopathy and rash.\n【37】 Laboratory diagnosis is necessary for pregnant women, patients with encephalitis, and neonates.\n【38】 Also, laboratory evaluation is strongly encouraged for all suspected cases of rubella for public health purposes.\n【39】 A ≥ 4-fold rise between acute and convalescent (4 to 8 weeks) antibody titers confirms the diagnosis, as can serum rubella IgM antibody testing.\n【40】 Detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing of throat, nasal, or urine specimens may also be done to confirm the diagnosis; genotype analysis is useful in epidemiologic investigations.\n【41】 Differential diagnosis includes measles is a highly contagious viral infection that is most common among children.\n【42】 scarlet fever Scarlet fever Streptococci are gram-positive aerobic organisms that cause many disorders, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, wound and skin infections, sepsis, and endocarditis.\n【43】 secondary syphilis Secondary syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum and is characterized by 3 sequential symptomatic stages separated by periods of asymptomatic latent infection.\n【44】 and infectious mononucleosis Infectious Mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4) and is characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.\n【45】 as well as echovirus and coxsackievirus infections ( see Table: Some Respiratory Viruses Some Respiratory Viruses ).\n【46】 Infections with enteroviruses and parvovirus B19 (erythema infectiosum) may be clinically indistinguishable.\n【47】 Some of these conditions can be distinguished from rubella as follows: Measles: Rubella is differentiated from measles by the milder, more evanescent rash, milder and briefer constitutional symptoms, and absence of Koplik spots, photophobia, and cough.\n【48】 Scarlet fever: Within a day of onset, scarlet fever usually causes more severe constitutional symptoms and pharyngitis than does rubella.\n【49】 Secondary syphilis: In secondary syphilis, adenopathy is not tender, and the rash is usually prominent on the palms and soles.\n【50】 Also, laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is usually readily available.\n【51】 Infectious mononucleosis: Infectious mononucleosis can be differentiated by its more severe pharyngitis, more prolonged malaise, and atypical lymphocytosis and with Epstein-Barr virus antibody testing.\n【52】 Treatment of Rubella Supportive care Treatment of rubella is symptomatic.\n【53】 No specific therapy for encephalitis is available.\n【54】 Prevention of Rubella Live-virus vaccine is given routinely ( see Table: Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 0–6 Years Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 0–6 Years and see Table: Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 7–18 Years Recommended Immunization Schedule for Ages 7–18 Years ).\n【55】 It produces immunity for ≥ 15 years in > 95% of recipients and does not appear to transmit the infection.\n【56】 Because certain other infections are clinically indistinguishable from rubella, a reported history of rubella does not guarantee immunity.\n【57】 Vaccination is given to children as a combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine effectively protects against all 3 infections.\n【58】 in 2 doses: The first dose at age 12 to 15 months The second dose at age 4 to 6 years One dose is recommended for all susceptible postpubertal people, especially college students, military recruits, health care practitioners, recent immigrants, and people working with young children.\n【59】 Routine vaccination is recommended for all susceptible mothers immediately after delivery.\n【60】 Screening women of childbearing age for rubella antibodies and immunizing those susceptible are also suggested.\n【61】 However, women receiving the vaccine should prevent conception for at least 28 days afterward.\n【62】 The vaccine virus may be capable of infecting a fetus during early pregnancy.\n【63】 The vaccine does not cause congenital rubella syndrome Symptoms and Signs Congenital rubella is a viral infection acquired from the mother during pregnancy.\n【64】 Signs are multiple congenital anomalies that can result in fetal death.\n【65】 but risk of fetal damage is estimated at ≤ 3%.\n【66】 Rubella vaccine use is contraindicated throughout pregnancy.\n【67】 Fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, polyneuropathy, arthralgia, and arthritis occur rarely after vaccination in children; painful joint swelling occasionally follows vaccination in adults, usually in nonimmune women.\n【68】 Key Points Rubella causes a scarlatiniform rash and often low-grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenopathy (characteristically involving the suboccipital, postauricular, and posterior cervical nodes).\n【69】 Most cases are mild and complications are few except for rare cases of encephalitis and the risk during early pregnancy that infection can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital defects.\n【70】 Laboratory diagnosis is strongly encouraged for all suspected cases for public health purposes; serologic or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing can be done.\n【71】 Screen women of childbearing age for rubella antibodies and immunize those susceptible, providing conception is prevented for ≥ 28 days afterwards.\n【72】 Vaccination is contraindicated during pregnancy.\n【73】 .", "tokens": "", "seq_id": 9349, "dataset": "high_quality-MSD_diagnosis_treatment_zh", "batch_name": "unifiedUpload", "version": "0", "lang": "en"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": "无关文本#0#0#重复文本Congenital Rubella Congenital Rubella Congenital rubella", "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-02-29 19:23:29", "update_time": "2024-03-03 18:23:08"}
